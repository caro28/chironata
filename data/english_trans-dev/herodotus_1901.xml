          </head>
          <p>WHOEVER wishes to become acquainted with the history <lb/>
            of the times and countries of which Herodotus wrote, <lb/>
            will read his writings either in the original, or some <lb/>
            translation which may be found to represent his mean­ <lb/>
            ing with the greatest fidelity Those how wish to ac­ <lb/>
            quire a knowledge ot the author himself, other than <lb/>
            that which they may glean from incidental remarks in <lb/>
            his history, will have recourse to some one of the authors <lb/>
            who have given an account of his life and writings. <lb/>
            These are so numerous, and so easy of access, that it <lb/>
            seems unnecessary, by adding to their number, to in­ <lb/>
            crease the bulk of the present volume.</p>
          <p>It will be sufficient to inform the student in what re­ <lb/>
            spect the present translation professes to differ from <lb/>
            those which have preceded it. Five have, at intervals, <lb/>
            made their appearance. The first was that by Beloe, <lb/>
            which, though flowing and easy in style, was rather a <lb/>
            translation from an indifferent French version than from <lb/>
            the original Greek. The second by Littlebury, was a <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            poor rendering of a bad Latin version. The third was <lb/>
            a revision of Littlebury's translation, bearing the appear C. <lb/>
            ance of having been made by one, who, though <unclear>hrq</unclear> <lb/>
            understood his author, contented himself with merel 'n <lb/>
            removing Littlebury's grosser faults, without attempting <lb/>
            to correct him uniformly and throughout. The fourth, <lb/>
            and most elegant version, was that by Mr. Isaac Taylor; <lb/>
            which, however, has met with less notice than its merit <lb/>
            deserves, probably owing to the circumstance, that <unclear>than</unclear> <lb/>
            usually received division by chapters has been departs. <lb/>
            from, whereby the facility of reference has been <unclear>muca</unclear>. <lb/>
            diminished, and also because, in too many instances, <unclear/> <lb/>
            translator has sacrificed the meaning of his author <unclear>a</unclear> <lb/>
            purity of thought or elegance of diction. The last <unclear>En</unclear>^s&gt; <lb/>
            lish version was that by Laurent, in making which the <lb/>
            translator laboured under the twofold disadvantage or <lb/>
            being an inaccurate Greek scholar, and a far worse Eng­ <lb/>
            lish one. Nor can the present translator hope to be <lb/>
            free from some defect, equal perhaps in extent to those <lb/>
            which he has pointed out in his predecessors. His <lb/>
            object, however, has been to keep as closely to the <lb/>
            sense of his author as the idioms of the two languages <lb/>
            would allow. He has adopted throughout the readings <lb/>
            of Baehr, and, except in some few instances, which <lb/>
            are pointed out in the notes, his interpretation also.</p>

            Greeks and barbarians1 deprived of renown:- <lb/>
            -and amongst the rest, for what cause they waged war upon <lb/>
            each other.</p>
          <p>1 The learned among the Persians assert that the Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicians were the original authors of the quarrel; for that <lb/>
            they having migrated from that which is called the Red Sea <lb/>
            to the Mediterranean,2 and having settled in the country <lb/>
            which they now inhabit, forthwith applied themselves to dis­ <lb/>
            tant voyages; and that having exported Egyptian and Assy­ <lb/>
            rian merchandise, they touched at other places, and also at <lb/>
            Argos. Now Argos at that period in every respect surpassed <lb/>
            all those states which are now comprehended under the gene­ <lb/>
            ral appellation of Greece.3 They say, that on their arrival <lb/>
            at Argos, the Phœnicians exposed their merchandise to sale, <lb/>
            and that on the fifth or sixth day after their arrival, and when <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 By barbarians the Greeks meant all who were not sprung from <lb/>

            they had almost disposed of their cargo, a great number <lb/>
            women came down to the sea-shore, and among them t <lb/>
            king's daughter, whose name, as the Greeks also say, was <unclear/> <lb/>
            daughter of Inachus. They add, that while these worrn <lb/>
            were standing near the stern of the vessel, and were bargai <lb/>
            in-, for such things as most pleased them, the Phœnician <lb/>
            having exhorted one another, made an attack upon then <lb/>
            and that most of the women escaped, but that Io, with son <lb/>
            others, was seized: and that they, having hurried them &lt; <lb/>
            board, set sail for Egypt. 2. Thus the Persians say that <lb/>
            went to Egypt, not agreeing herein with the Phoenicians ; a <unclear/> <lb/>
            that this was the beginning of wrongs. After this, that certi. <lb/>
            Grecians, (for they are unable to tell their name,) having tout­ <lb/>
            ed at Tyre in Phœicia, carried off the king's daughter Europ. <lb/>
            These must have been Cretans. Thus far they say that they hd <lb/>
            only retaliated ;4 but that after this the Greeks were guiltyof <lb/>
            the second provocation ; for that having sailed down in a <lb/>
            vessel of war5 to Æa, a city of Colchis on the river P<unclear/>, <lb/>
            when they had accomplished the more immediate object of <lb/>
            their expedition, they carried off the king's daughter Medea ; <lb/>
            and that the king of Colchis, having despatched a herald to <lb/>
            Greece, demanded satisfaction for the rape, and the restitution <lb/>
            of the princess ; but the Greeks replied, that as they of Asia <lb/>
            had not given any satisfaction for the rape of Io, neither <lb/>
            would they give any to them. 3. They say too, that in the <lb/>
            second generation after this, Alexander the son of Priam, <lb/>
            having heard of these events, was desirous of obtaining a <lb/>
            wife from Greece by means of violence, being fully per, <lb/>
            suaded that he should not have to give satisfaction, for that <lb/>
            the Greeks had not done so. When therefore he had carried <lb/>
            off Helen, they say, that the Greeks immediately sent mesr <lb/>
            sengers to demand her back again, and require satisfaction <lb/>
            for the rape ; but that they, when they brought forward <lb/>
            these demands, objected to them the rape of Medea; " that <lb/>
            they who had not themselves given satisfaction, nor made it <lb/>
            when demanded, now wished others to give it to themselves."</p>
          <p>4. Thus far then they say that there had only been rapes <lb/>
            from each other ; but that after this the Greeks were greatly <note type="footnote">‘ Literally, .. had only done like for like." </note><note type="footnote"> ‘ " Iu a long vessel." The long vessels were vessels of war; the round <lb/>
            vessels, merchantmen and transports. </note> <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>5</unclear>, 6.]</note> <lb/>
            o blame, for that they levied war against Asia before the <lb/>
            Asiatics did upon Europe. Now, to carry off women by vio­ <lb/>
            lence the Persians think is the act of wicked men, but to trou <lb/>
            ble oneself about avenging them when so carried off is the <lb/>
            act of foolish ones ; and to pay no regard to them when car­ <lb/>
            sied off, of wise men : for that it is clear, that if they had not <lb/>
            een willing, they could not have been carried off. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the Persians say, that they of. Asia made no account of <lb/>
            Women that were carried off; but that the Greeks for the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ake of a Lacedæmonian woman assembled a mighty, fleet, and <lb/>
            'hen having come to Asia overthrew the empire of Priam. <lb/>
            at from this event they had always considered the Greeks <lb/>
            their enemies: for the Persians claim Asia and the bar­ <lb/>
            barous nations that inhabit it, as their own, and consider <lb/>
            Europe and the people of Greece as totally distinct.</p>
          <p>5. Such is the Persian account; and to the capture on <lb/>
            Troy they ascribe the commencement of their enmity to the <lb/>
            Greeks. As relates to Io, the Phœnicians do not agree with <lb/>
            this account of the Persians : for they affirm that they did <lb/>
            not use violence to carry her into Egypt ; but that she had <lb/>
            connexion at Argos with the master of a vessel, and when she <lb/>
            found herself pregnant, she, through dread of her parents, <lb/>
            voluntarily sailed away with the Phœnicians, to avoid detec­ <lb/>
            tion. Such then are the accounts of the Persians and Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicians : I, however, am not going to inquire whether the <lb/>
            facts were so or not; but having pointed out the person whom <lb/>
            I myself know to have been the first guilty of injustice to­ <lb/>
            wards the Greeks, I will then proceed with my history, <lb/>
            touching as well on the small as the great estates of men : <lb/>
            for of those that were formerly powerful many have become <lb/>
            weak, and some that were powerful in my time were formerly <lb/>
            weak. Knowing therefore the precarious nature of human <lb/>
            prosperity, I shall commemorate both alike.</p>
          <p>6. Crœsus was a Lydian by birth, son of Alyattes, and <lb/>
            sovereign of the nations on this side the river Halys. This <lb/>
            river flowing from the south6 between the Syrians7 and <lb/>
            Paphlagonians, empties itself northwards into the Euxine <lb/>
            Sea. This Crœsus was the first of the barbarians whom we <note type="footnote">6 The Halys had two branches, one flowing from the east, the other <lb/>
            from the south: Herodotus speaks only of the southern one. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Syria was at that time the name of Cappadocia. See I. 72. </note><note type="footnote">B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            know of that subjected some of the Greeks to the paymen <lb/>
            tribute, and formed alliances with others. He subdued <lb/>
            lonians and Æolians, and the Dorians settled in Asia, and <lb/>
            formed an alliance with the Lacedæmonians ; but before <lb/>
            reign of Crœsus all the Greeks were free ; for the incunt <lb/>
            of the Cimmerians8 into Ionia, which was before the time <lb/>
            Crœsus, was not for the purpose of subjecting states, but a <lb/>
            irruption for plunder. 7. The government, which former- <lb/>
            belonged to the Heraclidæ, passed in the following manne <lb/>
            the family of Croesus, who were called Mermnadæ. Candan <lb/>
            whom the Greeks call Myrsilus, was tyrant of Sardis, and <unclear/> <lb/>
            descendant of Alcæus, son of Hercules. For Agron, son <lb/>
            Ninus, grandson of Belus, great-grandson of Alcæus, a <lb/>
            the first of the Heraclidæ who became king of Sardis ; and <lb/>
            Candaules, son of Myrsus, was the last. They who ruled <lb/>
            over this country before Agron were descendants of Lydus, <lb/>
            son of Atys, from whom this whole people, anciently called <lb/>
            Mæonians, derived the name of Lydians. The Heraclidæ, de­ <lb/>
            scended from a female slave of Jardanus and Hercules, having <lb/>
            been intrusted with the government by these princes, retained <lb/>
            the supreme power in obedience to the declaration of an <lb/>
            oracle: they reigned for twenty-two generations, a space of <lb/>
            five hundred and five years, the son succeeding to the father <lb/>
            to the time of Candaules, son of Myrsus. This Candaules <lb/>
            then was enamoured of his own wife, and being so, thought <lb/>
            that she was by far the most beautiful of all women. Now <lb/>
            being of this opinion,—Gyges, son of Dascylus, one of his <lb/>
            body-guard, happened to be his especial favourite, and to him <lb/>
            Candaules confided his most important affairs, and moreover <lb/>
            extolled the beauty of his wife in exaggerated terms. In <lb/>
            lapse of time (for Candaules was fated to be miserable) he ad­ <lb/>
            dressed Gyges as follows : " Gyges, as I think you do not be­ <lb/>
            lieve me when I speak of my wife's beauty, (for the ears of men <lb/>
            are naturally more incredulous than their eyes,) you must con. <lb/>
            trive to see her naked." But he, exclaiming loudly, answered, <lb/>
            " Sire, what a shocking proposal do you make, bidding me be­ <lb/>
            hold my queen naked! With her clothes a woman puts off <lb/>
            ther modesty. Wise maxims have been of old laid down by <lb/>
            men, from these it is our duty to learn : amongst them is the <note type="footnote"><unclear/> The incursion here spoken of occurred in the reign of the Lydian <lb/>
            Ardys. See I. 15 and IV. 12. </note> <pb n="5"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="9-11.]"/> <lb/>
            following,—‘ Let every man look to the things that concern <lb/>
            himself.' I am persuaded that she is the most beautiful of <lb/>
            her sex, but I entreat of you not to require what is wicked." <lb/>
            9. Saying thus, Gyges fought off the proposal, dreading <lb/>
            lest some harm should befal himself: but the king answered, <lb/>
            “Gyges, take courage, and be not afraid of me, as if I desired <lb/>
            to make trial of you, by speaking thus, nor of my wife, lest <lb/>
            any harm should befal you from her. For from the outset I <lb/>
            will so contrive that she shall not know she has been seen by <lb/>
            you. I will place you behind the open door of the apartment <lb/>
            in which we sleep; as soon as I enter my wife will come to <lb/>
            bed; there stands by the entrance a chair, on this she will lay <lb/>
            her garments one by one as she takes them off, and then she <lb/>
            will give you an opportunity to look at her at your leisure; <lb/>
            but when she steps from the chair to the bed, and you are at <lb/>
            her back, be careful that she does not see you as you are going <lb/>
            out by the door." 10. Gyges therefore, finding he could not <lb/>
            escape, prepared to obey. And Candaules, when it seemed to <lb/>
            be time to go to bed, led him to the chamber, and the lady <lb/>
            soon afterwards appeared, and Gyges saw her enter and lay <lb/>
            her clothes on the chair: when he was at her back, as the lady <lb/>
            was going'to the bed, he crept secretly out, but she saw him <lb/>
            as he was going away. Perceiving what her husband had <lb/>
            done, she neither cried out through modesty, nor appeared <lb/>
            to notice it, purposing to take vengeance on Candaules; <lb/>
            for among the Lydians and almost all the barbarians, it is; <lb/>
            deemed a great disgrace even for a man to be seen naked. <lb/>
            11. At the time therefore, having shown no consciousness <lb/>
            of what had occurred, she held her peace, and as soon as it <lb/>
            was day, having prepared such of tier domestics as she knew <lb/>
            were most to be trusted, she sent for Gyges. He, supposing <lb/>
            that she knew nothing of what had happened, came when he <lb/>
            was sent for, for he had been before used to attend whenever <lb/>
            the queen sent for him. When Gyges came, the lady thus <lb/>
            addressed him: " Gyges, I submit two proposals to your <lb/>
            choice, either kill Candaules and take possession of me and of <lb/>
            the Lydian kingdom, or expect immediate death, so that you <lb/>
            may not, from your obedience to Candaules in all things, <lb/>
            again see what you ought not. It is necessary however that <lb/>
            he who planned this, or that you who have seen me naked, <lb/>
            f.nd lave done what is not decorous, should die. Gyges for a <pb n="6"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[12-14."/> <lb/>
            time was amazed at what he heard; but, afterwards, he im <lb/>
            plored her not to compel him to make such a choice. He how. <lb/>
            ever could not persuade, but saw a necessity imposed on him, <lb/>
            either to kill his master Candaules or die himself by the hands <lb/>
            of others ; he chose therefore to survive, and made the follow­ <lb/>
            in- inquiry: " Since you compel me to kill my master against <lb/>
            my will, tell me how we shall lay hands on him." She an­ <lb/>
            swered, " The assault shall be made from the very spot <lb/>
            whence he showed me naked; the attack shall be made on <lb/>
            him while asleep." 12. When they had concerted their plan, <lb/>
            on the approach of night he followed the lady to the chamber: <lb/>
            then (for Gyges was not suffered to depart, nor was there any <lb/>
            possibility of escape, but either he or Candaules must needs <lb/>
            perish) she, having given him a dagger, concealed him be­ <lb/>
            hind the same door: and after this, when Candaules was <lb/>
            asleep, Gyges having crept stealthily up and slain him, pos­ <lb/>
            sessed himself both of the woman and the kingdom. Of <lb/>
            this event, also, Archilochus9 the Parian, who lived about <lb/>
            the same time, has made mention in a trimeter Iambic poem. <lb/>
            13. Thus Gyges obtained the kingdom, and was confirmed <lb/>
            in it by the oracle at Delphi. For when the Lydians re­ <lb/>
            sented the murder of Candaules, and were up in arms, the <lb/>
            partisans of Gyges and the other Lydians came to the follow­ <lb/>
            ing agreement, that if the oracle should pronounce him king <lb/>
            of the Lydians, he should reign ; if not, he should restore <lb/>
            the power to the Heraclidæ. The oracle, however, answered <lb/>
            accordingly, and so Gyges became king. But the Pythian <lb/>
            added this, “ that the Heraclidæ should be avenged on the <lb/>
            fifth descendant of Gyges.” 1 Of this prediction neither the <lb/>
            Lydians nor their kings took any notice until it was actually <lb/>
            accomplished.</p>
          <p>14. Thus the Mermnadæ, having deprived the Heraclidæ, <lb/>
            possessed themselves of the supreme power. Gyges having <lb/>
            obtained the kingdom, sent many offerings to Delphi; for <lb/>
            most of the silver offerings at Delphi are his : and besides the <lb/>
            silver, he gave a vast quantity of gold; and among the rest, <lb/>
            what is especially worthy of mention, the bowls of gold, six <lb/>
            in number, were dedicated by him: these now stand in the <note type="footnote">9 Archilochus was one of the earliest writers of Iambics. All that <lb/>

            treasury of the Corinthians, and are thirty talents in weight; <lb/>
            though, to say the truth, this treasury does not belong to the <lb/>
            people of Corinth, but to Cypselus son of Eetion. This Gyges <lb/>
            is the first of the barbarians whom we know of that dedicated <lb/>
            offerings at Delphi; except Midas, son of Gordius, king of <lb/>
            Phrygia, for Midas dedicated the royal throne, on which he <lb/>
            used to sit and administer justice, a piece of workmanship <lb/>
            deserving of admiration. This throne stands in the same <lb/>
            place as the bowls of Gyges. This gold and silver, which <lb/>
            Gyges dedicated, is by the Delphians called Gygian, from the <lb/>
            name of the donor. Now this prince, when he obtained the <lb/>
            sovereignty, led an army against Myletus and Smyrna, and <lb/>
            took the city of Colophon; but as he performed no other great <lb/>
            action during his reign of eight and thirty years, we will pass <lb/>
            him over, having made this mention of him. 15. I will pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to mention Ardys, the son and successor of Gyges. He <lb/>
            took Priene, and invaded Miletus. During the time that he <lb/>
            reigned at Sardis, the Cimmerians, being driven from their <lb/>
            seats by the Scythian nomades, passed into Asia, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessed themselves of all Sardis except the. citadel.</p>
          <p>16. When Ardys had reigned forty-nine years, his son <lb/>
            Sadyattes succeeded him, and reigned twelve years ; and <lb/>
            Alyattes succeeded Sadyattes. He made war upon Cyaxares, <lb/>
            a descendant of Deioces, and upon the Medes. He drove the <lb/>
            Cimmerians out of Asia ; took Smyrna, which was founded <lb/>
            from Colophon, and invaded Clazomenæ. From this place he <lb/>
            departed, not as he could wish, but signally defeated. He <lb/>
            also performed in the course of his reign the following actions <lb/>
            worthy of mention. 17. He continued the war which his <lb/>
            father had begun against the Milesians ;and leading his <lb/>
            army against Miletus, he invaded it in'the following manner. <lb/>
            When their fruits were ripe on the ground, he led his army <lb/>
            into their territory, attended in his march with pipes, harps, <lb/>
            and flutes, masculine and feminine. On his arrival in Mi­ <lb/>
            lesia, he neither demolished nor burnt their country houses, <lb/>
            nor forced off the doors, but let them stand as they were ; but <lb/>
            when he had destroyed their trees and the fruits on the <lb/>
            ground, he returned home ; for the Milesians were masters <lb/>
            of the sea, so that there was no use in the army's besieging <lb/>
            it. And the Lydian king would not destroy their houses, <lb/>
            for this reason, that the Milesians, having those habitations, <pb n="8"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[18—21 "/>might come out to sow and cultivate the ground, and when <lb/>
            they had cultivated it, he might have something to ravage, <lb/>
            when he should invade them with his army. 18. In this <lb/>
            manner he carried on the war eleven years, during which the <lb/>
            Milesians received two great blows, one in a battle at Li­ <lb/>
            meneion in their own territory, the other in the plain of the <lb/>
            Mæander. Six of these eleven years Sadyattes the son of <lb/>
            Ardys was still king of the Lydians, and during those he <lb/>
            made incursions into the Milesian territory (for this Sa­ <lb/>
            dyattes was the person that began the war). But during <lb/>
            the five years that succeeded the six, Alyattes the son of Sa­ <lb/>
            dyattes, who (as I have before mentioned) received it from <lb/>
            his father, earnestly applied himself to it. None of the Ionians, <lb/>
            except the Chians, assisted the Milesians in bearing the bur­ <lb/>
            den of this war : they did it in requital for succour they had <lb/>
            received ; for formerly the Milesians had assisted the Chians <lb/>
            in prosecuting the war against the Erythræans. 19. In the <lb/>
            twelfth year, when the corn had been set on fire by the <lb/>
            army, an accident of the following nature occurred. As <lb/>
            soon as the corn had caught fire, the flames, carried by <lb/>
            the wind, caught a temple of Minerva, called Assesian ;2 and <lb/>
            the temple, thus set on fire, was burnt to the ground. No <lb/>
            notice was taken of this at the time ; but afterwards, when <lb/>
            the army had returned to Sardis, Alyattes fell sick. When <lb/>
            the disease continued a considerable time, he sent messengers <lb/>
            to Delphi to consult the oracle, either from the advice of some <lb/>
            friend, or because it appeared right to himself to send and <lb/>
            make inquiries of the god concerning his disorder. The <lb/>
            Pythian, however, refused to give any answer to the mes­ <lb/>
            sengers when they arrived at Delphi, until they had rebuilt <lb/>
            the temple of Minerva which they had burnt at Assesus in <lb/>
            the territory of Milesia. 20. This relation I had from the <lb/>
            Delphians: but the Milesians add, that Periander the son <lb/>
            of Cypselus, who was a very intimate friend of Thrasybu­ <lb/>
            lus, at that time king of Miletus, having heard of the an­ <lb/>
            swer given to Alyattes, despatched a messenger to inform him <lb/>
            of it, in order that, being aware of it beforehand, he might <lb/>
            form his plans according to present circumstances. This is <lb/>
            the Milesian account. 21. Alyattes, when the above an- <note type="footnote">1 Assesus was a small town dependent on Miletus. Minerva bad a <lb/>
            temple there, and hence took the name of the Assesian Minerva. Larcher</note> <pb n="9"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="22—24 ] "/>ewer was brought to him, immediately sent a herald to Mi <lb/>
            letus, desiring to make a truce with Thrasybulus and the <lb/>
            Milesians, till such time as he should have rebuilt the temple. <lb/>
            The herald accordingly went on this mission to Miletus. <lb/>
            But Thrasybulus being accurately informed of the whole <lb/>
            matter, and knowing the design of Alyattes, had recourse to <lb/>
            the following artifice: having collected in the market-place <lb/>
            all the corn that was in the city, both his own and what be­ <lb/>
            longed to private persons, he made a proclamation, that when <lb/>
            he gave the signal, all the inhabitants should feast together. <lb/>
            22. Thrasybulus contrived and ordered this, to the end that <lb/>
            the Sardian herald, seeing so great a profusion of corn, and <lb/>
            the people enjoying themselves, might report accordingly <lb/>
            to Alyattes ; and so it came to pass. For when the herald <lb/>
            had seen these things, and delivered to Thrasybulus the mes­ <lb/>
            sage of the Lydian king, he returned to Sardis ; and. as I am <lb/>
            informed, a reconciliation was brought about for no other <lb/>
            reason. For, Alyattes expecting that there was a great scar­ <lb/>
            city of corn in Miletus, and that the people, were reduced to <lb/>
            extreme distress, deceived from the herald on his return from <lb/>
            Miletus an account quite contrary to what he expected. Soon <lb/>
            afterwards a reconciliation took place between them, on terms <lb/>
            of mutual friendship and alliance. And Alyattes built two <lb/>
            temples to Minerva at Assesus, instead of one, and himself <lb/>
            recovered from sickness. Such were the circumstances of <lb/>
            the war that Alyattes made against the Milesians and Thra­ <lb/>
            sybulus.</p>
          <p>23. Periander was the son of Cypselus,—he it was who <lb/>
            acquainted Thrasybulus with the answer of the oracle. Now, <lb/>
            Periander was king of Corinth, and the Corinthians say, <lb/>
            (and the Lesbians confirm their account,) that a wonderful <lb/>
            prodigy occurred in his life-time. They say that Arion of <lb/>
            Methymna, who was second to none of his time in accom­ <lb/>
            panying the harp, and who was the first, that we are ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with, who composed, named, and represented the <lb/>
            dithyrambus at Corinth, was carried to Tænarus on the back <lb/>
            of a dolphin. 24. They say that this Arion, having continued <lb/>
            a long time with Periander, was desirous of making a voyage to <lb/>
            Italy and Sicily; and that having acquired great wealth, he <lb/>
            determined to return to Corinth : that he set out from Taren­ <lb/>
            turn, and hired a ship of certain Corinthians, because he put <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="margin">[25. 26. </note> <lb/>
            more confidence in them than in any other nation ; but that <lb/>
            these men, when they were in the open sea, conspired to­ <lb/>
            gether to throw him overboard and seize his money, and he <lb/>
            being aware of this, offered them his money, and entreated <lb/>
            them to spare his life. However, he could not prevail on <lb/>
            them ; but the sailors ordered him either to kill himself, that <lb/>
            he might be buried ashore, or to leap immediately into the sea. <lb/>
            They add, that Anon, reduced to this strait, entreated them, <lb/>
            since such was their determination, to permit him to stand on <lb/>
            the poop in his full dress and sing, and he promised when he <lb/>
            had sung to make away with himself. The seamen, pleased <lb/>
            that they should hear the best singer in the world, retired <lb/>
            from the Stern to the middle of the vessel. They relate, that <lb/>
            Arion, having put on all his robes, and taken his harp, stood <lb/>
            on the rowing benches and went through the Orthian strain; <lb/>
            that when the strain was ended he leaped into the sea as he <lb/>
            was, in his full dress ; and the sailors continued their voyage <lb/>
            to Corinth : but they say that a dolphin received him on his <lb/>
            back, and carried him to Tænarus ; and that he, having landed, <lb/>
            proceeded to Corinth in his full dress, and upon his arrival <lb/>
            there, related all that had happened; but that Periander, giv­ <lb/>
            ing no credit to his relation, put Arion under close confine­ <lb/>
            ment, and watched anxiously for the seamen : that when they <lb/>
            appeared, he summoned them and inquired if they could give <lb/>
            any account of Arion ; but when they answered, that he was <lb/>
            safe in Italy, and that they had left him flourishing at Taren­ <lb/>
            turn, Arion in that instant appeared before them just as he <lb/>
            was when he leaped into the sea ; at which they were so <lb/>
            astonished, that being fully convicted, they could no longer <lb/>
            deny the fact. These things are reported by the Corinthians <lb/>
            and Lesbians ; and there is a small brazen statue of Arion at <lb/>
            Tænarus, representing a man sitting on a dolphin.</p>
          <p>25. Alyattes the Lydian, having waged this long war <lb/>
            against the Milesians, afterwards died, when he had reigned <lb/>
            fifty-seven years. On his recovery from sickness he was the <lb/>
            second of his family that dedicated at Delphi a large silver <lb/>
            bowl, with a saucer of iron inlaid; an object that deserves at­ <lb/>
            tention above all the offerings at Delphi. It was made by <lb/>
            Glaucus the Chian, who first invented the art of inlaying iron.</p>
          <p>26. After the death of Alyattes, his son Crœsus, who was <lb/>
            then thirty-five years of age, succeeded to the kingdom. <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="27-29"/> <lb/>
            He attacked the Ephesians before any other Grecian people. <lb/>
            The Ephesians then being besieged by him, consecrated their <lb/>
            city to Diana, by fastening a rope from the temple to the wall. <lb/>
            The distance between the old town, which was then besieged, <lb/>
            and the temple, is seven stadia. Crœsus then attacked these <lb/>
            the first, and afterwards the several cities of the Ionians and <lb/>
            Æolians one after another, alleging different pretences <lb/>
            against different states, imputing graver charges against <lb/>
            those in whom he was able to discover greater causes of <lb/>
            blame, and against some of them alleging frivolous pretences. <lb/>
            27. After he had reduced the Grecians in Asia to the pay­ <lb/>
            ment of tribute, lie formed a design to build ships and at­ <lb/>
            tack the Islanders. But when all things were ready for the <lb/>
            building of ships, Bias of Priene, (or, as others say, Pittacus <lb/>
            of Mitylene,) arriving at Sardis, put a stop to his ship-build­ <lb/>
            in,,, by making this reply, when Crœsus inquired if he had <lb/>
            any news from Greece : “0 king, the Islanders are enlisting <lb/>
            a large body of cavalry, with intention to make war upon <lb/>
            you and Sardis." Crœsus, thinking he had spoken the truth, <lb/>
            said, " May the gods put such a thought into the Islanders, as <lb/>
            to attack the sons of the Lydians with horse." The other <lb/>
            answering said, " Sire, you appear to wish above all things <lb/>
            to see the Islanders on horseback upon the continent; and <lb/>
            not without reason. But what can you imagine the Islanders <lb/>
            more earnestly desire, after having heard of your resolution to <lb/>
            build a fleet in order to attack them, than to catch the Lydians <lb/>
            at sea, that they may revenge on you the cause of those Greeks <lb/>
            who dwell on the continent, whom you hold in subjection ?” <lb/>
            It is related, that Crœsus was very much pleased with the con­ <lb/>
            elusion, and that being convinced, (for he appeared to speak <lb/>
            tQ the purpose,) he put a stop to the ship-building, and mad3 <lb/>
            an alliance with the Ionians that inhabit the islands.</p>
          <p>28. In course of time, when nearly all the nations that <lb/>
            dwell within the river Halys, except the Cilicians and Ly­ <lb/>
            cians, were subdued; for Cræsus held all the rest in subjec­ <lb/>
            tion : and they were the following, the Lydians, Phrygians, <lb/>
            Mysians, Mariandynians, Chalybians, Paphlagonians, Thra­ <lb/>
            cians, both the Thynians and Bithynians, Carians, Ionians, <lb/>
            Dorians, Æolians, and Pamphylians. 29. When these na-, <lb/>
            tions were subdued, and Croesus had added them to the Lydi <lb/>
            ans, all the other wise men of that time, as each had op- <pb n="12"/>

            port unity, came from Greece to Sardis, which had then <lb/>
            attained to the highest degree of prosperity ; and amongst <lb/>
            them Solon an Athenian, who having made laws for the <lb/>
            Athenians at their request, absented himself for ten years, <lb/>
            having sailed away under pretence of seeing the world, that <lb/>
            he might not be compelled to abrogate any of the laws he had <lb/>
            established : for the Athenians could not do it themselves, <lb/>
            since they were bound by solemn oaths to observe for ten <lb/>
            years whatever laws Solon should enact for them. 30. Solon <lb/>
            therefore having gone abroad for these reasons, and for the <lb/>
            purposes of observation, arrived in Egypt at the court of <lb/>
            Amasis, and afterwards at that of Crœsus at Sardis. On his <lb/>
            arrival he was hospitably entertained by Crœsus, and on <lb/>
            the third or fourth day, by order of the king, the attend­ <lb/>
            ants conducted him round the treasury, and showed him all <lb/>
            their grand and costly contents; and when lie had seen <lb/>
            and examined every thing sufficiently, Crœsus asked him <lb/>
            this question " My Athenian guest, your great fame has <lb/>
            reached even to us, as well of your wisdom as of your travels, <lb/>
            how that as a philosopher you have travelled through various <lb/>
            countries for the purpose of observation; I am therefore de­ <lb/>
            sirous of asking you, who is the most happy man you have <lb/>
            seen?" He asked this question, because he thought himself <lb/>
            the most happy of men. But Solon, speaking the truth freely, <lb/>
            without any flattery, answered, “ Tellus the Athenian." Crœ­ <lb/>
            sus, astonished at his answer, eagerly3 asked him, "On what <lb/>
            account do you deem Tellus the happiest?" He replied, <lb/>
            “ Tellus, in the first place, lived in a well-governed common­ <lb/>
            wealth ; had sons who were virtuous and good; and he saw <lb/>
            children born to them all, and all surviving: in the next­ <lb/>
            place, when he had lived as happily as the condition of human <lb/>
            affairs will permit, he ended his life in a most glorious man­ <lb/>
            ner. For coming to the assistance of the Athenians in a battle <lb/>
            with their neighbours of Eleusis, he put the enemy to flight, <lb/>
            and died nobly. The Athenians buried him at the public <lb/>
            charge in the place where he fell, and honoured him greatly."</p>
          <p>31. When Solon had roused the attention of Crœsus by <lb/>
            relating many and happy circumstances concerning Tellus, <lb/>
            Crœsus, expecting at least to obtain the second place, asked, <note type="footnote">3 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιστϱεφίως</foreign> Baelir translates it accurate, diligetUr </note> <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> 32.] <lb/>
            </note>whom he had seen next to him. " Cleobis," said he, " and <lb/>
            Biton, for they being natives of Argos, possessed a sufficient <lb/>
            fortune, and had withal such strength of body, that they-were <lb/>
            both alike victorious in the public games; and moreover the <lb/>
            following story is related of them: when the Argives were <lb/>
            celebrating a festival of Juno, it was necessary that their <lb/>
            mother should be drawn to the temple in a chariot; but the <lb/>
            oxen did not come from the field in time, the young men <lb/>
            therefore, being pressed for time, put themselves beneath the <lb/>
            yoke, and drew the car in which their mother sate; and having <lb/>
            conveyed it forty-five stades, they reached the temple. After <lb/>
            they had done this in sight of the assembled people, a most <lb/>
            happy termination was put to their lives; and in them the <lb/>
            Deity clearly showed, that it is better for a man to die than <lb/>
            to live. For the men of Argos, who stood round, commended <lb/>
            the strength of the youths, and the women blessed her as the <lb/>
            mother of such sons; but the mother herself, transported with <lb/>
            joy both on account of the action and its renown, stood before <lb/>
            the image and prayed, that the goddess would grant to Cleobis <lb/>
            and Biton, her own sons, who had so highly honoured her, <lb/>
            the greatest blessing man could receive. After this prayer, <lb/>
            when they had sacrificed and partaken of the feast, the youths <lb/>
            fell asleep in the temple itself, and never awoke more, but <lb/>
            met with such a termination of life. Upon this the Argives, <lb/>
            in commemoration of their piety, caused their statues to be <lb/>
            made and dedicated at Delphi." 32. Thus Solon adjudged the <lb/>
            second place of felicity to these youths. But Crœsus, being <lb/>
            enraged, said, " My Athenian friend, is my happiness then so <lb/>
            slighted by you as nothing worth, that you do not think me of <lb/>
            so much value as private men ?" He answered; " Croesus, do <lb/>
            you inquire of me concerning human affairs—of me, who know <lb/>
            that the divinity is always jealous, and delights in confusion. <lb/>
            For in lapse of time men are constrained to see many things <lb/>
            they would not willingly see, and to suffer many things they <lb/>
            would not willingly suffer. Now I put the term of man's life <lb/>
            at seventy years ; these seventy years then give twenty-five <lb/>
            thousand two hundred days, without including the intercalary <lb/>
            month; and if we add that month 4 to every other year, in <note type="footnote">4If the first number 25,200 is correct, it follows that the year was <lb/>
            360 days; if the number of intercalary days 1050 in 70 years, there will <lb/>
            be altogether 26,259, which will give 375 days to the year; so that in </note> <pb n="14"/>
             <note type="margin">[2. </note> <lb/>
            order that the seasons arriving at the proper time may agree, <lb/>
            the intercalary months will be thirty-five more in the seventy <lb/>
            years, and the days of these months will be one thousand and <lb/>
            fifty. Yet in all this number of twenty-six thousand two <lb/>
            hundred and fifty days, that compose these seventy years, one <lb/>
            day produces nothing exactly the same as another. Thus, <lb/>
            then, 0 Crœsus, man is altogether the sport of fortune. You <lb/>
            appear to me to be master of immense treasures, and king of <lb/>
            many nations ; but as relates to what you inquire of me, I <lb/>
            cannot say, till I hear you have ended your life happily. For <lb/>
            the richest of men is not more happy than he that has a suffi­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ciency for a day, unless good fortune attend him to the grave, <lb/>
            so that he ends his life in happiness. Many men, who abound <lb/>
            in wealth, are unhappy ; and many, who have only a moderate <lb/>
            competency, are fortunate. He that abounds in wealth, and <lb/>
            is yet unhappy, surpasses the other only in two things ; but <lb/>
            the other surpasses the wealthy and the miserable in many <lb/>
            things. The former indeed is better able to gratify desire, <lb/>
            and to bear the blow of adversity. But the latter surpasses <lb/>
            him in this; he is not indeed equally able to bear misfortune <lb/>
            or satisfy desire, but his good fortune wards off these things <lb/>
            from him ; and he enjoys the full use of his limbs, he is free <lb/>
            from disease and misfortune, he is blessed with good children <lb/>
            and a fine form, and if, in addition to all these things, he shall <lb/>
            end his life well, he is the man you seek, and may justly be <lb/>
            called happy; but before he die we ought to suspend our <lb/>
            judgment, and not pronounce him happy, but fortunate. Now <lb/>
            it is impossible for any one man to comprehend all these ad­ <lb/>
            vantages : as no one country suffices to produce every thing <lb/>
            for itself, but affords some and wants others, and that which <lb/>
            affords the most is the best; so no huma being is in re­ <lb/>
            spects self-sufficient. but possesses one advantage, is in <lb/>
            need of another ; he therefore who has constantly enjoyed the <lb/>
            most or these, and then ends his life tranquilly, this man, in my <lb/>
            judgment, 0 king, deserves the name of happy. We ought <lb/>
            therefore to consider the end of every thing, in what way it <lb/>
            will terminate ; for the Deity having shown a glimpse of <lb/>
            happiness to many, has afterwards utterly overthrown them." <note type="footnote">spite of the precaution the seasons will be confused—Wyttenbach alters. <lb/>

            33. When he spoke thus to Crœsus, Crœsus did not con­ <lb/>
            fer any favour on him, and holding him in no account, dis­ <lb/>
            missed him; since he considered him a very ignorant man, <lb/>
            because he overlooked present prosperity, and bade men look <lb/>
            to the end of every thing.</p>
          <p>34. After the departure of Solon, the indignation of the <lb/>
            gods fell heavy upon Croesus, probably because he thought <lb/>
            himself the most happy of all men. A dream soon after visited <lb/>
            him while sleeping, which pointed out to him the truth of the <lb/>
            misfortunes that were about to befal him in the person of one <lb/>
            of his sons. For Crœsus had two sons, of whom one was <lb/>
            grievously afflicted, for he was dumb ; but the other, whose <lb/>
            name was Atys, far surpassed all the young men of his age. <lb/>
            Now the dream intimated to Croesus that he would lose this <lb/>
            Atys by a wound inflicted by the point of an iron weapon ; <lb/>
            he, when he awoke, and had considered the matter with him­ <lb/>
            self, dreading the dream, provided a wife for his son ; and <lb/>
            though he was accustomed to command the Lydian troops, he <lb/>
            did not ever after send him out on that business; and causing <lb/>
            all spears, lances, "and such other weapons as men use in war, <lb/>
            to be removed from the men's apartments, he had them laid <lb/>
            up in private chambers, that none of them being suspended <lb/>
            might fall upon his son. 35. While Crœsus was engaged with <lb/>
            the nuptials of his son, a man oppressed by misfortune, and <lb/>
            whose hands were polluted, a Phrygian by birth, and of royal <lb/>
            family, arrived at Sardis. This man, having come to the palace <lb/>
            of Crœsus, sought permission to obtain purification according <lb/>
            to the custom of the country. Crœsus purified him:—(now the <lb/>
            manner of expiation is nearly the same among the Lydians <lb/>
            and the Greeks :) and when he had performed the usual cere­ <lb/>
            monies, Crœsus inquired whence he came, and who he was ; <lb/>
            speaking to him as follows : " Stranger, who art thou, and <lb/>
            from what part of Phrygia hast thou come as a suppliant to <lb/>
            my hearth ? and what man or woman hast thou slain ?" The <lb/>
            stranger answered, " Sire, I am the son of Gordius, son of <lb/>
            Midas, and am called Adrastus : having unwittingly slain my <lb/>
            own brother, and being banished by my father and deprived of <lb/>
            every thing, I am come hither." Crœsus answered as follows: <lb/>
            " You are born of parents who are our friends, and you are <lb/>
            come to friends, among whom, if you will stay, you shall want <lb/>
            nothing ; and by bearing your misfortune as lightly as pos- <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[36-39."/> <lb/>
            sible you will be the greatest gainer." So Adi astus took up <lb/>
            his abode in the palace of Crœsus.</p>
          <p>36. At this same time a boar of enormous size appeared in <lb/>
            Mysian Olympus, and rushing down from that mountain, ra­ <lb/>
            vaged the fieldsof the Mysians. The Mysians, though they <lb/>
            often went out against him, could not hurt him, but suffered <lb/>
            much from him. At last deputies from the Mysians having come <lb/>
            to Crœsus, spoke as follows: " 0 king, a boar of enormous size <lb/>
            has appeared in our country, and ravages our fields: though we <lb/>
            have often endeavoured to take him, we cannot. We therefore <lb/>
            earnestly beg, that you would send with us your son and some <lb/>
            chosen youths with dogs, that we may drive him from the coun­ <lb/>
            try." Such was their entreaty, but Crœsus, remembering the <lb/>
            warning of his dream, answered, " Make no further mention of <lb/>
            my son ; for I shall not send him with you, because lie is lately <lb/>
            married, and that now occupies his attention : but I will send <lb/>
            with you chosen Lydians, and the whole hunting train, and <lb/>
            will order them to assist you with their best endeavours in <lb/>
            driving the monster from your country." 37. Such was his <lb/>
            answer ; and when the Mysians were content with this, the <lb/>
            son of Crœsus, who had heard of their request, came in ; and <lb/>
            when Croesus refused to send him with them, the youth thus <lb/>
            addressed him: " Father, in time past I was permitted to <lb/>
            signalize myself in the two most noble and becoming exercises <lb/>
            of war and hunting ; but now you keep me excluded from both, <lb/>
            without having observed in me either cowardice or want of <lb/>
            spirit. How will men look on me when I go or return from <lb/>
            the forum ? What kind of man shall I appear to my fellow <lb/>
            citizens ? What to my newly married wife ? What kind of <lb/>
            man will she think she has for a partner ? Either suffer me <lb/>
            then to go to this hunt, or convince me that it is better for <lb/>
            me to do as you would have me." 38. " My son," answered <lb/>
            Crœsus, " I act thus, not because I have seen any cowardice, <lb/>
            or any thing else unbecoming in you; but a vision in a dream <lb/>
            appearing to me in my sleep warned me that you would be <lb/>
            short-lived, and would die by the point of an iron weapon. <lb/>
            On account of this vision therefore I hastened your marriage, <lb/>
            and now refuse to send you on this expedition ; taking care <lb/>
            to preserve you, if by any means I can, as long as I live ; <lb/>
            for you are my only son ; the other, who is deprived of his <lb/>
            hearing; I consider as lost." 39. The youth answered, " You <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="40-43.]"/> <lb/>
            are not to blame, my father, if after such a dream you take <lb/>
            so much care of me; but it is right for me to explain that <lb/>
            which you do not comprehend, and which has escaped your <lb/>
            notice in the dream. You say the dream signified that I <lb/>
            should die by the point of an iron weapon. But what hand, <lb/>
            or what pointed iron weapon has a boar, to occasion such <lb/>
            fears in you ? Had it said I should lose my life by a tusk, or <lb/>
            something of like nature, you ought then to have done as you <lb/>
            now do ; whereas it said by the point of a weapon ; since then <lb/>
            we have not to contend against men, let me go." 40. " You <lb/>
            have surpassed me," replied Crœsus, " in explaining the im­ <lb/>
            port of the dream ; therefore, being overcome by you, I <lb/>
            change my resolution, and permit you to go to the chase."</p>
          <p>41. Crœsus, having thus spoken, sent for the Phrygian <lb/>
            . Adrastus, and, when he came, addressed him as follows: <lb/>
            " Adrastus, I purified you when smitten by a grievous mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, which I do not upbraid you with, and have received <lb/>
            you into my house, and supplied you with every thing neces­ <lb/>
            sary. Now therefore, (for it is your duty to requite me with <lb/>
            kindness, since I have first conferred a kindness on you,) I <lb/>
            beg you would be my son's guardian; when he goes to the <lb/>
            chase, and take care that no skulking villains show themselves <lb/>
            in the way to do him harm. Besides, you ought to go for your <lb/>
            own sake, where you may signalize yourself by your exploits ; <lb/>
            for this was the glory of your ancestors, and you are besides <lb/>
            in full vigour." 42. Adrastus answered, " On no other account, <lb/>
            sire, would I have taken part in this enterprise; for it is not <lb/>
            fitting that one in my unfortunate circumstances should join <lb/>
            with his prosperous compeers, por do I desire to do so; and, <lb/>
            indeed, I have often restrained myself. Now, however, since <lb/>
            you urge me, and I ought to oblige you, for I am bound to <lb/>
            requite the benefits you have conferred on me, I am ready to <lb/>
            do as you desire ; and rest assured, that your son, whom you <lb/>
            bid me take care of, shall, as far as his guardian is concerned, <lb/>
            return to you uninjured."</p>
          <p>43. When Adrastus had made this answer to Crœsus, <lb/>
            they went away, well provided with chosen youths and dogs : <lb/>
            and, having arrived at Mount Olympus, they sought the wild <lb/>
            beast, and having found him and encircled him around, they <lb/>
            hurled their javelins at him. Among the rest, the stranger, <lb/>
            the same that had been purified of murder, named Adrastus, <note type="footnote">a </note> <pb n="18"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[44—46."/> <lb/>
            throwing his javelin at the boar, missed him, and struck the <lb/>
            son of Croesus : thus he being wounded by the point of the <lb/>
            lance, fulfilled the warning of the dream. Upon this, some <lb/>
            one ran off to tell Crœsus what had happened, and having <lb/>
            arrived at Sardis, gave him an account of the action, and of <lb/>
            his son's fate. 44. Crœsus, exceedingly distressed by the death <lb/>
            of his son, lamented it the more bitterly, because he fell by the <lb/>
            hand of one, whom he himself had purified from blood ; and <lb/>
            vehemently deploring his misfortune, he invoked Jove the <lb/>
            Expiator, attesting what he had suffered by this stranger. <lb/>
            He invoked also the same deity, by the name of the god of <lb/>
            hospitality and private friendship : as the god of hospitality, <lb/>
            because by receiving a stranger into his house, he had una­ <lb/>
            wares fostered the murderer of his son ; as the god of private <lb/>
            friendship, because, having sent him as a guardian, he found <lb/>
            him his greatest enemy. 45. After this, the Lydians approach­ <lb/>
            ed, bearing the corpse, and behind it followed the murderer. <lb/>
            He, having advanced in front of the corpse, delivered himself <lb/>
            up to Crœsus, stretching forth his hands and begging of him to <lb/>
            kill him upon it; then relating his former misfortune, and how <lb/>
            in addition to that he had destroyed his purifier, and that he <lb/>
            ought to live no longer. When Crœsus heard this, though <lb/>
            his own affliction was so great, he pitied Adrastus, and said <lb/>
            to him, " You have made me full satisfaction by condemning <lb/>
            yourself to die. But you are not the author of this misfor­ <lb/>
            tune, except as far as you were the involuntary agent ; but <lb/>
            that god, whoever he was, that long since foreshowed what <lb/>
            was about to happen." Crœsus therefore buried his son as <lb/>
            the dignity of his birth required; but Adrastus, son of Gor­ <lb/>
            dius, son of Midas, who had been the murderer of his own <lb/>
            brother, and the murderer of his purifier, when all was silent <lb/>
            round the tomb, judging himself the most heavily afflicted of <lb/>
            all men, killed himself on the tomb. But Crœsus, bereaved <lb/>
            of his son, continued disconsolate for two years.</p>
          <p>46. Some time after, the overthrow of the kingdom of <lb/>
            Astyages, son of Cyaxares, by Cyrus, son of Cambyses, and <lb/>
            the growing power of the Persians, put an end to the grief <lb/>
            of Croesus ; and it entered into his thoughts whether he could <lb/>
            by any means check the growing power of the Persians be­ <lb/>
            fore they became formidable. After he had formed this pur­ <lb/>
            pose, he determined to make trial as well of the oracles in <pb n="19"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="17—49.]"/> <lb/>
            Greece as of that in Libya ; aud sent different persons to <lb/>
            different places, some to Delphi, some to Abæ of Phocis, and <lb/>
            some to Dodona; others were sent to Amphiaraus and Tro­ <lb/>
            phonius, and others to Branchidæ of Milesia : these were the <lb/>
            Grecian oracles to which Croesus sent to consult. He sent <lb/>
            others also to consult that of Ammon in Libya. And he sent <lb/>
            them different ways, designing to make trial of what the ora­ <lb/>
            cles knew ; in order that if they should be found to know the <lb/>
            truth, he might send a second time to inquire whether he <lb/>
            should venture to make war on the Persians. 47. He des­ <lb/>
            patched them to make trial of the oracles with the follow­ <lb/>
            ing orders; that computing the days from the time of their <lb/>
            departure from Sardis, they should consult the oracles on <lb/>
            the hundredth day, by asking, what Crœsus, son of Alyattes <lb/>
            and king of the Lydians, was then doing; and that they <lb/>
            should bring him the answer of each oracle in writing. <lb/>
            Now what were the answers given by the other oracles, is <lb/>
            mentioned by none ; but no sooner had the Lydians entered <lb/>
            the temple of Delphi to consult the god, and asked the ques­ <lb/>
            tion enjoined them, than the Pythian thus spoke in hexame­ <lb/>
            ter verse: " I know the number of the sands, and the measure <lb/>
            of the sea ; I understand the dumb, and hear him that does <lb/>
            not speak; the savour of the hard-shelled tortoise boiled in <lb/>
            brass with the flesh of lamb strikes on my senses ; brass is <lb/>
            laid beneath it, and brass is put over it." 48. The Lydians <lb/>
            having written down this answer of the Pythian, returned to <lb/>
            Sardis. And when the rest, who had been sent to other places, <lb/>
            arrived bringing the answers, Crœsus having opened each of <lb/>
            them examined their contents ; but none of them pleased him. <lb/>
            When, however, he heard that from Delphi, he immediately <lb/>
            adored it, and approved of it, being convinced that the oracle <lb/>
            at Delphi alone was a real oracle, because it had discovered <lb/>
            what he had done. For when he had sent persons to consult <lb/>
            the different oracles, watching the appointed day, he had re­ <lb/>
            course to the following contrivance; having thought of what <lb/>
            it was impossible to discover or guess at, he cut up a tortoise <lb/>
            and a lamb, and boiled them himself together in a brazen <lb/>
            caldron, and put on it a cover of brass. 49. Such then was <lb/>
            the answer given to Crœsus from Delphi: as regards the <lb/>
            answer of the cracle of Amphiaraus, I cannot say what <lb/>
            answer it gave to the Lydians. who performed the accus­ <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="margin"> [50, 51. </note> <lb/>
            tomed rites at the temple; for nothing else is related than <lb/>
            that he considered this also to be a true oracle.</p>
          <p>50. After this he endeavoured to propitiate the god at <lb/>
            Delphi by magnificent sacrifices; for he offered three thou­ <lb/>
            sand head of cattle of every kind fit for sacrifice, and having <lb/>
            heaped up a great pile, he burnt on it beds of gold and silver, <lb/>
            vials of gold, and robes of purple and garments; hoping by <lb/>
            that means more completely to conciliate the god: he also <lb/>
            ordered all the Lydians to offer to the god whatever he was <lb/>
            able. When the sacrifice was ended, having melted down a vast <lb/>
            quantity of gold, he cast half-bricks from it; of which the <lb/>
            longest were six palms in length, the shortest three, and in <lb/>
            thickness one palm: their number was one hundred and seven­ <lb/>
            teen : four of these, of pure gold, weighed each two talents <lb/>
            and a half; the other half-bricks of pale gold, weighed two <lb/>
            talents each. He made also the figure of a lion of fine gold, <lb/>
            weighing ten talents. This lion, when the temple of Delphi <lb/>
            was burnt down, fell from the half-bricks, for it had been <lb/>
            placed on them ; and it now lies in the treasury of the Co­ <lb/>
            rinthians, weighing six talents and a half; for three talents <lb/>
            and a half were melted from it. 51. Crœsus, having finished <lb/>
            these things, sent them to Delphi, and with them these <lb/>
            following; two large bowls, one of gold, the other of silver: <lb/>
            that of gold was placed on the right hand as one enters the <lb/>
            temple, and that of silver on the left; but these also were <lb/>
            removed when the temple was burnt down; and the golden <lb/>
            one, weighing eight talents and a half and twelve mince, is <lb/>
            placed in the treasury of Clazomenæ; the silver one, contain­ <lb/>
            ing six hundred amphoræ, lies in a corner of the vestibule, <lb/>
            and is used by the Delphians for mixing the wine on the <lb/>
            Theophanian festival. The Delphians say it was the work­ <lb/>
            manship of Theodorus the Samian; and I think so too, for <lb/>
            it appears to be no common work. He also sent four casks <lb/>
            of silver, which stand in the treasury of the Corinthians; <lb/>
            and he dedicated two lustral vases, one of gold, the other of <lb/>
            silver: on the golden one is an inscription, OF THE LACE­ <lb/>
            DÆMONIANS, who say that it was their offering, but <lb/>
            wrongfully, for this also was given by Croesus: a certain <lb/>
            Delphian made the inscription, in order to please the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians ; I know his name, but forbear to mention it. <lb/>
            The boy indeed, through whose hand the water flows, is their <pb n="21"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="52—55.]"/> <lb/>
            gift; but neither of the lustral vases. At the same time <lb/>
            Crœsus sent many )ther offerings without an inscription: <lb/>
            amongst them some round silver covers ; and moreover a <lb/>
            statue of a woman in gold three cubits high, which the <lb/>
            Delphians say is the image of Croesus's baking woman ; and <lb/>
            to all these things he added the necklaces and girdles of his <lb/>
            wife.</p>
          <p>52. These were the offerings he sent to Delphi; and to <lb/>
            Amphiaraus, having ascertained his virtue and sufferings, he <lb/>
            dedicated a shield all of gold, and a lance of solid gold, the <lb/>
            shaft as well as the points being of gold; and these are at <lb/>
            Thebes in the temple of Ismenian Apollo.</p>
          <p>53. To the Lydians appointed to convey these presents <lb/>
            to the temples, Croesus gave it in charge to inquire of the <lb/>
            oracles, whether he should make war on the Persians, and if <lb/>
            he should unite any other nation as an ally. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when the Lydians arrived at the places to which they were <lb/>
            sent, and had dedicated the offerings, they consulted the <lb/>
            oracles, saying, " Croesus, king of the Lydians and of other <lb/>
            nations, esteeming these to be the only oracles among men, <lb/>
            sends these presents in acknowledgment of your discoveries ; <lb/>
            and now asks, whether he should lead an army against the <lb/>
            Persians, and whether he should join any auxiliary forces <lb/>
            with his own?" Such were their questions; and the opinions <lb/>
            of both oracles concurred, foretelling, " That if Crœsus should <lb/>
            make war on the Persians, he would destroy a mighty em­ <lb/>
            pire;" and they advised him to engage the most powerful of <lb/>
            the Grecians in his alliance. 54. When Crœsus heard the <lb/>
            answers that were brought back, he was beyond measure de­ <lb/>
            lighted with the oracles; and fully expecting that he should <lb/>
            destroy the kingdom of Cyrus, he again sent to Delphi, and <lb/>
            having ascertained the number of the inhabitants, presented <lb/>
            each of them with two staters of gold. In return for this, the <lb/>
            Delphians gave Croesus and the Lydians the right to consult the <lb/>
            oracle before any others, and exemption from tribute, and the <lb/>
            first seats in the temple, and the privilege of being made citizens <lb/>
            of Delphi, to as many as should desire it in all future time. <lb/>
            55. Crœsus having made these presents to the Delphians, sent <lb/>
            a third time to consult the oracle. For after he had ascer­ <lb/>
            tained the veracity of the oracle,he had frequent recourse to it. <lb/>
            His demand now was whether he should long enjoy the king- <pb n="22"/>
             <note type="margin">[56, 57. </note> <lb/>
            dom ? to which the Pythian gave this answer: " When a mule <lb/>
            shall become king of the Medes, then, tender-footed Lydian, <lb/>
            flee over pebbly Hermus, nor tarry, nor blush to be a coward." <lb/>
            56. With this answer, when reported to him, Crœsus was <lb/>
            more than ever delighted, thinking that a mule should never <lb/>
            be king of the <unclear>Meinstead</unclear> of a man, and consequently that <lb/>
            neither he nor his posterity should ever be deprived of the <lb/>
            kingdom. In the next place he began to inquire carefully <lb/>
            who were the'most powerful of the Greeks whom lie might <lb/>
            gain over as allies ; and on inquiry found that the Lacede­ <lb/>
            monians and Athenians excelled the rest, the former being of <lb/>
            Dorian, the latter of Ionic descent: for these were in ancient <lb/>
            time the most distinguished, the latter being a Pelasgian, the <lb/>
            other an Hellenic nation ; the latter had never emigrated, but <lb/>
            the former had very often changed their seat; for under the <lb/>
            reign of Deucalion they inhabited the country of Phthiotis ; <lb/>
            and in the time of Dorus, the son of Hellen, the country at <lb/>
            the foot of Ossa and Olympus, called Histiæotis : when they <lb/>
            were driven out of Histiæotis by the Cadmæans, they settled <lb/>
            on Mount Pidnus, at a place called Macednum ; thence they <lb/>
            again removed to Dryopis; and at length coming into Pe­ <lb/>
            loponnesus, were called Dorians.</p>
          <p>57. What language the Pelasgians used I cannot with <lb/>
            certainty affirm ; but if I may form a conjecture from those <lb/>
            Pelasgians who now exist, and who now inhabit the town of <lb/>
            Crestona above the Tyrrhenians, and who were formerly <lb/>
            neighbours to those now called Dorians, and at that time oc­ <lb/>
            cupied the country at present called Thessaliotis; and if 1 <lb/>
            may conjecture from those Pelasgians settled at Placia and Scy­ <lb/>
            lace on the Hellespont, and who once dwelt with the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans,5 and whatever other cities, which, though really Pelas­ <lb/>
            gian, have changed their name ; if, I say, I may be permitted <lb/>
            to conjecture from these, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarous <lb/>
            language And if the whole Pelasgian body did so, the Attic <lb/>
            race, being Pelasgic, must at the time they changed into <lb/>
            Hellenes have altered their language. For neither do the <lb/>
            Crestonians use the same language with any of their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, nor do the people of Placia, but both use the same <lb/>
            language ; by which it appears they have taken care to pre <note type="footnote">5 For the reason cf their separation, see VI. 137. </note> <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="margin"> 58, 59.] </note> <lb/>
            serve the character of the language they brought with them <lb/>
            into those places. 58. The Hellenic race, however, as appears <lb/>
            to me, from the time they became a people have used the same <lb/>
            language: though, when separated from the Pelasgians, they <lb/>
            were at first insignificant, yet from a small beginning they <lb/>
            have increased to a multitude of nations, chiefly by a union <lb/>
            with many other barbarous nations. Wherefore it appears to <lb/>
            me, that the Pelasgic race, being barbarous, never increased <lb/>
            to any great extent.</p>
          <p>59. Of these nations then Crœsus learnt that the Attic was <lb/>
            oppressed and distracted by Pisistratus son of Hippocrates, then <lb/>
            reigning in Athens : to this Hippocrates, who was at the time a <lb/>
            private person, and a spectator at the Olympian games, a great <lb/>
            prodigy occurred. For having killed a victim, the caldrons, <lb/>
            which were full of flesh and water, bubbled up without any fire <lb/>
            and boiled over. Chilon the Lacedæmonian, who was accident­ <lb/>
            ally there, and saw the prodigy, advised Hippocrates, first of all, <lb/>
            not to marry any woman by whom he might have children ; or, <lb/>
            if he was already married, then to put away his wife ; and if he <lb/>
            happened to have a son, to disown turn. However, Hippo­ <lb/>
            crates, when Chilon gave this advice, would not be persuaded; <lb/>
            and had afterwards this same Pisistratus ; who, when a quar­ <lb/>
            rel happened between those who dwelt on the sea-coast and <lb/>
            the Athenians, the former headed by Megacles son of Alc­ <lb/>
            mason, the latter by Lycurgus son of Aristolaides. aiming at <lb/>
            the sovereign power, formed a third party; and having as­ <lb/>
            sembled his partisans under colour of protecting those of the <lb/>
            mountains, he contrived this stratagem. Having wounded <lb/>
            himself and his mules, he drove his chariot into the public <lb/>
            square, as if he had escaped from enemies that designed to <lb/>
            murder him in his way to the country ; and besought the <lb/>
            people to grant him a guard, having before acquired renown <lb/>
            in the expedition against Megara, by taking Nisæa,6 and dis­ <lb/>
            playing other illustrious deeds. The people of Athens, being - <lb/>
            deceived by this, gave him such of the citizens as he selected, <lb/>
            who were not to be his javelin men, but club-bearers, for they <lb/>
            attended him with clubs of wood. These men, therefore, <lb/>
            joining in revolt with Pisistratus, seized the Acropolis, and <lb/>
            thereupon Pisistratus assumed the government of the Atheni­ <note type="footnote"><unclear>7</unclear> Nisæa was the port of the Megarians, about two miles from the city.</note> <pb n="24"/>
            <note type="margin"> [60, 61 </note> <lb/>
            ans, neither disturbing the existing magistracies, nor alter­ <lb/>
            ing the laws ; but he administered the government according <lb/>
            to the established institutions, ordering it liberally and well <lb/>
            60. Not long after, the partisans of Megacles and Lycur­ <lb/>
            gus, being reconciled, drove him out. In this manner Pisis­ <lb/>
            tratus first made himself master of Athens, and, his power not <lb/>
            being very firmly rooted, lost it. But those who expelled <lb/>
            Pisistratus quarrelled anew with one another ; and Megacles, <lb/>
            harassed by the sedition, sent a herald to Pisistratus to ask if <lb/>
            he was willing to marry his daughter, on condition of having <lb/>
            the sovereignty. Pisistratus having accepted the proposal <lb/>
            and agreed to his terms, in order to his restitution, they con­ <lb/>
            trive the most ridiculous project that, I think, was ever <lb/>
            imagined; especially if we consider, that the Greeks have <lb/>
            from old been distinguished from the barbarians as being <lb/>
            more acute and free from all foolish simplicity, and more par­ <lb/>
            ticularly as they played this trick upon the Athenians, who <lb/>
            are esteemed among the wisest of the Grecians. In the Pæ­ <lb/>
            anean tribe was a woman named Phya, four cubits high, want­ <lb/>
            in- three fingers, and in other respects handsome ; having <lb/>
            dressed this woman in a complete suit of armour, and placed <lb/>
            her on a chariot, and having shown her beforehand how to <lb/>
            assume the most becoming demeanour, they drove her to the <lb/>
            city, having sent heralds before, who, on their arrival in <lb/>
            the city, proclaimed what was ordered in these terms: " 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, receive with kind wishes Pisistratus, whom Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva herself, honouring above all men, now conducts back to <lb/>
            her own citadel." They then went about proclaiming this; <lb/>
            and a report was presently spread among the people that Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva was bringing back Pisistratus ; and the people in the <lb/>
            city believing this woman to be the goddess, both adored a <lb/>
            human being, and received Pisistratus.</p>
          <p>61. Pisistratus having recovered the sovereignty in the <lb/>
            manner above described, married the daughter of Megacles in <lb/>
            accordance with his agreement. But as he already had grown­ <lb/>
            up sons, and as the Alcmæonidæ were said to be under a curse,7 <lb/>
            he, wishing not to have any children by his newly-married <lb/>
            wife, had intercourse with her unnaturally. The woman at <lb/>
            first kept the thing a secret, but afterwards, whether ques­ <note type="footnote"><unclear>1</unclear> See the cause of this. B. V. 71 </note> <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="margin"> 62.] </note> <lb/>
            tioned by her mother or not, she discovered It to her, and she <lb/>
            to her husband. He felt highly indignant at being dis­ <lb/>
            honoured by Pisistratus, and in his rage instantly reconciled <lb/>
            himself to those of the opposite faction;8 but Pisistratus <lb/>
            hearing of the designs thai were being formed against him, <lb/>
            withdrew entirely out of the country, and arriving in Ere­ <lb/>
            tria,9 consulted with his sons. The opinion of Hippias pre­ <lb/>
            vailing, to recover the kingdom, they immediately began to <lb/>
            collect contributions from those cities which felt any gratitude <lb/>
            to them for benefits received; and though many gave large <lb/>
            sums, the Thebans surpassed the rest in liberality. At length <lb/>
            (not to give a detailed account) time passed, and every thing <lb/>
            was ready for their return, for Argive mercenaries arrived <lb/>
            from Peloponnesus; and a man of Naxos, named Lygdamis, <lb/>
            who had come as a volunteer, and brought both men and <lb/>
            money, showed great zeal in the cause. 62. Having set out <lb/>
            from Eretria, they came back in the eleventh year of their <lb/>
            exile, and first of all possessed themselves of Marathon. <lb/>
            While they lay encamped in this place, both their partisans <lb/>
            from the city joined them, and others from the various dis­ <lb/>
            tricts, to whom a tyranny was more welcome than liberty, <lb/>
            crowded to them ; thus they were collected together. The <lb/>
            Athenians of the city, on the other hand, had shown'very <lb/>
            little concern all the time Pisistratus was collecting money, or <lb/>
            even when he took possession of Marathon. But when they <lb/>
            heard that he was marching from Marathon against the <lb/>
            city, they at length went out to resist him ; so they marched <lb/>
            with their whole force against the invaders. In the mean <lb/>
            time Pisistratus's party, having set out from Marathon, ad­ <lb/>
            vanced towards the city, and arrived in a body at the temple <lb/>
            of the Pallenian1 Minerva, and there took up their position. <lb/>
            Here Amphilytus, a prophet of Acarnania, moved by divine <lb/>
            impulse, approached Pisistratus, and pronounced this oracle <lb/>
            in hexameter verse: " The cast is thrown, and the net <lb/>
            is spread ; by the moonlight the tunnies will rush in." <note type="footnote">8 Schweighæuser translates it " to his former partisans." See Cary's <lb/>

            63. He, inspired by the god, uttered this prophecy ; and Pi­ <lb/>
            sistratus, comprehending the oracle, and saying he accepted <lb/>
            the omen, led on his army. The Athenians of the city were <lb/>
            then engaged at their breakfast, and some of them after <lb/>
            breakfast had betaken themselves to dice, others to sleep ; so <lb/>
            that the army of Pisistratus, falling upon them by surprise, <lb/>
            soon put them to flight; and as they were flying, Pisistratus <lb/>
            contrived a clever stratagem to prevent their rallying again, <lb/>
            and that they might be thoroughly dispersed. He mounted <lb/>
            his sons on horseback and sent them forward ; and they, <lb/>
            having overtaken the fugitives, spoke as they were ordered <lb/>
            by Pisistratus, bidding them be of good cheer, and to depart <lb/>
            every man to his own home. 64. The Athenians yielded a <lb/>
            ready obedience, and thus Pisistratus, having a third time <lb/>
            possessed himself of Athens, secured his power more firmly <lb/>
            both by the aid of auxiliary forces, and by revenues partly <lb/>
            collected at home and partly drawn from the river Stry­ <lb/>
            mon.2 He also seized as hostages the sons of the Athenians <lb/>
            who had held out against him, and had not immediately fled, <lb/>
            and settled them at Naxos ; which island Pisistratus had <lb/>
            formerly subdued, and given in charge to Lygdamis : he, <lb/>
            moreover, purified the island of Delos, in obedience to an <lb/>
            oracle. And he purified it in the following manner : having <lb/>
            dug up the dead bodies, as far as the prospect from the <lb/>
            temple reached, he removed them to another part of Delos. <lb/>
            Thus Pisistratus ruled despotically over the Athenians ; but <lb/>
            of them, some had fallen in the battle, and others fled from <lb/>
            their homes with the son of Alcmæon.3</p>
          <p>65. Crœsus, therefore, was Informed that such was, at <lb/>
            that time, the condition of the Athenians ; and that the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians, having extricated themselves out of great diffi­ <lb/>
            culties, had first gained the mastery over the Tegeans in war. <lb/>
            For during the reign of Leo and Hegesicles, kings of Sparta, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians were successful in all other wars, and <lb/>
            were worsted by the Tegeans only. And long before their <lb/>
            reign they had been governed by the worst laws of almost <lb/>
            any people in Greece, both as regarded their dealings with <lb/>
            one another, and in holding no intercourse with strangers. <note type="footnote"> a The country between the Strymon and the Nessus was celebrated <lb/>

            But they changed to a good government in the following <lb/>
            manner: Lycurgus, a man much esteemed by the Spartans, <lb/>
            having arrived at Delphi to consult the oracle, no sooner <lb/>
            entered the temple, than the Pythian spoke as follows : " Thou <lb/>
            art come, Lycurgus, to my wealthy temple, beloved by Jove <lb/>
            and all that inhabit Olympian mansions: I doubt whether I <lb/>
            shall pronounce thee god or man ; but rather god, I think, <lb/>
            Lycurgus." Some men say that, besides this, the Pythian <lb/>
            also communicated to him that form of government now <lb/>
            established among the Spartans. But, as the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            themselves affirm, Lycurgus, being appointed guardian to his <lb/>
            nephew Leobotas,4 king of Sparta, brought those institutions <lb/>
            from Crete. For as soon as he had taken the guardianship, <lb/>
            he altered all their customs, and took care that no one should <lb/>
            transgress them. Afterwards he established military regula­ <lb/>
            tions, the enomotiæ, the triecades, and the syssitia,5 and <lb/>
            besides these he instituted the ephori and senators. 66. <lb/>
            Thus, having changed their laws, they established good <lb/>
            institutions in their stead: and having erected a temple <lb/>
            to Lycurgus after his death, they held him in the highest <lb/>
            reverence. As they had a good soil and abundant popula­ <lb/>
            tion, they quickly sprang up and flourished. And now they <lb/>
            were no longer content to live in peace; but proudly con­ <lb/>
            sidering themselves superior to the Arcadians, they sent to <lb/>
            consult the oracle at Delphi, touching the conquest of the <lb/>
            whole country of the Arcadians ; and the Pythian gave them <lb/>
            this answer : " Dost thou ask of me Arcadia ? thou askest a <lb/>
            great deal ; I cannot grant it thee. There are many acorn­ <lb/>
            eating men in Arcadia, who will hinder thee. But I do not <lb/>
            grudge thee all; I will give thee Tegea to dance on with <lb/>
            beating of the feet, and a fair plain to measure out by the <lb/>
            rod." When the Lacedæmonians heard this answer reported, <lb/>
            they laid aside their design against all Arcadia ; and relying <lb/>
            on an equivocal oracle, led an army against Tegea only, carry­ <lb/>
            ing fetters with them, as if they would surely reduce the <lb/>
            Tegeans to slavery. But being defeated in an engagement, <lb/>
            as many of them as were taken alive, were compelled to work, <note type="footnote"> 4 It is generally agreed that the name of Lycurgus's nephew was not <lb/>
            Leobotas, but Charilaus. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 For an account of these several <unclear>instituticus</unclear> see Smith's Dictionary <lb/>

            wearing the fetters they had brought, and measuring the lands <lb/>
            of the Tegeans with a rod. Those fetters in which they <lb/>
            were bound, were, even in my time, preserved in Tegea, sus­ <lb/>
            pended around the temple of Alean Minerva.</p>
          <p>67. In the first war, therefore, they had constantly fought <lb/>
            against the Tegeans with ill success; but in the time of <lb/>
            Croesus, and during the reign of Anaxandrides and Aris­ <lb/>
            ton at Lacedæmon, they had at length become superior in the <lb/>
            war, and they became so in the following manner : when they <lb/>
            had always been worsted in battle by the Tegeans, they sent <lb/>
            to inquire of the oracle at Delphi, what god they should pro­ <lb/>
            pitiate, in order to become victorious over the Tegeans. The <lb/>
            Pythian answered, they should become so, when they had <lb/>
            brought back the bones of Orestes the son of Agamemnon. <lb/>
            But as they were unable to find the sepulchre of Orestes, they <lb/>
            sent again to inquire of the god in what spot Orestes lay in­ <lb/>
            terred, and the Pythian gave this answer to the inquiries of <lb/>
            those who came to consult her: " In the level plain of Arca­ <lb/>
            dia lies Tegea, where two winds by hard compulsion blow, <lb/>
            and stroke answers to stroke, and woe lies on woe. There <lb/>
            life-engendering earth contains Agamemnon's son ; convey <lb/>
            him home, and you will be victorious over Tegea." When <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians heard this, they were as far off the dis­ <lb/>
            covery as ever, though they searched every where: till Li­ <lb/>
            chas, one of the Spartans who are called Agathoergi, found it. <lb/>
            These Agathoergi consist of citizens who are discharged from <lb/>
            serving in the cavalry, such as are senior, five in every year: <lb/>
            it is their duty during the year in which they are discharged <lb/>
            from the cavalry, not to remain inactive, but go to different <lb/>
            places where they are sent by the Spartan commonwealth. <lb/>
            68. Lichas, who was one of these persons, discovered it <lb/>
            in Tegea, both meeting with good fortune and employing <lb/>
            sagacity. For as the Lacedæmonians had at that time inter­ <lb/>
            course with the Tegeans, he, coming to a smithy, looked at­ <lb/>
            tentively at the iron being forged, and was struck with wonder <lb/>
            when he saw what was done. The smith perceiving his <lb/>
            astonishment desisted from his work, and said, " 0 Laconian <lb/>
            stranger, you would certainly have been astonished had you <lb/>
            seen what I saw, since you are so surprised at the working of <lb/>
            iron. For as I was endeavouring to sink a well in this en­ <lb/>
            closure, in digging, I came to a coffin seven cubits long j and <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="margin">69.] </note> <lb/>
            because I did not believe that men were ever taller than they <lb/>
            now are, I opened it, and saw that the body was equal to the <lb/>
            coffin in length, and after I had measured it, I covered it up <lb/>
            again. The man told him what he had seen, but Lichas, re­ <lb/>
            flecting on what was said, conjectured from the words of the <lb/>
            oracle, that this must be the body of Orestes, forming his con­ <lb/>
            jecture on the following reasons: seeing the smith's two bel­ <lb/>
            lows he discerned in them the two winds, and in the anvil <lb/>
            and hammer the stroke answering to stroke, and in the iron that <lb/>
            was being forged the woe that lay on woe ; representing it in <lb/>
            this way, that iron had been invented to the injury of man. <lb/>
            Having made this conjecture, he returned to Sparta, and gave <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians an account of the whole matter; they, <lb/>
            having brought a feigned charge against him, sent him into <lb/>
            banishment. He then, going back to Tegea, related his mis­ <lb/>
            fortune to the smith, and wished to hire the enclosure from <lb/>
            him, but he would not let it. But in time, when he had per­ <lb/>
            suaded him, he took up his abode there; and having opened <lb/>
            the sepulchre and collected the bones, he carried them away <lb/>
            with him to Sparta. From that time, whenever they made <lb/>
            trial of each other's strength, the Lacedæmonians were by far <lb/>
            superior in war; and the greater part of Peloponnesus had <lb/>
            been already subdued by them.</p>
          <p>69. Crœsus being informed of all these things, sent am­ <lb/>
            bassadors to Sparta, with presents, and to request their alli­ <lb/>
            ance, having given them orders what to say ; and when they <lb/>
            were arrived they spoke as follows: " Croesus, king of the <lb/>
            Lydians and of other nations, has sent us with this mes­ <lb/>
            sage ; ‘O Lacedæmonians, since the deity has directed me <lb/>
            by an oracle to unite myself to a Grecian friend, therefore <lb/>
            (for I am informed that you are pre-eminent in Greece) I <lb/>
            invite you in obedience to the oracle, being desirous of be­ <lb/>
            coming your friend and ally, without treachery or guile.'" <lb/>
            Croesus therefore made this proposal by his ambassadors. But <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians, who had before heard of the answer given <lb/>
            by the oracle to Crœsus, were gratified at the coming of the <lb/>
            Lydians, and exchanged pledges of friendship and alliance ;x <lb/>
            and indeed certain favours had been formerly conferred on <lb/>
            them by Croesus : for when the Lacedæmonians sent to Sardis <lb/>
            to purchase gold, wishing to use it in erecting the statue of <lb/>
            Apollo that now stands at Thornax in Laconia, Croesus gave <pb n="30"/>
            <note type="margin"> [70, 71 </note> <lb/>
            it as a present to them, when they were desirous of pur­ <lb/>
            chasing it. 70. For this reason then, and because he had se­ <lb/>
            lected them from all the Greeks, and desired their friendship, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians accepted his offer of alliance ; and in the first <lb/>
            place they promised to be ready at his summons; and in the <lb/>
            next, having made a brazen bowl, and covered it outside to the <lb/>
            rim with various figures, and capable of containing three hUll <lb/>
            dred amphoræ, they sent it to him, being desirous of making <lb/>
            Crœsus a present in return. But this bowl never reached <lb/>
            Sardis, for one of the two following reasons: the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians say, that when this bowl, on its way to Sardis, was off <lb/>
            Samos, the Samians having heard of it, sailed out in long <lb/>
            ships, and took it away by force. On the other hand the <lb/>
            Samians affirm, that when the Lacedæmonians who were con. <lb/>
            veying the bowl found they were too late, and heard that <lb/>
            Sardis was taken, and Crœsus a prisoner, they sold the bowl <lb/>
            in Samos, and that some private persons, who bought, it, dedi­ <lb/>
            cated it in the temple of Juno. And perhaps they who sold it, <lb/>
            when they returned to Sparta, might say that they had been <lb/>
            robbed of it by the Samians. So it is then respecting this <lb/>
            bowl.</p>
          <p>71. Crœsus then, mistaking the oracle, prepared to invade <lb/>
            Cappadocia, hoping to overthrow Cyrus and the power of the <lb/>
            Persians. Whilst Crœsus was preparing for his expedition <lb/>
            against the Persians, a certain Lydian, who before that time <lb/>
            was esteemed a wise man, and on this occasion acquired a very <lb/>
            great name in Lydia, gave him advice in these words (the <lb/>
            name of this person was Sandanis): " 0 king, you are pre­ <lb/>
            paring to make war against a people who wear leather <lb/>
            trousers, and the rest of their garments of leather; who in­ <lb/>
            habit a barren country, and feed not on such things as they <lb/>
            choose, but such as they can get. Besides, they do not habit­ <lb/>
            ually use wine, but drink water; nor have they figs to eat, <lb/>
            nor any thing that is good. In the first place, then, if you <lb/>
            should conquer, what will you take from them, since they have <lb/>
            nothing ? On the other hand, if you she uld be conquered, <lb/>
            consider what good things you will lose. For when they have <lb/>
            tasted of our good things, they will become fond of them, nor <lb/>
            will they be driven from them. As for me, I thank the gods, <lb/>
            that they have not put it into the thoughts of the Persians <lb/>
            to make war on the Lydians.” In saying this, he did not <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> 72, 73. </note> <lb/>
            persuade Crœsus. Now before the , <unclear>subdued</unclear> the Lydians, the <lb/>
            Persians possessed nothing either luxurious or good. 72. <lb/>
            The Cappadocians are by the Greeks called Syrians; these <lb/>
            Syrians, before the establishment of the Persian power, were <lb/>
            subject to the Modes; but then to Cyrus. For the boundary <lb/>
            of the Median empire and the Lydian was the river Halys, <lb/>
            which flows from the mountains of Armenia through Cilicia; <lb/>
            and afterwards has the Matienians on the right and the <lb/>
            Phrygians on the other side; then passing these and flowing <lb/>
            up towards the north, it skirts the Syrian Cappadocians on <lb/>
            one side, and the Paphlagonians on the left. Thus the river <lb/>
            Halys divides almost the whole of lower Asia, from the sea <lb/>
            opposite Cyprus to the Euxine: this is the isthmus of that <lb/>
            whole country: as to the length of the journey, it takes five <lb/>
            days for a well-girt man.6</p>
          <p>73. Crœsus invaded Cappadocia for the following rea­ <lb/>
            sons; as well from a desire of adding it to his own domi­ <lb/>
            nions, as, especially, from his confidence in the oracle, and <lb/>
            a wish to punish Cyrus on account of Astyages. For Cyrus, <lb/>
            son of Cambyses, had subjugated Astyages, son of Cyaxares, <lb/>
            who was brother-in-law of Crœsus, and king of the Medes. <lb/>
            He had become brother-in-law to Crœsus in the following <lb/>
            manner : a band of Scythian nomades having risen in rebel­ <lb/>
            lion, withdrew into Media: at that time Cyaxares, son of <lb/>
            Phraortes, grandson of Deioces, ruled over the Medes; he, <lb/>
            at first, received these Scythians kindly, as being suppliants; <lb/>
            so much so, that esteeming them very highly, he intrusted <lb/>
            some youths to them, to learn their language, and the use of <lb/>
            the bow. In course of time, it happened, that these Scythians, <lb/>
            who were constantly going out to hunt, and who always <lb/>
            brought home something, on one occasion took nothing. On <lb/>
            their returning empty-handed, Cyaxares (for he was, as he <lb/>
            proved, of a violent temper) treated them with most oppro­ <lb/>
            brious language. The Scythians, having met with this treat­ <lb/>
            ment from Cyaxares, and considering it undeserved by them, <lb/>
            determined to kill one of the youths that were being educated <lb/>
            under their care; and having prepared the flesh as they used <lb/>
            to dress the beasts taken in hunting, to serve it up to Cyaxares <lb/>
            as if it were game; and then to make their escape immedi- <note type="footnote">3 The long flowing dresses of the ancients made it necessary to gird <lb/>

            ately to Alyattes, son of Saiyattes, at Sardis. This was ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly done: and Cyaxares and his guests tasted of this <lb/>
            flesh; and the Scythians, having done this, became suppliants <lb/>
            to Alyattes. 74. After this, (for Alyattes refused to deliver up <lb/>
            the Scythians to Cyaxares when he demanded them,) war <lb/>
            lasted between the Lydians and the Medes for five years : <lb/>
            during this period the Medes often defeated the Lydians, and <lb/>
            often the Lydians defeated the Medes ; and during this time <lb/>
            they had a kind of nocturnal engagement. In the sixth year, <lb/>
            when they were carrying on the war with nearly equal suc­ <lb/>
            cess, on occasion of an engagement, it happened that in the <lb/>
            heat of the battle day was suddenly turned into night. This <lb/>
            change of the day Thales the Milesian had foretold to the <lb/>
            Ionians, fixing beforehand this year as the very period, ip <lb/>
            which the change actually took place. The Lydians and <lb/>
            Medes seeing night succeeding in the place of day, desisted <lb/>
            from fighting, and both showed a great anxiety to make peace. <lb/>
            Syennesis 7 the Cilician, and Labynetus 8 the Babylonian, were <lb/>
            the mediators of their reconciliation ; these were they who <lb/>
            hastened the treaty between them, and made a matrimonial <lb/>
            connexion ; for they persuaded Alyattes to give his daughter <lb/>
            Aryenis in marriage to Astyages, son of Cyaxares. For with­ <lb/>
            out strong necessity, agreements are not wont to remain firm. <lb/>
            These nations in their federal contracts observe the same cere­ <lb/>
            monies as the Greeks; and in addition, when they have cut <lb/>
            their arms to the outer skin, they lick up one another's blood.</p>
          <p>75. Cyrus had subdued this same Astyages, his grandfather <lb/>
            by the mother's side, for reasons which I shall hereafter re­ <lb/>
            late.9 Crœsus, alleging this against him, sent to consult the <lb/>
            oracle, if he should make war on the Persians ; and when an <lb/>
            ambiguous answer came back, he, interpreting it to his own <lb/>
            advantage, led his army against the territory of the Persians. <lb/>
            When he arrived at the river Halys, Croesus transported his <lb/>
            forces, as I believe, by the bridges which are now there. But <lb/>
            the common opinion of the Grecians is, that Thales the Mi. <lb/>
            lesian procured him a passage. For, whilst Crœsus was in <note type="footnote"> ' Syennesis seems to have been a name common to the kings of Cities. <lb/>
            In addition to the one here mentioned, we meet with another in the time <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 76, 77.] </note> <lb/>
            doubt" how his army should pass over the river, (for they say <lb/>
            that these bridges were not at that time in existence,) Thales, <lb/>
            who was in the camp, caused the stream, which flowed along <lb/>
            the left of the army, to flow likewise on the right; and he <lb/>
            contrived it thus: having begun above the camp, he dug a <lb/>
            deep trench, in the shape of a half-moon, so that the river, <lb/>
            being turned into this from its old channel, might pass in the <lb/>
            rear of the camp pitched where it then was, and afterwards, <lb/>
            having passed by the camp, might fall into its former course; <lb/>
            so that as soon as the river was divided into two streams it <lb/>
            became fordable in both. Some say, that the ancient channel <lb/>
            of the river was entirely dried up; but this I cannot assent <lb/>
            to; for how then could they have crossed it on their return ? <lb/>
            76. However, Crœsus, having passed the river with his <lb/>
            army, came to a place called Pteria, in Cappadocia. (Now <lb/>
            Pteria is the strongest position of the whole of this country, <lb/>
            and is situated over against Sinope, a city on the Euxine Sea.) <lb/>
            Here he encamped, and ravaged the lands of the Syrians ; and <lb/>
            took the city of the Pterians, and enslaved the inhabitants; <lb/>
            he also took all the adjacent places, and expelled the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants, who had given him no cause for blame. But Cyrus, <lb/>
            having assembled his own army, and having taken with him <lb/>
            all who inhabited the intermediate country, went to meet <lb/>
            Crœsus. But before he began to advance, he sent heralds to <lb/>
            the Ionians, to persuade them to revolt from Crœsus: the <lb/>
            Ionians however refused. When Cyrus had come up and <lb/>
            encamped opposite Crcesus, they made trial of each other's <lb/>
            strength on the plains of Pteria : but when an obstinate battle <lb/>
            took place, and many fell on both sides, they at last parted, on <lb/>
            the approach of night, neither having been victorious. In <lb/>
            this manner did the two armies engage.</p>
          <p>77. But Crœsus laying "the blame on his own army on <lb/>
            account of the smallness of its numbers, for his forces that <lb/>
            engaged were far fewer than those of Cyrus,—laying the blame <lb/>
            on this, when on the following day Cyrus did not attempt <lb/>
            to attack him, he marched back to Sardis, designing to sum­ <lb/>
            mon the Egyptians according to treaty, for he had made an <lb/>
            alliance with Amasis king of Egypt before he had with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians; and to send for the Babylonians, (for he had <lb/>
            made an alliance with them also, and Labynetus at this timo <lb/>
            reigned over the Babylonians,) and to require the presence of <note type="footnote">D </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="margin"> [78. 79. </note> <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians at a fixed time: having collected these <lb/>
            together, and assembled his own army, he purposed, when <lb/>
            winter was over, to attack the Persians in the beginning of <lb/>
            the spring. With this design, when he reached Sardis, he <lb/>
            despatched ambassadors to his different allies, requiring them <lb/>
            to meet at Sardis before the end of five months; but the army <lb/>
            that was with him, and that had fought with the Persians, <lb/>
            which was composed of mercenary troops, he entirely dis­ <lb/>
            banded, not imagining that Cyrus, who had come off on such <lb/>
            equal terms, would venture to advance upon Sardis. 78. <lb/>
            While Croesus was forming these plans the whole suburbs <lb/>
            were filled with serpents, and when they appeared, the horses, <lb/>
            forsaking their pastures, came and devoured them. When <lb/>
            Crœsus beheld this, he considered it to be, as it really was, a <lb/>
            prodigy, and sent immediately to consult the interpreters at <lb/>
            Telmessus ; but the messengers having arrived there, and learnt <lb/>
            from the Telmessians what the prodigy portended, were un­ <lb/>
            able to report it to Croesus, for before they sailed back to Sar­ <lb/>
            dis Crœsus had been taken prisoner. The Telmessians had <lb/>
            pronounced as follows: " that Crœsus must expect a foreign <lb/>
            army to invade his country, which, on its arrival, would sub­ <lb/>
            due the natives, because, they said, the serpent is a son of the <lb/>
            earth, but the horse is an enemy and a stranger." This answer <lb/>
            the Telmessians gave to Croesus when he had been already <lb/>
            taken ; yet without knowing what had happened with respect <lb/>
            to Sardis or Crœsus himself.</p>
          <p>79. But Cyrus, as soon as Croesus had retreated after <lb/>
            the battle at Pteria, having discovered that it was the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of Croesus to disband his army, found, upon deliberation, <lb/>
            that it would be to his advantage to march with all possible <lb/>
            expedition on Sardis, before the forces of the Lydians could <lb/>
            be a second time assembled ; and when he had thus deter­ <lb/>
            mined, he put his plan into practice with all possible expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, for having marched his army into Lydia, he brought <lb/>
            this news of his own enterprise to Croesus. Thereupon Crœsus, <lb/>
            being thrown into great perplexity, seeing that matters had <lb/>
            turned out contrary to his expectations, nevertheless drew out <lb/>
            the Lydians to battle ; and at that time no nation in Asia was <lb/>
            more valiant and warlike than the Lydians. Their mode of <lb/>
            fighting was from on horseback; they were armed with long <unclear/> <lb/>
            lances, and managed their horses with admirable address <pb n="35"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="80—82.]"/> <lb/>
            80. The place where they met was the plain that lies-be <lb/>
            fore the city of Sardis, which is extensive and bare; several <lb/>
            rivers, as well as the Hyllus, flowing through it, force a pas­ <lb/>
            sage into the greatest, called the Hermus, which flowing from <lb/>
            the sacred mountain of mother Cybele, falls into the sea near <lb/>
            the city of Phocaea. Here Cyrus, when he saw the Lydians <lb/>
            drawn up in order of battle, alarmed at the cavalry, had re­ <lb/>
            course to the following stratagem, on the suggestion of Har­ <lb/>
            pagus, a Mede. Having collected together all the camels that <lb/>
            followed his army with provisions and baggage, and having <lb/>
            caused their burdens to be taken off, he mounted men upon <lb/>
            them equipped in cavalry accoutrements, and having furnished <lb/>
            them, he ordered them to go in advance of the rest of his <lb/>
            army against the Lydian horse ; and he commanded his in­ <lb/>
            fantry to follow the camels, and he placed the whole of his <lb/>
            cavalry behind the infantry. When all were drawn up in <lb/>
            order, he charged them not to spare any of the Lydians, but to <lb/>
            kill every one they met; but on no account to kill Crcesus, <lb/>
            even if he should offer resistance when taken. Such were the <lb/>
            orders he gave. He drew up the camels inthe front of the <lb/>
            cavalry, for this reason ; a horse is afraid, of a camel, and can­ <lb/>
            not endure either to see its form or to scent its smell: for this <lb/>
            reason, then, he had recourse to this stratagem, that the cavalry <lb/>
            might be useless to Crœsus, by which the Lydian expected to <lb/>
            signalize himself. Accordingly, when they joined battle, the <lb/>
            horses no sooner smelt the camels and saw them, than they <lb/>
            wheeled round, and the hopes of Crœsus were destroyed <lb/>
            Nevertheless the Lydians were not therefore discouraged, but <lb/>
            when they perceived what had happened, leaped from their <lb/>
            horses and engaged with the Persians on foot: at last, when <lb/>
            many had fallen on both sides, the Lydians were put to flight, <lb/>
            and being shut up within the walls, were besieged by the <lb/>
            Persians.</p>
          <p>81. Siege was then laid to- them; but Crcesus, think­ <lb/>
            ing it would last a long time, sent other messengers from <lb/>
            the city to his allies ; for those who were before sent requested <lb/>
            them to assemble at Sardis on the fifth month, but he sent <lb/>
            out these last to request them to succour him with all speed, <lb/>
            as he was already besieged. 82. He sent therefore to the <lb/>
            rest of his allies, and especially to the Lacedæmonians; but <lb/>
            at that very time the Spartans themselves happened to have a <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [83. </note> <lb/>
            quarrel with the Argians about a tract called Thyrea; for this <lb/>
            Thyrea, which properly belongs to the territory of Argos, the <lb/>
            Spartans had seized. And indeed the country that lies west­ <lb/>
            ward as far as Malea, both on the continent, and the island <lb/>
            Cythera and the other islands, belongs to the Argians. The <lb/>
            Argians having advanced to the defence of their country which <lb/>
            had been thus seized upon, both parties, upon a conference, <lb/>
            agreed that three hundred men on each side should engage, and <lb/>
            that whichever party was victorious should be entitled to the <lb/>
            disputed territory: but it was stipulated, that the main body of <lb/>
            each army should withdraw to their own country, and not re­ <lb/>
            main while the engagement was going on, lest if the armies <lb/>
            were present, either side seeing their countrymen in distress, <lb/>
            should come in to their assistance. Having agreed to these <lb/>
            terms, the armies withdrew, and the picked men on each side <lb/>
            remaining behind engaged: they fought with such equal suc­ <lb/>
            cess, that of the six hundred, three men only were left alive ; of <lb/>
            the Argians, Alcehorand Chromius,andof the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            Othryades; these survived when night came on. The two Ar­ <lb/>
            gians thinking themselves victorious, ran to Argos with the <lb/>
            news; but Othryades, the Lacedæmonian, having stripped the <lb/>
            corpses of the Argians, and carried their arms to his own camp­ <lb/>
            continued at his post. On the next day both <unclear>armies</unclear> being in­ <lb/>
            formed of the event, met again in the same place; and for a time <lb/>
            both laid claim to the victory; the one side alleging that the <lb/>
            greater number of their men survived; the other side urging <lb/>
            that those survivors had fled, and that their countryman had <lb/>
            kept the field and spoiled their dead. At length, from words <lb/>
            they betook themselves to blows ; and when many had fallen on <lb/>
            both sides, the Lacedæmonians obtained the victory. From that <lb/>
            time the Argians, cutting off their hair, which they had before <lb/>
            been compelled to wear long, enacted a law, which was con­ <lb/>
            firmed by a curse, that no Argian should suffer his hair to <lb/>
            grow, nor any woman wear ornaments of gold, till they should <lb/>
            recover Thyrea. On the other hand, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            made a contrary law, enjoining all their people to wear long <lb/>
            hair, which they had never done before. As to Othryades, <lb/>
            who was the only one that survived of the three hundred. <lb/>
            they say that, being ashamed to return to Sparta when all <lb/>
            his fellow soldiers had perished, he put an end to himself at <lb/>
            Thyrea. 83. When the affairs of the Spartans were in this <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> 84 85.] </note> <lb/>
            condition, the Sardian ambassador arrived, ani requested <lb/>
            them to assist Croesus, who was besieged in Sardis; they, how­ <lb/>
            ever, no sooner heard the ambassadors' report, than they made <lb/>
            preparations to succour him. But when they were now pre­ <lb/>
            pared to set out, and their ships were ready, another message <lb/>
            reached them that the citadel of the Lydians was taken, and <lb/>
            Crœsus made prisoner; they accordingly, deeming it a great <lb/>
            misfortune, desisted from their enterprise.</p>
          <p>84. Sardis was taken in the following manner., On the <lb/>
            fourteenth day after Crœsus had been besieged, Cyrus sent <lb/>
            horsemen throughout his army, and proclaimed that he <lb/>
            would liberally reward the man who should first mount the <lb/>
            wall: upon this several attempts were made, and as often <lb/>
            failed ; till, after the rest had desisted, a Mardian, whose name <lb/>
            was Hyrceades, endeavoured to climb up on that part of <lb/>
            the citadel where no guard was stationed, because there did <lb/>
            not appear to be any danger that it would be taken on that <lb/>
            part, for on that side the citadel was precipitous and imprac­ <lb/>
            ticable. Round this part alone, Meles, a former king of Sar­ <lb/>
            dis, had not brought the lion which his concubine bore to him, <lb/>
            though the Telmessians had pronounced, that if the lion were <lb/>
            carried round the wall, Sardis would be impregnable; but <lb/>
            Meles, having caused it to be carried round the rest of the <lb/>
            wall, where the citadel was exposed to assault, neglected this, <lb/>
            as altogether unassailable and precipitous: this is the quarter <lb/>
            of the city that faces Mount Tmolus. Now this Hyrœades the <lb/>
            Mardian having seen a Lydian come down this precipice the <lb/>
            day before, for a helmet that was rolled down, and carry it up <lb/>
            again, noticed it carefully, and reflected on it in his mind: he <lb/>
            thereupon ascended the same way, followed by divers Per­ <lb/>
            sians ; and when great numbers had gone up, Sardis was thus <lb/>
            taken, and the whole town plundered.</p>
          <p>85. The following incidents betel Croesus himself. He <lb/>
            had a son of whom I have before made mention, who was in <lb/>
            other respects proper enough, but dumb. Now, in the time <lb/>
            of his former prosperity, Crœsus had done every thing he <lb/>
            could for him, and among other expedients had sent to consult <lb/>
            the oracle of Delphi concerning him; but the Pythian gave <lb/>
            him this answer: " 0 Lydian born, king of many, very foolish <lb/>
            Crœsus, wish not to hear the longed-for voice of thy son <lb/>
            speaking within thy palace; it were better for thee that this <pb n="38"/>
             <note type="margin">[86 </note> <lb/>
            should be far off; for he will first speak in an unhappy day." <lb/>
            When the city was taken, one of the Persians, not knowing <lb/>
            Crcesus, was about to kill him: Croesus, though he saw him <lb/>
            approach, from his present misfortune, took no heed of him, <lb/>
            nor did he care about dying by the blow ; but this speechless <lb/>
            son of his, when he saw the Persian advancing against him, <lb/>
            through dread and anguish, burst into speech, and said, " Man, <lb/>
            kill not Croesus." These were the first words he ever uttered ; <lb/>
            but from that time he continued to speak during the remainder <lb/>
            of his life. 86. So the Persians got possession of Sardis, and <lb/>
            made Crœsus prisoner, after he had reigned fourteen years, <lb/>
            been besieged fourteen days, and lost his great empire, as the <lb/>
            oracle had predicted. The Persians, having taken him, con­ <lb/>
            ducted him to Cyrus; and he, having heaped up a great pile, <lb/>
            placed Croesus upon it, bound with fetters, and with him <lb/>
            fourteen young Lydians; designing either to offer this sacri­ <lb/>
            lice to some god, as the first-fruits of his victory, or wishing <lb/>
            to perform a vow; or perhaps, having heard that Croesus was <lb/>
            a religious person, he placed him on the pile for the purpose <lb/>
            of discovering whether any deity would save him from being <lb/>
            burnt alive. He accordingly did what has been related: it is <lb/>
            added, that when Crcesus stood upon the pile, notwithstanding <lb/>
            the weight of his misfortunes, the words of Solon recurred <lb/>
            to him, as spoken by inspiration of the deity, that “no living <lb/>
            man could be justly called happy." When this occurred to <lb/>
            him, it is said, that after a long silence he recovered himself, <lb/>
            and uttering a groan, thrice pronounced the name of Solon ; <lb/>
            that when Cyrus heard him, he commanded his interpreters <lb/>
            to ask Croesus, whom it was he called upon; that they drew <lb/>
            near and asked him ; but Croesus for some time kept silence; <lb/>
            but at last, being constrained to speak, said, " I named a man, <lb/>
            whose discourses I more desire all tyrants might hear, than <lb/>
            to be possessor of the greatest riches." When he gave them <lb/>
            this obscure answer, they again inquired what he said: and <lb/>
            when they persisted in their inquiries, and were very impor­ <lb/>
            tunate, he at length told them, that Solon, an Athenian, for­ <lb/>
            merly visited him, and having viewed all his treasures, made <lb/>
            no account of them: telling, in a word, how every thing had <lb/>
            befallen him as Solon had warned him, though his discourse <lb/>
            related to all mankind as much as to himself, and especially <lb/>
            to those who imagine themselves happy. They say, that <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="margin"> 87, 88.] </note> <lb/>
            Crœsus gave this explanation ; and that the pile being now <lb/>
            kindled, the outer parts began to burn; and that Cyrus, in­ <lb/>
            formed by the interpreters of what Crœsus had said, relented, <lb/>
            and considering that being but a man, he was yet going to <lb/>
            burn another man alive, who had been no way inferior to <lb/>
            himself in prosperity; and moreover fearing retribution, and <lb/>
            reflecting that nothing human is constant, commanded the fire <lb/>
            to be instantly extinguished, and Crœsus, with those who <lb/>
            were about him, to be taken down; and that they with all <lb/>
            their endeavours were unable to master the fire. 87. It is <lb/>
            related by the Lydians, that Crœsus, perceiving that Cyrus <lb/>
            had altered his resolution, when he saw every man en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to put out the fire, but unable to get the better of <lb/>
            it, shouted aloud, invoking Apollo, and besought him, if ever <lb/>
            any of his offerings had been agreeable to him, to protect <lb/>
            and deliver him from the present danger: they report, that <lb/>
            he with tears invoked the god, and that on a sudden clouds <lb/>
            . were seen gathering in the air, which before was serene, <lb/>
            and that a violent storm burst forth and vehement rain fell <lb/>
            and extinguished the flames ; by which Cyrus perceiving <lb/>
            that Croesus was beloved by the gods, and a good man, when <lb/>
            he had had him taken down from the pile, asked him the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing question: " Who persuaded you, Crœsus, to invade my <lb/>
            territories, and to become my enemy instead of my friend?" <lb/>
            He answered: " 0 king, I have done this for your good but <lb/>
            my own evil fortune, and the god of the Greeks who encou­ <lb/>
            raged me to make war is the cause of all. For no man is so <lb/>
            void of understanding as to prefer war before peace ; for in <lb/>
            the latter bury their fathers; in the former, fathers <lb/>
            bury their children. But, I suppose, it pleased the gods that <lb/>
            these things should be so."</p>
          <p>88. He then thus spoke: but Cyrus, having set him <lb/>
            at liberty, placed him by his own side, and showed him <lb/>
            great respect; and both he and all those that were with him <lb/>
            were astonished at what they saw. But Crœsus, absorbed in <lb/>
            thought, remained silent; and presently turning round and <lb/>
            beholding the Persians sacking the city of the Lydians, he <lb/>
            said, " Does it become me, 0 king, to tell you what is pass­ <lb/>
            ing through my mind, or to keep silence on the present <lb/>
            occasion ?" Cyrus bill him say with confidence whatever <lb/>
            he wished; upon which Croesus asked him, saying, " What <pb n="40"/>
             <note type="margin">[89. 90. </note> <lb/>
            is this vast crowd so earnestly employed about ? " He an­ <lb/>
            swered, " They are sacking your city, and plundering your <lb/>
            riches." " Not so," Crœsus replied ; “ they are neither sack­ <lb/>
            ing my city, nor plundering my riches, ior they no longer <lb/>
            belong to me, but they are ravaging what belongs to you.” <lb/>
            89. The reply of Crœsus attracted the attention of Cyrus; <lb/>
            lie therefore ordered all the rest to withdraw, and asked <lb/>
            Crœsus what he thought should be done in the present con­ <lb/>
            juncture. He answered: " Since the gods have made me <lb/>
            your servant, I think it my duty to acquaint you, if I perceive <lb/>
            any thing deserving of remark. The Persians, who are by na­ <lb/>
            ture overbearing, are poor. If, therefore, you permit them to <lb/>
            plunder and possess great riches, you may expect the follow­ <lb/>
            ing results: whoso acquires the greatest possessions, be assured, <lb/>
            will be ready to rebel. Therefore, if you approve what I say, <lb/>
            adopt the following plan: place some of your body-guard as <lb/>
            sentinels at every gate, with orders to take the booty from all <lb/>
            those who would go out, and to acquaint them that the tenth <lb/>
            must of necessity be consecrated to Jupiter : thus you will <lb/>
            not incur the odium of taking away their property ; and they, <lb/>
            acknowledging your intention to be just, will readily obey.” <lb/>
            90. Cyrus, when he heard this, was exceedingly delighted, <lb/>
            as he thought the suggestion a very good one : having there­ <lb/>
            fore commended it highly, and ordered his guards to do what <lb/>
            Croesus suggested, he addressed Crœsus as follows : “ Croesus, <lb/>
            since you are resolved to display the deeds and words of a <lb/>
            true king, ask whatever boon you desire on the instant." <lb/>
            " Sir," he answered, " the most acceptable favour you can <lb/>
            bestow upon me is, to let me send my fetters to the god of <lb/>
            the Grecians, whom I have honoured more than any other <lb/>
            deity, and to ask him, if it be his custom to deceive those <lb/>
            who deserve well of him." Cyrus asked him what cause lie <lb/>
            had to complain, that induced him to make this request: upon <lb/>
            which Crœsus recounted to him all his projects, and the an­ <lb/>
            swers of the oracles, and particularly the offerings he had <lb/>
            presented; and how he was incited by the oracle to make <lb/>
            war against the Persians. When he had said this, he again <lb/>
            besought him to grant him leave to reproach the god with <lb/>
            these things. But Cyrus, smiling, said, " You shall not only <lb/>
            receive this boon from me, but whatever else you may at any <lb/>
            time desire." When Crœsus heard this, he sent certain Ly- <pb n="41"/>
            <note type="margin"> 91.] </note> <lb/>
            dians to Delphi, with orders to lay his fetters at the entrance <lb/>
            of the temple, and to ask the god, if he were not ashamed to <lb/>
            have encouraged Croesus by his oracles to make war on the <lb/>
            Persians, assuring him that he would put an end to the power of <lb/>
            Cyrus, of which war such were the first-fruits, (commanding <lb/>
            them at these words to show the fetters,) and at the same time to <lb/>
            ask if it were the custom of the Grecian gods to be ungrateful. <lb/>
            91. When the Lydians arrived at Delphi, and had delivered <lb/>
            their message, the Pythian is reported to have made this <lb/>
            answer: " The god himself even cannot avoid the decrees <lb/>
            of fate ; and Crœsus has atoned the crime of his ancestor in <lb/>
            the fifth generation,1 who, being one of the body-guard of the <lb/>
            Heraclidæ, was induced by the artifice of a woman to murder <lb/>
            his master, and to usurp his dignity, to which he had no right. <lb/>
            But although Apollo was desirous that the fall of Sardis might <lb/>
            happen in the time of the sons of Crœsus, and not during his <lb/>
            reign, yet it was not in his power to avert the fates ; but so <lb/>
            far as they allowed he accomplished, and conferred the boon <lb/>
            on him ; for he delayed the capture of Sardis for the space of <lb/>
            three years. Let Crœsus know, therefore, that he was taken I <lb/>
            prisoner three years later than the fates had ordained : and in <lb/>
            the next place, he came to his relief, when he was upon the point <lb/>
            of being burnt alive. Then, as to the prediction of the oracle, <lb/>
            Crœsus has no right to complain ; for Apollo foretold him <lb/>
            that if he made war on thp Persians. he would subvert a great <lb/>
            empire ; and had he desired to be truly informed, he ought to <lb/>
            have sent again to inquire, whether his own or that of Cyrus <lb/>
            as meant. But since he neither understood the oracle, nor <lb/>
            inqUIre again, let him lay the blame on himself. And when <lb/>
            he last consulted the oracle, he did not understand the answer <lb/>
            concerning the mule ; for Cyrus was that mule; inasmuch as <lb/>
            he was born of parents of different nations, the mother su­ <lb/>
            perior, but the father inferior. For she was a Mede, and <lb/>
            daughter of Astyages king of Media ; but he was a Persian,. <lb/>
            subject to the Medes ; and though in every respect inferior, <lb/>
            he married his own mistress." The Pythian gave this an­ <lb/>
            swer to the Lydians, and they carried it back to Sardis, and <lb/>
            reported it to Croesus, and he, when he heard it, acknowledged <note type="footnote"> 1 Crœsus was the fifth descendant of Gyges, if we include the two ex. <lb/>
            tremes; for the house of the Mermnadæ was as follows. Gyges, Ardys, <lb/>
            Sadyattes, Alyattes, Crœsus. See chap. IS </note> <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="margin"> [92, 93. </note> <lb/>
            the fault to be his, and not the god's. Such is the account of <lb/>
            the kingdom of Croesus, and the first subjection of Ionia.</p>
          <p>92. Many other offerings were also consecrated by Croesus <lb/>
            in Greece, besides those already mentioned. For at Thebes <lb/>
            of Boeotia there is a golden tripod, which he dedicated to Is­ <lb/>
            menian Apollo; and in Ephesus, the golden heifers, and several <lb/>
            of the pillars ; and in the Pronaea at Delphi a large golden <lb/>
            shield. All these were in existence in my day ; but others <lb/>
            have been lost. The offerings he dedicated -in Branchis, a <lb/>
            city of the Milesians, were, as I am informed, equal in weight <lb/>
            and similar to those at Delphi. Now the offerings which he <lb/>
            made to Delphi and to Amphiaraus, were his own property <lb/>
            and the first-fruits of his patrimonial riches ; but the rest were <lb/>
            the produce of the property of an enemy who, before he came <lb/>
            to the throne, had set up an adverse faction, endeavouring to <lb/>
            raise Pantaleon to the throne : now Pantaleon was the son of <lb/>
            Alyattes, but of the same mother as Croesus ; for Alyattes had <lb/>
            Crœsus by a Carian, and Pantaleon by an Ionian woman. <lb/>
            When therefore Crœsus by the will of his father obtained the <lb/>
            kingdom, he put his opponent to death by tearing his flesh <lb/>
            with a fuller's thistle ; and having already vowed all his trea­ <lb/>
            sure to the gods, he dedicated it in the manner above described <lb/>
            to the places I have mentioned. And this may suffice re­ <lb/>
            specting the offerings.</p>
          <p>93. The Lydian territory does not present many wonders <lb/>
            worthy of description, like some other countries, except the <lb/>
            gold dust brought down from Mount Tmolus. It exhibits, <lb/>
            however, one work the greatest of all, except those of the <lb/>
            Egyptians and Babylonians. There is there a monument <lb/>
            to Alyattes, father of Crœsus, the basis of which is composed <lb/>
            of large stones, the rest is a mound of earth. This fabric was <lb/>
            raised by merchants, artificers, and prostitutes. On the sum­ <lb/>
            mit of this monument there remained, even in my day, five <lb/>
            termini, upon which were inscriptions, showing how much of <lb/>
            the work each class executed, and when measured the work of <lb/>
            the females proved to be the greatest. For the daughters of <lb/>
            the Lydian common people all prostitute themselves, for the <lb/>
            purpose of providing themselves with dowries ; and they con­ <lb/>
            tinue to do so until they marry ; and they dispose of them­ <lb/>
            selves in marriage. This monument is six stades and two <lb/>
            plethra in circumference, and in breadth, thirteen plethra; <pb n="43"/>
             <note type="margin">94, 95.] </note> <lb/>
            contiguous to it is a large lake, which the Lydians say is fed <lb/>
            by perpetual springs, and it is called the Gygean lake. This <lb/>
            may suffice for this Subject.</p>
          <p>94. The customs of the Lydians differ little from those <lb/>
            of the Grecians, except that they prostitute their females. <lb/>
            They are the first of all nations we know of that introduced <lb/>
            the art of coining gold and silver ; and they were the first re­ <lb/>
            tailers. The Lydians themselves say that the games which are <lb/>
            now common to themselves and the Greeks, were their inven­ <lb/>
            tion ; and they say they were invented about the time they <lb/>
            sent a colony to Tyrrhenia, of all which they give the follow­ <lb/>
            ing account. During the reign of Atys, son of Manes king of <lb/>
            Lydia, a great scarcity of corn pervaded all Lydia : for some <lb/>
            time the Lydians supported it with constancy; but when <lb/>
            they saw the evil still continuing they sought for remedies, <lb/>
            and some devised one thing, some another; and at that time <lb/>
            the games of dice, hucklebones, ball, and all other kinds of <lb/>
            games except draughts, were invented, for the Lydians do not <lb/>
            claim the invention of this last; and having made these in­ <lb/>
            ventions to alleviate the famine, they employed them as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : they used to play one whole day that they might not <lb/>
            be in want of food ; and on the next, they eat and abstained <lb/>
            from play ; thus they passed eighteen years ; but when the <lb/>
            evil did not abate, on the contrary became still more virulent, <lb/>
            their king divided the whole people into two parts, and cast <lb/>
            lots which should remain and which quit the country, and <lb/>
            over that part whose lot it should be to stay he appointed him­ <lb/>
            self king ; and over that part which was to emigrate he ap­ <lb/>
            pointed his own son, whose name was Tyrrhenus. Those to <lb/>
            whose lot it fell to leave their country went down to Smyrna, <lb/>
            built ships, and having put all their movables which were of <lb/>
            use on board, set sail in search of food and land, till having <lb/>
            passed by many nations, they reached the Ombrici, where <lb/>
            they built towns, and dwell to this day. From being called <lb/>
            Lydians, they changed their name to one after the king's son, <lb/>
            who led them out; from him they gave themselves the appel­ <lb/>
            lation of Tyrrhenians. The Lydians then were reduced <lb/>
            under the power of the Persians.</p>
          <p>95. My history hence proceeds to inquire who Cyrus <lb/>
            was that overthrew the power of Croesus, and how the Per­ <lb/>
            sians became masters of Asia. In which narration I shall fol- <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="margin">[96, 97.</note> <lb/>
            low those Persians, who do not wish to magnify the actions of <lb/>
            Cyrus, but to relate the plain truth; though I am aware that <lb/>
            there are three other ways of relating Cyrus's history. After <lb/>
            the Assyrians had ruled over Upper Asia five hundred and <lb/>
            twenty years, the Medes first began to revolt from them ; and <lb/>
            they it seems, in their struggle with the Assyrians for liberty, <lb/>
            proved themselves brave men ; and having shaken off the <lb/>
            yoke, became free: afterwards the other nations also did the <lb/>
            same as the Medes. When all throughout the continent were <lb/>
            independent, they were again reduced under a despotic go­ <lb/>
            vernment in the following manner. 96. There was among <lb/>
            the Medes a man famous for wisdom, named Deioces, son of <lb/>
            Phraortes. This Deioces, aiming at absolute power, had re­ <lb/>
            course to the following plan. The Medes were at that time <lb/>
            distributed into villages, and Deioces, who was already highly <lb/>
            esteemed in his own district, applied himself with great zeal <lb/>
            to the exercise of justice ; and this he did, since great law­ <lb/>
            lessness prevailed throughout the whole of Media, and he <lb/>
            knew that injustice and justice are ever at variance. The <lb/>
            Medes of the same village, observing his conduct, chose him <lb/>
            for their judge; and he, constantly keeping the sovereign <lb/>
            power in view, showed himself upright and just. By this <lb/>
            conduct he acquired no slight praise from his fellow citizens, <lb/>
            so much so that the inhabitants of other villages, hearing <lb/>
            that Deioces was the only one who judged uprightly, having <lb/>
            before met with unjust sentences, when they heard of him <lb/>
            gladly came from all parts to Deioces, in order to submit <lb/>
            their quarrels to his decision; and at last they would commit <lb/>
            the decision to no one else. 97. In the end, when the number <lb/>
            of those who had recourse to him continually increased as men <lb/>
            heard of the justice of his decisions, Deioces, seeing the whole <lb/>
            devolved upon himself, would no longer occupy the seat where <lb/>
            he used to sit to determine differences, and refused to act as <lb/>
            judge any more, for that it was of no advantage to him to neg­ <lb/>
            lect his own affairs, and spend the day in deciding the quarrels <lb/>
            of others. Upon this, rapine and lawlessness growing far more <lb/>
            frequent throughout the villages than before, the Medes called <lb/>
            an assembly and consulted together about the present state of <lb/>
            things, but, as I suspect, the partisans of Deioces spoke to the <lb/>
            following purpose : " Since it is impossible for us to inhabit <lb/>
            the country if we continue in our present condition, let us <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="margin"> 98, 99.] </note> <lb/>
            constitute a king over us, and so the country will be go. <lb/>
            verned by good laws, and we ourselves shall be able to attend <lb/>
            to our business, nor be any longer driven from our homes by <lb/>
            lawlessness." By some such words they persuaded them to <lb/>
            submit to a kingly government. 98. Upon their immediately <lb/>
            putting the question, whom they should appoint king, Deioces <lb/>
            was unanimously preferred and commended ; so that at last <lb/>
            they agreed that he should be their king. But he required them <lb/>
            to build him a palace suitable to the dignity of a king, and <lb/>
            guards for the-security of his person. The Modes accordingly <lb/>
            did so and built him a spacious and strong palace in the part <lb/>
            of the country that he selected, and permitted him to choose <lb/>
            guards for his person out of all the Medes. Being thus pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of the power, he compelled the Medes to build one city, <lb/>
            and having carefully adorned that, to pay less attention to the <lb/>
            others. And as the Medes obeyed him in this also, he built <lb/>
            lofty and strong walls, which now go under the name of Ecba­ <lb/>
            tana,2 one placed in a circle within the other ; and this fortifi­ <lb/>
            cation is so contrived, that each circle was raised above the <lb/>
            other by the height of the battlements only. The situation of <lb/>
            the ground, rising by an easy ascent, was very favourable to the <lb/>
            design. But that which was particularly attended to is, that <lb/>
            there being seven circles altogether, the king's palace and the <lb/>
            treasury are situated within the innermost of them. The <lb/>
            largest of these walls is about equal in circumference to the <lb/>
            city of Athens ; the battlements of the first circle are white, <lb/>
            of the second black, of the third purple, of the fourth blue, of <lb/>
            the fifth bright red. Thus the battlements of all the circles <lb/>
            are painted with different colours ; but the two last have <lb/>
            their battlements plaited, the one with silver, the other with <lb/>
            gold.</p>
          <p>99. Deioces then built these fortifications for himself, <lb/>
            and round his own palace ; and he commanded the rest of the <lb/>
            people to fix their habitations round the fortification ; and <lb/>
            when all the buildings were completed he, for the first time, <lb/>
            established the following regulations: that no man should be <lb/>
            admitted to the king's presence, but every one should consult <lb/>
            him by means of messengers, and that none should be per­ <lb/>
            mitted to see him; and, moreover, that it should be accounted <note type="footnote"> I For the Scripture account of Ecba <unclear/> <unclear/> Judith i. 1- <unclear/></note> <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[100-103"/> <lb/>
            indecency for any to laugh or spit before him. He established <lb/>
            such ceremony about his own person, for this reason, that <lb/>
            those who were his equals, and who were brought up with <lb/>
            him, and of no meaner family, nor inferior to him in manly <lb/>
            qualities, might not, when they saw him, grieve and conspire <lb/>
            against him ; but that he might appear to be of a different <lb/>
            nature to them who did not see him. 100. When he had <lb/>
            established these regulations, and settled himself in the ty­ <lb/>
            ranny, he was very severe in the distribution of justice. And <lb/>
            the parties contending were obliged to send him their case in <lb/>
            writing ; and he having come to a decision, on the cases so <lb/>
            laid before him, sent them back again. This then was his <lb/>
            plan in reference to matters of litigation. And all other <lb/>
            things were regulated by him : so that, if he received informa­ <lb/>
            tion that any man had injured another, he would presently <lb/>
            send for him, and punish him in proportion to his offence; <lb/>
            and for this purpose he had spies and eves-droppers in every <lb/>
            part of his dominions.</p>
          <p>101. Now Deioces collected the Medes into one nation, and <lb/>
            ruled over that. The following are the tribes of the Medes, the <lb/>
            Busæ, Parataceni, Struchates, Arizanti, Budii, and the Magi. <lb/>
            Such are the tribes of the Medes. 102. Deioces had a son, <lb/>
            Phraortes, who, when his father died, after a reign of fifty- <lb/>
            three years, succeeded him in the kingdom; but having so <lb/>
            succeeded, he was not content to rule over the Medes only, <lb/>
            but, having made war on the Persians, he attached them first, <lb/>
            and reduced them under the dominion of the Medes. And <lb/>
            afterwards being master of these two nations, both of them <lb/>
            powerful, he subdued Asia, attacking one nation after another; <lb/>
            till at last he invaded the Assyrians, who inhabited the city <lb/>
            of Nineveh, and who had before been supreme, though at that <lb/>
            time they were abandoned by their confederates, (who had re­ <lb/>
            volted,) but who were otherwise in good condition: Phraortes <lb/>
            then, having made war on them, perished with the greater <lb/>
            part of his army, after he had reigned twenty-two years.</p>
          <p>103. When Phraortes was dead, Cyaxares his son, grand­ <lb/>
            son of Deioces, succeeded him. He is said to have been more <lb/>
            warlike than his ancestors. He first divided the people of <lb/>
            Asia into cohorts, and first divided them into spearmen, <lb/>
            archers, and cavalry ; whereas before they had been confusedly <lb/>
            mixed together. It was he that fought with the Lydians, <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="104—160.]"/> <lb/>
            when the day was turned into night,3 as they were fighting ; <lb/>
            and who subjected the whole of Asia above the river Halys. <lb/>
            He assembled the forces of all his subjects, and marched <lb/>
            against Nineveh to avenge his father, and destroy that city. <lb/>
            However, when he had obtained a victory over the Assyrians, <lb/>
            and while he was besieging Nineveh, a great army of Scythi­ <lb/>
            ans came upon him, under the conduct of their king Madyes, <lb/>
            son of Protothyas. These Scythians had driven the Cimme­ <lb/>
            rians out of Europe, and pursuing them into Asia, by that <lb/>
            means entered the territories of the Medes. 104. The distance <lb/>
            from the lake Mæotis to the river Phasis and to Colchis, is a <lb/>
            journey of thirty days to a well-girt man,4 but the route from <lb/>
            Colchis to Media is not long, for there is only one nation, the <lb/>
            Saspires, between them: when one has passed over this, one <lb/>
            finds oneself in Media. The Scythians, however, did not pass <lb/>
            by this way, but turned to the higher road by a much longer <lb/>
            route, having Mount Caucasus on the right,5 and there the <lb/>
            Medes coming to an engagement with the Scythians, and being <lb/>
            worsted in the battle, lost their dominion; but the Scythians <lb/>
            became masters of all Asia. 105. From thence they pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Egypt, and when they reached Palestine in Syria, <lb/>
            Psammitichus, king of Egypt, having met them with pre­ <lb/>
            sents and prayers, diverted them from advancing further. <lb/>
            In their return, however, they came to Ascalon, a city of <lb/>
            Syria, and when most of them had marched through with­ <lb/>
            out doing any injury, some few, who were left behind, pil­ <lb/>
            laged the temple of Celestial Venus. This temple, as I find <lb/>
            by inquiry, is the most ancient of all the temples dedicated <lb/>
            to this goddess: for that in Cyprus was built after this, as <lb/>
            the Cyprians themselves confess; and that in Cythera was <lb/>
            erected by Phoenicians who came from the same part of Syria. <lb/>
            However, the goddess inflicted on the Scythians who robbed <lb/>
            her temple at Ascalon, and on all their posterity, a female <lb/>
            disease; so that the Scythians confess that they are afflicted <lb/>
            with it on this account, and those who visit Scythia may see <lb/>
            in what a state they are whom the Scythians call Enarees <lb/>
            106. For twenty-eight years, then, the Scythians governed <lb/>
            Asia, and every thing was overthrown by their licentiousness <lb/>
            and neglect; for besides the usual tribute, they exacted from <note type="footnote">a See chap. 74. </note><note type="footnote">4 See chap. 72, it. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 See B IV chap. 12, and B. VII. chap. 20. </note> <pb n="48"/>
            <note type="margin"> [107, 108 </note> <lb/>
            each whatever they chose to impose; and. in addition to the <lb/>
            tribute, they rode round the country and plundered them of <lb/>
            all their possessions. Now Cyaxares and the Medes invited <lb/>
            the greatest part of them to a feast, and having made them <lb/>
            drunk, put them to death; and so the Medes recovered their <lb/>
            former power, and all they had possessed before; and they <lb/>
            took Nineveh, (how they took it, I will relate in anothei <lb/>
            work,6) and reduced the Assyrians into subjection, with the ex­ <lb/>
            ception of the Babylonian district. Having accomplished these <lb/>
            things, Cyaxares died, after he had reigned forty years, in­ <lb/>
            cluding the time of the Scythian dominion.</p>
          <p>107. Astyages the son of Cyaxares succeeded him in the <lb/>
            kingdom. He had a daughter, to whom he gave the name of <lb/>
            Mandane. He dreamt that she made so great a quantity of <lb/>
            water, as not only filled his own city, but overflowed all Asia. <lb/>
            And having communicated this dream to those of the Magi <lb/>
            who interpret dreams, he was exceedingly alarmed when in­ <lb/>
            formed by them of every particular; and he afterwards gave <lb/>
            this Mandane, when arrived at a marriageable age, to no one <lb/>
            of the Medes who was worthy of her, through dread of the <lb/>
            vision ; but to a Persian, named Cambyses, whom he found <lb/>
            descended of a good family, and of a peaceful disposition, <lb/>
            deeming him far inferior to a Mede of moderate rank. 108. <lb/>
            In the first year after Mandane was married to Cambyses, <lb/>
            Astyages saw another vision: it appeared to him that a vine <lb/>
            grew up from his daughter's womb, and that the vine covered <lb/>
            all Asia. Having seen this and communicated it to the <lb/>
            interpreters of dreams, he sent to Persia for his daughter, <lb/>
            who was then near her time of delivery; and upon her ar­ <lb/>
            rival lie put her under a guard, resolving to destroy what­ <lb/>
            ever should be born of her; for the Magian interpreters had <lb/>
            signified to him from his vision, that the issue of his daugh­ <lb/>
            ter would reign in his stead. Astyages therefore, guarding <lb/>
            against this, as soon as Cyrus was born, sent for Harpagus, <lb/>
            a kinsman of his, and the most faithful of all the Modes, and <lb/>
            the manager of all his affairs, and said to him, " Harpagus, <lb/>
            on no account fail to perform the business I now charge you <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Several passages of our author seem to prove that Herodotus wrote <lb/>
            other histories than those which have come down to us. In the 184th <lb/>
            chapter of this book he speaks of his Assyrian history; in the 161st of <lb/>
            the 2nd of the Libyan. </note> <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> 109, 110.] </note> <lb/>
            with; nor expose me to danger by deceiving me; nor, by <lb/>
            preferring another, draw ruin upon thy own head. Take the <lb/>
            child that Mandane has given birth to, carry him to your own <lb/>
            house and kill him, and afterwards bury him in whatever way <lb/>
            you think fit." Harpagus answered, " 0 king, you have <lb/>
            never yet observed any ingratitude in me, and I shall take <lb/>
            care never to offend you for the future. If therefore it is <lb/>
            your pleasure that this thing should be done, it is fitting that <lb/>
            I readily obey you." 109. Harpagus, having given this <lb/>
            answer, when the child had been put into his hands, adorned <lb/>
            as if for death, returned home weeping ; and upon his arrival <lb/>
            he told his wife all that Astyages had said. She asked him, <lb/>
            "What then do you purpose to do?" He answered, “ Not <lb/>
            as Astyages has commanded; though he should be yet more <lb/>
            outrageous and mad than he is, I will not comply with his <lb/>
            wishes, nor will I submit to him by performing such a murder: <lb/>
            and for many reasons I will not murder the child; both be­ <lb/>
            cause he is my own relation, and because Astyages is old, and <lb/>
            has no male offspring; besides, if, after his death, the sovereign­ <lb/>
            ty should devolve on this daughter, whose son he would now <lb/>
            murder by my means, what else remains for me but the <lb/>
            greatest danger ? It is necessary, however, for my safety that <lb/>
            the child should die; but as necessary that one of Astyages' <lb/>
            people should be the executioner; and not one of mine." <lb/>
            110. Thus he spoke, and immediately sent a messenger for <lb/>
            one of Astyages' herdsmen, who he knew grazed his cattle on <lb/>
            pastures most convenient for the purpose, and on mountains <lb/>
            abounding with wild beasts. His name was Mitradates, and he <lb/>
            had married his fellow-servant. The name of the woman to <lb/>
            whom he was married, in the language of Greece was Cyno, <lb/>
            and in that of the Medes Spaco, for the Medes call a bitch <lb/>
            Spaca. The foot of the mountains at which this herdsman grazed <lb/>
            his cattle, lies to the north of Ecbatana, towards the Euxine <lb/>
            Sea. For the Medic territory on this side towards the Saspires, <lb/>
            is very mountainous, lofty, and covered with forests ; whereas <lb/>
            all the rest of Media is level. When therefore the herdsman, be­ <lb/>
            ing summoned in great haste, arrived, Harpagus addressed him <lb/>
            as follows : “ Astyages bids thee take this infant, and expose <lb/>
            him on the-bleakest part-of the mountains, that he may <lb/>
            speedily perish; and has charged me to add, that if thou <lb/>
            by any means shouldst save the child, thou shalt die by the <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [111, 112 </note> <lb/>
            most cruel death; and I am appointed to see the child ex­ <lb/>
            posed." 111. The herdsman, having heard these words, took <lb/>
            the infant, returned back by the same way, and reached his <lb/>
            cottage. It so happened that his own wife, whose confinement <lb/>
            had been daily expected, was brought to bed whilst he was ab­ <lb/>
            sent in the city. And each had been in a state of anxiety for <lb/>
            the other; he being alarmed about his wife's delivery; and <lb/>
            the woman, because Harpagus, who had not been accustomed <lb/>
            to do so, had sent for her husband. When he returned and <lb/>
            came up to her, she seeing him thus unexpectedly, first asked <lb/>
            him why Harpagus had sent for him in such haste. “ Wife,” <lb/>
            said he, " when I reached the city, I saw and heard what <lb/>
            I wish I had never seen, nor had ever befallen our masters. <lb/>
            The whole house of Harpagus was filled with lamentations; <lb/>
            I, greatly alarmed, went in, and as soon as I entered, I saw an <lb/>
            infant lying before me, panting and crying, dressed in gold <lb/>
            and a robe of various colours. When Harpagus saw me, he <lb/>
            ordered me to take up the child directly, and carry him away, <lb/>
            and expose him in the part of the mountain most frequented <lb/>
            by wild beasts; telling me at the same time, that it was <lb/>
            Astyages who imposed this task on me, and threatening the <lb/>
            severest punishment if I should fail to do it. I took up the <lb/>
            infant and carried him away, supposing him to belong to <lb/>
            one of the servants; for I had then no suspicion whence he <lb/>
            came; though I was astonished at seeing him dressed in gold <lb/>
            and fine apparel; and also at the sorrow which evidently pre­ <lb/>
            vailed in the house of Harpagus. But soon after, on my way <lb/>
            home, I learnt the whole truth, from a servant who accom­ <lb/>
            panied me out of the city, and delivered the child into my <lb/>
            hands ; that he was born of Mandane, Astyages' daughter, and <lb/>
            of Cambyses son of Cyrus, and that Astyages had commanded <lb/>
            him to be put to death."</p>
          <p>112. As the herdsman uttered these last words, he un­ <lb/>
            covered the child, and showed it to his wife; she seeing that <lb/>
            the child was large and of a beautiful form, embraced the <lb/>
            knees of her husband, and with tears besought him by no <lb/>
            means to expose it. He said that it was impossible to do other­ <lb/>
            wise ; for that spies would come from Harpagus to see the <lb/>
            thing done, and he must himself die the most cruel death if he <lb/>
            should fail to do it... The woman, finding she could not per­ <lb/>
            suade her husband, again addressed him as follows: " Since, <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>113</unclear>, 114.] </note> <lb/>
            then, I cannot persuade you not to expose the child, do this at <lb/>
            least, if it is absolutely necessary that he should be seen ex­ <lb/>
            posed : now I too have been delivered, and delivered of a still­ <lb/>
            born child, then take this and expose it, and let us bring up <lb/>
            the son of Astyages' daughter as our own. Thus you will <lb/>
            neither be convicted of having wronged our masters, nor shall <lb/>
            we have consulted ill for our own interests ; for the child that <lb/>
            is dead will have a royal burial, and the one that survives will <lb/>
            not be deprived of life." 113. The herdsman thought his wife <lb/>
            spoke very much to the purpose under existing circumstances, <lb/>
            and immediately proceeded to act accordingly: the child that lie <lb/>
            had brought for the purpose of putting to death he delivered to <lb/>
            his wife; his own, which was dead, he put into the basket in <lb/>
            which he had brought the other, and having dressed it in all the <lb/>
            finery of the other child, he exposed it in the most desolate part <lb/>
            of the mountains. On the third day after the infant had been <lb/>
            exposed, the herdsman, having left one of his assistants as a <lb/>
            guard, went to the city, and arriving at the house of Harpagus, <lb/>
            told him he was ready to show the dead body of the infant. <lb/>
            Harpagus accordingly sent some of the most trusty of his <lb/>
            guards, and by that means saw the body, and buried the <lb/>
            herdsman's child. Thus this child was buried. The other, <lb/>
            who afterwards had the name of Cyrus, was brought up by <lb/>
            the herdsman’s wife, who gave him some other name, and not <lb/>
            that, of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>114. When the child attained the age of ten years, a <lb/>
            circumstance of the following nature discovered him. He <lb/>
            was playing in the village in which the ox-stalls were, with <lb/>
            boys of his own age, in the road. The boys who were playing <lb/>
            chose this reputed son of the herdsman for their king. But he <lb/>
            appointed some of them to build houses, and others to be his <lb/>
            body-guards ; one of them to be the king's eye, and to an­ <lb/>
            other he gave the office of bringing messages to him, assigning <lb/>
            to each his proper duty. Now one of these boys who was <lb/>
            playing with him, being son of Artembares, a man of rank <lb/>
            among the Modes, refused to obey the orders of Cyrus ; he <lb/>
            therefore commanded the others to seize him, and when they <lb/>
            obeyed, Cyrus scourged the boy very severely. But the boy, <lb/>
            as soon as he was let loose,, considering that he had been <lb/>
            treated with great indignity, took it very much to heart, and <lb/>
            hastening to tlie city, complained to his father of the treas­ <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            <note type="margin"> [115, 116. </note> <lb/>
            ment he had met with from Cyrus, not indeed saying from <lb/>
            Cyrus, (for he was not yet known by that name,) but from <lb/>
            the son of Astyages' herdsman. Artembares, in a transport <lb/>
            of anger, went immediately to Astyages, and taking his son <lb/>
            with him, said that he suffered treatment that was not to be <lb/>
            borne, adding, “ Thus, 0 king, are we insulted by your <lb/>
            slave, the son of a herdsman;” showing the boy's shoulders. <lb/>
            115. Astyages having heard and seen what was done, re­ <lb/>
            solving, on account of the rank of Artembares, to avenge <lb/>
            the indignity offered to the youth, sent for the herdsman and <lb/>
            his son. When both came into his presence, Astyages, look­ <lb/>
            ing upon Cyrus, said, " Have you, who are the son of such a <lb/>
            man as this, dared to treat the son of one of the principal per­ <lb/>
            sons in my kingdom with such indignity ? " But Cyrus answer­ <lb/>
            ed, " Sir, I treated him as I did with justice. For the boys of <lb/>
            our village, of whom he was one, in their play made me their <lb/>
            king, because I appeared to them the most fitted to that office. <lb/>
            Now, all the other boys performed what they were ordered, <lb/>
            but he alone refused to obey, and paid no attention to my com­ <lb/>
            mands ; wherefore he was punished : if then on this account I <lb/>
            am deserving of punishment, here I am ready to submit to <lb/>
            it.- 116. As the boy was speaking thus, Astyages recognised <lb/>
            who he was ; both the character of his face appeared like his <lb/>
            own, and his answer more free than accorded with his con­ <lb/>
            dition ; the time also of the exposure seemed to agree with <lb/>
            the age of the boy. Alarmed at this discovery, he was for <lb/>
            some time speechless ; and at last, having with difficulty re­ <lb/>
            covered himself, (being desirous of sending Artembares away <lb/>
            in order that he might examine the herdsman in private,) he <lb/>
            said, "Artembares, I will take care that neither you nor your <lb/>
            son shall have any cause of complaint." Thus he dismissed <lb/>
            Artembares ; but the servants, at the command of Astyages, <lb/>
            conducted Cyrus into an inner room ; and when the herds­ <lb/>
            man remained' alone, be asked him in the absence of wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, whence he had the boy, and from whose hands he re­ <lb/>
            ceived him ? He affirmed that the boy was his own son, and <lb/>
            that the mother who bore him was still living with him. <lb/>
            Astyages told him, that he did not consult his own safety <lb/>
            in wishing to be put -to the torture; and as he said this he <lb/>
            made a signal to his guards to seize him. The man, when <lb/>
            brought to the torture, discovered the whole matter, and be- <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="117-119.]"/> <lb/>
            ginning from the outset he went through it, speaking the truth <lb/>
            throughout; and concluded with prayers and entreaties for <lb/>
            pardon. 117. Astyages, when the herdsman had confessed the <lb/>
            truth, did not concern himself much about him afterwards ; <lb/>
            but attaching great blame to Harpagus, he ordered his guards <lb/>
            to summon him ; and when Astyages asked, " Harpagus, by <lb/>
            what kind of death did you dispose of the child which I de­ <lb/>
            livered to you, born of my daughter?" Harpagus, seeing <lb/>
            the herdsman present, had not recourse to falsehood, lest he <lb/>
            should be detected and convicted, but said, " 0 king, when I <lb/>
            had received the infant, I carefully considered how I could act <lb/>
            according to your wish and command, and, without offending <lb/>
            you, I might be free from the crime of murder both in your <lb/>
            daughter's sight and in yours. I therefore acted as follows <lb/>
            having sent for this herdsman I gave him the child, saying <lb/>
            that you had commanded him to put it to death; and in say­ <lb/>
            ing this I did not speak falsely, for such indeed were your <lb/>
            orders. In this manner I delivered the infant to him, charging <lb/>
            him to place it in some desert mountain, and to stay and <lb/>
            watch till the child was dead, threatening the severest pun­ <lb/>
            ishment if he should not fully carry out these injunctions. <lb/>
            When he had executed these orders, and the child was dead, I <lb/>
            sent some of the most trusty of my eunuchs, and by means <lb/>
            of them beheld the body, and buried it. This is the whole <lb/>
            truth, 0 king, and such was the fate of the child."</p>
          <p>118. Thus Harpagus told the real truth; but Astyages, <lb/>
            dissembling the anger which he felt on account of what had <lb/>
            been done, again related to Harpagus the whole matter as he <lb/>
            had heard it from the herdsman ; and afterwards, when he had <lb/>
            repeated it throughout, he ended by saying that the child was <lb/>
            alive and all was well. "For," he added, "I suffered much <lb/>
            on account of what had been done regarding this child, and <lb/>
            could not easily bear the reproaches of my daughter; there­ <lb/>
            fore since fortune has taken a more favourable turn, do you, <lb/>
            in the first place, send your own son to accompany the boy I <lb/>
            have recovered; and, in the next place, (for I purpose to offer <lb/>
            a sacrifice for the preservation of the child to the gods, to <lb/>
            whom that honour is due,) do you be with me at supper." <lb/>
            119. Harpagus, on hearing these words, when he had paid <lb/>
            his homage, and had congratulated himself that his fault <lb/>
            had turned to so good account, and that he was invited to <pb n="54"/>
            <note type="margin"> [120 </note> <lb/>
            the feast under such auspicious circumstances, went to his <lb/>
            own home. And as soon as he entered he sent his only son, <lb/>
            who was about thirteen years of age, and bade him go to <lb/>
            Astyages, and do whatever he should command ; and then, <lb/>
            being full of joy, he told his wife what had happened. But <lb/>
            when the son of Harpagus arrived, having slain him and cut <lb/>
            him into joints, Astyages roasted some parts of his flesh and <lb/>
            boiled others, and having had them well dressed, kept them in <lb/>
            readiness. At the appointed hour, when the other guests and <lb/>
            Harpagus were come, tables full of mutton were placed be­ <lb/>
            fore the rest and Astyages himself, but before Harpagus all <lb/>
            the body of his son, except the head, the hands, and the feet; <lb/>
            these were laid apart in a basket covered over. When <lb/>
            Harpagus seemed to have eaten enough, Astyages asked him <lb/>
            if he was pleased with the entertainment; and when Harpagus <lb/>
            replied that he was highly delighted, the officers appointed <lb/>
            for the purpose brought him the head of his son covered up <lb/>
            with the hands and feet, and standing before Harpagus, they <lb/>
            bade him uncover the basket and take what he chose. Har­ <lb/>
            pagus doing as they desired, and uncovering the basket, saw <lb/>
            the remains of his son's body, but he expressed no alarm at <lb/>
            the sight, and retained his presence of mind; whereupon <lb/>
            Astyages asked him if he knew of what animal he had been <lb/>
            eating. He said he knew very well, and that whatever a king <lb/>
            did was agreeable to him. After he had given this answer he <lb/>
            gathered the remains of the flesh and went home, purposing, <lb/>
            as I conjecture, to collect all he could and bury it.</p>
          <p>120. Astyages thus punished Harpagus; and then con­ <lb/>
            sidering what he should do with Cyrus, summoned the Magi, <lb/>
            who had formerly interpreted his dream. When they were <lb/>
            come, Astyages asked them in what way they had interpreted <lb/>
            his vision. They gave the same answer as before; and said, that <lb/>
            if the boy was still alive, and had not already died, he must of <lb/>
            necessity be king. He answered them as follows: " The boy <lb/>
            is and still survives, and while living in the country, the boys <lb/>
            of the village made him king, and he has already performed <lb/>
            all such things as kings really do, for he has appointed guards, <lb/>
            door-Keepers, messengers, and all other things in like manner; <lb/>
            and now I desire to know, to what do these things appear to <lb/>
            you to tend.” The Magi answered, " If the boy be living, <lb/>
            and has already been a king by no settled plan, you may take <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="margin"> 121, 122.] </note> <lb/>
            courage on his account and make your mind easy, for he will <lb/>
            not reign a second time. For some of our predictions termi­ <lb/>
            nate in trifling results; and dreams, and things like them, are <lb/>
            fulfilled by slight events." To this Astyages replied, " I too, <lb/>
            0 Magi, am very much of the same opinion, that since the <lb/>
            child has been named king, the dream is accomplished, and <lb/>
            that the boy is no longer an object of alarm to me ; yet con­ <lb/>
            sider well, and carefully weigh what will be the safest course <lb/>
            for my family and yourselves." The Magi answered, "0 <lb/>
            king, it is of great importance to us that your empire should <lb/>
            be firmly established, for otherwise it is alienated, passing <lb/>
            over to this boy, who is a Persian, and we, who are Modes, <lb/>
            shall be enslaved by Persians, and held in no account as being <lb/>
            foreigners; whereas while you, who are of our own country, <lb/>
            are king, we have a share in the government, and enjoy great <lb/>
            honours at your hands. Thus, then, we must on every ac­ <lb/>
            count provide for your safety and that of your government; <lb/>
            and now, if we saw any thing to occasion alarm we should tell <lb/>
            you of it beforehand ; but now, since the dream has issued in <lb/>
            a trifling event, we ourselves take courage, and advise you to <lb/>
            do the like, and to send the boy out of your sight to- his <lb/>
            parents in Persia." 121. When, therefore, Astyages heard' <lb/>
            this he was both delighted, and, having called for Cyrus, <lb/>
            said to him, " Child, I have been unjust to you, by reason of <lb/>
            a vain dream ; but you survive by your own destiny. Now <lb/>
            go in happiness to Persia, and I will send an escort to attend <lb/>
            you : when you arrive there you will find a father and mo-' <lb/>
            ther very different from the herdsman Mitradates and his <lb/>
            wife."</p>
          <p>122. Astyages, having spoken thus, sent Cyrus away, <lb/>
            and, upon his arrival at the house of Cambyses, his parents <lb/>
            received him ; and having received him, when they heard <lb/>
            who he was they embraced him with the greatest tenderness, <lb/>
            having been assured that he had died immediately after his <lb/>
            birth ; and they inquired of him by what means his life had <lb/>
            been preserved. He told them, saying, that before he knew <lb/>
            not, but had been very much mistaken ; however, that on <lb/>
            his road he had heard the whole case ; for that till that time <lb/>
            he believed he was the son of Astyages' herdsman. He re­ <lb/>
            lated that he had been brought up by the herdsman’s wife ; <lb/>
            and he went on constantly praising her; and Cyno was the <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="margin">[123, 124. </note> <lb/>
            chief subject of his talk. His parents having taken up this <lb/>
            name, (in order that the Persians might suppose that the <lb/>
            child was somewhat miraculously preserved for them,) spread <lb/>
            about a report, that a bitch had nourished him when exposed : <lb/>
            hence this report was propagated. 123. When Cyrus had <lb/>
            reached man's estate, and proved the most manly and beloved <lb/>
            of his equals in age, Harpagus paid great court to him, <lb/>
            sending him presents, from his desire to be avenged on As­ <lb/>
            tyages ; for he did not see that he himself, who was but a <lb/>
            private man, could be able to take vengeance on Astyages; <lb/>
            perceiving, therefore, that Cyrus was growing up to be his <lb/>
            avenger, he contracted a friendship with him, comparing the <lb/>
            sufferings of Cyrus with his own. And before this he had <lb/>
            made the following preparations. Seeing Astyages severe <lb/>
            in his treatment of the Medes, Harpagus, holding intercourse <lb/>
            with the chief persons of the nation, one after another, per­ <lb/>
            suaded them that they ought to place him at their head, <lb/>
            and depose Astyages. When he had effected his purpose <lb/>
            in this respect, and all was ready, Harpagus, wishing to dis­ <lb/>
            cover his designs to Cyrus, who resided in Persia, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing no other way left, because the roads were all guarded, <lb/>
            contrived the following artifice. Having cunningly con­ <lb/>
            trived a hare, by opening its belly, and tearing off none of <lb/>
            the hair, he put a letter, containing what he thought neces­ <lb/>
            sary to write, into the body ; and having sewed up the belly <lb/>
            of the hare, he gave it with some nets to the most trusty <lb/>
            of his servants, dressed as a hunter, and sent him to Persia ; <lb/>
            having by word of mouth commanded him to bid Cyrus, as <lb/>
            he gave him the hare, to open it with his own hand, and not <lb/>
            to suffer any one to be present when he did so. 124. This <lb/>
            was accordingly done, and Cyrus having received the hare, <lb/>
            opened it ; and finding the letter which was in it, he read <lb/>
            it ; and it was to the following purport : " Son of Cam­ <lb/>
            byses, seeing the gods watch over you, (for otherwise you <lb/>
            could never have arrived at your present fortune,) do you <lb/>
            now avenge yourself on your murderer Astyages ; for as <lb/>
            far as regards his purpose you are long since dead, but by <lb/>
            the care of the gods and of me you survive. I suppose you <lb/>
            have been long since informed both what was done regard­ <lb/>
            ing yourself, and what I suffered at the hands of Astyages <lb/>
            because I did not put you to death, but gave you to the <pb n="57"/>
             <note type="margin">125, 126.] </note> <lb/>
            herdsman. If, then, you will follow my counsel, you shall <lb/>
            rule over the whole territory that Astyages now governs. <lb/>
            Persuade the Persians to revolt, and invade Media; and <lb/>
            whether I or any other illustrious Mede be appointed to com­ <lb/>
            mand the army opposed to you, every thing will turn out as <lb/>
            you wish; for they, on the first onset, having revolted from <lb/>
            him, and siding with you, will endeavour to depose him. <lb/>
            Since, then, every thing is ready here, do as I advise, and do <lb/>
            it quickly."</p>
          <p>125. Cyrus, having received this intelligence, began to <lb/>
            consider by what measures he could best persuade the Persians <lb/>
            to revolt; and after mature consideration, he fixed upon the <lb/>
            following as the most proper ; and accordingly he put it in <lb/>
            practice. Having written such a letter as he thought fit, he <lb/>
            called an assembly of the Persians, and then, having opened <lb/>
            the letter and read it, he said that Astyages had appointed <lb/>
            him general of the Persians : " Now," he continued, " I re­ <lb/>
            quire you to attend me, every man with a sickle." Cyrus <lb/>
            then issued such an order. Now the Persians are divided into <lb/>
            many tribes; and some of them Cyrus assembled together, <lb/>
            and persuaded to revolt from the Medes ; these are they upon <lb/>
            whom the rest of the Persians are dependent: the Pasargadæ, <lb/>
            the Maraphians, and the Maspians : of these the Pasargadæ are <lb/>
            the most noble ; among them is the family of the Achæmenidæ, <lb/>
            from which the kings of Persia are descended. The rest are <lb/>
            as follows : the Panthialæans, the Derusiæans, and the Ger­ <lb/>
            manians ; these are all husbandmen : the rest are pastoral; <lb/>
            Daians, Mardians, Dropicians, and Sagartians. 126. When <lb/>
            all were come with their sickles, as had been ordered, Cy­ <lb/>
            rus selected a tract of land in Persia, which was overgrown <lb/>
            with briers, and about eighteen or twenty stadia square, <lb/>
            and directed them to clear it during the day: when the <lb/>
            Persians had finished the appointed task, he next told them <lb/>
            to come again on the next day, having first washed them­ <lb/>
            selves. In the mean time Cyrus, having collected together <lb/>
            all his father's flocks and herds, had them killed and dress <lb/>
            ed, as purposing to entertain the Persian forces, and he <lb/>
            provided wine and bread in abundance. The next day, <lb/>
            when the Persians were assembled, he made them lie down <lb/>
            on the turf, and feasted them; and after the repast was over, <lb/>
            Cyrus asked them whether the treatment they had received <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[127-12"/> <lb/>
            the day before, or the present, were preferable. They an­ <lb/>
            swered, that the difference was great; for on the preceding <lb/>
            day they had every hardship, but on the present every thing <lb/>
            that was good. Cyrus therefore having received this answer, <lb/>
            discovered his intentions, and said, " Men of Persia, the case <lb/>
            stands thus; if you will hearken to me, you may enjoy these, <lb/>
            and numberless other advantages, without any kind of servile <lb/>
            labour; but if you will not hearken to me, innumerable hard­ <lb/>
            ships, like those of yesterday, await you. Now, therefore, obey <lb/>
            me, and be free; for I am persuaded I am born by divine <lb/>
            providence to undertake this work; and I deem you to be <lb/>
            men in no way inferior to the Medes, either in other respects <lb/>
            or in war: since then these things are so, revolt with all <lb/>
            speed from Astyages."</p>
          <p>127. The Persians then having obtained a leader, gladly <lb/>
            asserted their freedom, having for a long time felt indig­ <lb/>
            nant at being governed by the Medes. Astyages, being <lb/>
            informed of what Cyrus was doing, sent a messenger and <lb/>
            summoned him ; but Cyrus bade the messenger take back <lb/>
            word, " that he would come to him sooner than Astyages <lb/>
            desired." When Astyages heard this, he armed all the Modes ; <lb/>
            and, as if the gods had deprived him of understanding, made <lb/>
            Harpagus their general, utterly forgetting the outrage he had <lb/>
            done him. And when the Medes came to an engagement with <lb/>
            the Persians, such of them as knew nothing of the plot, fought; <lb/>
            but others went over to the Persians ; and the far greater <lb/>
            part purposely behaved as cowards and fled. 128. The army <lb/>
            of the Medes being thus shamefully dispersed, as soon as the <lb/>
            news was brought to Astyages, he exclaimed, threatening <lb/>
            Cyrus, "Not even so shall Cyrus have occasion to rejoice." <lb/>
            Having so said, he first impaled the Magi, who had interpreted <lb/>
            his dream, and advised him to let Cyrus go ; then he armed all <lb/>
            the Medes that were left in the city, both old and young ; and <lb/>
            leading them out, he engaged the Persians, and was defeated. <lb/>
            Astyages himself was made prisoner, and he lost all the Medes <lb/>
            whom he had led out. 129. Harpagus, standing by Astyages <lb/>
            after he was taken, exulted over him and jeered him; and <lb/>
            among other galling words, he asked him also about the supper, <lb/>
            at which he had feasted him with his son's flesh, and inquired <lb/>
            " how he liked slavery in exchange for a kingdom." Astyages <lb/>
            looking stedfastly on Harpagus, asked in return, whether he <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="margin"> 130 131.] </note> <lb/>
            thought himself the author of Cyrus s success. Harpagus <lb/>
            said, he did, for, as he had written, the achievement was <lb/>
            justly due to himself. Astyages thereupon proved him to be <lb/>
            " the weakest and most unjust of all men: the weakest, in <lb/>
            giving the kingdom to another, which he might have assumed <lb/>
            to himself, if indeed he had'effected this change; and the <lb/>
            most unjust, because he had enslaved the Medes on account <lb/>
            of the supper. For if it were absolutely necessary to transfer <lb/>
            the kingdom to some one else, and not to take it himself, lie <lb/>
            might with more justice have conferred this benefit on some <lb/>
            one of the Medes than on a Persian : whereas now the Medes, <lb/>
            who were not at all in fault, had become slaves instead of <lb/>
            masters; and the Persians, who before were slaves to the <lb/>
            Medes, had now become their masters."</p>
          <p>130. So Astyages, after he had reigned thirty-five years, <lb/>
            was thus deposed; and by reason of his cruelty the Medes <lb/>
            bent under the Persian yoke, after they had ruled over <lb/>
            all Asia beyond the river Halys for the space of one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and twenty-eight years,7 excepting the interval of the <lb/>
            Scythian dominion. At a later period, however, they re­ <lb/>
            pented of what they had done, and revolted from Darius, but <lb/>
            being conquered in battle, were again subdued: but now in <lb/>
            the time of Astyages, the Persians, under the conduct of <lb/>
            Cyrus, having risen against the Medes, have from that time <lb/>
            been masters of Asia. As for Astyages, Cyrus kept him <lb/>
            with him till he died, without doing him any further injury. <lb/>
            Cyrus therefore, having been thus born and educated, came <lb/>
            to the throne; and after these events he conquered Croesus, <lb/>
            - who gave the first provocation, as I have already related, and <lb/>
            having subdued him, he became master of all Asia.</p>
          <p>131. The Persians, according to my own knowledge, ob­ <lb/>
            serve the following customs. It is not their practice to erect <lb/>
            statues, or temples, or altars, but they charge those with folly <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> [132, 133. </note> <lb/>
              who do so; because, as I conjecture, they do not think the <lb/>
              gods have human forms, as the Greeks do. They are accus­ <lb/>
              tomed to ascend the highest parts of the mountains, and offer <lb/>
              sacrifice to Jupiter, and they call the whole circle of the hea­ <lb/>
              vens by the name of Jupiter. They sacrifice to the sun and <lb/>
              moon, to the earth, fire, water, and the winds. To these alone <lb/>
              they have sacrificed from the earliest times: but they have <lb/>
              since learnt from the Arabians and Assyrians to sacrifice to <lb/>
              Venus Urania, whom the Assyrians call Venus Mylitta, the <lb/>
              Arabians, Alitta, and the Persians, Mitra. 132. The fol­ <lb/>
              lowing is the established mode of sacrifice to the above- <lb/>
              mentioned deities: they do not erect altars nor kindle fires <lb/>
              when about to sacrifice; they do not use libations, or flutes, <lb/>
              or fillets, or cakes; but, when any one wishes to offer sa­ <lb/>
              crifice to any one of these deities, he leads the victim to a <lb/>
              clean spot, and invokes the god, usually having his tiara <lb/>
              decked with myrtle. He that sacrifices is not permitted to <lb/>
              pray for blessings for himself alone; but he is obliged to offer <lb/>
              prayers for the prosperity of all the Persians, and the king, <lb/>
              for he is himself included in the Persians. When he has cut <lb/>
              the victim into small pieces, and boiled the flesh, he strews <lb/>
              under it a bed of tender grass, generally trefoil, and then lays <lb/>
              all the flesh upon it: when he has put every thing in order, <lb/>
              one of the Magi standing by sings an ode concerning the <lb/>
              original of the gods, which they say is the incantation ; and <lb/>
              without one of the Magi it is not lawful for them to sacrifice. <lb/>
              After having waited a short time, he that has sacrificed <lb/>
              carries away the flesh and disposes of it as he thinks fit. <lb/>
              133. It is their custom to honour their birth-day above <lb/>
              all other days; and on this day they furnish their table in <lb/>
              a more plentiful manner than at other times. The rich then <lb/>
              produce an ox, a horse, a camel, and an ass, roasted whole in <lb/>
              an oven ; but the poor produce smaller cattle. They are mo­ <lb/>
              derate at their meals, but eat of many after dishes, and those <lb/>
              not served up together. On this account the Persians say, <lb/>
              “that the Greeks rise hungry from table, because nothing <lb/>
              worth mentioning is brought in after dinner, and that if any <lb/>
              thing were brought in, they would not leave off eating." The <lb/>
              Persians are much addicted to wine; they are not allowed to <lb/>
              vomit or make water in presence of another. These customs <lb/>
              are observed to this day. They are used to debate the most <pb n="61"/>
              <note type="correspondsTo" n="134—136. ]"/> <lb/>
              important affairs when intoxicated ; but whatever they <lb/>
              have determined on in such deliberations, is on the following <lb/>
              day, when they are sober, proposed to them by the master <lb/>
              cf the house where they have met to consult; and if they <lb/>
              approve of it when sober also, then they adopt it ; if not, they <lb/>
              reject it. And whatever they have first resolved on when <lb/>
              sober, they reconsider when intoxicated. 134. When they <lb/>
              meet one another in the streets, one may discover by the <lb/>
              following custom, whether those who meet are equals. For <lb/>
              instead of accosting 'one another, they kiss on the mouth; <lb/>
              if one be a little inferior to the other, they kiss the cheek; <lb/>
              but if he be of a much lower rank, he prostrates himself <lb/>
              before the other. They honour, above all, those who live <lb/>
              nearest to themselves ; in the second degree, those that are <lb/>
              second in nearness ; and after that, as they go further off, <lb/>
              they honour in proportion ; and least of all they honour those <lb/>
              who live at the greatest distance ; esteeming themselves to be <lb/>
              by far the most excellent of men in every respect; and that <lb/>
              others make approaches to excellence according to the fore­ <lb/>
              going gradations, but that they are the worst who live <lb/>
              farthest from them.. During the empire of the Medes, each <lb/>
              nation ruled over its next neighbour, the Medes over all, and <lb/>
              especially over those that were nearest to them ; these again, <lb/>
              over the bordering people, and the last in like manner over <lb/>
              their' next neighbours ; and in the same gradations the Per­ <lb/>
              sians honour ; for that nation went on extending its govern­ <lb/>
              ment and guardianship. 135. The Persians are of all na­ <lb/>
              tions most ready to adopt foreign customs; for they wear <lb/>
              the Medic costume, thinking it handsomer than their own; <lb/>
              and in war they use the Egyptian cuirass. And they <lb/>
              practise all kinds of indulgences with which they become <lb/>
              acquainted; amongst others, they have learnt from the <lb/>
              Greeks a passion for boys: they marry, each of them, <lb/>
              many wives ; and keep a still greater number of concu­ <lb/>
              bines. 136. Next to bravery in battle, this is considered <lb/>
              the greatest proof of manliness, to be able to exhibit many <lb/>
              children ; and to such as can exhibit the greatest number, <lb/>
              the king sends presents every year ; for numbers are consi­ <lb/>
              dered strength. Beginning from the age of five years <lb/>
              twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only;. to ride, <lb/>
              to use the bon, and to speak truth. Before he is five years <pb n="62"/>
              <note type="correspondsTo" n="[137-140"/> <lb/>
              of age, a son is not admitted to the presence of his father, but <lb/>
              lives entirely with the women : the reason of this custom is, <lb/>
              that if he should die in childhood, he may occasion no grief <lb/>
              to his father.</p>
          <p>137. Now I much approve of the above custom, as also of <lb/>
            the following, that not even the king is allowed to put any one <lb/>
            to death for a single crime, nor any private Persian exercise <lb/>
            extreme severity against any of his domestics for one fault, but <lb/>
            if on examination he should find that his misdeeds are more <lb/>
            numerous and greater than his services, he may in that case <lb/>
            give vent to his anger. They say that no one ever yet killed <lb/>
            his own father or mother, but whenever such things have hap­ <lb/>
            pened they affirm, that if the matter were thoroughly searched <lb/>
            into, they would be found to have been committed by suppo­ <lb/>
            sititious children or those born in adultery, for they hold it <lb/>
            utterly improbable that a true father should be murdered by <lb/>
            his own son. 138. They are not allowed even to mention the <lb/>
            things which it is not lawful for them to do. To tell a lie is <lb/>
            considered by them the greatest disgrace ; next to that, to be <lb/>
            in debt; and this for many other reasons, but especially because <lb/>
            they think that one who is in debt must of necessity tell lies. <lb/>
            Whosoever of the citizens has the leprosy or scrofula, is not <lb/>
            permitted to stay within a town, nor to have communication <lb/>
            with other Persians ; and they say that from having committed <lb/>
            some offence against the sun a man is afflicted with these dis­ <lb/>
            eases. Every stranger that is seized with these distempers <lb/>
            many of them even drive out of the country; and they do the <lb/>
            same to white pigeons, making the same charge against them. <lb/>
            They neither make water, nor spit, nor wash their hands in a <lb/>
            river, nor defile the stream with urine, nor do they allow any <lb/>
            one else to do so, but they pay extreme veneration to all <lb/>
            rivers. 139. Another circumstance is also peculiar to them, <lb/>
            which has escaped the notice of the Persians themselves, but <lb/>
            not of us. Their names, which correspond with their personal <lb/>
            forms and their rank, all terminate in the same letter which <lb/>
            the Dorians call San, and the Ionians Sigma And if you <lb/>
            inquire into this you will find, that all Persian names, with­ <lb/>
            out exception, end in the same letter. 140. These things 1 <lb/>
            can with certainty affirm to be true, since I myself know them. <lb/>
            But what follows, relating to the dead, is only secretly men­ <lb/>
            tioned and not openly ; viz. that the dead body of a Persian is <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="145-142.] "/>never buried until it has been torn by some bird or dog; but <lb/>
            I know for a certainty that the Magi do this, for they do it <lb/>
            openly. The Persians then, having covered the body with <lb/>
            wax, conceal it in the ground. The Magi differ very much <lb/>
            from all other men, and particularly from the Egyptian priests, <lb/>
            for the latter hold it matter of religion not to kill any thing <lb/>
            that has life, except such things as they offer in sacrifice; <lb/>
            whereas the Magi kill every thing with their own hands, <lb/>
            except a dog or a man; and they think they do a meritorious <lb/>
            thing, when they kill ants, serpents, and other reptiles and <lb/>
            birds. And with regard to this custom, let it remain as it ex­ <lb/>
            isted from the first. I will now return to my former subject.</p>
          <p>141. The Ionians and Æolians, as soon as the Lydians <lb/>
            were subdued by the Persians, sent ambassadors to Cyrus at <lb/>
            Sardis, wishing to become subject to him, on the same terms <lb/>
            As they had been to Crœsus. But he, when he heard their <lb/>
            proposal, told them this story : " A piper seeing some fishes <lb/>
            in the sea, began to pipe, expecting that they would come to <lb/>
            shore; but finding his hopes disappointed, he took a casting­ <lb/>
            net, and enclosed a great number of fishes, and drew them out. <lb/>
            When he saw them leaping about, he said to the fishes, ' Cease <lb/>
            your dancing, since when I. piped you would not come out and <lb/>
            dance.'" Cyrus told this story to the Ionians and Æolians, <lb/>
            because the Ionians, when Cyrus pressed them by his ambas­ <lb/>
            sador to revolt from Croesus, refused to consent, and now, <lb/>
            when the business was done, were ready to listen to him. He, <lb/>
            therefore, under the influence, of anger, gave them this an­ <lb/>
            swer. But the Ionians, when they heard this message brought <lb/>
            back to their cities, severally fortified themselves with walls, <lb/>
            and met together at the Panionium, with the exception of the <lb/>
            Milesians ; for Cyrus made an alliance with them only, on <lb/>
            the same terms as the Lydians had done. The rest of the <lb/>
            Ionians resolved unanimously to send ambassadors to Sparta, <lb/>
            to implore them to succour the Ionians. 142. These Ionians, <lb/>
            to whom the Panionium belongs, have built their cities under <lb/>
            the finest sky and climate of the world that we know of; for <lb/>
            neither the regions that are above it, nor those that are below, <lb/>
            nor the parts to the east or west, are at all equal to Ionia ; <lb/>
            for some of them are oppressed by cold and rain, others by <lb/>
            heat and drought. These Ionians do not all use the same lan­ <lb/>
            guage, but have four varieties of dialect. Miletus, the first <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin"> <unclear>40</unclear></note><lb/>
             <lb/>
            of them, lies towards the south ; next are Myus and Priene <lb/>
            these are situate in Caria, and use the same dialect. The <lb/>
            following are in Lydia; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, <lb/>
            Clazomenæ, Phocæa: these cities do not at all agree with <lb/>
            those before mentioned in their language, but they speak a <lb/>
            dialect common to themselves. There are three remaining <lb/>
            of the Ionian cities, of which two inhabit islands, Samoa <lb/>
            and Chios ; and one, Erythræ, is situated on the continent. <lb/>
            Now the Chians and Erythræans use the same dialect, but the <lb/>
            Samians have one peculiar to themselves. And these are <lb/>
            the four different forms of language.</p>
          <p>143. Of these Ionians, the Milesians were sheltered from <lb/>
            danger, as they had made an alliance. The islanders also <lb/>
            had nothing to fear; for the Phœnicians were not yet sub­ <lb/>
            ject to the Persians, nor were the Persians themselves at <lb/>
            all acquainted with maritime affairs. Now the Milesians <lb/>
            had seceded from the rest of the Ionians only for this reason, <lb/>
            that weak as the Grecian race then was, the Ionian was weakest <lb/>
            of all, and of least account ; for except Athens, there was no <lb/>
            other city of note. The other Ionians, therefore, and the <lb/>
            Athenians shunned the name, and would not be called Io­ <lb/>
            nians ; and even now many of them appear to me to be <lb/>
            ashamed of the name. But these twelve cities gloried in the <lb/>
            name, and built a temple for their own use, to which they <lb/>
            gave the name of Panionium ; and they resolved not to com­ <lb/>
            municate privileges to any other of the Ionians ; nor indeed <lb/>
            have any others, except the Smyrnæans, desired to participate <lb/>
            in them. 144. In the same manner, the Dorians of the <lb/>
            present Pentapolis, which was before called Hexapolis, take <lb/>
            care not to admit any of the neighbouring Dorians into the <lb/>
            temple at Triopium, but excluded from participation such of <lb/>
            their own community as have violated the sacred laws. For <lb/>
            in the games in honour of Triopian Apollo, they formerly gave <lb/>
            brazen tripods to the victors; and it was usual for those who <lb/>
            gained them not to carry them out of the temple, but to dedi­ <lb/>
            cate them there to the god : however, a man of Halicarnassus, <lb/>
            whose name was Agasicles, having won the prize, disregarded <lb/>
            their custom, and carrying away the tripod hung it up in his <lb/>
            own house ; for this offence, the five cities, Lindus, Ialyssus, <lb/>
            Cameirus, Cos, and Cnidus, excluded the sixth city, IIalicar­ <lb/>
            nassus, from participation ; on them. therefore, they imposed <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="145-147.]"/> <lb/>
            this punishment. 145. The Ionians appear to me to have <lb/>
            formed themselves into twelve cities, and to have refused to <lb/>
            admit more, for the following reason, because when they dwelt <lb/>
            in Peloponnesus there were twelve divisions of them, as now <lb/>
            there are twelve divisions of the Achaeans, who drove out the <lb/>
            Ionians. Pellene is the first towards Sicyon; next Ægyra <lb/>
            and Æge, in which is the ever-flowing river Crathis, from <lb/>
            which the river in Italy derived its name; then Bura and <lb/>
            Helice, to which the Ionians fled when they were defeated <lb/>
            by the Achæans; Ægium, Rhypes, Patrees, Pharees, and <lb/>
            Olenus, in which is the great river Pirus; lastly Dyma and <lb/>
            Tritæes, the only inland places among them. 146. These now <lb/>
            are the twelve divisions of the Achæans, which formerly be­ <lb/>
            longed to the Ionians; and on that account the Ionians erected <lb/>
            twelve cities. For to say that these are more properly Ionians, <lb/>
            or of more noble origin than other Ionians, would be great <lb/>
            folly; since the Abantes from Eubœa, who had no connexion <lb/>
            even in name with Ionia, are no inconsiderable part of this <lb/>
            colony; and Minyan-Orchomenians are intermixed with <lb/>
            them, and Cadmæans, Dryopians, Phocians, (who separated <lb/>
            themselves from the rest of their countrymen,) and Molossians, <lb/>
            Pelasgians of Arcadia, Dorian Epidaurians, and many other <lb/>
            people, are intermixed with them ; and those of them who set <lb/>
            out from the Prytaneum of Athens, and who deem themselves <lb/>
            the most noble of the Ionians, brought no wives with them <lb/>
            when they came to settle in this country, but seized a number <lb/>
            of Carian women, after they had killed their men : and on ac­ <lb/>
            count of this massacre these women established a law and <lb/>
            imposed on themselves an oath, and transmitted it to their <lb/>
            daughters, that they would never eat with their husbands, nor <lb/>
            ever call them by the name of husband; because they had <lb/>
            killed their fathers, their husbands, and their children, and <lb/>
            then after so doing had forced them to become their wives. <lb/>
            This was done in Miletus. 147. The Ionians appointed kings <lb/>
            to govern them; some choosing Lycians, of the posterity <lb/>
            of Glaucus son of Hippolochus ; others Cauconian Pylians, de­ <lb/>
            scended from Codrus son of Melanthus; others again from <lb/>
            both those families. However, they are more attached to the <lb/>
            name of Ionians than any others ; let it be allowed then that <lb/>
            -they are genuine Ionians: still, all are Ionians, who derive <lb/>
            their original from Athens, and celebrate the Apaturian <lb/>
            F <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[148—151."/> <lb/>
            festival; but all do so except the Ephesians and Colophonians ; <lb/>
            for these alone do not celebrate the Apaturian festival, on <lb/>
            some pretext of a murder. 148. The Panionium is a sacred <lb/>
            place in Mycale, looking to the north, and by the Ionians con <lb/>
            secrated in common to Heliconian Neptune; and Mycale is a <lb/>
            headland on the continent, stretching westward towards Samos. <lb/>
            At this place the Ionians, assembling from the various cities, <lb/>
            were accustomed to celebrate the festival to which they gave <lb/>
            the name of Panionia ; and not only do the festivals of the <lb/>
            Ionians, but all the festivals of all the Greeks terminate, like <lb/>
            the Persian names,8 in the same letter. These then are the <lb/>
            Ionian cities.</p>
          <p>149. The following are the Æolian; Cyme, called also <lb/>
            Phriconis, Larissæ, Neon-teichos, Temnos, Cilia, Notium, <lb/>
            Ægiroessa, Pitane. Ægææ, Myrina, and Grynia : these are <lb/>
            eleven of the ancient cities of the Æolians ; for one of them, <lb/>
            Smyrna, was taken away from them by the Ionians ; for they <lb/>
            too had twelve cities on the continent. These Æolians have <lb/>
            settled in a more fertile country than the Ionians, but not <lb/>
            equal in climate. 150. The Æolians lost Smyrna in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner. They received into their city certain Colo­ <lb/>
            phonians, who were unsuccessful in a sedition and driven from <lb/>
            their country. But some time after, the Colophonian exiles, <lb/>
            having watched the opportunity while the Smyrnæans were <lb/>
            celebrating'a festival to Bacchus outside the walls, shut to the <lb/>
            gates, and seized the city. But when all the Æolians came <lb/>
            to the assistance of the Smyrnæans, an agreement was made, <lb/>
            that the Ionians should restore the moveable property, and <lb/>
            that the Æolians should abandon Smyrna. When the Smyr­ <lb/>
            naeans did this, the other eleven cities distributed them amongst <lb/>
            themselves and gave them the privilege of citizens. 151. <lb/>
            These then are the Æolian cities on the continent; besides <lb/>
            those settled on Mount Ida; for these are altogether distinct. <lb/>
            But of those that occupy islands, five cities are situated in <lb/>
            Lesbos ; for the sixth in Lesbos, Arisba, the Methymnæans re­ <lb/>
            duced to slavery, although they were of kindred blood ; one <lb/>
            city is situated in Tenedos ; and another in what are called the <lb/>
            I Hundred Islands. Accordingly the Lesbians and Tenedians, . <lb/>
            as well as the Ionians of the Islands, had nothing to fear; but <note type="footnote"><unclear/>* See ch. 130.</note> <pb n="67"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="152-154.]"/><lb/>
            <lb/>
            all the other cities resolved with one accord to follow the <lb/>
            Ionians, wherever they should lead the way.</p>
          <p>152. When the ambassadors of the Ionians and Æolians <lb/>
            arrived at Sparta, (for this was done with all possible speedy <lb/>
            they made choice of a Phocæan, whose name was Pythermus. <lb/>
            to speak in behalf of all; he then, having put on a purple robe, <lb/>
            in order that as many as possible of the Spartans might hear <lb/>
            of it and assemble, and having stood forward, addressed them <lb/>
            at length, imploring their assistance. But the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            would not listen to him, and determined not to assist the <lb/>
            lonians: they therefore returned home. Nevertheless the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, though they had rejected the Ionian ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, despatched men in a penteconter, as I conjecture, to <lb/>
            keep an eye upon the affairs of Cyrus and Ionia. These men <lb/>
            arriving in Phocaea, sent the most eminent person among them, <lb/>
            whose name was Lacrines, to Sardis, to warn Cyrus in the <lb/>
            name of the Lacedæmonians, " not to injure any city on the <lb/>
            Grecian territory, for in that case they would not pass it by <lb/>
            unnoticed." 153. When the herald gave this message, it is <lb/>
            related that Cyrus inquired of the Grecians who were present, <lb/>
            who the Lacedæmonians were, and how many in number, that <lb/>
            they sent him such a warning. And when informed, he said <lb/>
            to the Spartan herald, "I was never yet afraid of those, who in <lb/>
            the midst of their city have a place set apart, in which they <lb/>
            collect and cheat one another by false oaths ; and if I continue <lb/>
            in health, not the calamities of the Ionians shall be talked about, <lb/>
            but their own." This taunt of Cyrus was levelled at the <lb/>
            Grecians in general, who have markets for the purposes of <lb/>
            buying and selling; for the Persians themselves are not accus I <lb/>
            tomed to use markets, nor have they such a thing as a market <lb/>
            After this, Cyrus, having intrusted Tabalus a Persian with the <lb/>
            government of Sardis, and appointed Pactyas a Lydian to <lb/>
            bring away the gold, both that belonging to Crœsus and to the <lb/>
            other Lydians, took Crœsus with.him, and.departed for Ecba­ <lb/>
            tana, for from the first he took no account of the lonians. <lb/>
            But Babylon was an obstacle to him, as were also the Bactri­ <lb/>
            anis, the Sacæ, and the Egyptians ; against whom he resolved <lb/>
            to lead an army in person, and to send some other general, <lb/>
            against the Ionians. 154. But as soon as Cyrus had marched <lb/>
            from Sardis, Pactyas prevailed on the Lydians to revolt from <lb/>
            Tabalus and Cyrus; and going downl to the sea-coast, with all <lb/>
            IF <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> [155, 156 </note> <lb/>
            the gold taken from Sardis in his possession, he hired merce­ <lb/>
            naries and persuaded the inhabitants of the coast to join him ; <lb/>
            and then having marched against Sardis, he besieged Tabalus, <lb/>
            who was shut up in the citadel.</p>
          <p>155. When Cyrus heard this news on his march, he said to <lb/>
            Crcesus ; " Croesus, what will be the end of these things ? the <lb/>
            Lydians, it seems, will never cease to give trouble to me, and <lb/>
            to themselves. I am in doubt whether it will not be better to <lb/>
            reduce them to slavery; for I appear to have acted like one <lb/>
            who, having killed the father, has spared the children; so I <lb/>
            am carrying away you, who have been something more than a <lb/>
            father to the Lydians, and have intrusted their city to the <lb/>
            Lydians themselves: and then I wonder at their rebellion !" <lb/>
            Now he said what he had in contemplation to do : but Crœsus, <lb/>
            fearing lest he should utterly destroy Sardis, answered, " Sir, <lb/>
            you have but too much reason for what you say ; yet do not <lb/>
            give full vent to your anger, nor utterly destroy an ancient <lb/>
            city, which is innocent as well of the former as of the present <lb/>
            offence: for of the former I myself was guilty, and now bear <lb/>
            the punishment on my own head; but in the present instance <lb/>
            Pactyas, to whom you intrusted Sardis, is the culprit; let him <lb/>
            therefore pay the penalty. But pardon the Lydians, and en­ <lb/>
            join them to observe the following regulations, to the end that <lb/>
            they may never more revolt, nor be troublesome to you : send <lb/>
            to them and order them to keep no weapons of war in then <lb/>
            possession ; and enjoin them to wear tunics under their cloaks, <lb/>
            and buskins on their feet; and require them to teach their <lb/>
            sons to play on the cithara, to strike the guitar, and to sell.-by <lb/>
            retail; and then you will soon see them becoming women in­ <lb/>
            stead of men, so that they will never give you any apprehen­ <lb/>
            sions about their revolting." 156. Crœsus suggested this <lb/>
            plan, thinking it would be more desirable for the Lydians, <lb/>
            than that they should be sold for slaves; and being persuaded, <lb/>
            that unless he could suggest some feasible proposal, he should <lb/>
            not prevail with him to alter his resolution: and he dreaded <lb/>
            also, lest the Lydians, if they should escape the present danger, <lb/>
            might hereafter revolt from the Persians, and bring utter ruin <lb/>
            on themselves. Cyrus, pleased with the expedient, laid aside <lb/>
            his anger, and said that he would follow his advice: then hav­ <lb/>
            ing sent for Mazares, a Mede, he commanded him to order the <lb/>
            Lydians to conform themselves to the regulations proposed by <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="157-159.]"/> <lb/>
            Crœsus, and moreover to enslave and the rest who had joined <lb/>
            the Lydians in the attack on Sardis; but by all means to bring <lb/>
            Pactyas to him alive. 157. Cyrus then having given these <lb/>
            orders on his way, proceeded to the settlements of the Persians. <lb/>
            But Pactyas hearing that the army which was coming against <lb/>
            him was close at hand, fled in great consternation to Cyme; <lb/>
            and Mazares the Mede having marched against Sardis with an <lb/>
            inconsiderable division of Cyrus's army, when he found that <lb/>
            Pactyas and his party were no longer there, in the first place <lb/>
            compelled the Lydians to conform to the injunctions of Cyrus ; <lb/>
            and by his order the Lydians completely changed their mode <lb/>
            of life: after this Mazares despatched messengers to Cyme, re­ <lb/>
            quiring them to deliver up Pactyas. But the Cymaeans, in <lb/>
            order to come to a decision, resolved to refer the matter to the <lb/>
            deity at Branchidæ, for there was there an oracular shrine, <lb/>
            erected in former times, which all the Ionians and Æolians <lb/>
            were in the practice of consulting: this place is situated in <lb/>
            Milesia, above the port of Panormus.9 158. The Cymæans <lb/>
            therefore, having sent persons to consult the oracle at Bran­ <lb/>
            chidæ, asked what course they should pursue respecting <lb/>
            Pactyas, that would be most pleasing to the gods the an­ <lb/>
            swer to their question was, that they should deliver up Pactyas <lb/>
            to the Persians. When the Cymæans heard this answer re­ <lb/>
            ported, they determined to give him up; but though most ot <lb/>
            them came to this determination, Aristodicus the son of Hera­ <lb/>
            elides, a man of high repute among the citizens, distrusting <lb/>
            the oracle, and suspecting the sincerity of the consulters, pre­ <lb/>
            vented them from doing so; till at last other messengers, <lb/>
            among whom was Aristodicus, went to inquire a second time <lb/>
            concerning Pactyas. 159. When they arrived at Branchidæ, <lb/>
            Aristodicus consulted the oracle in the name of all, inquiring <lb/>
            in these words: " 0 king, Pactyas, a Lydian, has come to us <lb/>
            as a suppliant, to avoid a violent death at the hands of the <lb/>
            Persians. They now demand him, and require the Cymæans to <lb/>
            give him up. We, however, though we dread the Persian power, <lb/>
            have not yet dared to surrender the suppliant, till it be plainly <lb/>
            declared by thee what we ought to do." Such was the inquiry <lb/>
            of Aristodicus; but the oracle gave the same answer as before, <note type="footnote">9 It will be proper to remark, that there were two places of that name; <lb/>
            and that this must not be confounded with the port of Panormus, in the <lb/>
            vicinity of Ephesus. .Beloe. </note><pb n="70"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[160-162."/> <lb/>
            and bade them surrender Pactyas to the Persians. Upon this <lb/>
            Aristodicus deliberately acted as follows; walking round the <lb/>
            temple, he took away the sparrows and all other kinds of birds <lb/>
            that had built nests in the temple; and while he was doing <lb/>
            this, it is reported, that a voice issued from the sanctuary, and <lb/>
            addressing Aristodicus, spoke as follows: " 0 most impious of <lb/>
            men, how darest thou do this ? Dost thou tear my suppliants <lb/>
            from my temple?" Aristodicus without hesitation answered, <lb/>
            " 0 king, art thou then so careful to succour thy suppliants, <lb/>
            but biddest the Cymæans to deliver up theirs ?" The oracle <lb/>
            again rejoined : " Yes, I bid you do so ; that having acted im­ <lb/>
            piously, ye may the sooner perish, and never more come and <lb/>
            consult the oracle about the delivering up of suppliants." 160. <lb/>
            When the Cymæans heard this last answer, they, not wishing <lb/>
            to bring destruction on themselves by surrendering Pactyas, <lb/>
            or to subject themselves to a siege by protecting him, sent <lb/>
            him away to Mitylene. But the Mitylenæans, when Mazares <lb/>
            sent a message to them requiring them to deliver up Pactyas, <lb/>
            were preparing to do so for some remuneration ; what, I am <lb/>
            unable to say precisely, for the proposal was never completed. <lb/>
            For the Cymæans, being informed of what was being done by <lb/>
            the Mitylenæans, despatched a vessel to Lesbos, and trans­ <lb/>
            ported Pactyas to Chios, whence he was torn by violence from <lb/>
            the temple of Minerva Poliuchus by the Chians, and delivered <lb/>
            up. The Chians delivered him up in exchange for Atarneus ; <lb/>
            this Atarneus was a place situate in Mysia, opposite Lesbos <lb/>
            In this manner Pactyas fell into the hands of the Persians; <lb/>
            therefore having got possession of Pactyas, they kept him <lb/>
            under guard in order that they might deliver him up to Cyrus. <lb/>
            And for a long time after this, none of the Chians would offer <lb/>
            barley-meal from Atarneus to any of the gods, or make any <lb/>
            cakes of the fruit that came from thence ; but all the produc­ <lb/>
            tions of that country were excluded from the temples. Thus <lb/>
            the Chians gave up Pactyas. 161. Mazares, after this, <lb/>
            marched against those who had assisted in besieging Tabalus; <lb/>
            and in the first place lie reduced the Prienians to slavery, and <lb/>
            in the next overran the whole plain of the Mæander, and gave <lb/>
            it to his army to pillage; and he treated Magnesia in the same <lb/>
            manner: and shortly afterwards he fell sick and died.</p>
          <p>162. On his death Harpagus came down as his successor in <lb/>
            the command; lie also was by birth a Mede, the same whor <pb n="71"/>

            Astyages king of the Medes entertained at an impious feast, <lb/>
            and who assisted Cyrus in ascending the throne. This man <lb/>
            being appointed general by Cyrus, on his arrival in Ionia, took <lb/>
            severalcities by means earthworks; for he forced the peo­ <lb/>
            ple to retire within their fortifications, and then, having heaped <lb/>
            up mounds against the walls, he carried the cities by storm. <lb/>
            Phocæa was the first place in Ionia that he attacked.</p>
          <p>163." These Phocaeans were the first of all the Grecians <lb/>
            who undertook long voyages, and they are the people who dis­ <lb/>
            covered the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas, and Iberia, and <lb/>
            Tartessus.1 They made their voyages in fifty-oared galleys, <lb/>
            and not in merchant-ships.2 When they arrived at Tartessus <lb/>
            they were kindly received by the king of the Tartessians, <lb/>
            whose name was Arganthonius; he reigned eighty years over <lb/>
            Tartessus, and lived to the age of one hundred and twenty <lb/>
            The Phocæans became such great favourites with him, that he <lb/>
            at first solicited them to abandon Ionia, and to settle in any <lb/>
            part of his territory they should choose; but afterwards, find­ <lb/>
            ing he could not prevail with the Phocæans to accept his offer, <lb/>
            and hearing from them the increasing power of the Mede, he <lb/>
            gave them money for the purpose of building a wall round their <lb/>
            city; and he gave it unsparingly, for the wall is not a few <lb/>
            stades in circumference, and is entirely built of large and well­ <lb/>
            compacted stone. 164. Now the wall of the Phocæans had <lb/>
            been built in the above manner ; but when Harpagus marched <lb/>
            his army against them, he besieged them, having first offered <lb/>
            terms: " that he would be content if the Phocæans would <lb/>
            throw down only c-ne of their battlements, and consecrate one <lb/>
            house to the king's use." The Phocæans, detesting slavery, <lb/>
            said, "that they wished for one day to deliberate, and would <lb/>
            then give their answer;" but while they were deliberating <lb/>
            they required him to draw off his forces from the wall. Har­ <lb/>
            pagus said, that " though he well knew their design, yet he <lb/>
            would permit, them to consult together." In the interval, then, <lb/>
            during which Harpagus withdrew his army from the wall, the <lb/>
            Phocæans launched their fifty-oared galleys, and having put <lb/>
            their wives, children, and goods on board, together with the <lb/>
            images from the temples, and other offerings, except works of <note type="footnote">1 Tartessus was situated between the two branches of the Bcetis, (now <lb/>

            brass or stone, or pictures.-with these exceptions, having put <lb/>
            every thing on board, and embarked themselves, they set sail <lb/>
            for Chios : and the Persians took possession of Phocæa, aban­ <lb/>
            doned by all its inhabitants. 165. The Phocæans, when the <lb/>
            Chians refused to sell them the Œnyssæ islands, for fear they <lb/>
            should become the seat of trade, and their own island be thereby <lb/>
            excluded, thereupon directed their course to Cyrnus; where, <lb/>
            by the admonition of an oracle, they had twenty years before <lb/>
            built a city, named Alalia. But Arganthonius was at that <lb/>
            time dead. On their passage to Cyrnus, having first sailed <lb/>
            down to Phocæa, they put to death the Persian garrison which <lb/>
            had been left by Harpagus to guard the city. Afterwards, <lb/>
            when this was accomplished, they pronounced terrible impre­ <lb/>
            cations on any who should desert the fleet: besides this, they <lb/>
            sunk a mass of red-hot iron, and swore that they would <lb/>
            never return to Phocæa, till this burning mass should appear <lb/>
            again." Nevertheless, as they were on their way towards <lb/>
            Cyrnus, more than one half of the citizens were seized with <lb/>
            regret and yearning for their city and dwellings in the country, <lb/>
            and violating their oaths, sailed back to Phocæa; but such of <lb/>
            them as kept to their oath, weighed anchor and sailed from the <lb/>
            Œnyssæ islands. 166. On their arrival at Cyrnus they lived <lb/>
            for five years in common with the former settlers: but as they <lb/>
            ravaged the territories of all their neighbours, the Tyrrhenians <lb/>
            and Carthaginians combined together to make war against <lb/>
            them, each with sixty ships : and the Phocæans, on their part, <lb/>
            having manned their ships, consisting of sixty in number, met <lb/>
            them in the Sardinian Sea; and having engaged, the Phocæans <lb/>
            obtained a kind of Cadmean victory ; 3 for forty of their own <lb/>
            ships were destroyed, and the twenty that survived were dis­ <lb/>
            abled, for their prows were blunted. They therefore sailed <lb/>
            oack to Alalia, and took on board their wives and children, <lb/>
            with what property their ships were able to carry, and leaving <lb/>
            Cyrnus, sailed to Rhegium. 167. As to the men belonging <lb/>
            to the ships destroyed, most of them fell into the hands 4 of the <note type="footnote"> :I <unclear>A</unclear> proverbial expression, importing, " that the victors suffered more <lb/>

            Cartbaginians and Tyrrhenians, who tock them On shore, and <lb/>
            stoned them to death. But afterwards all animals belonging <lb/>
            to the Agyllæans that passed by the spot where the Phocæans <lb/>
            who had been stoned lay, became distorted, maimed, and <lb/>
            crippled, as well sheep, as beasts of burden, and men. The <lb/>
            Agyllæans therefore, being anxious to expiate the guilt, sent <lb/>
            to Delphi; and the Pythia enjoined them to use those rites <lb/>
            which the Agyllæans still observe; for they commemorate <lb/>
            their death with great magnificence, and have established <lb/>
            gymnastic and equestrian contests. This was the fate of <lb/>
            these Phocæans; but the others who fled to Rhegium, left <lb/>
            that place, and got possession of that town in the territory <lb/>
            of Œnotria, which is now called Hyela, and they colonized <lb/>
            this town by the advice of a certain Posidonian, who told them <lb/>
            the Pythia had directed them to establish sacred rites to Cyrnus <lb/>
            as being a hero, but not to colonize the island of that name.</p>
          <p>168. The Teians also acted nearly in the same manner as <lb/>
            the Phocæans. For when Harpagus by means of his earth­ <lb/>
            works had made himself master of their walls, they all went <lb/>
            on board their ships, and sailed away to Thrace, and there set­ <lb/>
            tled in the city of Abdera ; which Timesius of Clazomenæ <lb/>
            having formerly founded, did not enjoy, but was driven out by <lb/>
            the Thracians, and is now honoured as a hero by the Teians <lb/>
            of Abdera.</p>
          <p>169. These were the only Ionians who abandoned their <lb/>
            country rather than submit to servitude. The rest, except <lb/>
            the Milesians, gave battle to Harpagus, and as well as those <lb/>
            who abandoned their country, proved themselves brave men, <lb/>
            each fighting for his own ; but being defeated and subdued, <lb/>
            they severally remained in their own countries, and submitted <lb/>
            to the commands imposed on them. But the Milesians, as I <lb/>
            have before mentioned,5 having made a league with Cyrus, re­ <lb/>
            mained quiet. Thus then was Ionia a second time enslaved ; 6 <lb/>
            and when Harpagus had subdued the Ionians on the continent, <lb/>
            those that occupied the islands, dreading the same fate, made <lb/>
            their submission to Cyrus. 170. When the Ionians were <note type="footnote"> take them." Indeed I believe that wherever Herodotus speaks of an <lb/>

            brought to this wretched condition, and nevertheless still held <lb/>
            assemblies at Panionium, I am informed that Bias of Priene <lb/>
            gave them most salutary advice, which, if they had hearkened <lb/>
            to him, would have made them the most flourishing of all the <lb/>
            Grecians. He advised, " that the Ionians, having weighed <lb/>
            anchor, should sail in one common fleet to Sardinia, and then <lb/>
            build one city for all the Ionians ; thus being freed from servi­ <lb/>
            tude, they would flourish, inhabiting the most considerable of <lb/>
            the islands, and governing the rest; whereas if they remained <lb/>
            in Ionia, he saw no hope of recovering their liberty.".. This <lb/>
            was the advice of Bias; the Prienean, after the. Ionians were <lb/>
            ruined. But. before Ionia was ruined, the advice of Thales <lb/>
            the Milesian, who was of Phœnician extraction, was also good. <lb/>
            He advised the Ionians to constitute one general council in <lb/>
            Teos, which stands in the centre of Ionia; and that the rest <lb/>
            if the inhabited cities should nevertheless be governed as in­ <lb/>
            dependent states. Such was the advice they severally gave.</p>
          <p>171. Harpagus having subdued Ionia, marched against the <lb/>
            Carians, Caunians, Lycians, Ionians, and Æolians. Of these <lb/>
            the Carians had come from the islands to the continent. For <lb/>
            being subjects of Minos, and anciently called Leleges, they oc­ <lb/>
            cupied the islands without paying any tribute, as far as I am <lb/>
            able to discover by inquiring into the remotest times, but, <lb/>
            whenever he required them, they manned his ships; and as <lb/>
            Minos subdued a large territory, and was successful in war, <lb/>
            the Carians were by far the most famous of all nations in those <lb/>
            times. They also introduced three inventions which the <lb/>
            Greeks have adopted. For the Carians set the example of <lb/>
            fastening crests upon helmets, and of putting devices on shields; <lb/>
            they are also the first who put handles to shields ; but until <lb/>
            their time all who used shields carried them without handles, <lb/>
            guiding them with leathern thongs, having them slung round <lb/>
            their necks and left shoulders. After a long time had elapsed, <lb/>
            the Dorians and Ionians drove the Carians out of the islands, <lb/>
            and so they came to the continent- This then is the account <lb/>
            that the Cretans give of the Carians: the Carians themselves <lb/>
            however do not admit its correctness; but consider themselves <lb/>
            to be aboriginal inhabitants of the continent, and always to <lb/>
            have gone under the same name as they now do. And in <lb/>
            testimony of this, they show an ancient temple of Jupiter <lb/>
            Canus at Mylasa, which the Mysians and Lydians share, as <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="margin"> 172, 173.] </note> <lb/>
            kinsmen to the Carians, for they say that Lydus and Mysus <lb/>
            were brothers to Car. Now they do share the temple, but <lb/>
            none who are of a different nation, though of the same lan­ <lb/>
            guage with the Carians, are allowed to share it. 172. The <lb/>
            Caunians, in my opinion, are aboriginals, though they say <lb/>
            they are from Crete. However, they have assimilated their <lb/>
            language to that of the Carians, or the Carians to theirs ; for <lb/>
            this I cannot determine with certainty. Their customs are <lb/>
            totally distinct from those of other nations, even from the <unclear>O</unclear> <lb/>
            rians ; for they account it very becoming for men, women, <lb/>
            and boys, to meet together to drink according to their age <lb/>
            and intimacy. They had formerly erected temples to foreign <lb/>
            deities, but afterwards, when they changed their minds, (for <lb/>
            they resolved to have none but their own national deities,) all <lb/>
            the Caunians armed themselves, both young and old, and <lb/>
            beating the air with their spears, marched in a body to the <lb/>
            Calindian confines, and said they were expelling strange gods. <lb/>
            They then have such customs.. 173. The Lycians were origin­ <lb/>
            ally sprung from Crete, for in ancient time Crete was entirely <lb/>
            in the possession of barbarians. But a dispute having arisen <lb/>
            between Sarpedon and Minos, sons of Europa, respecting the <lb/>
            sovereign power, when Minos got the upper hand in the strug­ <lb/>
            gle, he drove out Sarpedon with his partisans ; and they being <lb/>
            expelled came to the land of Milyas in Asia: for the country <lb/>
            which the Lycians now occupy was anciently called Milyas ; <lb/>
            but the Milyans were then called Solymi. So long as Sarpedon <lb/>
            reigned over them, they went by the name of Termite, which <lb/>
            they brought with them, and the Lycians are still called by <lb/>
            that name by their neighbours. But when Lycus son of Pan­ <lb/>
            dion, who was likewise driven out by his brother Ægeus, <lb/>
            came from Athens, the Termite under Sarpedon, in course of <lb/>
            time, got to be called Lycians after him. Their customs are <lb/>
            partly Cretan and partly Carian ; but they have one peculiar <lb/>
            to themselves, in which they differ from all other nations ; for <lb/>
            they take their name from their mothers and not from <lb/>
            fathers; so that if any one ask another who he is, he will <lb/>
            scribe himself by his mother's side, and reckon up his mater­ <lb/>
            final ancestry in the femaleline. And if a free-born woman <lb/>
            arr a <lb/>
            if a man who is a citizen, even though of high rank, marry a <pb n="76"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[174-176"/> <lb/>
            foreigner or cohabit with a concubine the children are in <lb/>
            famous.</p>
          <p>174. Now the Carians were subdued by Harpagus, with­ <lb/>
            out having done any memorable action in their own defence : <lb/>
            and not only the Carians, but all the Grecians that inhabit <lb/>
            those parts, behaved themselves with as little courage. And <lb/>
            among others settled there, are the Cnidians, colonists from <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, whose territory juts on the sea, and is <lb/>
            called the Triopean : but the region of Bybassus commenced <lb/>
            from the peninsula, for all Cnidia, except a small space, is <lb/>
            surrounded by water ; (for the Ceramic gulf bounds it on the <lb/>
            north, and on the south the sea by Syme and Rhodes : now <lb/>
            this small space, which is about five stades in breadth, the <lb/>
            Cnidians, wishing to make their territory insular, designed to <lb/>
            dig through, while Harpagus was subduing Ionia. For the <lb/>
            whole of their dominions were within the isthmus ; and where <lb/>
            the Cnidian territory terminates towards the continent, there <lb/>
            is the isthmus that they designed to dig through. But as they <lb/>
            were carrying on the work with great diligence, the workmen <lb/>
            appeared to be wounded to a greater extent and in a more <lb/>
            strange manner than usual, both in other parts of the body, <lb/>
            and particularly in the eyes, by the chipping of the rock ; they <lb/>
            therefore sent deputies to Delphi to inquire what was the <lb/>
            cause of the obstruction ; and, as the Cnidians say, the Py­ <lb/>
            thia answered as follows in trimeter verse: " Build not a <lb/>
            tower on the isthmus, nor dig it through, for Jove would <lb/>
            have made it an island had he so willed." When the Pythia <lb/>
            had given this answer, the Cnidians desisted from their work, <lb/>
            and surrendered without resistance to Harpagus, as soon as <lb/>
            he approached with his army. 175. The Pedasians were <lb/>
            situate inland above Halicarnassus ; when any mischief is <lb/>
            about to befal them or their neighbours, the priestess of Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva has a long beard : this has three times occurred. Now <lb/>
            these were the only people about Caria who opposed Harpa­ <lb/>
            gus for any time, and gave him much trouble, by fortifying a <lb/>
            mountain called Lyda. 176. After some time, however, the <lb/>
            Pedasians were subdued. The Lycians, when Harpagus march­ <lb/>
            ed his army towards the Xanthian plain, went out to meet him, <lb/>
            and engaging with very inferior numbers, displayed great feats <lb/>
            of valour. But being defeated and shut up within their city, <pb n="77"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="177—179.]"/> <lb/>
            ;hey collected their wives, children, property, and servants <lb/>
            within the citadel, and then set fire to it and burnt it to the <lb/>
            ground. When they had done this, and engaged themselves <lb/>
            by the strongest oaths, all the Xanthians went out and died <lb/>
            lighting. Of the modern Lycians, who are said to be Xan­ <lb/>
            thians, all, except eighty families, are strangers ; but these <lb/>
            eighty families happened at the time to be away from home, <lb/>
            und so survived. Thus Harpagus got possession of Xanthus <lb/>
            and Caunia almost in the same manner ; for the Caunians <lb/>
            generally followed the example of the Lycians.</p>
          <p>177. Harpagus therefore reduced the lower parts of Asia, <lb/>
            but Cyrus conquered the upper parts, subduing every nation <lb/>
            without exception. The greatest part of these I shall pass <lb/>
            by without notice; but I will make mention of those which <lb/>
            'ave, him most trouble, and are most worthy of being re­ <lb/>
            corded.</p>
          <p>178. When Cyrus had reduced all the other parts of the <lb/>
            continent, he attacked the Assyrians. Now Assyria con­ <lb/>
            tains many large cities, but the most renowned and the <lb/>
            strongest, and where the seat of government was established <lb/>
            after the destruction of Nineveh, was Babylon, which is of the <lb/>
            following description. The city stands in a spacious plain, and <lb/>
            is quadrangular, and shows a front on every side of one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and twenty stades; these stades make up the sum of four <lb/>
            hundred and eighty in the whole circumference. Such is the <lb/>
            size of the city of Babylon. It was adorned in a manner sur­ <lb/>
            passing any city we are acquainted with. In the first place, <lb/>
            a. moat deep, wide, and full of water, runs entirely round it; <lb/>
            next, there is a wall fifty royal cubits in breadth, and in height <lb/>
            two hundred, but the royal cubit is larger than the common <lb/>
            one by three fingers' breadth. 179. And here I think I ought <lb/>
            to explain how the earth, taken out of the moat, was consumed, <lb/>
            and in what manner the wall was built. As they dug the <lb/>
            moat they made bricks of the earth that was taken out ; and <lb/>
            when they had moulded a sufficient number they baked them <lb/>
            in kilns. Then making use of hot asphalt for cement, and <lb/>
            laying wattled reeds between the thirty bottom courses of <lb/>
            bricks, they first built up the sides of the moat, and after­ <lb/>
            wards the wall itself in the same manner; and on the top of <lb/>
            the wall, at the edges, they built dwellings of one story, front­ <lb/>
            ing each other, and they left a space between these dwellings <pb n="78"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[180-182."/> <lb/>
            sufficient for turning a chariot with four horses. In the cir­ <lb/>
            cumference of the wall there were a hundred gates, all of <lb/>
            brass, as also are the posts and lintels. Eight days' journey <lb/>
            from Babylon stands another city, called Is, on a small river <lb/>
            of the same name, which discharges its stream into the <lb/>
            Euphrates ; now, this river brings down with its water many <lb/>
            lumps of bitumen, from whence the bitumen used in the wall <lb/>
            of Babylon was brought. 180. In this manner Babylon was <lb/>
            encompassed with a wall. And the city consists of two di­ <lb/>
            visions, for a river, called the Euphrates, separates it in the <lb/>
            middle: this river, which is broad, deep, and rapid, flows <lb/>
            from Armenia, and falls into the Red Sea. The wall there­ <lb/>
            fore on either bank has an elbow carried down to the river; <lb/>
            from thence along the curvatures of each bank of the river <lb/>
            runs a wall of baked bricks. The city itself, which is full of <lb/>
            houses three and four stories high, is cut up into straight <lb/>
            streets, as well all the other as the transverse ones that lead to <lb/>
            the river. At the end of each street a little gate is formed in <lb/>
            the wall along the river-side, in number equal to the streets; <lb/>
            and they are all made of brass, and lead down to the edge of <lb/>
            the river. 181. This outer wall then is the chief defence, but <lb/>
            another wall runs round within, not much inferior to the <lb/>
            other in strength, though narrower. In the middle of each di­ <lb/>
            vision of the city fortified buildings were erected ; in one, the <lb/>
            royal palace, with a spacious and strong enclosure, brazen­ <lb/>
            gated ; and in the other, the precinct of Jupiter Belus, which <lb/>
            in my time was still in existence, a square building of two <lb/>
            stades on every side. In the midst of this precinct is built a <lb/>
            solid tower of one stade both in length and breadth, and on <lb/>
            this tower rose another, and another upon that, to the number <lb/>
            of eight. And an ascent to these is outside, running spirally <lb/>
            round all the towers. About the middle of the ascent there <lb/>
            is a landing-place and seats to rest on, on which those who go <lb/>
            up sit down and rest themselves; and in the uppermost tower <lb/>
            stands a spacious temple, and in this temple is placed, hand­ <lb/>
            somely furnished, a large couch, and by its side a table of gold. <lb/>
            No statue has been erected within it, nor does any mortal <lb/>
            pass the night there, except only a native woman, chosen by <lb/>
            the god out of the whole nation, as the Chaldeans, who are <lb/>
            priests of this deity, say. 182. These same priests assert, <lb/>
            though I cannot credit what they say. that the god himself <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="183—185.]"/> <lb/>
            comes to the temple and reclines on the bed, in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner as the Egyptians say happens at Thebes in Egypt, for <lb/>
            ;here also a woman lies in the temple of Theban Jupiter, and <lb/>
            )oth are said to have no intercourse with men; in the <lb/>
            same manner also the priestess, who utters the oracles at <lb/>
            Pataram in Lycia, when the god is there, for there is not an <lb/>
            )racle there at all times, but when there she is shut up during <lb/>
            the night in the temple with the god. 183. There is also an. <lb/>
            )ther temple below, within the precinct at Babylon; in it is a <lb/>
            arge golden statue of Jupiter seated, and near it is placed a <lb/>
            arge table of gold, the throne also and the step are of gold, <lb/>
            vhich together weigh eight hundred talents, as the Chaldæans <lb/>
            Lffirm. Outside the temple is a golden altar; and another <lb/>
            arge altar, where full-grown sheep are sacrificed; for on the <lb/>
            golden altar only sucklings may be offered. On the great <lb/>
            altar the Chaldæans consume yearly a thousand talents of <lb/>
            frankincense when they celebrate the festival of this god. <lb/>
            rhere was also at that time within the precincts of this <lb/>
            :emple a statue of solid gold, twelve cubits high: I indeed did <lb/>
            lot see it, I only relate what is said by the Chaldæans. Da­ <lb/>
            ius, son of Hystaspes, formed a design to take away this <lb/>
            itatue, but dared not do so; but Xerxes, son of Darius, took <lb/>
            t, and killed the priest who forbade him to remove it. Thus, <lb/>
            hen, this temple was adorned; and besides there are many <lb/>
            private offerings.</p>
          <p>184. There were many others who reigned over Babylon, <lb/>
            vhom I shall mention in my Assyrian history, who beau­ <lb/>
            tified the walls and temples, and amongst them were two <lb/>
            vomen. The first of these, named Semiramis, lived five gener­ <lb/>
            ations before the other; she raised mounds along the plain, <lb/>
            which are worthy of admiration; for before, the river used to <lb/>
            )verflow the whole plain like a sea. 185. But the other, who <lb/>
            .vas queen next after her, and whose name was Nitocris, (she <lb/>
            was much more sagacious than the queen before her,) in the <lb/>
            irst place left monuments of herself, which I shall presently <lb/>
            lescribe; and in the next place, when she saw the power of <lb/>
            the Medes growing formidable and restless, and that, among <lb/>
            )ther cities, Nineveh was captured by them, she took every <lb/>
            possible precaution for her own defence. First of all, with re­ <lb/>
            spect to the river Euphrates, which before ran in a straight <lb/>
            line. and Which flows through the middle of-the city, this, by <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[186"/> <lb/>
            having channels dug above, she made so winding, that in <lb/>
            its course it touches three times at one and the same village <lb/>
            in Assyria: the name of this village at which the Euphrates <lb/>
            touches, is Arderica: and to this day, those who go from our <lb/>
            sea to Babylon, if they travel by the Euphrates, come three <lb/>
            times to this village on three successive days. She also raised <lb/>
            on either bank of the river a mound, astonishing for its mag­ <lb/>
            nitude and height. At a considerable distance above Baby­ <lb/>
            lon, she had a reservoir for a lake dug, carrying it out some <lb/>
            distance from the river, and in depth digging down to water, <lb/>
            and in width making its circumference of four hundred and <lb/>
            twenty stades : she consumed the soil from this excavation <lb/>
            by heaping it up on the banks of the river, and when it was <lb/>
            completely dug, she had stones brought and built a casing to <lb/>
            it all round. She had both these works done, the river made <lb/>
            winding, and the whole excavation a lake, in order that the <lb/>
            current, being broken by frequent turnings, might be more <lb/>
            slow, and the navigation to Babylon tedious, and that after <lb/>
            the voyage, a long march round the lake might follow. All <lb/>
            this was done in that part of the country where the approach <lb/>
            to Babylon is nearest, and where is the shortest way for the <lb/>
            Medes ; in order that the Medes might not, by holding inter­ <lb/>
            course with her people, become acquainted with her affairs. <lb/>
            186. She enclosed herself, therefore, with these defences by <lb/>
            digging, and immediately afterwards made the following ad­ <lb/>
            dition. As the city consisted of two divisions, which were <lb/>
            separated by the river, during the reign of former kings, <lb/>
            when any one had occasion to cross from one division to the <lb/>
            other, he was obliged to cross in a boat: and this, in my <lb/>
            opinion, was very troublesome: she therefore provided for <lb/>
            this, for after she had dug the reservoir for the lake, she left <lb/>
            this other monument built by similar toil. She had large <lb/>
            blocks of stone cut, and when they were ready and the place <lb/>
            was completely dug out, she turned the whole stream of the <lb/>
            river into the place she had dug: while this was filled, and <lb/>
            the ancient channel had become dry, in the first place, she <lb/>
            lined with burnt bricks the banks of the river throughout the <lb/>
            city, and the descents that lead from the gates to the river, <lb/>
            in the same manner as the walls. In the next place, about the <lb/>
            middle of the city, she built a bridge with the stones she had <lb/>
            prepared, and bound them together with plates of lead and <pb n="81"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="187-189.]"/> <lb/>
            iron. Upon these stones she laid, during the day, square <lb/>
            planks of timber, on which the Babylonians might pass over ; <lb/>
            but at night these planks were removed, to prevent people <lb/>
            from crossing by night and robbing one another. When the, <lb/>
            hollow that was dug had become a lake filled by the river, and <lb/>
            the bridge was finished, she brought back the river to its an­ <lb/>
            cient channel from the lake. And thus, the excavation hav* <lb/>
            ing been turned into a marsh, appeared to answer the purpose <lb/>
            for which it was made, and a bridge was built for the use of <lb/>
            the inhabitants.</p>
          <p>187. This same queen also contrived the following de­ <lb/>
            ception. Over the most frequented gate of the city she <lb/>
            prepared a sepulchre for herself, high up above the gate <lb/>
            itself; and on the sepulchre she had engraved, SHOULD ANY <lb/>
            ONE OF MY SUCCESSORS, KINGS OF BABYLON, FIND HIMSELF IN <lb/>
            WANT OF MONEY, LET HIM OPEN THIS SEPULCHRE, AND TAKE <lb/>
            AS MUCH AS HE CHOOSES ; BUT IF HE BE NOT IN WANT, LET <lb/>
            HIM NOT OPEN IT ; FOR THAT WERE NOT WELL. This monu­ <lb/>
            ment remained undisturbed, until the kingdom fell to Darius ; <lb/>
            but it seemed hard to Darius that this gate should be of no <lb/>
            use, and that when money was lying there, and this money <lb/>
            inviting him to take it, he should not do so ; but no use was <lb/>
            made of this gate for this reason, that a dead body was over <lb/>
            the head of any one who passed through it. He therefore <lb/>
            opened the sepulchre, and instead of money, found only the <lb/>
            body, and these words written : HADST THOU NOT BEEN INSA- <lb/>
            TIABLY COVETOUS, AND GREEDY OF THE MOST SORDID GAIN, <lb/>
            THOU WOULDEST NOT HAVE OPENED THE CHAMBERS OF THE <lb/>
            DEAD. Such then is the account given of this queen.</p>
          <p>188. Cyrus made war against the son of this queen, who <lb/>
            bore the name of his father Labynetus, and had the empire of <lb/>
            Assyria. Now when the great king leads his army in person, <lb/>
            he carries with him from home provisions well prepared and <lb/>
            cattle ; and he takes with him water from the river Choaspes, <lb/>
            which flows past Susa, of which alone, and no other, the <lb/>
            king drinks. A great number of four-wheeled carriages <lb/>
            drawn by mules carry the water of this rive, after it has <lb/>
            been boiledin silver vessels, and follow him from place to <lb/>
            place wherever he marches. 189. When Cyrus, in his march <lb/>
            against Babylon, arrived at the river Gyndes, whose fountains <lb/>
            are in the Matianian mountains, and which flows through the <note type="footnote"> u </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [190, 191. </note> <lb/>
            land of the Dardanians, and falls into another rIver, the Ti­ <lb/>
            gris ; which latter, flowing by the city of Opis, discharges <lb/>
            itself into the Red Sea :-now, when Cyrus was endeavouring <lb/>
            to cross this river Gyndes, which can be passed only in <lb/>
            boats, one of the sacred white horses through wantonness <lb/>
            plunged into the stream, and attempted to swim over, but the <lb/>
            stream having carried him away and drowned him, Cyrus <lb/>
            was much enraged with the river for this affront, and threat <lb/>
            ened to make his stream so weak, that henceforth women <lb/>
            should easily cross it without wetting their knees. After this <lb/>
            menace, deferring his expedition against Babylon, he divided <lb/>
            his army into two parts ; and having so divided it, he marked <lb/>
            out by lines one hundred and eighty channels, on each side of <lb/>
            the river, diverging every way ; then having distributed his <lb/>
            army, he commanded them to dig. His design was indeed <lb/>
            executed by the great numbers he employed ; but they spent <lb/>
            the whole summer in the work. 190. When Cyrus had <lb/>
            avenged himself on the river Gyndes, by distributing it into <lb/>
            three hundred and sixty channels, and the second spring be­ <lb/>
            gan to shine, he then advanced against Babylon. But the <lb/>
            Babylonians, having taken the field, awaited his coming ; and <lb/>
            when he had advanced near the city, the Babylonians gave <lb/>
            battle, and, being defeated, were shut up in the city. But as <lb/>
            they had been long aware of the restless spirit of Cyrus, and saw <lb/>
            that he attacked all nations alike, they had laid up provisions <lb/>
            for many years ; and therefore were under no apprehensions <lb/>
            about a siege. On the other hand, Cyrus found himself in <lb/>
            difficulty, since much time had elapsed, and his affairs were <lb/>
            not at all advanced. 191. Whether therefore some one else <lb/>
            made the suggestion to him in his perplexity, or whether <lb/>
            he himself devised the plan, he had recourse to the following <lb/>
            stratagem. Having stationed the bulk of his army near the <lb/>
            passage of the river where it enters Babylon, and again hav­ <lb/>
            ing stationed another division beyond the city, where the <lb/>
            river makes its exit, he gave orders to his forces to enter the <lb/>
            city as soon as they should see the stream fordable. Having <lb/>
            thus stationed his forces, and given these directions, he him­ <lb/>
            self marched away with the ineffective part of his army ; and <lb/>
            having come to the lake, Cyrus did the same with respect to <lb/>
            the river and the lake as the queen of the Babylonians had <lb/>
            done. For having diverted the river, by means of a canal, <pb n="83"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="191, 192.]"/> <lb/>
            into the lake, which was before a swamp, he made the an­ <lb/>
            cient channel fordable by the sinking of the river. When <lb/>
            this took place, the Persians who were appointed to that pur­ <lb/>
            pose close to the stream of the river, which had now subsided <lb/>
            to about the middle of a man's thigh, entered Babylon by this <lb/>
            passage. If, however, the Babylonians had been aware of it <lb/>
            beforehand, or had known what Cyrus was about, they would <lb/>
            not have suffered the Persians to enter the city, but would <lb/>
            have utterly destroyed them ; for having shut all the little <lb/>
            gates that lead down to the river; and mounting the walls <lb/>
            that extend along the banks of the river, they would have <lb/>
            caught them as in a net; whereas the Persians came upon <lb/>
            them by surprise. It is related by the people who inhabited <lb/>
            this city, that by reason of its great extent, when they who <lb/>
            were at the extremities were taken, those of the Babylonians <lb/>
            who inhabited the centre knew nothing of the capture ; (for <lb/>
            it happened to be a festival;) but they were dancing at the <lb/>
            time, and enjoying themselves, till they received certain in­ <lb/>
            formation of the truth: and thus Babylon was taken for the <lb/>

          <p>192. How great was the power of the Babylonians, I can <lb/>
            prove by many other circumstances, and especially by the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing. The whole territory over which the great king reigns, <lb/>
            is divided into districts for the purpose of furnishing subsistence <lb/>
            for him and his army, in addition to the usual tribute ;now, <lb/>
            whereas there are twelve months in the year, the Babylonian <lb/>
            territory provides him with subsistence for four months, and <lb/>
            all the rest of Asia for the remaining eight: thus the territory <lb/>
            of Assyria amounts to a third part of the power of all Asia, <lb/>
            and the government of this region, which the Persians call a <lb/>
            satrapy, is considerable; since it yielded a full artabe of silver <lb/>
            every day. to Tritæchmes son of Artabazus, who held this dis­ <lb/>
            trict from the king: the artabe is a Persian measure, contain­ <lb/>
            ing three Attic chœnices nore than the Attic medimnus. And <lb/>
            he had a private stud of horses, in addition to those used in <lb/>
            war, of eight hundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares; <lb/>
            for each stallion served twenty mares. He kept too such a <lb/>
            number of Indian dogs, that four considerable towns in the <lb/>
            plain were exempted from all other taxes, and appointed to <lb/>
            find food for the dogs. Such were the advantages accruing <note type="footnote"> 7 It was again taken by Darius. See Book III. chap. 159 </note> <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [193. <unclear>194</unclear> </note> <lb/>
            to the governor of Babylon. 193. The land of Assyria is but <lb/>
            little watered by rain, and that little nourishes the root of the <lb/>
            corn; however, the stalk grows up, and the grain comes to <lb/>
            maturity, by being irrigated from the river, not, as in Egypt, <lb/>
            by the river overflowing the fields, but it is irrigated by t'he <lb/>
            hand and by engines. For the Babylonian territory, like <lb/>
            Egypt, is intersected by canals; and the largest of these is <lb/>
            navigable, stretching in the direction of the winter sunrise ;8 <lb/>
            and it extends from the Euphrates to another river, the river <lb/>
            Tigris, on which the city of Nineveh stood. This is, of all <lb/>
            lands with which we are acquainted, by far the best for the <lb/>
            growth of corn : but it does not carry any show of producing <lb/>
            trees of any kind, neither the fig, nor the vine, nor the olive; <lb/>
            yet it is so fruitful in the produce of corn, that it yields con­ <lb/>
            tinually two hundred-fold, and when it produces its best, it <lb/>
            yields even three hundred-fold. The blades of wheat and <lb/>
            barley grow there to full four fingers in breadth ; and <lb/>
            though I well know to what a height millet and sesama <lb/>
            grow, I shall not mention it; for I am well assured, that <lb/>
            to those who have never been in the Babylonian country, <lb/>
            what has been said concerning its productions will appear to <lb/>
            many incredible. They use no other oil than such as is drawn <lb/>
            from sesama. They have palm trees growing all over the <lb/>
            plain ; most of these bear fruit, from which they make <lb/>
            bread, wine, and honey. These they cultivate as fig trees, <lb/>
            both in other respects, and they also tie the fruit of that <lb/>
            which the Grecians call the male palm, about those trees that <lb/>
            bear dates, in order that the fly entering the date may ripen <lb/>
            it, lest otherwise the fruit fall before maturity; for the males <lb/>
            have flies in the fruit, just like-wild fig trees.</p>
          <p>194. The most wonderful thing of all here, next to the <lb/>
            city itself, is what I now proceed to describe: their vessels <lb/>
            that sail down the river to Babylon are circular, and made of <lb/>
            leather.For when they have cut the ribs out of willows that <lb/>
            grow in Armenia above Babylon, they cover them with hides <lb/>
            extended on the outside, by way of a bottom ; neither mak­ <lb/>
            ing any distinction in the stern, nor contracting the prow, but <lb/>
            making them circular like a buckler ; then having lined this <lb/>
            vessel throughout with reeds, they suffer it to be carried down <lb/>
            by the river freighted with merchandise, but they chiefly <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> That is, south-east. </note> <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> 95, 196. ] </note> <lb/>
            take down casks of palm wine. The vessel is steered by two <lb/>
            spars, and two men standing upright, one of whom draws his <lb/>
            spar in and the other thrusts his out. Some of these vessels are <lb/>
            made very large, and others of a smaller size; but the largest of <lb/>
            them carry a cargo of five thousand talents. Every vessel has <lb/>
            a live ass on board, and the larger ones more. For after they <lb/>
            arrive at Babylon, and have disposed of their freight, they sell <lb/>
            the ribs of the boat and all the reeds by public auction ; then <lb/>
            having piled the skins on the asses, they return by land to <lb/>
            Armenia, for it is not possible by any means to sail up the <lb/>
            river by reason of the rapidity of the current: and for this <lb/>
            reason they make their vessels of skins and not of wood, and <lb/>
            at their return to Armenia with their asses, they construct <lb/>
            other vessels in the same manner. Such, then, is the descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of their boats. 195. For their dress, they wear a linen <lb/>
            tunic that reaches down to the feet, over this they put an­ <lb/>
            other garment of wool, and over all a short white cloak; they <lb/>
            have sandals peculiar to the country, very like the Bœotian <lb/>
            clogs. They wear long hair, binding their heads with turbans, <lb/>
            and anoint the whole body with perfumes. Every man has <lb/>
            a seal, and a staff curiously wrought; and on every staff is <lb/>
            carved either an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle, or something of <lb/>
            the kind ; for it is not allowable to wear a stick without a de­ <lb/>
            vice. Such, then, is their manner of adorning the body.</p>
          <p>196. The following customs prevail amongst them. This, <lb/>
            in my opinion, is the wisest, which I hear the Venetians, of <lb/>
            Illyria, also practise. Once in every year the following <lb/>
            course is pursued in every village. Whatever maidens were <lb/>
            of a marriageable age, they used to collect together and bring <lb/>
            in a body to one place; around them stood a crowd of men. <lb/>
            Then a crier having made them stand up one by one, offered <lb/>
            them for sale, beginning with the most beautiful; and when <lb/>
            she had been sold for a large sum, he put up another who <lb/>
            was next in beauty. They were sold on condition that they <lb/>
            should be married. Such men among the Babylonians as were <lb/>
            rich and desirous of marrying, used to bid against one another, <lb/>
            and purchase the handsomest. But such of the lower classes <lb/>
            as were desirous of marrying, did not require a beautiful <lb/>
            form, but were willing to take the plainer damsels with 'a sum <lb/>
            of money. For when the crier had finished selling the hand­ <lb/>
            somest of the maidens, he made the ugliest stand up, or one <pb n="86"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[197—199."/> <lb/>
            that was a cripple, and put her up to 'auction, for the person <lb/>
            who would marry her with the least sum, until she was adjudged <lb/>
            to the man who offered to take the smallest sum. This money <lb/>
            was obtained from the sale of the handsome maidens; and <lb/>
            thus the beautiful ones portioned out the ugly and the crip­ <lb/>
            pled. A father was not allowed to give his daughter in mar­ <lb/>
            riage to whom he pleased, neither might a purchaser carry <lb/>
            off a maiden without security, but he was first obliged to give <lb/>
            security that he would certainly marry her, and then he might <lb/>
            take her away. If they did not agree, a law was enacted that <lb/>
            the money should be repaid. It was also lawful for any one <lb/>
            who pleased, to come from another village and purchase. Such <lb/>
            was their best institution; it has not, however, continued to <lb/>
            exist. They have lately adopted another regulation to pre­ <lb/>
            vent them from ill-treating the women, or carrying them away <lb/>
            to another city; for now that, since the taking of the city, <lb/>
            they have been harshly treated, and ruined in fortune, all the <lb/>
            meaner sort, from want of a livelihood, prostitute their daugh­ <lb/>
            ters. 197. They have also this other custom, second to the <lb/>
            former in wisdom. They bring out their sick to the market- <lb/>
            place, for they have no physicians; then those who pass by the <lb/>
            sick person, confer with him about the disease, to discover <lb/>
            whether they have themselves been afflicted with the same <lb/>
            disease as the sick person, or have seen others so afflicted: <lb/>
            thus the passers-by confer with him, and advise him to have <lb/>
            recourse to the same treatment as that by which they escaped <lb/>
            a similar disease, or as they have known cure others. And <lb/>
            they are not allowed to pass by a sick person in silence, with­ <lb/>
            out inquiring into the nature of his distemper. 198. They <lb/>
            embalm the dead in honey, and their funeral lamentations are <lb/>
            like those of the Egyptians. As often as a Babylonian has <lb/>
            had intercourse- with his wife, he sits over burning incense, <lb/>
            and his wife does the same in some other place ; at break of <lb/>
            day both wash, for they will not touch any vessel till they have <lb/>
            washed. The same practice is observed by the Arabians.</p>
          <p>199. The most disgraceful of the Babylonian customs is the <lb/>
            following : every native woman is obliged, once in her life, to <lb/>
            sit in the temple of Venus, and have intercourse with some <lb/>
            stranger. And many disdaining to mix with the rest, being <lb/>
            proud on account of their wealth, come in covered carriages, <lb/>
            and take up their station at the temple with a numerous train <pb n="87"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="200-202.]"/> <lb/>
            of servants attending them. But the far greater part do thus: <lb/>
            many sit down in the temple of Venus, wearing a crown of <lb/>
            cord round their heads ; some are continually coming in, and <lb/>
            others are going out. Passages marked out in a straight line <lb/>
            lead in every direction through the women, along which <lb/>
            strangers pass and make their choice. When a woman has <lb/>
            once seated herself, she must not return home till some stranger <lb/>
            has thrown a piece of silver into her lap,and lain with her <lb/>
            outsidethetemple. He who throws the silver must say thus : <lb/>
            I beseech the goddess Mylitta to favour thee :” for the As­ <lb/>
            syrians call Venus Mylitta. The silver may be ever so small, <lb/>
            for she will not reject it, inasmuch as it is not lawful for her <lb/>
            to do so, for such silver is accounted sacred. The woman <lb/>
            follows the first man that throws, and refuses no one. But <lb/>
            when she has had intercourse and has absolved herself from <lb/>
            her obligation to the goddess, she returns home; and after <lb/>
            that time, however great a sum you may give her you will not <lb/>
            gain possession of her. Those that are endowed with beauty <lb/>
            and symmetry of shape are soon set free; but the deformed <lb/>
            are detained a long time, from inability to satisfy the jaw, for <lb/>
            some wait for a space of three or four years. In some parts <lb/>
            ofCyprus there is a custom very similar. 200. These cus­ <lb/>
            toms, then, prevail amongst the Babylonians. There are three <lb/>
            tribes among them that eat nothing but fish ; these, when they <lb/>
            have taken and dried them in the sun, they treat in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner: they put them into a mortar, and having <lb/>
            pounded them with a pestle, sift them through a fine cloth ; <lb/>
            then, whoever pleases, kneads them into a cake, or bakes them <lb/>
            like bread.</p>
          <p>201. When Cyrus had conquered this nation, he was anx­ <lb/>
            ious to reduce the Massagetæ to subjection. Now, this nation <lb/>
            is said to be both powerful and valiant, dwelling towards the <lb/>
            east and the rising sun beyond the river Araxes, over against <lb/>
            the Issedonians ; there are some who say that this nation is <lb/>
            Scythian. 202. The Araxes is reported by some persons to <lb/>
            be greater, by others less, than the Ister ; they say that there <lb/>
            are many islands in it, some nearly equal in size to Lesbos ; <lb/>
            and that in them are men, who during the summer feed upon <lb/>
            all manner of roots, which they dig out of the ground ; and <lb/>
            that they store up for food ripe fruits which they find on the <lb/>
            trees, and feed ipon these during the winter. They add. <pb n="88"/>
             <note type="margin">[203, 204. </note> <lb/>
            that they have discovered other trees that produce fruit of <lb/>
            a peculiar kind, which the inhabitants, when they meet toge. <lb/>
            her in companies, and have lit a fire, throw on the fire, as they <lb/>
            sit round in a circle ; and that by inhaling the fumes of the <lb/>
            burning fruit that has been thrown on, they become intoxi­ <lb/>
            cated by the odour, just as the Greeks do by wine ; and that <lb/>
            the more fruit is thrown on, the more intoxicated they be­ <lb/>
            come, until they rise up to dance and betake themselves to <lb/>
            singing. In this manner these islanders are reported to live. <lb/>
            The river Araxes flows from the Matienian mountains, <lb/>
            whence also springs the river Gyndes, which Cyrus distri­ <lb/>
            buted into the three hundred and sixty trenches; and it <lb/>
            gushes out from forty springs, all of which, except one, dis­ <lb/>
            charge themselves into fens and swamps, in which it is said <lb/>
            men live who feed on raw fish, and clothe themselves in the <lb/>
            skins of sea-calves ; but the one stream of the Araxes flows <lb/>
            through an unobstructed channel into the Caspian Sea. The <lb/>
            Caspian is a sea by itself, having no communication with any <lb/>
            other sea ; for the whole of that which the Grecians navigate, <lb/>
            and that beyond the Pillars, called the Atlantic, and the Red <lb/>
            Sea, are all one. 203. But the Caspian is a separate sea of it­ <lb/>
            self ; being in length a fifteen days' voyage for a rowing boat; <lb/>
            and in breadth, where it is widest, an eight days' voyage. On <lb/>
            the western shore of this sea stretches the Caucasus, which is <lb/>
            in extent the largest, and in height the loftiest of all moun­ <lb/>
            tains ; it contains within itself many and various nations of <lb/>
            men, who for the most part live upon the produce of wild <lb/>
            fruit trees. In this country, it is said, there are trees which <lb/>
            produce leaves of such a nature, that by rubbing them and <lb/>
            mixing them with water the people paint figures on their <lb/>
            garments ; these figures they say do not wash out, but grow <lb/>
            eld with the wool, as if they had been woven in from the <lb/>
            first. It is said that sexual intercourse among these people <lb/>
            takes place openly, as with cattle. 204. The Caucasus, then, <lb/>
            bounds the western side of this sea, which is called the Cas­ <lb/>
            pian ; and on the east, towards the rising sun, succeeds a plain <lb/>
            in extent unbounded in the prospect. A great portion of this <lb/>
            extensive plain is inhabited by the Massagetæ, against whom <lb/>
            Cyrus resolved to make war ; for the motives that urged and <lb/>
            incited him to this enterprise were many and powerful ; first <lb/>
            of all his birth, which he thought was something more than <pb n="89"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="205—207. ]"/> <lb/>
            human; and secondly, the good fortune which had attended <lb/>
            him in his wars ; for wherever Cyrus directed his arms, it <lb/>
            was impossible for that nation to escape.</p>
          <p>205. A woman whose husband was dead, was queen of the <lb/>
            Massagetæ; her name was Tomyris ; and Cyrus sent am­ <lb/>
            bassadors under pretence of wooing her, and made her an offer <lb/>
            of marriage. But Tomyris, being aware that he was not woo­ <lb/>
            in- her, but the kingdom of the Massagetæ, forbade their ap­ <lb/>
            proach. Upon this Cyrus, perceiving his artifice ineffectual, <lb/>
            marched to the Araxes, and openly prepared to make war on <lb/>
            the Massagetae, by throwing bridges over the river, and <lb/>
            building turrets on the boats which carried over his army. <lb/>
            206. While he was employed in this work, Tomyris sent a <lb/>
            herald to him with this message : " King of the Medes, desist <lb/>
            from your great exertions ; for you cannot know if they will <lb/>
            terminate to your advantage ; and having desisted, reign over <lb/>
            your own dominions, and bear to see me governing what is <lb/>
            mine. But if you will not attend to my advice, and prefer <lb/>
            every thing before peace ; in a word, if you are very anxious <lb/>
            to make trial of the Massagetae, toil no longer an throwing a <lb/>
            bridge over the river; but do you cross over to our side, <lb/>
            while we retire three days' march from the river; or if you <lb/>
            had rather receive us on your side, do you the like." When <lb/>
            Cyrus heard this proposal, he called a council of the principal <lb/>
            Persians ; and having assembled them, he laid the matter be­ <lb/>
            fore them, and demanded their opinion as to what he should <lb/>
            do: they unanimously advised him to let Tomyris pass with <lb/>
            her army into his territory. 207. But Croesus the Lydian, <lb/>
            who was present and disapproved this advice, delivered a con­ <lb/>
            trary opinion to that which was put forward, and said: " 0 <lb/>
            king, I assured you long ago, that since Jupiter delivered me <lb/>
            into your hands, I would to the utmost of my power avert <lb/>
            whatever misfortune I should see impending over your house; <lb/>
            and my own calamities,9 sad as they are, have been lessons to <lb/>
            me. If you think yourself immortal, and that you command an <lb/>
            army that is so too, it were needless for me to make known to <lb/>
            you my opinion. But if you know that you too are a man, and <lb/>
            that you command such as are men, learn this first of all, that <lb/>

            Now, therefore, I hold an opinion touching the matter before <lb/>
            us, wholly at variance with that already given. For if we <lb/>
            shall receive the enemy into this country, there is this danger <lb/>
            in so doing, if you are defeated, you will lose, besides, your <lb/>
            whole empire ; for it is plain that if the Massagetae are victo­ <lb/>
            rious, they will not flee home again, but will march upon your <lb/>
            territories : and if you are victorious, your victory is not so <lb/>
            complete, as if, having crossed over into their territory, you <lb/>
            should conquer the Massagetæ, and pursue them in their flight; <lb/>
            for I will carry the comparison throughout, it is plain, that if <lb/>
            you are victorious over your adversaries you will march di­ <lb/>
            rectly into the dominions of Tomyris. In addition to what <lb/>
            has been now stated, it were a disgrace and intolerable, that <lb/>
            Cyrus the son of Cambyses should give way and retreat before <lb/>
            a woman. My opinion therefore is, that you should pass over <lb/>
            and advance as far as they retire; and then by the following <lb/>
            stratagem endeavour to get the better of them. As I hear, the <lb/>
            Massagetæ are unacquainted with the Persian luxuries, and <lb/>
            are unused to the comforts of life. My opinion then is, that <lb/>
            having cut up and dressed abundance of cattle, you should lay <lb/>
            out a feast in our camp for these men ; and besides, bowls of <lb/>
            unmixed wine without stint, and all other provisions ; and that <lb/>
            having done this, and having left the weakest part of your <lb/>
            army behind, the rest should return again towards the river; <lb/>
            for the Massagetæ, if I mistake not, when they see so much <lb/>
            excellent fare, will turn to immediately, and after that there <lb/>
            remains for us the display of mighty achievements."</p>
          <p>208. Now these two contrary opinions were given. Cyrus, <lb/>
            rejecting the former, and approving that of Crœsus, bade <lb/>
            Tomyris retire, for that he would cross over to her. She <lb/>
            accordingly retired, as she had promised at first. But <lb/>
            Cyrus having placed Croesus in the hands of his son Cam­ <lb/>
            byses, to whom he also intrusted the kingdom, and having <lb/>
            strictly charged him to honour Crœsus, and treat turn well, in <lb/>
            case his inroad on the Massagetæ should fail; having given <lb/>
            these injunctions, and sent them back to Persia, he himself <lb/>
            crossed the river with his army. 209. When he had passed <lb/>
            the Araxes, and night came on, he saw the following vision, <lb/>
            as he was sleeping in the country of the Massagetæ. Cyrus <lb/>
            fancied in his sleep that he saw the :Idest son of Hytaspes <pb n="91"/>
             <note type="margin">210, 211.] </note> <lb/>
            with wings on his shoulders; and that with one of these he <lb/>
            overshadowed Asia, and with the other Europe. Now Darius, <lb/>
            who was then about twenty years of age, was the eldest son <lb/>
            of Hystaspes son of Arsames, one of the Achæmenides; and <lb/>
            he had been left in Persia, for he had not yet attained the age <lb/>
            of military service. When therefore Cyrus awoke, he con­ <lb/>
            sidered his dream with attention ; and as it seemed to him of <lb/>
            great moment, he summoned Hystaspes, and taking him aside, <lb/>
            said, “Hystaspes, your son has been detected plotting against <lb/>
            me and my empire; and I will show you how I know it for a <lb/>
            certainty. The gods watch over me, and forewarn me of <lb/>
            every thing that is about to befal me. Now, in the past <lb/>
            night, as I was sleeping, I saw the eldest of your sons with <lb/>
            wings on his shoulders, and with one of these he overshadowed <lb/>
            Asia, and Europe with the other; from this vision, it cannot <lb/>
            be otherwise than that your son is forming designs against <lb/>
            me; do you therefore go back to Persia with all speed, and <lb/>
            take care, that when I have conquered these people, and re­ <lb/>
            turn home, you bring your son before me to be examined." <lb/>
            210. Cyrus spoke thus under a persuasion that Darius, was <lb/>
            plotting against him ; but the. deity forewarned him that he <lb/>
            himself would die in that very expedition, and that his kingdom <lb/>
            would devolve on Darius. Hystaspes however answered in <lb/>
            these words: "God forbid, 0 king, that a Persian should <lb/>
            be born who would plot against you ! But if any such there <lb/>
            be, may sudden destruction overtake him, for you have made <lb/>
            the Persians free instead of being slaves, and instead of being <lb/>
            ruled over by others, to rule over all: but if any vision informs <lb/>
            you that my son is forming any plot against you, I freely sur­ <lb/>
            render him to you to deal with as you please." Hystaspes, <lb/>
            having given this answer, repassed the Araxes and went to <lb/>
            Persia, for the purpose of keeping his son Darius in custody <lb/>
            for Cyrus.</p>
          <p>211. Cyrus having advanced one day's march from the <lb/>
            Araxes, proceeded to act according to the suggestion of Crœsus. <lb/>
            After this, when Cyrus and the effective part of the Persian <lb/>
            army had marched back to the Araxes, leaving the ineffective <lb/>
            part behind; a third division of the army of the Massagetæ <lb/>
            attacked those of Cyrus's forces that had been left behind, and <lb/>
            after some resistance, put them to death. Then, seeing the <unclear/> <lb/>
            f t laid out, as soon as they bad overcome their enemies they <pb n="92"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[212-214."/> <lb/>
            lay down and feasted ; and being filled with food and wine, <lb/>
            fell asleep. But the Persians having attacked them, put <lb/>
            many of them to death, and took a still greater number <lb/>
            prisoners, and among them the son of Queen Tomyris, who <lb/>
            commanded the Massagetæ, and whose name was Spargapises. <lb/>
            212. She, when she heard what had befallen her army and <lb/>
            her son, sent a herald to Cyrus with the following message: <lb/>
            " Cyrus, insatiate with blood, be not elated with what has <lb/>
            now happened, that by the fruit of the vine, with which ye <lb/>
            yourselves, when filled with it, so rave, that when it de­ <lb/>
            scends into your bodies, evil words float on your lips, be not <lb/>
            elated, that by such a poison you have deceived and con <lb/>
            quered my son, instead of by prowess in battle. Now, <lb/>
            however, take the good advice that I offer you. Restore <lb/>
            my son ; depart out of this country unpunished for hav­ <lb/>
            in- insolently disgraced a third division of the army of the <lb/>
            Massagetæ. But if you will not do this, I swear by the <lb/>
            sun, the Lord of the Massagetæ, that, insatiable as you are, <lb/>
            I will glut you with blood." 213. Cyrus, however, paid <lb/>
            no attention to this message; but Spargapises, the son of <lb/>
            Queen Tomyris, as soon as lie recovered from the effects of the <lb/>
            wine, and perceived in what a plight he was, begged of Cyrus <lb/>
            that he might be freed from his fetters ; but-as soon as be <lb/>
            was set free, and found his hands at liberty, he put himself to <lb/>
            death. Such was the end he met with. 214. But Tomyris, <lb/>
            finding Cyrus did not listen to her, assembled all her forces, <lb/>
            and engaged with him. I think that this battle was the most <lb/>
            obstinate that was ever fought between barbarians. And I <lb/>
            am informed that it took place in the following manner: it is <lb/>
            related, that, first of all, they stood at a distance and used their <lb/>
            bows, and that afterwards, when they had emptied their <lb/>
            quivers, they engaged in close fight with their swords and <lb/>
            spears, "and that thus they continued fighting for a long time, <lb/>
            and neither were willing to give way; but at length the Massa­ <lb/>
            getæ got the better, and the greater part of the Persian army <lb/>
            was cut in pieces on the spot, and Cyrus himself killed, after <lb/>
            he had reigned twenty-nine years. But Tomyris, having <lb/>
            filled a skin with human blood, sought for the body of Cyrus <lb/>
            among the slain of the Persians, and having found it, thrust <lb/>
            the head into the skin, and insulting the dead body, said : <lb/>
            " Thou hast indeed ruined me though alive and victorious in <pb n="93"/>
             <note type="margin">215, 216.] </note> <lb/>
            battle, since thou hast taken my son by stratagem; but I will <lb/>
            now glut thee with blood, as I threatened." Of the many <lb/>
            accounts given of the end of Cyrus, this appears to me most <lb/>
            worthy of credit.</p>
          <p>215. The Massagetæ resemble the Scythians in their dress <lb/>
            and mode of living ; they have both horse and foot ; for they <lb/>
            have some of each ; and bow-men, and javelin-men, who are <lb/>
            accustomed to carry battle-axes : they use gold and brass for <lb/>
            every thing ; for in whatever concerns spears, and arrow- <lb/>
            points, and battle-axes, they use brass ; but for the head, and <lb/>
            belts, and shoulder-pieces, they are ornamented with gold. <lb/>
            In like manner with regard to the chests of horses, they put <lb/>
            on breastplates of brass ; but the bridle-bit and cheek-pieces <lb/>
            are ornamented with gold. They make no use of silver or <lb/>
            iron, for neither of those metals are found in their country, <lb/>
            out they have brass and gold in abundance. 216. Their <lb/>
            manners are as follows : each man marries a wife, but they­ <lb/>
            use the wornen promiscuously ; for what the Grecians say the <lb/>
            Scythians do, is a mistake, for they do it not, but the Mas­ <lb/>
            sagetæ ; for when a Massagetan desires to have the company <lb/>
            of a woman he hangs up his quiver in front of herchariot.and <lb/>
            has intercourse with her without shame. No particular term <lb/>
            of life isprescribed to them ; but when a man has attained <lb/>
            a great age, all his kinsmen meet, and sacrifice him, together <lb/>
            with cattle of several kinds ; and when they have boiled the <lb/>
            flesh, they feast on it. This death they account the most <lb/>
            happy ; but they do not eat the bodies of those who die of dis­ <lb/>
            ease ; but bury them in the earth, and think it a great mis­ <lb/>
            fortune that they did not reach the age to be sacrificed. They <lb/>
            sow nothing, but live on cattle and fish, which the river <lb/>
            Araxes yields in abundance, and they are drinkers of milk. <lb/>
            They worship the sun only of all the gods, andsacrifice <lb/>
            horses to him ; and this is the reason of this custom ; they <lb/>
            thinkit right to offer the swiftest of all animals to the <lb/>
            swiftest of all the gods</p><pb n="94"/>

          <p>AFTER the death of Cyrus, Cambyses succeeded to the king­ <lb/>
            dom : he was son of Cyrus, and Cassandane the daughter of <lb/>
            Pharnaspes; who having died some time before, Cyrus both <lb/>
            deeply mourned for her himself, and commanded all his subjects <lb/>
            to mourn. Cambyses then, being son of this lady and Cyrus, <lb/>
            considered the Ionians and Æolians as his hereditary slaves <lb/>
            when, therefore, he made an expedition against Egypt, he took <lb/>
            with him others of his subjects, and also some of the Greeks <lb/>
            over whom he. bore rule.</p>
          <p>2. The Egyptians, before the reign of Psammitichus, con­ <lb/>
            sidered themselves to be the most ancient of mankind. But <lb/>
            after Psammitichus, having come to the throne, endeavoured <lb/>
            to ascertain who were the most ancient, from that time they <lb/>
            consider the Phrygians to have been before them, and them­ <lb/>
            selves before all others. Now, when Psammitichus was <lb/>
            unable, by inquiry, to discover any solution of this question, <lb/>
            who were the most ancient of men he devised the following <lb/>
            expedient. He gave two new-born children of poor parents <lb/>
            to a shepherd, to be brought up among his flocks in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner: he gave strict orders that no one should utter <lb/>
            a word in their presence, that they should lie in a solitary <lb/>
            room by themselves, and that he should bring goats to them <lb/>
            at certain times, and that when he had satisfied them with <lb/>
            milk he should attend to his other employments. Psammiti­ <lb/>
            chus contrived and ordered this, for the purpose of hearing <lb/>
            what word the. children would first articulate, after they had <lb/>
            given over their insignificant mewlings; and such accordingly <lb/>
            was the result. For when the shepherd had pursued this <lb/>
            plan for the space of two years, one day as he opened the door <lb/>
            and went in, both the children falling upon him, and holding <pb n="95"/>
             <note type="margin">3.4.] </note> <lb/>
            out their hands, cried "Becos." The shepherd, when he first <lb/>
            heard it, said nothing; but when this same word was con­ <lb/>
            stantly repeated to him whenever he went and tended the <lb/>
            children, he at length acquainted his master, and by his com­ <lb/>
            mand brought the children into his presence. When Psam­ <lb/>
            mitichus heard the same, he inquired what people call any thing <lb/>
            by the name of " Becos ;” and on inquiry he discovered that <lb/>
            the Phrygians call bread by that name. ■ Thus the Egyptians, <lb/>
            convinced by the above experiment, allowed that the Phrygi­ <lb/>
            ans were more ancient than themselves. 3. This relation I <lb/>
            had from the priests of Vulcan at Memphis. But the Greeks <lb/>
            tell many other foolish things, and moreover that Psammiti­ <lb/>
            chus, having had the tongues of some women cut out: then had <lb/>
            the children brought up by these women. Such is the ac­ <lb/>
            count they gave of the nurture of the children. I heard <lb/>
            other things also at Memphis in conversation with the priests <lb/>
            of Vulcan. And on this very account I went also to Thebes, <lb/>
            and to Heliopolis, in order to ascertain whether they would <lb/>
            agree with the accounts given at Memphis; for the Heliopoli­ <lb/>
            tans are esteemed the most learned in history of all the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians. The parts of the narration that I heard concerning di­ <lb/>
            vine things, I am not willing to relate, except only their <lb/>
            names; and with these I suppose all men are equally well ac­ <lb/>
            quainted : but what more I shall relate of these matters, I <lb/>
            shall relate from a necessity to keep up the thread of my story.</p>
          <p>4. But as concerns human affairs, they agree with one another <lb/>
            in the following account: that the Egyptians were the first to <lb/>
            discover the year, which they divided into twelve parts ; and <lb/>
            they say that they made this discovery from the stars: and so <lb/>
            far, I think, they act more wisely than the Grecians, in that <lb/>
            the Grecians insert an intercalary month every third year, on <lb/>
            account of the seasons; whereas the Egyptians, reckoning <lb/>
            twelve months of thirty days each, add five days each year <lb/>
            above that number, and so with them the circle of the seasons <lb/>
            comes round to the same point. They say also, that the <lb/>
            Egyptians were the first who introduced the names of the <lb/>
            twelve gods, and that the Greeks borrowed those names from <lb/>
            them; that they were the first to assign altars, images, and <lb/>
            temples to the gods, and to carve the figures of animals on stone; <lb/>
            and most of these things they proved were so in fact. They <lb/>
            added, that Menes was the first mortal who reigned (ver <pb n="96"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[5—8"/> <lb/>
            Egypt, and that in his time all Egypt, except the district of <lb/>
            Thebes, was a morass, and that no part of the land that now <lb/>
            exists below Lake Myris was then above water: to this place <lb/>
            from the sea is a seven days' passage up the river. 5. And <lb/>
            they seemed to me to give a good account of this region. For <lb/>
            it is evident to a man of common understanding, who has not <lb/>
            heard it before, but sees it, that the part of Egypt which the <lb/>
            Greeks frequent with their shipping, is land acquired by the <lb/>
            Egyptians, and a gift from the river; and the parts above this <lb/>
            lake, during a three days' passage, of which, however, they <lb/>
            said nothing, are of the same description. For the nature of <lb/>
            the soil of Egypt is of this kind; when you are first sailing to <lb/>
            it, and are at the distance of a day's sail from land, if you cast <lb/>
            the lead you will bring up mud, and will find yourself in eleven <lb/>
            fathoms water: this so far shows that there is an alluvial deposit.</p>
          <p>6. The length of Egypt along the sea-coast is sixty schœni, <lb/>
            according as we reckon it to extend from the Plinthinetic bay to <lb/>
            Lake Serbonis, near which Mount Casius stretches: from this <lb/>
            point then the length is sixty schœni. Now, all men who are <lb/>
            short of land measure their territory by fathoms ; but those who <lb/>
            are less short of land, by stades; and those who have much, by <lb/>
            parasangs; and such as have a very great extent; by schœni. <lb/>
            Now, a parasang is equal to thirty stades, and each schœnus, <lb/>
            which is an Egyptian measure, is equal to sixty stades. So the <lb/>
            whole coast of Egypt is three thousand six hundred stades in <lb/>
            length. 7. From thence, as far as Heliopolis, inland, Egypt <lb/>
            is wide, being all flat, without water, and a swamp. The dis­ <lb/>
            tance to Heliopolis, as one goes up from the sea, is about equal <lb/>
            in length to the road from Athens, that is to say, from the <lb/>
            altar of the twelve gods, to Pisa and the temple of Olympian <lb/>
            Jupiter. For whoever will compare these roads will find, by <lb/>
            computation, that the difference between them is but little, <lb/>
            not exceeding fifteen stades, for the road from Athens to Pisa <lb/>
            is only fifteen stades short of one thousand five hundred <lb/>
            stades; but the road from the sea to Heliopolis amounts to <lb/>
            just that number. 8. From Heliopolis upwards Egypt is <lb/>
            narrow, for on one side the mountain of Arabia extends from <lb/>
            north to south and south-west, stretching up continuously to <lb/>
            that which is called the Red Sea. In this mountain are the <lb/>
            stone quarries which were cut for the pyramids at Memphis ; <lb/>
            here, then the m untain, deviating turns to the parts above <pb n="97"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="0—11.]"/> <lb/>
            mentioned. But where its length is the greatest, 1 have <lb/>
            heard that it is a two months' journey from east to west; and <lb/>
            that eastward its confines produce frankincense. On that side <lb/>
            of Egypt which borders upon Libya extends another rocky <lb/>
            mountain, and covered with sand, on which the pyramids stand; <lb/>
            and this stretches in the same direction as that part of the <lb/>
            Arabian mountain that runs southward. So that from Heli­ <lb/>
            opolis, the territory which belongs to Egypt is not very ex­ <lb/>
            tensive ; but for four days' sail up the river it is very narrow. <lb/>
            Between the mountains before mentioned the land is level, and <lb/>
            in the narrowest part appeared to me to be not more than two <lb/>
            hundred stades in breadth, from the Arabian mountain to that <lb/>
            called the Libyan; but above this Egypt again becomes wide. <lb/>
            Such then is the character of this country. 9. From He­ <lb/>
            liopolis to Thebes is a voyage up of nine days; the length of <lb/>
            this journey is in stades four thousand eight hundred and <lb/>
            sixty, which amount to eighty-one schoeni. Now, if we com­ <lb/>
            pute these stades together, the coast of Egypt, as I before <lb/>
            explained, contains in length three thousand and six hundred <lb/>
            stades: how far it is from the sea inland as far as Thebes, I <lb/>
            will next show, namely, six thousand one hundred and twenty <lb/>
            stades; and from Thebes to the city called Elephantine, one <lb/>
            thousand eight hundred stades.</p>
          <p>10. The greater part of all this country, as the priests in­ <lb/>
            formed me, and as appeared to me also to be the case, has been <lb/>
            acquired by the Egyptians. For the space between the above- <lb/>
            mentioned mountains, that are situate beyond the city of <lb/>
            Memphis, seem to me to have been formerly a bay of the sea ; <lb/>
            as is the case also with the parts about Ilium, Teuthrania, <lb/>
            Ephesus, and the plain of the Mæander, if I may be per­ <lb/>
            mitted to compare small things with great; for of the rivers <lb/>
            that have thrown up the soil that forms these countries, 'not <lb/>
            one can justly be brought into comparison, as to size, with <lb/>
            any one of the five mouths of the Nile. But there are other <lb/>
            rivers not equal in size to the Nile, which have wrought great <lb/>
            works; of these I could mention the names, and amongst them <lb/>
            one of the most remarkable is the Achelous, which, flow­ <lb/>
            ing through Acarnania, and falling into the sea, has already <lb/>
            converted one-half of the Echinades islands into continent. <lb/>
            11. There is also in the Arabian territory, not far from <lb/>
            Egypt, branching from the Red Sea, a bay of the sea, of the <note type="footnote">a </note> <pb n="98"/>
             <note type="margin">[12, 13 </note> <lb/>
            length and width I shall here describe : the length of the <lb/>
            voyage, beginning from the innermost part of this bay to the <lb/>
            broad sea, occupies forty days for a vessel with oars; and the <lb/>
            width, where the bay is widest, half a day's passage: and in <lb/>
            it an ebb and flow takes place daily; and I am of opinion <lb/>
            that Egypt was formerly a similar bay; this stretching from <lb/>
            the Northern Sea towards Ethiopia; and the Arabian Bay, <lb/>
            which I am describing, from the south towards Syria; and that <lb/>
            they almost perforated their recesses so as to meet each other, <lb/>
            overlapping * to some small extent. Now, if the Nile were to <lb/>
            turn its stream into this Arabian gulf, what could hinder it <lb/>
            from being filled with soil by the river within twenty thousand <lb/>
            years? for my part, I think it would be filled within ten <lb/>
            thousand. How then, in the time that has elapsed before I <lb/>
            was born, might not even a much greater bay than this <lb/>
            have been filled up by such a great and powerful river? <lb/>
            12. I therefore both give credit to those who relate these <lb/>
            things concerning Egypt, and am myself persuaded of their <lb/>
            truth, when I see that Egypt projects beyond the adjoin­ <lb/>
            ing land; that shells are found on the mountains ; that a <lb/>
            saline humour forms on the surface so as even to corrode the <lb/>
            pyramids; and that this mountain which is above Memphis is <lb/>
            the only one in Egypt that abounds in sand: add to which, <lb/>
            that Egypt, in its soil, is neither like Arabia or its confines, <lb/>
            nor Libya, nor Syria, (Syrians occupy the sea-coast of Arabia,) <lb/>
            but is black and crumbling, as if it were mud and alluvial do­ <lb/>
            posit, brought down by the river from Ethiopia; whereas we <lb/>
            know that the earth of Libya is reddish, and somewhat more <lb/>
            sandy; and that of Arabia and Syria is more clayey and flinty.</p>
          <p>13. The priests told me this also, as a great proof of what <lb/>
            they related concerning this country, that in the reign of <lb/>
            Mœris, when the river rose at least eight cubits, it irrigated all <lb/>
            Egypt below Memphis; and yet Mœris had not been nine <lb/>
            hundred years dead when I received this information. But <lb/>
            now, unless the river rises sixteen cubits, or fifteen at least, it <lb/>
            does not overflow the country. It appears to me, therefore, <lb/>
            that if the soil continues to grow in height, in the same pro­ <lb/>
            portion, and to contribute in like manner towards its increase, <note type="footnote"> *I have adopted the meaning given to <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλλάσσοντας</foreign> by Liddell <lb/>
            and Scott, instead of the usual interpretation, that " the two bays were <lb/>
            but little distant from each other." </note><pb n="99"/>
             <note type="margin">14, 15.] <lb/>
            </note>those Egyptians below Lake Mœris, who inhabit other districts <lb/>
            and that which is called Delta, must, by reason of the Nile not <lb/>
            overflowing their land, for ever suffer the same calamity which <lb/>
            they used to say the Greeks would suffer from. For having <lb/>
            heard that all the lands of Greece were watered by rain, and <lb/>
            not by rivers, as their own was, they said " that the Grecians <lb/>
            at some time or other would be disappointed in their great <lb/>
            expectations, and suffer miserably from famine;" meaning, <lb/>
            " that if the deity should not vouchsafe rain to them, but visit <lb/>
            them with a long drought, the Greeks must perish by famine, <lb/>
            since they had no other resource for water, except from Jupiter <lb/>
            only." 14. And the Egyptians are right in saying this to the <lb/>
            Greeks; but now let me state how the matter stands with the <lb/>
            Egyptians themselves: if, as I said before, the land below <lb/>
            Memphis (for this it is that increases) should continue to in­ <lb/>
            crease in height in the same proportion as it has in time past, <lb/>
            what else will happen but that the Egyptians who inhabit this <lb/>
            part will starve, if their land shall neither be watered by <lb/>
            rain, nor the river be able to inundate the fields ? Now indeed <lb/>
            they gather in the fruits of the earth with less labour than any <lb/>
            other people, and than the rest of the Egyptians, for they have <lb/>
            not the toil of breaking up the furrows with the plough, nor <lb/>
            of hoeing, nor of any other work which all other men must <lb/>
            labour at to obtain a crop of corn ; but when the river has <lb/>
            come of its own accord and irrigated their fields, and having <lb/>
            irrigated them has subsided, then each man sows his own land <lb/>
            and turns swine into it; and when the seed has been trodden <lb/>
            in by the swine, he afterwards waits for harvest-time: then <lb/>
            having trod out the corn with his swine, he gathers it in</p>
          <p>15. But if we should adopt the opinion of the Ionians re­ <lb/>
            specting Egypt, who say that the Delta alone is properly <lb/>
            Egypt, stating that its sea-coast extends from what is called <lb/>
            the tower of Perseus to the Tarichæa of Pelusium, forty <lb/>
            schœni in length; and who say that from the sea inland it <lb/>
            stretches to the city of Cercasorus, where the Nile divides, <lb/>
            and flows towards Pelusium and Canopus; and who attribute <lb/>
            the rest of Egypt, partly to Libya, and partly to Arabia,-if <lb/>
            we adopted this account, we should show that the Egyptians <lb/>
            had not formerly any country of their own ; for the Delta, as <lb/>
            the Egyptians themselves acknowledge, and as I think, is <lb/>
            alluvial, and (if I may so express myself) has lately come to <note type="footnote">11 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin"> 16. 17. </note> <lb/>
            light. If then they formerly had no country, how foolish they <lb/>
            were to think themselves the most ancient of all people ! nor <lb/>
            was there any use in their having recourse to the experiment <lb/>
            of the children, to ascertain what language they would first <lb/>
            speak. For my own part, I am not of opinion that the <lb/>
            Egyptians commenced their existence with the country which <lb/>
            the Ionians call Delta ; but that they always were, since men <lb/>
            have been ; and that as the soil gradually increased, many of <lb/>
            them remained in their former habitations, and many came <lb/>
            lower down. For, anciently, Thebes was called Egypt, and <lb/>
            is six thousand one hundred and twenty stades in circum­ <lb/>
            ference. 16. If, therefore, I judge correctly of these things, the <lb/>
            Ionians are mistaken with respect to Egypt; but if their <lb/>
            opinion is correct, then I will show that neither the Greeks <lb/>
            nor the Ionians themselves know how to reckon, when they <lb/>
            say, that the whole earth consists of three divisions, Europe, <lb/>
            Asia, and Libya ; for they ought to add a fourth, the Delta of <lb/>
            Egypt, if it be not a part either of Asia or of Libya. For, by <lb/>
            this account, the Nile does not separate Asia from Libya, but <lb/>
            is divided at the point of Delta, so that it must be between <lb/>
            Asia and Libya. But I will dismiss the opinion of the <lb/>
            lonians, and proceed to give ray own account of the matter. <lb/>
            17. I consider that the whole country inhabited by Egyptians <lb/>
            is Egypt, as that inhabited by Cilicians is Cilicia, and that by <lb/>
            Assyrians, Assyria. And, strictly speaking, I know of no <lb/>
            other boundary to Asia and Libya, except the frontier of <lb/>
            Egypt. But if we follow the opinion received by the. Greeks, <lb/>
            we shall suppose that all Egypt, beginning from the cata­ <lb/>
            racts and the city of Elephantine, is divided into two parts, <lb/>
            and partakes of both names ; and that one part belongs to <lb/>
            Libya, and the other to Asia. For the Nile, beginning from the <lb/>
            cataracts, flows to the sea, dividing Egypt in the middle. Now, <lb/>
            as far as the city of Cercasorus, the Nile flows in one stream ; <lb/>
            but from that point it is divided into three channels: and that <lb/>
            which runs eastward is called the Pelusiac mouth ; another <lb/>
            uf the channels bends westward, and is called the Canopic <lb/>
            mouth ; but the direct channel of the Nile is the following : <lb/>
            descending from above, it comes to the point of the Delta, <lb/>
            and after this it divides the Delta in the middle, and dis­ <lb/>
            charges itself into the sea, supplying by this channel, not by <lb/>
            any means the least quantity of water, nor that the least re- <pb n="101"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="18—20"/> <lb/>
            nowned , this is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are <lb/>
            also two other mouths, that diverge from the Sebennytic and <lb/>
            flow into the sea; to these the following names are given, to <lb/>
            one the Saitic, to the other tne Mendesian mouth. The <lb/>
            Bolbitine and Bucolic mouths are not natural, but artificial <lb/>
            18. My opinion that Egypt is of the extent I have above de­ <lb/>
            clared it to be, is confirmed by an oracle delivered at Ammon. <lb/>
            which I heard after I had formed my own opinion respecting <lb/>
            Egypt. For the people who inhabit the cities of Marea and <lb/>
            Apis, in the part of Egypt bordering on Libya, deeming <lb/>
            themselves Libyans and not Egyptians, and being discontented <lb/>
            with the institutions regarding victims, were desirous not to <lb/>
            be restricted from the use of cow's flesh, and therefore sent to <lb/>
            Ammon, saying, "that they had no relation to the Egyptians, <lb/>
            because they lived out of Delta, and did not speak the same <lb/>
            language with them ; and desired to be allowed to eat all <lb/>
            manner of food." The god, however, did not permit them to <lb/>
            do so, saying, "that all the country which the Nile irrigated <lb/>
            was Egypt, and that all those were Egyptians who dwell be­ <lb/>
            low the city Elephantine, and drink of that river. Such <lb/>
            was the answer given them. 19. But the Nile, when full, <lb/>
            inundates not only Delta, but also part of the country said to <lb/>
            belong to Libya and Arabia, to the extent of about two days' <lb/>
            journey on either side, more or less.</p>
          <p>Respecting the nature of this river, I was unable to gain <lb/>
            any information, either from the priests or any one else. I <lb/>
            was very desirous, however, of learning from them why the <lb/>
            Nile, beginning at the summer solstice, fills and overflows for <lb/>
            a hundred days; and when it has nearly completed this num <lb/>
            her of days, falls short in its stream, and retires; so that it <lb/>
            continues low all the winter, until the return of the summer <lb/>
            solstice. Of these particulars I could get no information from <lb/>
            the Egyptians, though I inquired whether this river have <lb/>
            any peculiar quality that makes it differ in nature from other <lb/>
            rivers. Being anxious, then, of knowing what was said about <lb/>
            this matter, I made inquiries, and also how it comes to pass, <lb/>
            that this is the only one of all rivers that does not send forth <lb/>
            breezes from its surface. 20. Nevertheless some of the <lb/>
            Greeks, wishing to be distinguished for their wisdom, 'ave <lb/>
            attempted to account for these inundations in three different <lb/>
            ways : two of these ways are scarcely worth ning ex- <pb n="102"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[21-24"/> <lb/>
            cept that I wish to show what they are. One of them says | <lb/>
            that the Etesian winds are the cause of the swelling of the <lb/>
            river, by preventing the Nile from discharging itself into the <lb/>
            sea. But frequently the Etesian winds have not blown, yet <lb/>
            the Nile produces the same effects ; besides, if the Etesian <lb/>
            winds were the cause, all other rivers that flow opposite to <lb/>
            the same winds, must of necessity be equally affected and in <lb/>
            the same manner as the Nile ; and even so much the more, as <lb/>
            they are less and have weaker currents : yet there are many <lb/>
            rivers in Syria, and many in Libya, which are not all affected <lb/>
            as the Nile is. 21. The second opinion shows still more <lb/>
            ignorance than the former, but, if I may so say, is more mar­ <lb/>
            vellous. It says that the Nile, flowing from the ocean, pro­ <lb/>
            duces this effect; and that the ocean flows all round the earth. <lb/>
            22. The third way of resolving this difficulty is by far the <lb/>
            most specious, but most untrue. For by saying that the Nile <lb/>
            flows from melted snow, it says nothing, for this river flows <lb/>
            from Libya through the middle of Ethiopia and discharges <lb/>
            itself into Egypt; how therefore, since it runs from a very <lb/>
            hot to a colder region, can it flow from snow ? Many reasons <lb/>
            will readily occur to men of good understanding, to show the <lb/>
            improbability of its flowing from snow. The first and chief <lb/>
            proof is derived from the winds, which blow hot from <lb/>
            those regions: the second is, that the country, destitute of <lb/>
            rain, is always free from ice ; but after snow has fallen, it <lb/>
            must of necessity rain within five days; so that if snow fell, <lb/>
            it would also rain in these regions. In the third place, the <lb/>
            inhabitants become black from the excessive heat; kites and <lb/>
            swallows continue there all the year ; and the cranes, to avoid <lb/>
            the cold of Scythia, migrate to these parts as winter quarters : <lb/>
            if then ever so little snow fell in this country through which the <lb/>
            Nile flows, and from which it derives its source, none of these <lb/>
            things would happen, as necessity proves. 23. But the per­ <lb/>
            son who speaks about the ocean, since he has referred his ac­ <lb/>
            count to some obscure fable, produces no conviction at all; <lb/>
            for I do not know any river called the Ocean ; but suppose <lb/>
            that Homer, or some other ancient poet, having invented the <lb/>
            name, introduced it into poetry.</p>
          <p>24. Yet if, after I have found fault with the opinions ad­ <lb/>
            vanced by others, it becomes me to declare my own concern­ <lb/>
            ing so obscure a question, I will describe what, in my opinion, <pb n="103"/>
             <note type="margin">25.26.] </note> <lb/>
            causes the Nile to overflow in summer. During the winter <lb/>
            season, the sun, being driven by storms from his former course, <lb/>
            retires to the upper parts of Libya: this in few words com­ <lb/>
            prehends the whole matter ; for it is natural that that country <lb/>
            which this god is nearest to, and over which he is, should be <lb/>
            most in want of water, and that the native river streams <lb/>
            should be dried up. 25. But to explain my meaning more at <lb/>
            length, the case is this : the sun passing over the upper parts <lb/>
            of Libya, produces the following effect; as the air in these re­ <lb/>
            gions is always serene, and the soil always hot, since there are <lb/>
            no cold winds passing over, he produces just the same <lb/>
            effect, as he usually does in the summer, when passing through <lb/>
            the middle of the firmament; for he attracts the water to him­ <lb/>
            self, and having so attracted it, throws it back upon the higher <lb/>
            regions ; there the winds, taking it up and dispersing it, melt <lb/>
            it: and therefore, with good reason, the winds that blow from <lb/>
            this country, from the south and south-west, are by far the most <lb/>
            rainy of all. I do not think, however, that the sun on each <lb/>
            occasion discharges the annual supply of water from the Nile, <lb/>
            but that some remains about him. When, however, the wintei <lb/>
            grows mild, the sun returns again to the middle of the hea <lb/>
            vens, and from that time attracts water equally from all rivers <lb/>
            Up to this time those other rivers, having much rain-watei <lb/>
            mixed with them, flow with full streams: but as the coun <lb/>
            try has been watered by showers and torn up by torrents <lb/>
            when the showers fail them, and they are attracted in summer <lb/>
            by the sun, they become weak, but the Nile, being destitute <lb/>
            of rain, and attracted by the sun, is the only river that with <lb/>
            good reason flows much weaker, than usual at this time. <lb/>
            than in summer; for in summer it is attracted equally with <lb/>
            all other waters, but in winter it alone is hard pressed. Thus <lb/>
            I consider that the sun is the cause of these things. <unclear/> 26. The <lb/>
            same cause in my opinion occasions also the dryness of the <lb/>
            air in these parts, the sun scorching every thing in his passage <lb/>
            in consequence of this, heat always prevails in the upper <lb/>
            parts of Libya. But if the order of the seasons were changed, <lb/>
            and that part of the heaven where the north and winter are <lb/>
            now placed could be made the position of the south and mid- <lb/>
            day, and the north were transferred to the south, if such a <lb/>
            change were made, the sun, driven from the middle of the fir­ <lb/>
            mament by the winter and the north wind, would go to the <lb/>
            upper parts of Europe, as he now does through those of Libya; <pb n="104"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[27–29"/> <lb/>
            and I suppose he would produce in his passage the same effects <lb/>
            on the Ister, which he now does on the Nile. 27. Then with <lb/>
            regard to the reason why no breezes blow from the Nile; my <lb/>
            opinion is, that it is very improbable they should blow from <lb/>
            hot countries, for they generally blow from some cold one.</p>
          <p>28. But I leave these things as they are, and as they were <lb/>
            at the beginning. With respect to the sources of the Nile, no <lb/>
            man of all the Egyptians, Libyans, or Grecians with whom I <lb/>
            have 'conversed, ever pretended to know any thing ; except <lb/>
            the registrar of Minerva's treasury at Sais in Egypt. He indeed <lb/>
            seemed to be trifling with me, when he said he knew perfectly <lb/>
            well; yet his account was as follows : “ That there are two <lb/>
            mountains rising into a sharp peak, situated between the city <lb/>
            of Syene in Thebais and Elephantine; the names ofthesemoun­ <lb/>
            tains are, the one Crophi, the other Mophi ; that the sources of <lb/>
            the Nile, which are bottomless, flow from between these moun­ <lb/>
            tains ; and that half of the water flows over Egypt, and to the <lb/>
            north, the other half over Ethiopia and the south. That the <lb/>
            fountains of the Nile are bottomless, he said, Psammitichus king <lb/>
            of Egypt proved by experiment; for having caused a line to be <lb/>
            twisted many thousand fathoms in length, he let it down, but <lb/>
            could not find a bottom." Such then was the opinion the regis­ <lb/>
            trar gave, if indeed he spoke the real truth ; proving, in my <lb/>
            opinion, that there are strong whirlpools and an eddy here; so <lb/>
            that the water beating against the rocks, a sounding line, when <lb/>
            let down, cannot reach the bottom. 29. I was unable to learn <lb/>
            any thing more from any one else. But thus much I learnt by <lb/>
            carrying my researches as far as possible, having gone and made <lb/>
            my own observations as far as Elephantine, and beyond that <lb/>
            obtaining information from hearsay. As one ascends the river <lb/>
            above the city of Elephantine, the country is steep; here <lb/>
            therefore it is necessary to attach a rope on both sides of a <lb/>
            boat as one does with an ox in a plough, and so proceed; but <lb/>
            if the rope should happen to break, the boat is carried away <lb/>
            by the force of the stream. This kind of country lasts for a <lb/>
            four days' passage, and the Nile here winds as much as the <lb/>
            Mæander. There are twelve schoeni, which it is necessary to <lb/>
            sail through in this manner; and after that you will come to <lb/>
            a level plain, where the Nile flows round an island; its name <lb/>
            is Tachompso. Ethiopians inhabit the country immediately <lb/>
            above Elephantine, and one half of the Island ; the other half <pb n="105"/>
             <note type="margin">30.] <lb/>
            </note>is inhabited by Egyptians. Near to this island lies a vast lake, <lb/>
            on the borders of which Ethiopian nomades dwell; after sail­ <lb/>
            in,,,,-through this lake, you will come to the channel of the <lb/>
            Nile, which flows into it: then you will have to land and <lb/>
            travel forty days by the side of the river, for sharp rocks rise <lb/>
            in the Nile, and there are many sunken ones, through which <lb/>
            it is not possible to navigate a boat: having passed this coun­ <lb/>
            try in the forty days, you must go on board another boat, and <lb/>
            sail for twelve days; and then you will arrive at a large city, <lb/>
            called Meroe : this city is said to be the capital of all Ethiopia. <lb/>
            The inhabitants worship no other gods than Jupiter and Bac­ <lb/>
            chus ; but these they honour with great magnificence ; they <lb/>
            have also an oracle of Jupiter ; and they make war, whenever <lb/>
            that god bids them by an oracular warning, and against what­ <lb/>
            ever country he bids them. 30. Sailing from this city, you <lb/>
            will arrive at the country of the Automoli, in a space of time <lb/>
            equal to that which you took in coming from Elephantine to <lb/>
            the capital of the Ethiopians. These Automoli are called by <lb/>
            the name of Asmak, which in the language of Greece signi­ <lb/>
            ties, " those that stand at the left hand of the king." These, <lb/>
            to the number of two hundred and forty thousand of the <lb/>
            Egyptian war-tribe, revolted to the Ethiopians on the follow­ <lb/>
            ing occasion. In the reign of king Psammitichus garrisons <lb/>
            were stationed at Elephantine against the Ethiopians, and­ <lb/>
            another at the Pelusian Daphnæ against the Arabians and <lb/>
            Syrians, and another at Marea against Libya; and even in <lb/>
            my time garrisons of the Persians are stationed in the same <lb/>
            places as they were in the time of Psammitichus, for they <lb/>
            maintain guards at Elephantine and Daphnæ. Now these <lb/>
            Egyptians, after they had been on duty three years, were not <lb/>
            relieved ; therefore having consulted together, and come to an <lb/>
            unanimous resolution, they all revolted from Psammitichus, <lb/>
            and went to Ethiopia. Psammitichus, hearing of this, pur­ <lb/>
            sued them: and when he overtook them, he entreated them, <lb/>
            by many arguments, and adjured them not to forsake the gods <lb/>
            of their fathers, and their children and wives. But one of <lb/>
            them is reported to have uncovered his private parts, and to <lb/>
            have said, "that wheresoever these were, there they should <lb/>
            find both children and wives." These men, when they arrived <lb/>
            in Ethiopia, offered their services to the king of the Ethiopi­ <lb/>
            ans, who made them the following recompence. There were <pb n="106"/>
             <note type="margin">[31, 32 </note> <lb/>
            certain Ethiopians disaffected towards him ; these he bade <lb/>
            them expel, and take possession of their land : by the settle­ <lb/>
            ment of these men among the Ethiopians, the Ethiopians be­ <lb/>
            came more civilized, and learned the manners of the Egyptians.</p>
          <p>31. Now for a voyage and land journey of four months, <lb/>
            the Nile is known, in addition to the part of the stream that <lb/>
            is in Egypt. For upon computation, so many months are <lb/>
            known to be spent by a person who travels from Elephantine <lb/>
            to the Automoli. This river flows from the west and the set­ <lb/>
            ting of the sun ; but beyond this no one is able to speak with <lb/>
            certainty, for the rest of the country is desert by reason of the <lb/>
            excessive heat. 32. But I have heard the following account <lb/>
            from certain Cyrenæans, who say that they went to the oracle <lb/>
            of Ammon, and had a conversation with Etearchus king of this <lb/>
            Ammonians; and that, among other subjects, they happened <lb/>
            to discourse about the Nile,-that nobody knew its sources: <lb/>
            whereupon Etearchus said, that certain Nasamonians once <lb/>
            came to him; this nation is Lybian and inhabits the Syrtis, <lb/>
            and the country for no great distance eastward of the Syrtis ; <lb/>
            and that when these Nasamonians arrived, and were asked if <lb/>
            they could give any further information touching the deserts <lb/>
            of Libya, they answered, that there were some daring youths <lb/>
            amongst them, sons of powerful men; and that they, having <lb/>
            reached man's estate, formed many other extravagant plans, <lb/>
            and moreover chose five of their number by lot to explore the <lb/>
            deserts of Libya, to see if they could make any further dis­ <lb/>
            covery than those who had penetrated the farthest. (For as <lb/>
            respects the parts of Libya along the Northern Sea, beginning <lb/>
            from Egypt to the promontory of Solois, where is the extrem­ <lb/>
            ity of Libya, Libyans and various nations of Libyans reach all <lb/>
            along it, except those parts which are occupied by Grecians <lb/>
            and Phoenicians : but as respects the parts above the sea, and <lb/>
            those nations which reach down to the sea, in the upper parts <lb/>
            Libya is infested by wild beasts ; and all beyond that is sand, <lb/>
            dreadfully short of water, and utterly desolate.) They further <lb/>
            related, "that when the young men deputed by their corn <lb/>
            panions set out, well furnished with water and provisions, <lb/>
            they passed first through the inhabited country; and having <lb/>
            traversed this, they came to the region infested by wild beasts; <lb/>
            and after this they crossed the desert, making their way to­ <lb/>
            wards the west; and when they had traversed much sandy <pb n="107"/>
             <note type="margin">33, 34.] </note> <lb/>
            ground, during a journey of many days, they at length saw <lb/>
            some trees growing in a plain; and that they approached and <lb/>
            began to gather the fruit that grew on the trees; and while <lb/>
            they were gathering, some diminutive men, less than men of <lb/>
            middle stature, came up, and having seized them carried them <lb/>
            away; and that the Nasamonians did not at all understand <lb/>
            their language, nor those who carried them off the language <lb/>
            of the Nasamonians. However, they conducted them through <lb/>
            vast morasses, and when they had passed these, they came to <lb/>
            a. city, in which all the inhabitants were of the same size as <lb/>
            their conductors, and black in colour : and by the city flowed <lb/>
            a great river, running from the west to the east, and that <lb/>
            crocodiles were seen in it." 33. Thus far I have set forth the <lb/>
            account of Etearchus the Ammonian ; to which may be added, <lb/>
            as the Cyrenæans assured me, " that he said the Nasamonians <lb/>
            all returned safe to their own country, and that the men whom <lb/>
            they came to were all necromancers." Etearchus also conjec <lb/>
            tured that this river, which flows by their city, is the Nile ; <lb/>
            and reason so evinces : for the Nile flows from Libya, and in-. <lb/>
            tersects it in the middle; and (as I conjecture, inferring things <lb/>
            unknown from things known) it sets out from a point corre­ <lb/>
            sponding with the Ister. For the Ister, beginning from the <lb/>
            Celts, and the city of Pyrene, divides Europe in its course : <lb/>
            but the Celts are beyond the pillars of Hercules, and border <lb/>
            on the territories of the Cynesians, who lie in the extremity <lb/>
            of Europe to the westward; and the Ister terminates by flow­ <lb/>
            ing through all Europe into the Euxine Sea, where a Milesian <lb/>
            colony is settled in Istria. 34. Now the Ister, as it flows <lb/>
            through a well-peopled country, is generally known; but no one <lb/>
            is able to speak about the sources of the Nile, because Libya, <lb/>
            through which it flows, is uninhabited and desolate. Respect­ <lb/>
            ing this stream, therefore, as far as I was able to reach by in­ <lb/>
            quiry, I have already spoken. It however discharges itself <lb/>
            into Egypt; and Egypt lies, as near: as may be, opposite to <lb/>
            the mountains of Cilicia ; from whence to Sinope, on the <lb/>
            Euxine Sea, is a five days' journey in a straight line to an <lb/>
            active man ; and Sinope is opposite to the Ister, where it dis­ <lb/>
            charges itself into the sea. So I think that the Nile, traversing <lb/>
            the whole of Libya, may be properly compared with the Ister. <lb/>
            Such, then, is the account that I am able to give respecting <lb/>
            the Nile.</p><pb n="108"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[35-37"/>
          <p>35. I now proceed to give a more particular account 01 <lb/>
            Egypt; it possesses more wonders than any other country, and <lb/>
            exhibits works greater than can be described, in comparison <lb/>
            with all other regions ; therefore more must be said about it. <lb/>
            The Egyptians, besides having a climate peculiar to them­ <lb/>
            selves, and a river differing in its nature from all other rivers, <lb/>
            have adopted customs and usages in almost every respect dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from the rest of mankind. Amongst them the women <lb/>
            attend markets and traffic, but the men stay at home and <lb/>
            weave. Other nations, in weaving, throw the wool upwards; <lb/>
            the Egyptians, downwards. The men carry burdens on their <lb/>
            heads ; the women, on their shoulders. The women stand up <lb/>
            when they make water, but the men sit down. They ease <lb/>
            themselves in their houses, but eat out of doors ; alleging that, <lb/>
            whatever is indecent, though necessary, ought to be done in <lb/>
            private; but what is not indecent, openly. No woman can <lb/>
            serve the office for any god or goddess ; but men are em­ <lb/>
            ployed for both offices. Sons are not compelled to support <lb/>
            their parents unless they choose, but daughters are compelled <lb/>
            to do so, whether they choose or not. 36. In other countries <lb/>
            the priests of the gods wear long hair; in Egypt they have <lb/>
            it shaved. With other men it is customary in mourning for <lb/>
            the nearest relations to have their heads shorn; the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians, on occasions of death, let the hair grow both on the <lb/>
            head and face, though till then used to shave. Other men <lb/>
            live apart from beasts ; but the Egyptians live with them. <lb/>
            Others feed on wheat and barley, but it is a very great disgrace <lb/>
            for an Egyptian to make food of them ; but they make bread <lb/>
            from spelt, which some call zea. They knead the dough with <lb/>
            their feet; but mix clay and take up dung with their hands. <lb/>
            Other men leave their private parts as they are formed by <lb/>
            nature, except those who have learnt otherwise from them ; <lb/>
            but the Egyptians are circumcised. Every man wears two <lb/>
            garments ;the women, but one. Other men fasten the rings <lb/>
            and sheets of their sails outside; but the Egyptians, inside. <lb/>
            The Grecians write and cipher, moving the hand from left <lb/>
            to right; but the Egyptians, from right to left: and doing so <lb/>
            they say they do it right-ways, and the Greeks left-ways <lb/>
            They have two sorts of letters, one of which is called sacred, <lb/>
            the other common.</p>
          <p>37. They are of all men the most excessively attentive to <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> 38, 39.] </note> <lb/>
            the worship of the gods, and observe the following ceremo­ <lb/>
            nies. They drink from cups of brass, which they scour every <lb/>
            day; nor is this custom practised by some and neglected by <lb/>
            others, but all do it. They wear linen garments, constantly <lb/>
            fresh washed, and they pay particular attention to this. They <lb/>
            are circumcised for the sake of cleanliness, thinking it better <lb/>
            to be clean than handsome. The priests shave their whole <lb/>
            body every third day, that neither lice nor any other impurity <lb/>
            may be found upon them when engaged in the service of the <lb/>
            gods. The priests wear linen only, and shoes of byblus, and <lb/>
            are not permitted to wear any other garments, or other shoes. <lb/>
            They wash themselves in cold water twice every day, and <lb/>
            twice every night; and, in a word, they use a number of ce­ <lb/>
            remonies. On the other hand, they enjoy no slight advantages, <lb/>
            for they do not consume or expend any of their private <lb/>
            property; but sacred food is cooked for them, and a great <lb/>
            quantity of beef and geese is allowed each of them every day, <lb/>
            and wine from the grape is given them ; but they may not <lb/>
            taste of fish. Beans the Egyptians do not sow at all in their <lb/>
            country, neither do they eat those that happen to grow there, <lb/>
            nor taste them when dressed. The priests, indeed, abhor the <lb/>
            sight of that pulse, accounting it impure. The service of each <lb/>
            god is performed, not by one, but by many priests, of <lb/>
            whom one is chief priest; and, when any one of them dies, his <lb/>
            son is put in his place. 38. The male kine they deem sacred <lb/>
            to Epaphus, and to that end prove them in the following <lb/>
            manner. If the examiner finds one black hair upon him, he <lb/>
            adjudges him to be unclean ; and one of the priests appointed <lb/>
            for this purpose makes this examination, both when the ani­ <lb/>
            mal is standing up and lying down ; and he draws out the <lb/>
            tongue, to see if it is pure as to the prescribed marks, which I <lb/>
            shall mention in another part of my history. He also looks <lb/>
            at the hairs of his tail, whether they grow naturally. If the <lb/>
            beast is found pure in all these respects, he marks it by roll­ <lb/>
            ing a piece of byblus round the horns, and then having put on it <lb/>
            some sealing earth, he impresses it with his signet; and so they <lb/>
            drive him away. Any one who sacrifices one that is unmark­ <lb/>
            ed, is punished with death. In this manner the animal is <lb/>
            proved. 39. The established mode of sacrifice is this: having <lb/>
            led the victim, properly marked, to the altar where they in­ <lb/>
            fend to sacrifice, they kindle a fire. Then having poured <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="margin">[40, 41 </note> <lb/>
            wine upon the altar, near the victim, and having invoked <lb/>
            the god, they kill it; and after they have killed it, they cut <lb/>
            off the head ; but they flay the body of the animal: then hav­ <lb/>
            ing pronounced many imprecations on the head, they who <lb/>
            have a market and Grecian merchants dwelling amongst them, <lb/>
            carry it there, and having so done, they usually sell it; but <lb/>
            they who have no Grecians amongst them, throw it into the <lb/>
            river : and they pronounce the following imprecations on the <lb/>
            head : " If any evil is about to befal either those that now <lb/>
            sacrifice, or Egypt in general, may it be averted on this <lb/>
            head." With respect, then, to the heads of beasts that are sa­ <lb/>
            crificed, and to the making libations of wine, all the Egyptians <lb/>
            observe the same customs in all sacrifices alike : and from <lb/>
            this custom no Egyptian will taste of the head of any animal. <lb/>
            40. But a different mode of disembowelling and burning the <lb/>
            victims prevails in different sacrifices. I proceed therefore <lb/>
            to speak of the practice with regard to the goddess whom they <lb/>
            consider the greatest, and in whose honour they celebrate the <lb/>
            most magnificent festival.. When they have flayed the bul­ <lb/>
            locks, having first offered up prayers, they take out all the <lb/>
            intestines, and leave the vitals with the fat in the carcass: <lb/>
            and they then cut off the legs and the extremity of the hip, <lb/>
            with the shoulders and neck, and having done this, they fill <lb/>
            the body of the bullock with fine bread, honey, raisins, figs, <lb/>
            frankincense, myrrh, and other perfumes ; and after they <lb/>
            have filled it with these, they burn it, pouring on it a great <lb/>
            quantity of oil They sacrifice after they have fasted ; and <lb/>
            while the sacred things are being burnt, they all beat them­ <lb/>
            selves ; and when they have done beating themselves, they <lb/>
            spread a banquet of what remains of the victims.</p>
          <p>41. All the Egyptians therefore sacrifice the pure male <lb/>
            kine and calves, but they are not allowed to sacrifice the fe­ <lb/>
            males, for they are sacred to Isis ; for the image of Isis is <lb/>
            made in the form of a woman with the horns of a cow, as the <lb/>
            Grecians represent 10 ; and all Egyptians alike pay a far <lb/>
            greater reverence to cows than to any other cattle. So that <lb/>
            no Egyptian man or woman will kiss a Grecian on the mouth ; <lb/>
            or use the knife, spit, or caldron of a Greek, or taste of the <lb/>
            flesh of a pure ox that has been divided by a Grecian knife. <lb/>
            They bury the kinethat die in the following manner ; the <lb/>
            females they throw into the river, and the males they sever- <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="margin">42.] </note> <lb/>
            ally inter in the suburbs, with one horn, or both, appearing <lb/>
            above the ground, for a mark. When it is putrified and <lb/>
            the appointed time arrives, a raft comes to each city from <lb/>
            the island called Prosopitis; this island is in the Delta, and is <lb/>
            nine schœni in circumference : now in this island Prosopitis <lb/>
            there are several cities ; but that from which the rafts come <lb/>
            to take away the bones of the oxen, is called Atarbechis ; in <lb/>
            it a temple of Venus has been erected. From this city then <lb/>
            many persons go about to other towns; and having dug up <lb/>
            the bones, all carry them away, and bury them in one place ; <lb/>
            and they bury all other cattle that die in the same way that <lb/>
            they do the oxen ; for they do not kill any of them. 42. All <lb/>
            those who have a temple erected to Theban Jupiter, or be­ <lb/>
            long to the Theban district, abstain from sheep, and sacrifice <lb/>
            goats only. For the Egyptians do not all worship the same <lb/>
            gods in the same manner, except Isis and Osiris, who, they <lb/>
            say, is Bacchus ; but these deities they all worship in the <lb/>
            same manner. On the other hand, those who frequent the <lb/>
            temple of Mendes, and belong to the Mendesian district, ab­ <lb/>
            stain from goats, and sacrifice sheep. Now the Thebans, and <lb/>
            such as abstain from sheep after their example, say, that this <lb/>
            custom was established among them in the following way : <lb/>
            that Hercules was very desirous of seeing Jupiter, but Ju­ <lb/>
            piter was unwilling to be seen by him ; at last, however, as <lb/>
            Hercules persisted, Jupiter had recourse to the following con­ <lb/>
            trivance : having flayed a ram, he cut off the head, and held <lb/>
            it before himself, and then having put on the fleece, he in <lb/>
            that form showed himself to Hercules." From this circum­ <lb/>
            stance the Egyptians make the image of Jupiter with a ram's <lb/>
            face ; and from the Egyptians the Ammonians, who are a <lb/>
            colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians, and who speak a lan­ <lb/>
            guage between both, have adopted the same practice; and, as <lb/>
            I conjecture, the Ammonians from hence derived their name, <lb/>
            for the Egyptians call Jupiter, Ammon. The Thebans then <lb/>
            do not sacrifice rams, but they are for the above reason ac­ <lb/>
            counted sacred by them ; on one day in the year, however, at - <lb/>
            the festival of Jupiter, they kill and flay one ram, and put it <lb/>
            on the image of Jupiter, and then they bring another image <lb/>
            of Hercules to it; when they have done this, all who are in <lb/>
            the temple bent themselves in mourning for the ram, and then <lb/>
            bury him in a sacred vault.</p><pb n="112"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [43. 44. </note>43. Of this Hercules I have heard this account, that he is <lb/>
            one of the twelve gods; but of the other Hercules, who is <lb/>
            known to the Grecians, I could never hear in any part of <lb/>
            Egypt. And that the Egyptians did not derive the name of <lb/>
            Hercules from the Grecians, but rather the Grecians (and espe­ <lb/>
            cially those who gave the name of Hercules to the son of Am­ <lb/>
            phitryon) from the Egyptians, I have both many other proofs <lb/>
            to show, and moreover the following, that the parents of this <lb/>
            Hercules, Amphitryon and Alcmene, were both of Egyptian <lb/>
            descent, and because the Egyptians say they do not know the <lb/>
            names of Neptune and the Dioscuri, and that they have never <lb/>
            been admitted into the number of their gods ; yet if they had <lb/>
            derived the name of any dpity from the Grecians, they would <lb/>
            certainly have mentioned these above all others, since even at <lb/>
            that time they made voyages, and some of the Grecians were <lb/>
            sailors, so that I believe, and am persuaded, that the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians must have learnt the names of these gods, rather than <lb/>
            that of Hercules. But Hercules is one of the ancient gods of <lb/>
            the Egyptians; and as they say themselves, it was seventeen <lb/>
            thousand years before the reign of Amasis, when the number <lb/>
            of their gods was increased from eight to twelve, of whom <lb/>
            Hercules was accounted one. 44. And being desirous of ob­ <lb/>
            taining, certain information from whatever source I could, I <lb/>
            sailed to Tyre in Phoenicia, having heard that there was there <lb/>
            a temple dedicated to Hercules ; and I saw it richly adorned <lb/>
            with a great variety of offerings, and in it were two pillars, <lb/>
            one of fine gold, the other of emerald stone, both shining ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly* at night. Conversing with the priests of this <lb/>
            god, I inquired how long this temple had been built, and I <lb/>
            found that neither did they agree with the Greeks. For they <lb/>
            said that the temple was built at the time when Tyre was <lb/>
            founded, and that two thousand three hundred years had <lb/>
            elapsed since the foundation of Tyre. In this city I also saw <lb/>
            another temple dedicated to Hercules by the name of Thasian; <lb/>
            I went therefore to Thasos, and found there a temple of Her­ <lb/>
            cules built by the Phœnicians, who, having set sail in search <lb/>
            of Europa, founded Thasos ; and this occurred five generations <lb/>
            before Hercules the son of Amphitryon appeared in Greece. <lb/>
            The researches then that I have made evidently prove, that <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μέγαθος</foreign> must be here construed as an adverb but Baelir thinks <lb/>
            that the text is corrupt. </note> <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="45-47.]"/> <unclear/> <lb/>
            es is a god of great antiquity, and therefore those <lb/>
            Grecians appear to me to have acted most correctly, who <lb/>
            have built two kinds of temples sacred to Hercules, and who <lb/>
            sacrificed to one as an immortal, under the name of Olympian, <lb/>
            and paid honour to the other as a hero. 45. But the Grecians <lb/>
            say many other things on this subject inconsiderately; for <lb/>
            instance, this is a silly story of theirs which they tell of Her­ <lb/>
            cules : that, " when he arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians, having <lb/>
            crowned him with a garland, led him in procession, as design­ <lb/>
            ing to sacrifice him to Jupiter, and that for some time he re­ <lb/>
            mained quiet, but when they began the preparatory ceremo­ <lb/>
            nies upon him at the altar, he set about defending himself and <lb/>
            slew every one of them." Now the Greeks who tell this story <lb/>
            appear to me to be utterly ignorant of the character and cus­ <lb/>
            toms of the Egyptians. For how can they who are forbidden <lb/>
            to sacrifice any kind of animal, except swine, and such bulls <lb/>
            and calves as are without blemish, and geese, sacrifice human <lb/>
            beings ? Moreover, since Hercules was but one, and besides a <lb/>
            mere man, as they confess, how is it probable that he should <lb/>
            slay many thousands ? And in thus speaking of them may I <lb/>
            meet with indulgence both from gods and heroes.</p>
          <p>46. The reason why the Egyptians above mentioned do not <lb/>
            sacrifice the goat, either male of female, is as follows: the <lb/>
            Mendesians consider Pan one of the eight gods, and they say, <lb/>
            that these eight existed prior to the twelve gods. And indeed <lb/>
            their painters and sculptors represent Pan with the face and <lb/>
            legs of a goat, as the Grecians do: not that they imagine this <lb/>
            to be his real form, for they think him like other gods; but <lb/>
            why they represent him in this way I had rather not mention. <lb/>
            However, the Mendesians pay reverence to all goats, and more <lb/>
            to the males than to the females, (and the goatherds who tend <lb/>
            them receive greater honour,) and particularly one he-goat, on <lb/>
            whose death public mourning is observed throughout the <lb/>
            whole Mendesian district.. In the language of Egypt, both a <lb/>
            goat and Pan are called Mendes; and in my time the follow­ <lb/>
            ing prodigy occurred in this district: a goat had connexion <lb/>
            with a woman in open day: this came to the knowledge of all <lb/>
            men. 47. The Egyptians consider the pig to be an impure <lb/>
            beast, and therefore if a' man in passing by a pig should touch <lb/>
            him only with his garments, he forthwith goes to the river <lb/>
            and plunges in: and in the next place, swineherds, although <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [48, 49. </note> <lb/>
            native Egyptians, are the only men who are not allowed to <lb/>
            enter any of their temples; neither will any man give his <lb/>
            daughter in marriage to one of them, nor take a wife from <lb/>
            among them; but the swineherds intermarry among them­ <lb/>
            selves. The Egyptians therefore do not think it right to <lb/>
            sacrifice swine to any other deities; but to the moon and <lb/>
            Bacchus they do sacrifice them, at the same time, that is, at <lb/>
            the same full moon, and then they eat of the flesh. A tradi <lb/>
            tion is related by the Egyptians in relation to this matter, <lb/>
            giving an account why they abhor swine on all other festivals, <lb/>
            and sacrifice them in that; but it is more becoming for me, <lb/>
            though I know it, not to mention it. This sacrifice of pigs to <lb/>
            the moon is performed in the following manner: when the <lb/>
            sacrificer has slain the victim, he puts together the tip of the <lb/>
            tail, with the spleen and the caul, and then covers them with <lb/>
            the fat found about the belly of the animal; and next he con­ <lb/>
            sumes them with fire : the rest of the flesh they eat during the <lb/>
            full moon in which they offer the sacrifices; but in no other <lb/>
            day would any one even taste it. The poor amongst them, <lb/>
            through want of means, form pigs of dough, and having baked <lb/>
            them, offer them in sacrifice. 48. On the eve of the festival <lb/>
            of Bacchus, every one slays a pig before his door, and then <lb/>
            restores it to the swineherd that sold it, that he may carry it <lb/>
            away. The rest of this festival to Bacchus, except as regards <lb/>
            the pigs, the Egyptians celebrate much in the same manner as <lb/>
            the Greeks do, but only, instead of phalli, they have invented <lb/>
            certain images, as much as a cubit in height, moved by strings, <lb/>
            which women carry about the villages, and which have the <lb/>
            member nodding, in size not much less than the rest of the <lb/>
            body; a pipe leads the way, and the women follow, singing <lb/>
            the praises of Bacchus. But why it has the member so large, <lb/>
            and moves no other part of the body, is accounted for by a <lb/>
            sacred story. 49. Now Melampus, son of Amytheon, appears <lb/>
            to me not to have been ignorant of this sacrifice, but per­ <lb/>
            fectly well acquainted with it; for Melampus is the person <lb/>
            who first introduced among the Greeks the name and sacri­ <lb/>
            fices of Bacchus, and the procession of the phallus; he did not, <lb/>
            however, fully explain every particular, but other learned per­ <lb/>
            sons who lived after him revealed them more accurately. <lb/>
            Melampus, then, is the person who introduced the procession <lb/>
            lie the phallus in honour of Bacchus, and from him the Greek? <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            having learnt it, do as they do. For my part I think that <lb/>
            Melampus, being a wise man, both acquired the art of divina­ <lb/>
            tion, and having learnt many other things in Egypt, intro­ <lb/>
            duced them among the Greeks, and particularly the worship <lb/>
            of Bacchus, changing only some few particulars; for I cannot <lb/>
            admit that the ceremonies adopted in Egypt in honour of this <lb/>
            god. and those among the Greeks, coincide by chance ; in that <lb/>
            case they would be conformable to Grecian customs, and not <lb/>
            have been lately introduced; neither can I admit that the <lb/>
            Egyptians borrowed either this or any other usage from the <lb/>
            Greeks. But I am of opinion that Melampus obtained his <lb/>
            information respecting the ceremonies of Bacchus, chiefly from <lb/>
            Cadmus the Tyrian, and those who accompanied him from <lb/>
            Phoenicia to the country now called Bœotia.</p>
          <p>50. And indeed the names of almost all the gods came from <lb/>
            Egypt into Greece ; for that they came from barbarians I <lb/>
            find on inquiry to be the case; and I think they chiefly pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded from Egypt. For with the exception of Neptune and <lb/>
            the Dioscuri, as I before mentioned, and Juno, Vesta, Themis, <lb/>
            the Graces, and the Nereids, the names of all the others have <lb/>
            always existed among the Egyptians: in this I repeat what <lb/>
            the Egyptians themselves affirm ; but the gods whose names <lb/>
            they say they are not acquainted with, I think, derived their <lb/>
            names from the Pelasgians, with the exception of Neptune; <lb/>
            this god they learned from the Libyans, for no people, except <lb/>
            the Libyans, originally possessed the name of Neptune, and <lb/>
            they have always worshipped him. Moreover the Egyptians <lb/>
            pay no religious honour to heroes. 51. These, and other <lb/>
            customs besides, which I shall hereafter mention, the Grecians <lb/>
            received from the Egyptians. The practice of making the <lb/>
            images of Mercury with the member erect, they did not learn <lb/>
            from the Egyptians, but from the Pelasgians: the Athenians <lb/>
            were the first of all the Greeks who adopted this practice, and <lb/>
            others from them; for the Pelasgians dwelt in the same <lb/>
            country as the Athenians, who were already ranked among <lb/>
            Greeks, whence they also began to be reckoned as Gre­ <lb/>
            cians. Whoever is initiated in the mysteries of the Cabiri, <lb/>
            which the Samothracians have adopted from the Pelasgians, <lb/>
            knows what I mean. For these Pelasgians dwelt in the <lb/>
            same country as the Athenians formerly inhabited, Samo­ <lb/>
            thrace, and from them the Samothracians learnt the mysteries : <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <pb n="116"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[52-55"/> <lb/>
            the Athenians therefore were the first of the Grecians who, <lb/>
            having learnt the practice from the Pelasgians, made the <lb/>
            images of Mercury with the member erect; but the Pelasgians <lb/>
            assign a certain sacred reason for this, which is explained in <lb/>
            the mysteries of Samothrace. 52. Formerly the Pelasgians <lb/>
            sacrificed all sorts of victims to the gods with prayer, as I was <lb/>
            informed at Dodona, but they gave no surname or name to <lb/>
            any of them, for they had not yet heard of them; but they <lb/>
            called them gods, because they had set in order and ruled <lb/>
            over all things. Then, in course of time, they learnt the <lb/>
            names of the other gods that were brought from Egypt, and <lb/>
            after some time, that of Bacchus. Concerning the names they <lb/>
            consulted the oracle of Dodona, for this oracle is accounted <lb/>
            the most ancient of those that are in Greece, and was then the <lb/>
            only one. When therefore the Pelasgians inquired at Dodona <lb/>
            C'whether they should receive the names that came from bar­ <lb/>
            barians," the oracle answered, "that they should." From that <lb/>
            time therefore they adopted the names of the gods in their <lb/>
            sacrifices, and the Grecians afterwards received them from <lb/>
            the Pelasgians. 53. Whence each of the gods sprung, <lb/>
            whether they existed always, and of what form they were, <lb/>
            was, so to speak, unknown till yesterday. For I am of <lb/>
            opinion that Hesiod and Homer lived four hundred years be­ <lb/>
            fore my time, and not more, and these were they who framed <lb/>
            a theogony for the Greeks, and gave names to the gods, and <lb/>
            assigned to them honours and arts, and declared their several <lb/>
            forms. But the poets, said to have been before them, in my <lb/>
            opinion, were after them. The first part of the above state­ <lb/>
            ment is derived from the Dodonaean priestesses; but the latter, <lb/>
            that relates to Hesiod and Homer, I say on my own authority.</p>
          <p>54. Concerning the two oracles, one in Greece, the other in <lb/>
            Libya, the Egyptians give the following account. The priests <lb/>
            of the Theban Jupiter say, "that two women, employed, in <lb/>
            the temple, were carried away from Thebes by certain phœni­ <lb/>
            cians, and that one of them was discovered to have been sold <lb/>
            into Libya, the other to the Greeks; and that these two <lb/>
            women were the first who established oracles in the nations <lb/>
            above mentioned." When I inquired how they knew this for <lb/>
            a certainty, they answered, "that they made diligent search <lb/>
            for these women, and were never able to find them ; but had <lb/>
            afterwards heard the account they gave of them.” 55. This, <pb n="117"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="56-58"/> <lb/>
            then is the account I heard from the priests at Thebes; but <lb/>
            the prophetesses at Dodona say, " that two black pigeons flew <lb/>
            away from Thebes in Egypt; that one of them went to Libya, <lb/>
            and the other to them ; that this last, sitting perched on an <lb/>
            oak tree, proclaimed in a human voice, that it was fitting an <lb/>
            oracle should be erected there to Jupiter; and that the people <lb/>
            believed this to be a divine message to them, and did accord­ <lb/>
            ingly. They add, that the other pigeon, which flew into <lb/>
            Libya, commanded the Libyans to found the oracle of Am­ <lb/>
            mon;" this also belongs to Jupiter. The priestesses of <lb/>
            Dodona, of whom the eldest is named Promenia, the second <lb/>
            Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra, gave this account; and <lb/>
            the rest of the Dodonæans, engaged in the service of the tem­ <lb/>
            ple, agreed with them. 56. My opinion of these things is <lb/>
            this : if the Phoenicians did really carry off the women em­ <lb/>
            ployed in the temple, and sold the one of them into Libya and <lb/>
            the other into Greece, this last woman, as I think, was sold to <lb/>
            some Thesprotians, in that part which is now called Hellas, <lb/>
            but was formerly called Pelasgia: tjien, being reduced to <lb/>
            slavery, she erected a temple to Jupiter, under an oak that <lb/>
            grew there; nothing being more natural, than that she, who <lb/>
            had been an attendant in the temple of Jupiter at Thebes, <lb/>
            should retain the memory of it wherever she came. And <lb/>
            after this, when she had learned the Greek language, she in­ <lb/>
            stituted an oracle; and she said that her sister in Libya had <lb/>
            been sold by the same Phœnicians by whom she herself was <lb/>
            sold. 57. The women, I conjecture, were called doves by the <lb/>
            Dodonaeans, because they were barbarians, and they seemed to <lb/>
            them to chatter like birds; but after a time, when the woman <lb/>
            spoke intelligibly to them, they presently reported that the <lb/>
            dove had spoken with a human voice; for as long as she used <lb/>
            a barbarous language, she appeared to them to chatter like a <lb/>
            bird : for how could a dove speak with a human voice ? But <lb/>
            in saying that the dove was black, they show that the woman <lb/>
            was an Egyptian. The manner in which oracles are delivered <lb/>
            at Thebes in Egypt, and at Dodona, is very similar ; and the <lb/>
            art of divination from victims came likewise from Egypt.</p>
          <p>58. The Egyptians were also the first who introduced pub­ <lb/>
            lie festivals, processions, and solemn supplications ; and the <lb/>
            Greeks learnt them from them: for these rites appear to <lb/>
            have been established for a very long time, but those in Greece <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="59–62"/> <lb/>
            have been lately introduced. 59. The Egyptians hold public <lb/>
            festivals not only on ce in a year, but several times : that which <lb/>
            is best and most rigidly observed, is in the city of Bubastis, in <lb/>
            honour of Diana; the second, in the city of Busiris, is in <lb/>
            honour of Isis; for in this city is the largest temple of Isis, <lb/>
            and it is situated in the middle of the Egyptian Delta. Isis <lb/>
            is in the Grecian language called Demeter. The third festi­ <lb/>
            val is held at Sais, in honour of Minerva; the fourth, at He­ <lb/>
            liopolis, in honour of the sun ; the fifth, at the city of Buto, <lb/>
            in honour of Latona; the sixth, at the city of Papremis, in <lb/>
            honour of Mars. 60. Now, when they are being conveyed to <lb/>
            the city Bubastis, they act as follows: for men and women <lb/>
            embark together, and great numbers of both sexes in every <lb/>
            barge : some of the women have castanets on which they play, <lb/>
            and the men play on the flute during the whole voyage ; the <lb/>
            rest of the women and men sing and clap their hands together <lb/>
            at the same time. When in the course of their passage they <lb/>
            come to any town, they lay their barge near to land, and do as <lb/>
            follows: some of the women do as I have described ; others shout <lb/>
            and scoff at the women of the place ; some dance, and others <lb/>
            stand up and pull up their clothes: this they do at every town by <lb/>
            the river-side. When they arrive at Bubastis, they celebrate the <lb/>
            feast, offering up'great sacrifices ; and more wine is consumed at <lb/>
            this festival than in all the rest of the year. What with men <lb/>
            and women, besides children, they congregate, as the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants say, to the number of seven hundred thousand. 61. I <lb/>
            have already related how they celebrate the festival or Isis in <lb/>
            the city of Busiris; and besides, all the men and women, to <lb/>
            the number of many myriads, beat themselves after the sacri­ <lb/>
            flee ; but for whom they beat themselves it were impious for <lb/>
            me to divulge. All the Carians that are settled in Egypt do <lb/>
            still more than this, in that they cut their foreheads with <lb/>
            knives, and thus show themselves to be foreigners and not <lb/>
            Egyptians. 62. When they are assembled at the sacrifice, in <lb/>
            the city of Sais, they all on a certain night kindle a great <lb/>
            number of lamps in the open air, around their houses ; the <lb/>
            lamps are flat vessels filled with salt and oil, and the wick <lb/>
            floats on the surface, and this burns all night; and the festival <lb/>
            is thence named "the lightingof lamps." The Egyptians who <lb/>
            do not come to this public assembly observe the rite of sacrifice, <lb/>
            and all kindle lamps, and this not only in Sais, but throughout <pb n="119"/>
             <note type="margin">63, 64.] </note> <lb/>
            all Egypt. A religious reason is given why this night is illumin­ <lb/>
            ated and so honoured. 63. Those who assemble at Heliopolis <lb/>
            and Buto perform sacrifices only. But in Papremis they offer <lb/>
            sacrifices and perform ceremonies, as in other places ; but, <lb/>
            when the sun is on the decline, a few priests are occupied <lb/>
            about the image, but the greater number stand, with woodeD <lb/>
            clubs, at the entrance of the temple; while others accomplish­ <lb/>
            ing their vows, amounting to more than a thousand men, each <lb/>
            armed in like manner, stand in a body on the opposite side. <lb/>
            But the image, placed in a small wooden temple, gilded all <lb/>
            over, they carry out to another sacred dwelling: then the few <lb/>
            who were left about the image draw a four-wheeled carriage, <lb/>
            containing the temple and the image that is in it. But the <lb/>
            priests, who stand at the entrance, refuse to give them admit­ <lb/>
            tance ; and the votaries, bringing succour to the god, oppose, <lb/>
            and then strike, whereupon an obstinate combat with clubs <lb/>
            ensues, and they break one another's heads, and, as I conjec­ <lb/>
            ture, many die of their wounds ; though the Egyptians deny <lb/>
            that any one dies. 64. The inhabitants say they instituted this <lb/>
            festival on the following occasion : they say, that the mother <lb/>
            of Mars dwelt in this temple, and that Mars, who had been <lb/>
            educated abroad, when he reached to man's estate, came, and <lb/>
            wished to converse with his mother; and that his mother's <lb/>
            attendants, as they had never seen him before, did not allow <lb/>
            him to pass them, but repelled him ; whereupon he, having <lb/>
            collected men from another city, handled the servants roughly, <lb/>
            and got access to his mother, fn consequence of this, they <lb/>
            say that they have instituted this combat on this festival in <lb/>
            honour of Mars.</p>
          <p>The Egyptians were likewise the first who made it a point <lb/>
            of religion that men should abstain from women in the sacred <lb/>
            precinets ; and not enter unwashed after the use of a woman. <lb/>
            For almost all other nations, except the Egyptians and Gre­ <lb/>
            cians, have intercourse in sacred places, and enter them unwash­ <lb/>
            ed ; thinking mankind to be like other animals : therefore, <lb/>
            since they see other animals and birds coupling in the shrines1 <lb/>
            and temples of the gods, they conclude that if this were dis • <lb/>
            pleasing to the god, the brute creatures even would not do it. <lb/>
            Now, they who argue thus, act in a manner that I cannot <lb/>
            approve. The Egyptians, then, are beyond measure seru- <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book I. ch. 199. </note> <pb n="120"/>
            <note type="margin"> [65, 66. </note> <lb/>
            pulous in all things concerning religion, and especially in the <lb/>
            above-mentioned particulars.</p>
          <p>65. Egypt, though bordering on Libya, does not abound in <lb/>
            wild beasts ; but all that they have are accounted sacred, as <lb/>
            well those that are domesticated as those that are not. But <lb/>
            if I should give the reasons why they are consecrated, I must <lb/>
            descend in my history to religious matters, which I avoid re­ <lb/>
            lating as much as I can ; and such as I have touched upon in <lb/>
            the course of my narrative, I have mentioned from necessity. <lb/>
            They have a custom relating to animals of the following kind. <lb/>
            Superintendents, consisting both of men and women, are ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to feed every kind separately; and the son succeeds <lb/>
            the father in this office. All the inhabitants of the cities per­ <lb/>
            form their vows to the superintendents in the following man­ <lb/>
            ner : having made a vow to the god to whom the animal <lb/>
            belongs, they shave either the whole heads of their children, <lb/>
            or a half, or a third part of the head, and then weigh <lb/>
            the hair in a scale against silver, and whatever the weight <lb/>
            may be, they give to the superintendent of the animals ; and <lb/>
            she in return cuts up some fish, and gives it as food to the <lb/>
            animals : such is the usual mode of feeding them. Should <lb/>
            any one kill one of these beasts, if wilfully, death is the punish­ <lb/>
            ment ; if by accident, he pays such fine as the priests choose <lb/>
            to impose. But whoever kills an ibis or a hawk, whether <lb/>
            wilfully or by accident, must necessarily be put to death. <lb/>
            66. Although the domesticated animals are many, they would <lb/>
            be much more numerous, were it not for the following acci­ <lb/>
            dents which befal the cats. When the females have littered, <lb/>
            they no longer seek the company of the males, and they, being <lb/>
            desirous of having intercourse with them, are not able to do <lb/>
            so ; wherefore they have recourse to the following artifice : <lb/>
            having taken the young from the females, and carried them <lb/>
            away secretly, they kill them ; though when they have killed <lb/>
            them, they do not eat them. The females being deprived of <lb/>
            their young, and desirous of others, again seek the com­ <lb/>
            pany of the males ; for this animal is very fond of its young. <lb/>
            When a conflagration takes place, a supernatural impulse <lb/>
            seizes on the cats. For the Egyptians, standing at a distance, <lb/>
            take care of the cats, and neglect to put out the fire ; but the <lb/>
            cats, making their escape, and leaping over the men, throw <lb/>
            themselves into the fire and when this happens great lament- <pb n="121"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="57-69.]"/> <lb/>
            ations are made among the Egyptians. In whatever house a <lb/>
            cat dies of a natural death, all the family shave their eye- <lb/>
            brows only; but if a dog die, they shave the whole body and <lb/>
            the head. 67. All cats that die are carried to certain sacred <lb/>
            houses, where being first embalmed, they are buried in the <lb/>
            city of Bubastis. All persons bury their dogs in sacred <lb/>
            vaults within their own city ; and ichneumons are buried in <lb/>
            the same manner as the dogs: but field-mice and hawks <lb/>
            they carry to the city of Buto ; the ibis to Hermopolis ; the <lb/>
            bears, which are few in number, and the wolves, which are <lb/>
            not much larger than foxes, they bury wherever they are <lb/>
            found lying.</p>
          <p>68. The following is the nature of the crocodile. During <lb/>
            the four coldest months it eats nothing, and though it has <lb/>
            fqur feet, it is amphibious. It lays its eggs on land, and there <lb/>
            hatches them. It spends the greater part of the day on the <lb/>
            dry ground, but the whole night in the river ; for the water <lb/>
            is then warmer than the air and dew. Of all living things <lb/>
            with which we are acquainted, this, from the least beginning, <lb/>
            grows to be the largest. For it lays eggs little larger than <lb/>
            those of a goose, and the young is at first in proportion to the <lb/>
            egg ; but when grown up it reaches to the length of seven­ <lb/>
            teen cubits, and even more. It has the eyes of a pig, large <lb/>
            teeth, and projecting tusks, in proportion to the body: it is <lb/>
            the only animal that has no tongue: it does not move the <lb/>
            lower jaw, but is the only animal that brings down its upper <lb/>
            jaw to the under one. It has strong claws, and a skin cover­ <lb/>
            ed with scales, that cannot be broken on the back. It is blind <lb/>
            in the water, but very quick-sighted on land ; and because it <lb/>
            lives for the most part in the water, its mouth is filled with <lb/>
            leeches. All other birds and beasts avoid him, but he is at <lb/>
            peace with the trochilus, because he receives benefit from <lb/>
            that bird. For when the crocodile gets out of the water on <lb/>
            land, and then opens its jaws, which it does most commonly <lb/>
            towards the west, the trochilus enters its mouth and swallows <lb/>
            the leeches : the crocodile is so well pleased with this service <lb/>
            that it never hurts the trochilus. 69. With some of the <lb/>
            Egyptians crocodiles are sacred ; with others not, but they <lb/>
            treat them as enemies. Those who dwell about Thebes, and <lb/>
            Lake Mceris, consider them to be very sacred ; and they each <lb/>
            af them train up a crocodile, which is taught to be quite <pb n="122"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[70-73"/> <lb/>
            tame ; and they put crystal and gold ear-rings into their ears, <lb/>
            and bracelets on their fore paws ; and they give them ap- &lt; <lb/>
            pointed and sacred food, and treat them as well as possible <lb/>
            while alive, and when dead they embalm them, and bury <lb/>
            them in sacred vaults. But the people who dwell about the <lb/>
            city of Elephantine eat them, not considering them sacred. <lb/>
            They are not called crocodiles by the Egyptians, but champ­ <lb/>
            sæ ;”the Ionians gave them the name of crocodiles, because <lb/>
            they thought they resembled lizards, which are also so called, <lb/>
            and which are found in the hedges in their country. 70. <lb/>
            The modes of taking the crocodile are many and various, but <lb/>
            I shall only describe that which seems to me most worthy of <lb/>
            relation. When the fisherman has baited a hook with the <lb/>
            chine of a pig, he lets it down into the middle of the river, <lb/>
            and holding a young live pig on the brink of the river, <lb/>
            beats it; the crocodile, hearing the noise, goes in its direction. <lb/>
            and meeting with the chine, swallows it; but the men draw <lb/>
            it to land : when it is drawn out on shore, the sportsman first <lb/>
            of all plasters its eyes with mud ; and having done this, after­ <lb/>
            wards manages it very easily ; but until he has done this, he <lb/>
            has a great deal of trouble. 71. The hippopotamus is esteem­ <lb/>
            ed sacred in the district of Papremis, but not so by the rest of <lb/>
            the Egyptians. This is the nature of its shape. It is a qua­ <lb/>
            druped, cloven-footed, with the hoofs of an ox, snub-nosed, <lb/>
            has the mane of a horse, projecting tusks, and the tail and <lb/>
            neigh of a horse. In size he is equal to a very large ox : his <lb/>
            hide is so thick that spear-handles are made of it when dry. <lb/>
            72. Otters are also met with in the river, which are deemed <lb/>
            sacred : and amongst fish, they consider that which is called <lb/>
            the lepidotus, and the eel, sacred ; these they say are sacred <lb/>
            to the Nile ; and among birds, the vulpanser.</p>
          <p>73. There is also another sacred bird, called the phœnix, <lb/>
            which I have never seen except in a picture ; for it seldom <lb/>
            makes its appearance amongst them, only once in five hundred <lb/>
            years, as the Heliopolitans affirm : they say that it comes on <lb/>
            the death of its sire. If he is like the picture, he is of the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing size and description : the plumage of his wings is <lb/>
            partly golden-coloured, and partly red ; in outline and size he <lb/>
            is very like an eagle. They say that he has the following con­ <lb/>
            trivance, which in my opinion is not credible. They say that <lb/>
            he comes from Arabia, and brings the body of his father to <lb/>
            I <pb n="123"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="74—76"/> <lb/>
            the temple of the sun, having enclosed him in myrrh, and there <lb/>
            buries him in the temple. He brings him in this manner : first <lb/>
            he moulds an egg of myrrh as large as he is able to carry; <lb/>
            then he tries to carry it, and when he has made the experi­ <lb/>
            ment, he hollows out the egg, and puts his parent into it, and <lb/>
            stops up with some more myrrh the hole through which he <lb/>
            had introduced the body, so when his father is put inside, <lb/>
            the weight is the same as before: then, having covered it <lb/>
            over, he carries him to the temple of the sun in Egypt. This <lb/>
            they say is done by this bird.</p>
          <p>74. In the neighbourhood of Thebes there are sacred ser­ <lb/>
            pents not at all hurtful to men : they are diminutive in size, <lb/>
            and carry two horns that grow on the top of the head. When <lb/>
            these serpents die they bury them in the temple of Jupiter, <lb/>
            for they say they are sacred to that god. 75. There is a <lb/>
            place in Arabia, situated very near the city of Buto, to which <lb/>
            I went, on hearing of some winged serpents ; and when I ar­ <lb/>
            rived there, I saw bones and spines of serpents, in such quan­ <lb/>
            tities as it would be impossible to describe: there were heaps <lb/>
            of these spinal bones, some large, some smaller, and others <lb/>
            still less ; and there were great numbers of them. The place <lb/>
            in which these spinal bones lie scattered, is of the following <lb/>
            description: it is a narrow pass between two mountains into a <lb/>
            spacious plain ; this plain is contiguous to the plain of Egypt: <lb/>
            it is reported, that at the beginning of spring, winged serpents <lb/>
            fly from Arabia towards Egypt; but that ibises, a sort of bird, <lb/>
            meet them at the pass, and do not allow the serpents to go by, <lb/>
            but kill them : for this service the Arabians say that the ibis <lb/>
            is highly reverenced by the Egyptians ; and the Egyptians <lb/>
            acknowledge that they reverence these birds for this reason. <lb/>
            76. The ibis is of the following description: it is all over a <lb/>
            deep black, it has the legs of a crane, its beak is much curved, <lb/>
            and it is about the size of the crex. Such is the form of the <lb/>
            black ones, that fight with the serpents. But those that are <lb/>
            commonly conversant among men, (for there are two species,) <lb/>
            are. bare on the head and the whole neck ; have white plum­ <lb/>
            age, except on the head, the throat; and the tips of the wings <lb/>
            and extremity of the tail; in all these parts that I have men­ <lb/>
            honed, they are of a deep black; in their legs and beak they <lb/>
            are like the other kind. The form of the serpent is like that <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[77–79"/> <lb/>
            of the water-snake; but he has wings without feathers, and as <lb/>
            like as possible to the wings of a bat. This must suffice for <lb/>
            the description of sacred animals.</p>
          <p>77. Of the Egyptians, those who inhabit that part of Egypt <lb/>
            which is sown with corn, in that they cultivate the memory <lb/>
            of past events more than anypther men, are the best informed <lb/>
            of all with whom I have had intercourse. Their manner of <lb/>
            life is this. They purge themselves every month, three days <lb/>
            successively, seeking to preserve health by emetics and clys­ <lb/>
            ters, for they suppose that all diseases to which men are sub­ <lb/>
            ject proceed from the food they use. And indeed in other <lb/>
            respects the Egyptians, next to the Libyans, are the most <lb/>
            healthy people in the world, as I think, on account of the sea­ <lb/>
            sons, because they are not liable to change; for men are most <lb/>
            subject to disease at periods of change, and above all others at <lb/>
            the change of the seasons. They feed on bread made into <lb/>
            loaves of spelt, which they call cyllestis ; and they use wine <lb/>
            made of barley, for they have no vines in that country. Some <lb/>
            fish they dry in the sun, and eat raw, others salted with brine; <lb/>
            and of birds they eat quails, ducks, and smaller birds raw, <lb/>
            having first salted them : ' all other things, whether birds or <lb/>
            fishes, that they have, except such as are accounted sacred, <lb/>
            they eat either roasted or boiled. 78. At their convivial ban­ <lb/>
            quets, among the wealthy classes, when they have finished <lb/>
            supper, a man carries round in a coffin the image of a dead body <lb/>
            carved in wood, made as like as possible in colour and workman­ <lb/>
            ship, and in size generally about one or two cubits in length ; <lb/>
            and showing this to each of the company, he says, " Look up­ <lb/>
            on this, then drink and enjoy yourself; for when dead you will <lb/>
            be like this." This practice they have at their drinking parties. <lb/>
            79. They observe their ancient customs, but acquire no <lb/>
            new ones. Among other memorable customs, they have one <lb/>
            song, Linus, which is sung in Phœnicia, Cyprus, and else­ <lb/>
            where ; in different nations it bears a different name, but it <lb/>
            agrees so exactly as to be the same which the Greeks sing, <lb/>
            under the name of Linus. So that among the many wonder-­ <lb/>
            ful things seen in Egypt, this is especially wonderful, whence <lb/>
            they got this Linus ; for they seem to have sung it from time <lb/>
            immemorial. The Linus in the Egyptian language is called <lb/>
            Maneros ; and the Egyptians say that hp was the only son of <pb n="125"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="80-85 ]"/> <lb/>
            the first king of Egypt, and that happening to die prematurely, <lb/>
            he was honoured by the Egyptians in this mourning dirge: <lb/>
            and this is the first and only song they have. 80. In this <lb/>
            other particular the Egyptians resemble the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            only among all the Grecians : the young men when they meet <lb/>
            their elders give way and turn aside ; and when they approach, <lb/>
            rise up from their seats. In the following custom, however, <lb/>
            they do not resemble any nation of the Greeks ; instead of <lb/>
            addressing one another in the streets, they salute by letting <lb/>
            the hand fall down as far as the knee. 81. They wear linen <lb/>
            tunics fringed round the legs, which they call calasiris, and <lb/>
            over these they throw white woollen mantles ; woollen clothes <lb/>
            however are not carried into the temples, nor are they buried <lb/>
            with them, for that is accounted profane. In this respect they <lb/>
            agree with the worshippers of Orpheus and Bacchus, who are <lb/>
            Egyptians and Pythagoreans. For it is considered profane for <lb/>
            one who is initiated in these mysteries to be buried in woollen <lb/>
            garments, and a religious reason is given for this custom.</p>
          <p>82. These other things were also invented by the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians. Each month and day is assigned to some particular <lb/>
            god; and according to the day on which each person is born, <lb/>
            they determine what will befal him, how he will die, and what <lb/>
            kind of person he will be. And these things the Grecian <lb/>
            poets have made use of. They have also discovered more <lb/>
            prodigies than all the rest of the world ; for when any prodigy <lb/>
            occurs, they carefully observe and write down the result; and <lb/>
            if a similar occurrence should happen afterwards they think <lb/>
            the result will be the same. 83. The art of divination is in <lb/>
            this condition: it is attributed to no human being, but only to <lb/>
            some of the gods. For they have amongst them an oracle of <lb/>
            Hercules, Apollo, Minerva, Diana, Mars, and Jupiter; and <lb/>
            that which they honour above all others, is the oracle of La­ <lb/>
            tona in the city of Buto. Their modes of delivering oracles <lb/>
            however are not all alike, but differ from each other. 84. <lb/>
            The art of medicine is thus divided amongst them: each <lb/>
            physician applies himself to one disease only, and not more. <lb/>
            All places abound in physicians; some physicians are for <lb/>
            the eyes, others for the head, others for the teeth, others for <lb/>
            the parts about the belly, and others for internal disorders.</p>
          <p>85. Their . manner of mourning and burying is as follows. <lb/>
            When in a family a man of any consideration dies. all the <pb n="126"/>
             <note type="margin">[86, S7. </note> <lb/>
            females of that family besmear their heads and faces with mud, <lb/>
            and then leaving the body in the house, they wander about <lb/>
            the city, and beat themselves, having their clothes girt up, <lb/>
            and exposing their breasts, and all their relations accompany <lb/>
            them. On the other hand, the men beat themselves, being <lb/>
            girt up, in like manner. When they have done this, they <lb/>
            carry out the body to be embalmed. 86. There are persons who <lb/>
            are appointed for this very purpose ; they, when the dead body <lb/>
            is brought to them, show to the bearers wooden models of <lb/>
            corpses, made exactly like by painting. And they show that <lb/>
            which they say is the most expensive manner of embalming. <lb/>
            the name of which I do not think it right to mention on such <lb/>
            an occasion; they then show the second, which is inferior and <lb/>
            less expensive; and then the third, which is the cheapest. <lb/>
            Having explained them all, they learn from them in what way <lb/>
            they wish the body to be prepared; then the relations, when <lb/>
            they have agreed on the price, depart; but the embalmers re­ <lb/>
            maining in the workshops thus proceed to embalm in the most <lb/>
            expensive manner. First they draw out the brains through <lb/>
            the nostrils with an iron hook, taking part of it out in this <lb/>
            manner, the rest by the infusion of drugs. Then with a sharp <lb/>
            Ethiopian stone they make an incision in the side, and take <lb/>
            out all the bowels; and having cleansed the abdomen and <lb/>
            rinsed it with palm-wine, they next sprinkle it with pounded <lb/>
            perfumes. Then having filled the belly with pure myrrh <lb/>
            pounded, and cassia, and other perfumes, frankincense ex­ <lb/>
            cepted, they sew it up again ; and when they have done this, <lb/>
            they steep it in natrum, leaving it under for seventy days ; for <lb/>
            a longer time than this it is not lawful to steep it. At the ex­ <lb/>
            piration of the seventy days they wash the corpse, and wrap <lb/>
            the whole body in bandages of flaxen cloth, smearing it with <lb/>
            gum, which the Egyptians commonly use instead of glue. <lb/>
            After this the relations, having taken the body back again, <lb/>
            make a wooden case in the shape of a man, and having <lb/>
            made it, they enclose the body; and thus, having fastened it <lb/>
            up, they store it in. a sepulchral chamber, setting it upright <lb/>
            against the wall. In this manner they prepare the bodies <lb/>
            that are embalmed in the most expensive way. 87. Those <lb/>
            who, avoiding great expense, desire the middle way, they pre­ <lb/>
            pare in the following manner. When they have charged <lb/>
            their syringes with oil made from cedar, they fill the abdomen <pb n="127"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="88-91.]"/> <lb/>
            )f the corpse without making any incision or taking out the <lb/>
            bowels, but inject it at the fundament; and having prevented the <lb/>
            injection from escaping, they steep the body in natrum for the <lb/>
            prescribed number of days, and on the last day they let out <lb/>
            from the abdomen the oil of cedar which they had before in­ <lb/>
            jected, and it has such power that it brings away the intes­ <lb/>
            tines and vitals in a state of dissolution; the natrum dissolves <lb/>
            the flesh, and nothing of the body remains but the skin and <lb/>
            the bones. When they have done this they return the body <lb/>
            without any further operation. 88. The third method of <lb/>
            embalming is this, which is used only for the poorer sort : <lb/>
            having thoroughly rinsed the abdomen in syrmaea, they steep <lb/>
            it with natrum for the seventy days, and then deliver it to be <lb/>
            carried away. 89. But the wives of considerable persons, <lb/>
            when they die, they do not immediately deliver to be em­ <lb/>
            balmed, nor such women as are very beautiful and of cele­ <lb/>
            brity, but when they have been dead three or four days they <lb/>
            then deliver them to the embalmers ; and they do this for the <lb/>
            following reason, that the embalmers may not abuse the bodies <lb/>
            of such women ; for they say that one man was detected in <lb/>
            abusing a body that was fresh, and that a fellow-workman in­ <lb/>
            formed against him. 90. Should any person, whether Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian or stranger, no matter which, be found to have been <lb/>
            seized by a crocodile, or drowned in the river, to whatever <lb/>
            city the body may be carried, the inhabitants are by law <lb/>
            compelled to have the body embalmed, and having adorned it <lb/>
            in the handsomest manner, to bury it in the sacred vaults. <lb/>
            Nor is it lawful for any one else, whether relations or friends, <lb/>
            to touch him ; but the priests of the Nile bury the corpse with <lb/>
            their own hands, as being something more than human.</p>
          <p>91. They avoid using Grecian customs ; and, in a word, <lb/>
            the customs of all other people whatsoever. All the other <lb/>
            Egyptians are particular in this. But there is a large city <lb/>
            called Chemmis, situate in the Thebaic district, near Neapo­ <lb/>
            lis, in which is a quadrangular temple dedicated to Perseus <lb/>
            the son of Danae; palm trees grow round it, and the portico <lb/>
            is of stone, very spacious, and over it are placed two large <lb/>
            stone statues. In this enclosure is a temple, and in it is <lb/>
            placed a statue of Perseus. The Chemmitæ affirm, that Per. <lb/>
            seus has frequently appeared to them on earthy, and frequently <lb/>
            within the temple, and that a sandal worn by him is sometimes <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="margin">[92 </note> <lb/>
            found, which is two cubits in length ; and that after its ap­ <lb/>
            pearance, all Egypt flourishes. This they affirm. They adopt <lb/>
            the following Grecian customs in honour of Perseus : they <lb/>
            celebrate gymnastic games, embracing every kind of contest; <lb/>
            and they give as prizes, cattle, cloaks, and skins. When I <lb/>
            inquired why Perseus appeared only to them, and why they <lb/>
            differed from the rest of the Egyptians, in holding gymnastic <lb/>
            games ; they answered, " that Perseus derived his origin from <lb/>
            their city ; for that Danaus and Lynceus, who were both <lb/>
            natives of Chemmis, sailed from them into Greece ;" and <lb/>
            tracing the descent down from them, they came to Perseus ; <lb/>
            " and that he coming to Egypt, for the same reason as the <lb/>
            Greeks allege, in order to bring away the Gorgon's head from <lb/>
            Libya, they affirmed that he came to them also and acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged all his kindred ; and that when he came to Egypt he <lb/>
            was well acquainted with the name of Chemmis, having heard <lb/>
            it from his mother: they add, that by his order they insti­ <lb/>
            tuted gymnastic games in honour of him."</p>
          <p>92. The Egyptians who dwell above the morasses, observe <lb/>
            all these customs ; but those who live in the morasses, have <lb/>
            the same customs as the rest of the Egyptians, and as in <lb/>
            other things, so in this, that each mar. has but one wife, like <lb/>
            the Greeks. But to obtain food more easily, they have the <lb/>
            following inventions : when the river is full, and has made <lb/>
            the plains like a sea, great numbers of lilies, which the <lb/>
            Egyptians call lotus, spring up in the water : these they <lb/>
            gather and dry in the sun ; then having pounded the middle <lb/>
            of the lotus, which resembles a poppy, they make bread of it <lb/>
            and bake it. The root also of this lotus is fit for food, and is <lb/>
            tolerably sweet; and is round, and of the size of an apple. <lb/>
            There are also other lilies, like roses, that grow in the river, <lb/>
            the fruit of which is contained in a separate pod, that springs <lb/>
            up from the root in form very like a wasp's nest; in this <lb/>
            there are many berries fit to be eaten, of the size of an <lb/>
            olive stone, and they are eaten both fresh and dried. The <lb/>
            byblus, which is an annual plant, when they have pulled it <lb/>
            up in the fens, they cut off the top of it and put to some <lb/>
            other uses, but the lower part that is left, to the length of <lb/>
            a cubit, they eat and sell. Those who are anxious to eat <lb/>
            the byblus dressed in the most delicate manner, stew it in <lb/>
            a hot pan and then eat it. Some of them live entirely on <pb n="129"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="93-95.]"/> <lb/>
            fish, which they catch, and gut, and dry in the sun, and then <lb/>
            eat them dried.</p>
          <p>93. Fishes that are gregarious are seldom found in the <lb/>
            rivers, but being bred in the lakes, they proceed as follows : <lb/>
            when the desire of engendering comes upon them, they swim <lb/>
            out in shoals to the sea; the males lead the way, scattering the <lb/>
            sperm; and the females following swallow it, and are thus <lb/>
            impregnated. When they find themselves full in the sea, they <lb/>
            swim back, each to their accustomed haunts; however, the <lb/>
            males no longer take the lead, but this is done by females: <lb/>
            they, leading the way in shoals, do as the males did before ; <lb/>
            for they scatter their spawn by degrees, and the males follow­ <lb/>
            ing devour them; but from the spawn that escapes and is not <lb/>
            devoured, the fish that grow up are engendered. Any of these <lb/>
            fish that happen to be taken in their passage towards the sea, <lb/>
            are found bruised on the left side of the head; but those that <lb/>
            are taken on their return, are bruised on the right; and this <lb/>
            proceeds from the following cause: they swim out to the sea <lb/>
            keeping close to the land on the left side, and when they swim <lb/>
            back again, they keep to the same shore, hugging it and touch­ <lb/>
            ing it as much as possible, for fear of losing their way by the <lb/>
            stream. When the Nile begins to overflow, the hollow parts <lb/>
            of the land and the marshes near the river first begin to be <lb/>
            filled by the water oozing through from the river; and as soon <lb/>
            as they are full, they are immediately filled with little fishes ; <lb/>
            the reason of which, as I conjecture, is this : in the preceding <lb/>
            year, when the Nile retreated, the fish that had deposited <lb/>
            their eggs in the marshy ground, went away with the last of <lb/>
            the waters; but when, as the time came round, the water has <lb/>
            risen again, fishes are immediately produced from these eggs. <lb/>
            Thus it happens with respect to the fishes.</p>
          <p>94. The Egyptians who live about the fens use an oil drawn <lb/>
            from the fruit of the sillicypria, which they call cici; and they <lb/>
            make it in the following manner : they plant these sillicypria, <lb/>
            which in Greece grow spontaneous and wild, on the banks of <lb/>
            the rivers and lakes: these, when planted in Egypt, bear <lb/>
            abundance of fruit, though of an offensive smell. When they <lb/>
            have gathered it, some bruise it and press out the oil; others <lb/>
            boil and stew it, and collect the liquid that flows from it; this <lb/>
            is fat, and no less suited for lamps than olive oil.; but it emits <lb/>
            un offensive smell. 95. They have the following contrivance <note type="footnote"> A </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [96, 97. </note> <lb/>
            to protect themselves from the musquitoes, which abound very <lb/>
            much. The towers are of great service to those who inhabit <lb/>
            the Upper parts of the marshes; for the musquitoes are pre­ <lb/>
            vented by the winds from flying high: bat those who live <lb/>
            round the marshes have contrived another expedient instead <lb/>
            of the towers. Every man has a net, with which in the day <lb/>
            he takes fish, and at night uses it in the following manner: <lb/>
            in whatever bed he sleeps, he throws the net around it, and <lb/>
            then getting in, sleeps under it: if he should wrap himself up <lb/>
            in his clothes or in linen, the musquitoes would bite through <lb/>
            them, but they never attempt to bite through the net.</p>
          <p>96. Their ships in which they convey merchandise are <lb/>
            made of the acacia, which in shape is very like the Cyrenæan <lb/>
            lotus, and its exudation is gum. From this acacia they cut <lb/>
            planks about two cubits in length, and join them together like <lb/>
            bricks, building their ships in the following manner. They <lb/>
            fasten the planks of two cubits length round stout and long <lb/>
            ties: when they have thus built the hulls, they lay benches <lb/>
            across them. They make no use of ribs, but caulk the seams <lb/>
            inside with byblus. They make only one rudder, and that is <lb/>
            driven through the keel. They use a mast of acacia, and sails <lb/>
            of byblus. These vessels are unable to sail up the stream un­ <lb/>
            less a fair wind prevails, but are towed from the shore. They <lb/>
            are thus carried down the stream: there is a hurdle made of <lb/>
            tamarisk, wattled with a band of reeds, and a stone bored <lb/>
            through the middle, of about two talents in weight; of these <lb/>
            two, the hurdle is fastened to a cable, and let down at the. <lb/>
            prow of the vessel to be carried on by the stream ; and the <lb/>
            stone by another cable at the stern; and by this means the <lb/>
            hurdle, by the stream bearing hard upon it, moves quickly and <lb/>
            draws along " the baris," (for this is the name given to these <lb/>
            vessels,) but the stone being dragged at the stern, and sunk <lb/>
            to the bottom, keeps the vessel in its course. They have very <lb/>
            many of these vessels, and some of them carry many thousand <lb/>
            talents. 97. When the Nile inundates the country, the cities <lb/>
            alone are seen above its surface, very like the islands in the <lb/>
            Ægean Sea; for all the rest of Egypt becomes a sea, and the <lb/>
            cities alone are above the surface. When this happens, they <lb/>
            navigate no longer by the channel of the river, but across the <lb/>
            plain. To a person sailing from Naucratis to Memphis, the <lb/>
            passage is by the pyramids; this, however, is not the usual <pb n="131"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="98-100.]"/> <lb/>
            course, but by the point of the Delta. and the city of Cerca­ <lb/>
            sorus ; and in sailing from the sea and Canopus to Naucratis <lb/>
            across the plain, you will pass by the city of Anthylla and <lb/>
            that called Archandropolis. 98. Of these, Anthylla, which is <lb/>
            a city of importance, is assigned to purchase shoes for the wife <lb/>
            of the reigning king of Egypt; and this has been so as long <lb/>
            as Egypt has been subject to the Persians. The other city <lb/>
            appears to me to derive its name from the son-in-law of <lb/>
            Danaus, Archander, son of Phthius, and grandson of Achæus ; <lb/>
            for it is called Archandropolis. There may indeed have been <lb/>
            another Archander; but the name is certainly not Egyptian.</p>
          <p>99. Hitherto I have related what I have seen, what I <lb/>
            have thought, and what I have learnt by inquiry: but from <lb/>
            this point I proceed to give the Egyptian account accord­ <lb/>
            in,; to what I heard ; and there is added to it something <lb/>
            also of my own observation. The priests informed me, that <lb/>
            Menes, who first ruled over Egypt, in the first place pro­ <lb/>
            tected Memphis by a mound ; for the whole river formerly ran <lb/>
            close to the sandy mountain on the side of Libya ; but Menes, <lb/>
            beginning about a hundred stades above Memphis, filled in <lb/>
            the elbow towards the south, dried up the old channel, and <lb/>
            conducted the river into a canal, so as to make it flow between <lb/>
            the mountains :2 this bend of the Nile, which flows excluded <lb/>
            from its ancient course, is still carefully upheld by the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, being made secure every year ; for if the river should <lb/>
            break through and overflow in this part, there would be dan­ <lb/>
            ger lest all Memphis should be flooded. When the part cut <lb/>
            off had been made firm land by this Menes, who was first <lb/>
            king, he in the first place built on it the city that is now <lb/>
            called Memphis ; for Memphis is situate in the narrow part <lb/>
            of Egypt; and outside of it he excavated a lake from the <lb/>
            river towards the north and the west; for the Nile itself <lb/>
            bounds it towards the east. In the next place, they relate <lb/>
            that he built in it the temple of Vulcan, which is vast and well <lb/>
            worthy of mention. 100. After this the priests enumerated <lb/>
            from a book the names of three hundred and thirty other kings. <lb/>
            In so many generations of men, there were eighteen Ethiopians <lb/>
            and one native queen, the rest were Egyptians. The name <lb/>
            of this woman who reigned, was the same as that of the Baby- <lb/>
            Ionian queen, Nitocris : they said that she avenged her brother, <note type="footnote">' That is, those ofArabia and Libya </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[101-108"/> <lb/>
            whom the Egyptians had slain, while reigning over them; and <lb/>
            after they had slain him, they then delivered the kingdom to <lb/>
            her ; and she, to avenge him, destroyed many of the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians by stratagem: for having caused an extensive apartment <lb/>
            to be made under ground, she pretended that she was going <lb/>
            to consecrate it, but in reality had another design in view: <lb/>
            and having invited those of the Egyptians whom site knew to <lb/>
            have been principally concerned in the murder, she gave a <lb/>
            great banquet, and when they were feasting, she let in the <lb/>
            river upon them, through a large concealed channel. This is <lb/>
            all they related of her, except that, when she had done this, <lb/>
            she threw herself into a room full of ashes in order that she <lb/>
            might escape punishment. 101. Of the other kings they did <lb/>
            not mention any memorable deeds, nor that they were in any <lb/>
            respect renowned, except one, the last of them, Aceris ; but lie <lb/>
            accomplished some memorable works, as the portal of Vulcan's <lb/>
            temple, facing the north wind; and dug a lake, (the dimensions <lb/>
            of which I shall describe hereafter,) and built pyramids in it, <lb/>
            the size of which I shall also mention when I come to speak <lb/>
            of the lake itself. He, then, achieved these several works, but <lb/>
            none of the others achieved any thing.</p>
          <p>102. Having therefore passed them by, I shall proceed to <lb/>
            make mention of the king that came after them, whose name <lb/>
            was Sesostris. The priests said that he was the first who, setting <lb/>
            out in ships of war from the Arabian Gulf, subdued those <lb/>
            nations that dwell by the Red Sea; until sailing onwards, he <lb/>
            arrived at a sea which was not navigable on account of the <lb/>
            shoals; and afterwards, when he came back to Egypt, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the report of the priests, he assembled a large army, <lb/>
            and marched through the continent, subduing every nation <lb/>
            that he fell in with; and wherever he met with any who <lb/>
            were valiant, and who were very ardent in defence of their <lb/>
            liberty, he erected columns in their territory, with inscriptions <lb/>
            declaring his own name and country, and how he had con­ <lb/>
            quered them by his power: but when he subdued any <lb/>
            cities without fighting and easily, he made inscriptions on <lb/>
            columns in the same way as among the nations that had <lb/>
            proved themselves valiant; and he had besides engraved on <lb/>
            them the secret parts of a woman, wishing to make it known <lb/>
            that they were cowardly. 103. Thus doing, he traversed the <note type="footnote"> See Book I. chap 2, note 5. </note> <pb n="133"/>
            <note type="margin"> 104. 105.] </note> <lb/>
            continent, until, having crossed from Asia into Europe, he <lb/>
            subdued the Scythians and Thracians: to these the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian army appears to me to have reached, and no farther; for <lb/>
            in their country the columns appear to have been erected, but <lb/>
            no where beyond them. From thence, wheeling round, he <lb/>
            went back again; and when he arrived at the river Phasis, <lb/>
            I am unable after this to say with certainty, whether king <lb/>
            Sesostris himself, having detached a portion of his army, left <lb/>
            them there to settle in that country, or whether some of the <lb/>
            soldiers, being wearied with his wandering expedition, of <lb/>
            their own accord remained by the river Phasis. 104. For <lb/>
            the Colchians were evidently Egyptians, and I say this having <lb/>
            myself observed it before I heard it from others; and as it <lb/>
            was a matter of interest to me I inquired of both people, <lb/>
            and the Colchians had more recollection of the Egyptians <lb/>
            than the Egyptians had of the Colchians ; yet the Egyptians <lb/>
            said that they thought the Colchians were descended from the <lb/>
            army of Sesostris ; and I formed my conjecture, not only be­ <lb/>
            cause they are swarthy and curly-headed, for this amounts to <lb/>
            nothing, because others are so likewise, but chiefly from the <lb/>
            following circumstances, because the Colchians, Egyptians, <lb/>
            and Ethiopians, are the only nations of the world who, from <lb/>
            the first, have practised circumcision. For the Phœnicians, <lb/>
            and the Syrians in Palestine, acknowledge that they learnt <lb/>
            the custom from the Egyptians; and the Syrians about Ther­ <lb/>
            modon and the river Parthenius, with their neighbours the <lb/>
            Macrones, confess that they very lately learnt the same custom <lb/>
            from the Colchians. And these are the only nations that are <lb/>
            circumcised, and thus appear evidently to act in the same mail <lb/>
            ner as the Egyptians. But of the Egyptians and Ethiopians <lb/>
            I am unable to say which learnt it from the other, for it is <lb/>
            evidently a very ancient custom. And this appears to me a <lb/>
            strong proof that the Phœnicians learnt this practice through <lb/>
            their intercourse with the Egyptians, for all the Phœnicians <lb/>
            who have any commerce with Greece no longer imitate the <lb/>
            Egyptians in this usage, but abstain from circumcising their <lb/>
            children. 105. I will now mention4 another fact respecting <lb/>
            the Colchians, how they resemble the Egyptians, They alone <lb/>
            and the Egyptians manufacture5 linen in the same manner; and <lb/>
            the whole way of living, and the language, is similar in both <note type="footnote"> * " Come now, I will also mention." 5 See chap 35. </note> <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[106—108."/> <lb/>
            nations; but the Colchian linen is called by the Greeks Sar­ <lb/>
            donic, though that which comes from Egypt is called Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian. 106. As to the pillars which Sesostris king of Egypt <lb/>
            erected in the different countries, most of them are evidently <lb/>
            no longer in existence, but in Syrian Palestine I myself saw <lb/>
            some still remaining, and the inscriptions before mentioned <lb/>
            still on them, and the private parts of a woman. There are <lb/>
            also in Ionia two images of this king, carved on rocks, one on <lb/>
            the way rrom Ephesia to Phocæa, the other from Sardis to <lb/>
            Smyrna. In both places a man is carved, four cubits and a <lb/>
            half high, holding a spear in his right hand, and in his left a <lb/>
            bow, and the rest of his equipment in unison, for it is partly <lb/>
            Egyptian and partly Ethiopian; from one shoulder to the <lb/>
            other across the breast extend sacred Egyptian characters en­ <lb/>
            graved, which have the following meaning: "I ACQUIRED THIS <lb/>
            REGION BY MY OWN SHOULDERS.” Who or whence he is, he does <lb/>
            not here show, but has elsewhere made known. Some, how­ <lb/>
            ever, who have seen these monuments have conjectured them <lb/>
            to be images of Memnon, herein being very far from the truth.</p>
          <p>107. The priests said moreover of this Egyptian Sesostris, <lb/>
            that returning and bringing with him many men from the na­ <lb/>
            tions whose territories he had subdued, when he arrived at the <lb/>
            Pelusian Daphnæ, his brother, to whom he had committed the <lb/>
            government of Egypt, invited him to an entertainment, and <lb/>
            his sons with him, and caused wood to be piled up round the <lb/>
            house, and having caused it to be piled up, set it on fire: but <lb/>
            that Sesostris, being informed of this, immediately consulted <lb/>
            with his wife, for he took his wife with him ; and she advised <lb/>
            him to extend two of his six sons across the fire, and form a <lb/>
            bridge over the burning mass, and that the rest should step <lb/>
            on them and make their escape. Sesostris did so, and two of <lb/>
            his sons were in this manner burnt to death, but the rest, to­ <lb/>
            gether with their father, were saved. 108. Sesostris having <lb/>
            returned to Egypt, and taken revenge on his brother, em­ <lb/>
            ployed the multitude of prisoners whom he brought from <lb/>
            the countries he had subdued, in the following works: these <lb/>
            were the persons who drew the huge stones which, in the <lb/>
            time of this king, were conveyed to the temple of Vulcan j <lb/>
            they, too, were compelled to dig all the canals now seen in <lb/>
            Egypt; by their involuntary labour they made Egypt, which. <lb/>
            before was throughout practicable for horses and carriages, <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="109—111.]"/> <lb/>
            unfit for these purposes; for from that time Egypt, though it <lb/>
            was one level plain, became impassable for horses or carriages; <lb/>
            and this is caused by the canals, which are numerous and in <lb/>
            every direction. But the king intersected the country for <lb/>
            this reason : such of the Egyptians as occupied the cities not <lb/>
            on the river, but inland, when the river receded, being in <lb/>
            want of water, were forced to use a brackish beverage which <lb/>
            they drew6 from wells ; and for this reason Egypt was inter­ <lb/>
            sected. 109. They said also that this king divided the coun­ <lb/>
            try amongst all the Egyptians, giving an equal square allot­ <lb/>
            ment to each; and from thence he drew his revenues, having <lb/>
            required them to pay a fixed tax every year; but if the river <lb/>
            happened to take away a part of any one's allotment, he was <lb/>
            to come to him and make known what had happened ; where­ <lb/>
            upon the king sent persons to inspect and measure how much <lb/>
            the land was diminished, that in future he might pay a pro­ <lb/>
            portionate part of the appointed tax. Hence land-measuring <lb/>
            appears to me to have had its beginning, and to have passed <lb/>
            over into Greece : for the pole and the sun-dial, and the di­ <lb/>
            vision of the day into twelve parts, the Greeks learnt from the <lb/>
            Babylonians. 110. This king then was the only Egyptian <lb/>
            that ruled over Ethiopia ; and he left as memorials before <lb/>
            Vulcan's temple, statues of stone ; two of thirty cubits, him­ <lb/>
            self and his wife ; and his four sons, each of twenty cubits. <lb/>
            A long time after, the priest of Vulcan would not suffer Da­ <lb/>
            rius the Persian to place his statue before them, saying, "that <lb/>
            deeds had not been achieved by him equal to those of Sesos­ <lb/>
            tris the Egyptian : for that Sesostris had subdued other na­ <lb/>
            tions, not fewer than Darius had done, and the Scythians <lb/>
            besides ; but that Darius was not able to conquer the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians ; wherefore it was not right for one who had not sur­ <lb/>
            passed him in achievements to place his statue before his <lb/>
            offerings." They relate, however, that Darius pardoned these <lb/>
            observations.</p>
          <p>111. After the death of Sesostris, they said that his son <lb/>
            Pheron succeeded to the kingdom ; that he undertook no <lb/>
            military expedition, and happened to become blind through the <lb/>

            height for that time, to eighteen cubits, when it overflowed <lb/>
            the fields, a storm of wind arose, and the river was tossed <lb/>
            about in waves ; whereupon they say that the king with <lb/>
            great arrogance laid hold of a javelin, and threw it into the <lb/>
            midst of the eddies of the river ; and that immediately after­ <lb/>
            wards he was seized with a pain in his eyes, and became <lb/>
            blind. He continued blind for ten years ; but in the eleventh <lb/>
            year an oracle reached him from the city of Buto, importing <lb/>
            " that the time of his punishment was expired, and he should <lb/>
            recover his sight, by washing his eyes with the urine of a <lb/>
            woman who had had intercourse with her own husband only, <lb/>
            and had known no other man. He therefore made trial of <lb/>
            his own wife first, and afterwards, when he did not recover <lb/>
            his sight, he made trial of others indifferently ; and at length <lb/>
            having recovered his sight, he collected the women of whom <lb/>
            he had made trial, except the one by washing with whose <lb/>
            urine he had recovered his sight, into one city, which is now <lb/>
            called Erythrebolus, and when he had assembled them to­ <lb/>
            gether he had them all burnt, together with the city; but the <lb/>
            woman, by washing in whose urine he recovered his sight, <lb/>
            he took to himself to wife. Having escaped from this cala­ <lb/>
            mity in his eyes, he dedicated other offerings throughout all <lb/>
            the celebrated temples, and, what is most worthy of mention, <lb/>
            he dedicated to the temple of the sun works worthy of ad­ <lb/>
            miration, two stone obelisks, each consisting of one stone, <lb/>
            and each a hundred cubits in length and eight cubits in <lb/>
            breadth.</p>
          <p>112. They said that a native of Memphis succeeded him <lb/>
            in the kingdom, whose name in the Grecian language is Pro­ <lb/>
            teus : there is to this day an enclosure sacred to him at Mem­ <lb/>
            phis, which is very beautiful and richly adorned, situated to the <lb/>
            south side of the temple of Vulcan. Tyrian Phoenicians <lb/>
            dwell round this enclosure, and the whole tract is called the <lb/>
            Tyrian camp.8 In this enclosure of Proteus, is a temple which <lb/>
            is called after the foreign Venus ; and I conjecture that thif <lb/>
            is the temple of Helen the daughter of Tyndarus, both be­ <lb/>
            cause I have heard that Helen lived with Proteus, and also <lb/>
            because it is named from the foreign Venus : for of all the <lb/>
            other temples of Venus, none is any where called by the name <note type="footnote"> 8 In chap. 151, we meet with the camp of the Ionians aud Ca­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="113—115.]"/> <lb/>
            of foreign. 113, When I inquired about Helen, the priests <lb/>
            told me that the case was thus : that when Paris had carried <lb/>
            Helen off from Sparta, he sailed away to his own country, <lb/>
            and when he was in the Ægean, violent winds drove him out <lb/>
            of his course into the Egyptian sea, and from thence (for the <lb/>
            gale did not abate) he came to Egypt, and in Egypt to that <lb/>
            which is now called the-Canopic mouth of the Nile, and to Ta­ <lb/>
            richeæ. On that shore stood a temple of Hercules, which re­ <lb/>
            mains to this day ; in which, if the slave of any person what­ <lb/>
            soever takes refuge, and has sacred marks impressed on him, <lb/>
            so devoting himself to the god, it is not lawful to lay hands on <lb/>
            him. This custom continues the same to my time as it was <lb/>
            from the first. The attendants of Paris therefore, when in­ <lb/>
            formed of the custom that prevailed respecting the temple, <lb/>
            revolted from him, and sitting as suppliants of the god, ac­ <lb/>
            cused Paris with a view to injure him, relating the whole <lb/>
            account, how things stood with regard to Helen, and his <lb/>
            injustice towards Menelaus. These accusations were made to <lb/>
            the priests, and the governor of that mouth, whose name was <lb/>
            Thonis. 114. Thonis having heard this, immediately sends a <lb/>
            message to Proteus at Memphis, to the following effect: "A <lb/>
            stranger of Trojan race has arrived, after having committed a <lb/>
            nefarious deed in Greece ; for having beguiled the wife of his <lb/>
            own host, he has brought her with him, and very great <lb/>
            treasures, having been driven by winds to this land. Whether <lb/>
            then shall we allow him to depart unmolested, or shall we seize <lb/>
            what he has brought with him ?" Proteus sends back a <lb/>
            messenger with the following answer : " Seize this man, who­ <lb/>
            ever he may be, that has acted so wickedly towards his host, <lb/>
            and bring him to me, that I may know what he will say <lb/>
            for himself." 115. Thonis, having received this message, <lb/>
            seizes Paris, and detains his ships ; and then sent him up <lb/>
            to Memphis with Helen and his treasures, and besides the <lb/>
            suppliants also. When all were carried up, Proteus asked <lb/>
            Paris who he was, and whence he had sailed ; and he gave <lb/>
            him an account of his family, and told him the name of his <lb/>
            country, and moreover described his voyage and from whence <lb/>
            he had set sail. Then Proteus asked him whence he got <lb/>
            Helen ; and when Paris prevaricated in his account, and did <lb/>
            not speak the truth, they who had become suppliants accused <lb/>
            him, relating the whole account of his crime. At last Proteus <pb n="138"/>
             <note type="margin">[116 </note> <lb/>
            pronounced this judgment, saying : “If I did not think it of <lb/>
            great moment, not to put any stranger to death who, being <lb/>
            prevented by the winds from pursuing his course, has come to <lb/>
            lilY territory, I would take vengeance on you on behalf of the <lb/>
            Grecian, you basest of men, who, after you had met with <lb/>
            hospitable treatment, have committed the most nefarious deed : <lb/>
            you seduced the wife of your host, and this did not content <lb/>
            you, but having excited her passions,9 you have taken her <lb/>
            away, by stealth. Nor even did this content you, but you <lb/>
            have also robbed the house of your host, and come hither with <lb/>
            the spoils : now therefore, since I deem it of great moment not <lb/>
            to put a stranger to death, I will not suffer you to carry away <lb/>
            this woman, or this treasure, but I will keep them for your <lb/>
            Grecian host, until he please to come himself and take them <lb/>
            away; as for you and your shipmates, I bid you depart out <lb/>
            of my territory to some other within three days ; if not, you <lb/>
            shall be treated as enemies."</p>
          <p>116. The priests gave this account of the arrival of Helen <lb/>
            at the court of Proteus. And Homer appears to me to have <lb/>
            heard this relation ; but it was not equally suited to epic <lb/>
            poetry as the other which he has made use of, wherefore he <lb/>
            has rejected it, though he has plainly shown that he was ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with this account also. And this is evident; since <lb/>
            he has described in the Iliad (and has no where else retraced <lb/>
            his steps) the wanderings of Paris, how, while he was carry­ <lb/>
            in- off Helen, he was driven out of his course, and wandered <lb/>
            to other places, and how he arrived at Sidon of Phœnicia: <lb/>
            and he has mentioned it in the exploits of Diomede, his verses <lb/>
            are as follows : " Where were the variegated robes, works of <lb/>
            Sidonian women, which god-like Paris himself brought from <lb/>
            Sidon, sailing over the wide sea, along the course by which he <lb/>
            conveyed high-born Helen.”1 He mentions it also in the <lb/>
            Odyssey, in the following lines: " Such well-chosen drugs <lb/>
            had the daughter of Jove, of excellent quality, which Poly­ <lb/>
            damna gave her, the Egyptian wife of Thonis, where the <lb/>
            fruitful earth produces many drugs, many excellent when <lb/>
            mixed, and many noxious."2 Menelaus also says the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing to Telemachus: " The gods detained me in Egypt, <note type="footnote"> 9 Literally, " having raised the wings." </note><note type="footnote"> ' Ilhd, vi. 289. 2 Odyssey, iv. 22. </note> <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="117—119.]"/> <lb/>
            though anxious to return hither, because I did not offer per­ <lb/>
            fect hecatombs to them.”3 He shows in these verses, that he <lb/>
            was acquainted with the wandering of Paris in Egypt; <lb/>
            for Syria borders on Egypt, and the Phœnicians, to whom <lb/>
            Sidon belongs, inhabit Syria. 117. From these verses, and <lb/>
            this first passage especially, it is clear that Homer was not <lb/>
            the author of the Cyprian verses, but some other person. For <lb/>
            in the Cyprian verses it is said, that Paris reached Ilium from <lb/>
            Sparta on the third day, when he carried off Helen, having met <lb/>
            with a favourable wind and a smooth sea ; whereas Homer in <lb/>
            the Iliad says that he wandered far while taking her with him. <lb/>
            And now I take my leave of Homer and the Cyprian verses.</p>
          <p>118. When I asked the priests whether the Greeks tell an <lb/>
            idle story about the Trojan war, or not; they gave me the <lb/>
            following answer, saying that they knew it by inquiry from <lb/>
            Menelaus himself: That after the rape of Helen, a vast army <lb/>
            of Grecians came to the land of Teucria to assist Menelaus; and <lb/>
            that when the army had landed and pitched their camp, they <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Ilium, and that Menelaus himself went with <lb/>
            them: when they reached the walls, they demanded the resti­ <lb/>
            tution of . Helen, and the treasures that Paris had stolen from <lb/>
            him, and satisfaction for the injuries done : that the Trojans <lb/>
            told the same story then and ever after, both when put to the <lb/>
            oath and when not swearing, that they had neither Helen nor <lb/>
            the treasures about which they were accused, but that they <lb/>
            were all in Egypt; and that they could not with justice be <lb/>
            answerable for what Proteus the Egyptian king had in his <lb/>
            possession: but the Greeks, thinking they were derided by <lb/>
            them, therefore besieged them until they took their city. <lb/>
            When, however, after they had taken the fortifications, Helen <lb/>
            was no where found, but they heard, the same story as before, <lb/>
            then they gave credit to the first account, and sent Menelaus <lb/>
            himself to Proteus. 119. When Menelaus reached Egypt, <lb/>
            he sailed up to Memphis, and related the real .truth : he <lb/>
            both met with very hospitable entertainment, and received <lb/>
            back Helen unharmed, and besides all his treasures. Mene-. <lb/>
            laus, however, though he met with this treatment, behaved <lb/>
            very iniquitously to the Egyptians: for when he was de­ <lb/>
            sirous of sailing away, contrary winds detained him ; and <pb n="140"/>
             <note type="margin">[120. </note> <lb/>
            when this continued the same for a long time, he had recourse <lb/>
            to a nefarious expedient; for having taken two children of the <lb/>
            people of the country, he sacrificed them;4 but afterwards, <lb/>
            when it was discovered that he had done this deed, he was <lb/>
            detested and persecuted by the Egyptians, and led with his <lb/>
            ships to Libya: whither he bent his course from thence, the <lb/>
            Egyptians were unable to say ; but of the above particulars <lb/>
            they said they knew some by inquiry, and others, having taken <lb/>
            place among themselves, they were able from their own <lb/>
            knowledge to speak of with certainty. 120. These things <lb/>
            the priests of the Egyptians related ; and I myself agree with <lb/>
            the account that is given respecting Helen, from the following <lb/>
            considerations. If Helen had been in Ilium, she would have <lb/>
            been restored to the Grecians, whether Paris were willing or <lb/>
            not. For surely Priam could not have been so infatuated, nor <lb/>
            the others his relatives, as to be willing to expose their own <lb/>
            persons, their children, and the city to danger, in order that <lb/>
            Paris might cohabit with Helen. But even if at first they <lb/>
            had taken this resolution, yet seeing that many of the other <lb/>
            Trojans perished, whenever they engaged with the Greeks, <lb/>
            and that on every occasion when a battle took place, two or <lb/>
            three or even more of Priam's own sons fell, if we may speak <lb/>
            on the authority of the epic poets ;-when such things hap­ <lb/>
            pened, I think, that if Priam himself were cohabiting with <lb/>
            Helen, he would have restored her to the Greeks, in order to <lb/>
            be delivered from such present evils. Neither would the <lb/>
            kingdom devolve upon Paris, so that when Priam was now <lb/>
            old, the administration of affairs should fall upon him ; but <lb/>
            Hector, who was both older and more a man than he was: <lb/>
            would succeed to the throne on the death of Priam ; nor did <lb/>
            it become him to give way to his brother when acting un­ <lb/>
            justly, and this too when through his means so many evils <lb/>
            were falling on himself, and on all the rest of the Trojans. <lb/>
            But indeed they had it not in their power to restore Helen, <lb/>
            nor, when they spoke the truth, did the Greeks give credit to <lb/>
            them : providence ordaining, as I am of opinion, that they, by <lb/>
            utterly perishing, should make it clear to all men, that for <lb/>
            great crimes great punishments at the hands of the gods arc <note type="footnote"> 4 Literally, " lie made victims of them :" by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντομα</foreign> are meant <lb/>
            " victims slain to appease the infernal deities.” </note> <pb n="141"/>
            <note type="margin"> 121.] </note> <lb/>
            in store. Thus these things have been related as they appear <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>121. The priests also informed me, that Rhampsinitus suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded Proteus in the kingdom : he left as a monument the <lb/>
            portico of the temple of Vulcan, fronting to the west; and he <lb/>
            erected two statues before the portico, twenty-five cubits <lb/>
            high. Of these, the one standing to the north the Egyptians <lb/>
            call Summer ; and that to the south, Winter : and the one <lb/>
            that they call Summer, they worship and do honour to; but <lb/>
            the one called Winter, they treat in a quite contrary way.</p>
          <p>1. This king, they said, possessed a great quantity of <lb/>
            money, such as no one of the succeeding kings was able to <lb/>
            surpass, or even nearly come up to ; and he, wishing to trea­ <lb/>
            sure up his wealth in safety, built a chamber of stone, of <lb/>
            which one of the walls adjoined the outside of the palace. <lb/>
            But the builder, forming a plan against it, devised the follow­ <lb/>
            ing contrivance ; he fitted one of the stones so that it might <lb/>
            be easily taken out by two men, or even one. When the <lb/>
            chamber was finished, the king laid up his treasures in it; but <lb/>
            in course of time the builder, finding his end approaching, called <lb/>
            his sons to him, for he had two, and described to them how (pro­ <lb/>
            viding for them that they might have abundant sustenance) he <lb/>
            had contrived when building the king's treasury ; and having <lb/>
            clearly explained to them every thing relating to the removal <lb/>
            of the stone, he gave them its dimensions, and told them, if <lb/>
            they would observe his instructions, they would be stewards <lb/>
            of the king's riches. He accordingly died, and the sons were <lb/>
            not long in applying themselves to the work; but having <lb/>
            come by night to the palace, and having found the stone in <lb/>
            the building, they easily removed it, and carried off a great <lb/>
            quantity of treasure. 2.'When the king happened to open <lb/>
            the chamber, he was astonished at seeing the vessels deficient <lb/>
            in treasure; but he was not able to accuse any one, as the <lb/>
            seals were unbroken, and the chamber well secured. When <lb/>
            therefore, on his opening it two or three times, the treasures <lb/>
            were always evidently diminished, (for the thieves did not <lb/>
            cease plundering,) he adopted the following plan ; he ordered <lb/>
            traps to be made, and placed them round the vessels in which <lb/>
            the treasures were. But when the thieves came as before, <lb/>
            and one of them had entered, as soon as he went near a ves­ <lb/>
            sel, he was straightway caught in the trap; perceiving, there- <pb n="142"/>
             <note type="margin">[121 </note> <lb/>
            fore, in what a predicament he was, he immediately called to <lb/>
            his brother, and told him what had happened, and bade him <lb/>
            enter as quick as possible, and cut off his head, lest, if he was <lb/>
            seen and recognised, he should ruin him also: the other <lb/>
            thought that he spoke well, and did as he was advised ; then, <lb/>
            having fitted in the stone, he returned home, taking with him <lb/>
            his brother's head. 3. When day came, the king having en­ <lb/>
            tered the chamber, was astonished at seeing the body of the <lb/>
            thief in the trap without the head, but the chamber secure, <lb/>
            and without any means of entrance or exit. In this perplex­ <lb/>
            ity he contrived the following plan ; he hung up the body of <lb/>
            the thief from the wall, and having placed sentinels there, he <lb/>
            ordered them to seize and bring before him whomsoever they <lb/>
            should see weeping or expressing commiseration at the <lb/>
            spectacle. The mother was greatly grieved at the body being <lb/>
            suspended, and coming to words with her surviving son, com­ <lb/>
            manded him, by any means he could, to contrive how he <lb/>
            might take down and bring away the corpse of his brother ; <lb/>
            but, should he neglect to do so, she threatened to go to the <lb/>
            king, and inform him that he had the treasures. 4. When <lb/>
            the mother treated her surviving son harshly, and when with <lb/>
            many entreaties he was unable to persuade her, he contrived <lb/>
            the following plan ; having got some asses, and having filled <lb/>
            some skins with wine, he put them on the asses, and then <lb/>
            drove them along ; but when he came near the sentinels that <lb/>
            guarded the suspended corpse, having drawn out two or three <lb/>
            of the necks of the skins that hung down, he loosened them ; <lb/>
            and when the wine ran out, he beat his head, and cried out <lb/>
            aloud, as if he knew not to which of the asses he should turn <lb/>
            first: but the sentinels, when they saw wine flowing in abund­ <lb/>
            ance, ran into the road, with vessels in their hands, caught <lb/>
            the wine that was being spilt, thinking it all their own gain ; <lb/>
            but the man, feigning anger, railed bitterly against them all ; <lb/>
            however, as the sentinels soothed him, he at length pretended <lb/>
            to be pacified, and to forego his anger; at last he irove his <lb/>
            asses out of the road, and set them to rights again. When <lb/>
            more conversation passed, and one of the sentinels joked with <lb/>
            him and moved him to laughter, he gave them another of the <lb/>
            skins; and they, just as they were, lay down and set to to <lb/>
            drink, and joined him to their party, and invited him to stay­ <lb/>
            and drink with them he was persuaded, forsooth, and <unclear>re</unclear> <pb n="143"/>
             <note type="margin">121.] </note> <lb/>
            named with them; and as they treated him kindly daring <lb/>
            che drinking, he gave them another of the skins ; and the <lb/>
            sentinels, having taken very copious draughts, became exceed­ <lb/>
            ugly drunk, and being overpowered by the wine, fell asleep <lb/>
            on the spot where they had been drinking. But he,, as the <lb/>
            night was far advanced, took down the body of his brother, <lb/>
            and by way of insult shaved the right cheeks of all the senti. <lb/>
            nels ; then having laid the corpse on the asses, he drove home, <lb/>
            having performed his mother's injunctions. 5. The king, <lb/>
            when he was informed that the body of the thief had been <lb/>
            stolen, was exceedingly indignant, and, resolving by any <lb/>
            means to find out the contriver of this artifice, had recourse, <lb/>
            as it is said, to the following plan, a design which to me <lb/>
            seems incredible: he placed his own daughter in a brothel, <lb/>
            ind ordered her to admit all alike to her embraces, but before <lb/>
            they had intercourse with her, to compel each one to tell her <lb/>
            what he had done during his life most clever and most wicked, <lb/>
            and whosoever should tell her the facts relating to the thief, <lb/>
            she was to seize, and not suffer him to escape. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the daughter did what her father commanded, the thief, <lb/>
            having ascertained for what purpose this contrivance was had <lb/>
            recourse to, and being desirous to outdo the king in craftiness, <lb/>
            did as follows : having cut off the arm of a fresh corpse at the <lb/>
            shoulder, he took it with him under his cloak, and having <lb/>
            gone in to the king's daughter, and being asked the same ques­ <lb/>
            tions as all the rest were, he related that he had done the most <lb/>
            wicked thing when he cut off his brother's head who was <lb/>
            caught in a trap in the king's treasury; and the most clever <lb/>
            thing, when, having made the sentinels drunk, he took away <lb/>
            the corpse of his brother that was hung up: she, when she <lb/>
            heard this, endeavoured to seize him, but the thief in the dark <lb/>
            held out to her the dead man's arm, and she seized it and held <lb/>
            it fast, imagining that she had got hold of the man's own arm ; <lb/>
            then the thief, having let it go, made his escape through the <lb/>
            door. 6. When this also was reported to the king, he was <lb/>
            istonished at the shrewdness and daring of the man; and at <lb/>
            last, sending throughout all the cities, he caused a proclama­ <lb/>
            ion to be made, offering a free pardon, and promising great <lb/>
            reward to the man, if he would discover himself. The thief, <lb/>
            relying on this promise, went to the king's palace; and Rhamp­ <lb/>
            nitus greatly admired him and gave him his daughter in <pb n="144"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[122—124"/> <lb/>
            marriage, accounting him the most knowing of all men; for <lb/>
            that the Egyptians are superior to all others, but he was su­ <lb/>
            perior to the Egyptians.</p>
          <p>122. After this, they said, that this king descended alive <lb/>
            into the place which the Greeks call Hades, and there played <lb/>
            at dice with Ceres, and sometimes won, and other times <lb/>
            lost; and that he came up again and brought with him as <lb/>
            a present from her a napkin of gold. On account of the <lb/>
            descent of Rhampsinitus, since he came back again they said <lb/>
            that the Egyptians celebrated a festival: this I know they <lb/>
            observed even in my time; but whether they held this feast <lb/>
            for some other reason, or for that above mentioned, I am un­ <lb/>
            able to say. However, on that same day, the priests, having <lb/>
            woven a cloak, bind the eyes of one of their uumber with a <lb/>
            scarf, and having conducted him with the cloak on him to the <lb/>
            way that leads to the temple of Ceres, they then return : upon <lb/>
            which they say, this priest with his eyes bound is led by two <lb/>
            wolves to the temple of Ceres, twenty stades distant from <lb/>
            the city, and afterwards the wolves lead him back to the <lb/>
            same place. 123. Any person to whom such things appear <lb/>
            credible may adopt the accounts given by the Egyptians; it <lb/>
            is my object, however, throughout the whole history, to write <lb/>
            what I hear from each people. The Egyptians say that <lb/>
            Ceres and Bacchus hold the chief sway in the infernal regions ; <lb/>
            and the Egyptians also were the first who asserted the doctrine <lb/>
            that the soul of man is immortal, and that when the body <lb/>
            perishes it enters into some other animal, constantly springing <lb/>
            into existence; and when it has passed through the different <lb/>
            kinds of terrestrial, marine, and aerial beings, it again enters <lb/>
            into the body of a man that is born; and that this revolution <lb/>
            is made in three thousand years. Some of the Greeks have <lb/>
            adopted this opinion, some earlier, others later, as if it were <lb/>
            their own ; but although I knew their names I do not mention <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>124. Now, they told me, that to the reign of Rhampsinitus <lb/>
            there was a perfect distribution of justice, and that all Egypt <lb/>
            was in a high state of prosperity; but that after him Cheops, <lb/>
            coming to reign over them, plunged into every kind of wick­ <lb/>
            edness. For that, having shut up all the temples, he first of <lb/>
            all forbade them to offer sacrifice, and afterwards he ordered <lb/>
            all the Egyptians to work for himself; some, accordingly, were <pb n="145"/>
             <note type="margin">125.] </note> <lb/>
            appointed to draw stones from the quarries in the Arabian <lb/>
            mountain down to the Nile, others he ordered to receive the <lb/>
            stones when transported in vessels across the river, and to <lb/>
            drag them to the mountain called the Libyan. And they <lb/>
            worked to the number of a hundred thousand men at a time, <lb/>
            each party during three months. The time during which the <lb/>
            people were thus harassed by toil, lasted ten years on the road <lb/>
            which they constructed, along which they drew the stones, a <lb/>
            work, in my opinion, not much less than the pyramid : for its <lb/>
            length is five stades, and its width ten orgyæ, and its height, <lb/>
            where it is the highest, eight orgyre ; and it is of polished <lb/>
            stone, with figures carved on it: on this road then ten years <lb/>
            were expended, and in forming the subterraneous apartments <lb/>
            on the hill, on which the pyramids stand, which he had made <lb/>
            as a burial vault for himself, in an island, formed by draining <lb/>
            a canal from the Nile. Twenty years were spent in erecting <lb/>
            the pyramid itself: of this, which is square, each face is <lb/>
            eight plethra, and the height is the same ; it is composed of <lb/>
            polished stones, and jointed with the greatest exactness ; none <lb/>
            of the stones are less than thirty feet. 125. This pyramid <lb/>
            was built thus ; in the form of steps, which some call crossæ, <lb/>
            others bomides. When they had first built it in this manner, <lb/>
            they raised the remaining stones by machines made of short <lb/>
            pieces of wood : having lifted them from the ground to the <lb/>
            first range of steps, when the stone arrived there, it was put on <lb/>
            another machine that stood ready on the first range ; and <lb/>
            from this it was drawn to the second range on another ma­ <lb/>
            chine ; for the machines were equal in number to the ranges <lb/>
            of steps ; or they removed the machine, which was only one, <lb/>
            and portable, to each range in succession, whenever they <lb/>
            wished to raise the stone higher ; for I should relate it in <lb/>
            both ways, as it is related. The highest parts of it, therefore, <lb/>
            were first finished, and afterwards they completed the parts <lb/>
            next following ; but last of all they finished the parts on the <lb/>
            ground, and that were lowest. On the pyramid is shown <lb/>
            an inscription, in Egyptian characters, how much was ex­ <lb/>
            pended in radishes, onions, and garlic, for the workmen; <lb/>
            which the interpreter, as I well remember, reading the in­ <lb/>
            scription, told me amounted to one thousand six hundred <lb/>
            talents of silver. And if this be really the case, how much <lb/>
            more was probably expended in iron tools, in bread, and in <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[126—129"/> <lb/>
            clothes for the labourers, since they occupied in building the <lb/>
            works the time which I mentioned, and no short time besides, <lb/>
            as I think, in cutting and drawing the stones, and in forming <lb/>
            the subterraneous excavation. 126. It is related that Cheops <lb/>
            reached such a degree of infamy, that being in want of money, <lb/>
            he prostituted his own daughter in a brothel, and ordered her <lb/>
            to extort, they did not say how much ; but she exacted a <lb/>
            certain sum of money, privately, as much as her father or­ <lb/>
            dered her ; and contrived to leave a monument of herself, and <lb/>
            asked every one that came in to her to give her a stone to­ <lb/>
            wards the edifice she designed : of these stones they said the <lb/>
            pyramid was built that stands in the middle of the three, be­ <lb/>
            fore the great pyramid, each side of which is a plethron and <lb/>
            a half in length. 127. The Egyptians say that this Cheops <lb/>
            reigned fifty years ; and when he died, his brother Chephren <lb/>
            succeeded to the kingdom ; and he followed the same prac­ <lb/>
            tices as the other, both in other respects, and in building a <lb/>
            pyramid ; which does not come up to the dimensions of his <lb/>
            brother's, for I myself measured them ; nor has it subter­ <lb/>
            raneous chambers; nor does a channel from the Nile flow to <lb/>
            it, as to the other ; but this flows through an artificial aque­ <lb/>
            duct round an island within, in which they say the body of <lb/>
            Cheops is laid. Having laid the first course of variegated <lb/>
            Ethiopian stones, less in height than the other by forty feet, <lb/>
            he built it near the large pyramid. They both stand on the <lb/>
            same hill, which is about a hundred feet high. Chephren, they <lb/>
            said, reigned fifty-six years. 128. Thus one hundred and <lb/>
            six years are reckoned, during which the Egyptians suffered <lb/>
            all kinds of calamities, and for this length of time the temples <lb/>
            were closed and never opened. From the hatred they bear <lb/>
            them, the Egyptians are not very willing to mention their <lb/>
            names ; but call the pyramids after Philition, a shepherd, who <lb/>
            at that time kept his cattle in those parts.</p>
          <p>129. They said that after him, Mycerinus, son of Cheops, <lb/>
            reigned over Egypt; that the conduct of his father was dis­ <lb/>
            pleasing to him ; and that he opened the temples, and per­ <lb/>
            mitted the people, who were worn down to the last extremity, <lb/>
            to return to their employments, and to sacrifices ; and that he <lb/>
            made the most just decisions of all their kings. On this ac­ <lb/>
            count, of all the kings that ever reigned in Egypt, they praise <lb/>
            him most, for he both judged well in other respects, and <pb n="147"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="130-132.]"/> <lb/>
            moreover, when any man complained of nis decision, he used <lb/>
            to make him some present out of his own treasury and pacify <lb/>
            his anger. To this Mycerinus, who was thus beneficent to­ <lb/>
            wards his subjects, and who followed these practices, the first <lb/>
            beginning of misfortunes was the death of his daughter, who <lb/>
            was his only child : whereupon he, being extremely afflicted <lb/>
            with the calamity that had befallen him, and wishing to bury <lb/>
            her in a more costly manner than usual, caused a hollow <lb/>
            wooden image of a cow to be made, and then, having covered <lb/>
            it with gold, he put the body of his deceased daughter into it. <lb/>
            130. This cow was not interred in the ground, but even in <lb/>
            my time was exposed to view, being in the city of Sais, <lb/>
            placed in the royal palace, in a richly furnished chamber ; <lb/>
            and they burn near it all kinds of aromatics every day, and a <lb/>
            lamp is kept burning by it throughout each night. In another <lb/>
            chamber near to this cow are placed the images of Mycerinus's <lb/>
            concubines, as the priests of Sais affirmed ; and indeed wooden <lb/>
            statues, about twenty in number, all formed naked, are placed <lb/>
            there; however, as to who they are, I am unable to say, except <lb/>
            what was told me. 131. Some people however give the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing account of this cow and these statues : that Mycerinus <lb/>
            fell in love with his own daughter, and had intercourse with <lb/>
            her against her will; but afterwards, they say, that the girl <lb/>
            strangled herself through grief, and he entombed her in this <lb/>
            cow ; but her mother cut off the hands of the servants who <lb/>
            had betrayed her daughter to the father; and that now their <lb/>
            images have suffered the same that they did when alive. But <lb/>
            these things, as I conjecture, are trifling fables, both in other <lb/>
            respects and in what relates to the hands of the statues, for I <lb/>
            myself saw that they had lost their hands from age, which <lb/>
            were seen lying at their feet even in my time. 132. The <lb/>
            cow is in other parts covered with a purple cloth, but shows <lb/>
            the head and the neck, covered over with very thick gold ; <lb/>
            and the orb of the sun imitated in gold is placed between the <lb/>
            horns. The cow is not standing up, but kneeling; in size it <lb/>
            is equal to a large living cow. It is carried every year out of <lb/>
            the chamber. When the Egyptians beat5 themselves for the <lb/>
            god that is not to be named by me on this occasion, they then <lb/>
            carry out the cow to the light; for they say that she, when <note type="footnote"> <unclear>5</unclear> See Chap. 61. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="margin"> [133, 134. </note> <lb/>
            she was dying, entreated her father Mycerinus to permit her <lb/>
            to see the sun once every year. 133. After the loss of his <lb/>
            daughter, this second calamity betel this king: an oracle <lb/>
            reached him from the city of Buto, importing, " that he had no <lb/>
            more than six years to live, and should die in the seventh :" <lb/>
            but he, thinking this very hard, sent a reproachful message <lb/>
            to the god, complaining, " that his father and uncle, who had <lb/>
            shut up the temples, and paid no regard to the gods, and more­ <lb/>
            over had oppressed men, had lived long; whereas he who was <lb/>
            religious must die so soon." But a second message came to <lb/>
            him from the oracle, stating, " that for this very reason his <lb/>
            life was shortened, because he had not done what he ought to <lb/>
            have done; for it was needful that Egypt should be afflicted <lb/>
            during one hundred and fifty years; and the two who were kings <lb/>
            before him understood this, but he did not." When Mycerinus <lb/>
            heard this, seeing that this sentence was now pronounced against <lb/>
            him, he ordered a great number of lamps to be made, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing lighted them, whenever night came on, he drank and enjoyed <lb/>
            himself, never ceasing night or day, roving about the marshes <lb/>
            and groves, wherever he could hear of places most suited for <lb/>
            pleasure: and he had recourse to this artifice for the purpose <lb/>
            of convicting the oracle of falsehood, that by turning the <lb/>
            nights into days, he might have twelve years instead of six.</p>
          <p>134. This king also left a pyramid much less than that of <lb/>
            his father, being on each side twenty feet short of three ple­ <lb/>
            thra ; it is quadrangular, and built half-way up of Ethiopian <lb/>
            stone. Some of the Grecians erroneously say that this pyra­ <lb/>
            mid is the work of the courtesan Rhodopis; but they <lb/>
            evidently appear to me ignorant who Rhodopis was ; for they <lb/>
            would not else have attributed to her the building such a <lb/>
            pyramid, on which, so to speak, numberless thousands of <lb/>
            talents were expended; besides, Rhodopis flourished in the <lb/>
            reign of Amasis, and not at this time ; for she was very many <lb/>
            years later than those kings who left these pyramids. By <lb/>
            birth she was a Thracian, servant to Iadmon, son of He­ <lb/>
            phæstopolis, a Samian, aud fellow-servant with Æsop, the <lb/>
            writer of fables, for he too belonged to Iadmon, as is clearly <lb/>
            proved by this circumstance. When the Delphians frequently <lb/>
            made proclamation, in obedience to the oracle, for " any one <lb/>
            who would require satisfaction for the death of Æsop,” no one <lb/>
            else appeared, but another Iadmon, the grandson of this lad- <pb n="149"/>
             <note type="margin">135, 136.] </note> <lb/>
            mon, required it; thus Æsop must have belonged to Iadmon. <lb/>
            135. Rhodopis came to Egypt, under the conduct of Xanthus <lb/>
            the Samian ; and having come to gain money by her person, <lb/>
            she was ransomed for a large sum by Charaxus of Mitylene, <lb/>
            son to Scamandronymus, and brother of Sappho the poetess. <lb/>
            Thus Rhodopis was made free, and continued in Egypt, and <lb/>
            being very lovely, acquired great riches for a person of her <lb/>
            condition, though no way sufficient to erect such a pyramid. <lb/>
            For as any one who wishes may to this day see the tenth of <lb/>
            her wealth, there is no need to attribute any great wealth to <lb/>
            her. For Rhodopis was desirous of leaving a monument to <lb/>
            herself in Greece, and, having had such a work made as no one <lb/>
            ever yet devised and dedicated in a temple, to offer it at Del­ <lb/>
            phi as a memorial of herself: having therefore made from the <lb/>
            tenth of her wealth a great number of iron spits for roasting <lb/>
            oxen, as far as the tenth allowed, she sent them to Delphi; <lb/>
            which are still piled up behind the altar, which the Chians <lb/>
            dedicated opposite the temple itself. The courtesans of Nau­ <lb/>
            cratis are generally very lovely: for in the first place this <lb/>
            one, of whom this account is given, became so famous that all <lb/>
            the Greeks became familiar with the name of Rhodopis ; and <lb/>
            in the next place, after her, another, whose name was Archi­ <lb/>
            dice, became celebrated throughout Greece, though less talked <lb/>
            about than the former. As for Charaxus, when, having ran­ <lb/>
            somed Rhodopis, he returned to Mitylene, Sappho gibed him <lb/>
            very much in an ode. Now I have done speaking of Rho­ <lb/>
            dopis.</p>
          <p>136. After Mycerinus, the priests said, that Asychis became <lb/>
            king of Egypt, and that he built the eastern portico to the <lb/>
            temple of Vulcan, which is far the most beautiful and the <lb/>
            largest: for all the porticos have sculptured figures, and an infi­ <lb/>
            nite variety of architecture, but this most of all. They related, <lb/>
            that during his reign, there being a great want of circulation <lb/>
            of money, a law was made by the Egyptians, that a man, by <lb/>
            giving the dead body of his father in pledge, might borrow <lb/>
            money; and it was also added to this law, that the lender <lb/>
            should have power over the whole sepulchre of the borrower ; <lb/>
            and that on any one who gave this pledge, the following pun­ <lb/>
            ishment should be inflicted, if he afterwards refused to repay <lb/>
            the debt, that neither he himself, when he died, should be <lb/>
            buried in his family sepulchre, or in any other, nor have the <lb/>
            liberty of burying any other of his own dead. This king <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [137, 138. </note> <lb/>
            being desirous of surpassing his predecessors who were kings <lb/>
            of Egypt, left a pyramid, as a memorial, made of bricks ; on <lb/>
            which is an inscription carved on stone, in the following words: <lb/>
            “Do not despise me in comparison with the pyramids of <lb/>
            stone, for I excel them as much as Jupiter the other gods. <lb/>
            For by plunging a pole into a lake, and collecting the mire <lb/>
            that stuck to the pole, men made bricks, and in this manner <lb/>
            built me." Such were the works that this king performed.</p>
          <p>137. After him, there reigned a blind man of the city of <lb/>
            Anysis, whose name was Anysis. During his reign, the <lb/>
            Ethiopians, and Sabacon, king of the Ethiopians, invaded <lb/>
            Egypt with a large force ; whereupon this blind king fled to <lb/>
            the fens ; and the Ethiopian reigned over Egypt for fifty <lb/>
            years, during which time he performed the following actions. <lb/>
            When any Egyptian committed any crime, he would not have <lb/>
            any of them put to death, but passed sentence upon each ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the magnitude of his offence, enjoining them to <lb/>
            heap up mounds against their own city to which each of the <lb/>
            offenders belonged : and by this means the cities were made <lb/>
            much higher ; for first of all they had been raised by those <lb/>
            who dug the canals in the time of king Sesostris,6 and secondly, <lb/>
            under the Ethiopian they were made very high. Although <lb/>
            other cities in Egypt were carried to a great height, in my <lb/>
            opinion, the greatest mounds were thrown up about the city <lb/>
            of Bubastis, in which is a temple of Bubastis well worthy of <lb/>
            mention ; for though other temples may be larger and more <lb/>
            costly, yet none is more pleasing to look at than this. Bu­ <lb/>
            bastis, in the Grecian language, answers to'Diana. 138. <lb/>
            Her sacred precinct is thus situated : all except the entrance <lb/>
            is an island; for two canals from the Nile extend to it, not <lb/>
            mingling with each other, but each reaches as far as the en­ <lb/>
            trance of the precinct, one flowing round it on one side, the <lb/>
            other on the other. Each is a hundred feet broad, and shaded <lb/>
            with trees. The portico is ten orgyæ in height, and is adorned <lb/>
            with figures six cubits high, that are deserving of notice. <lb/>
            This precinct, being in the middle of the city, is visible on <lb/>
            every side to a person going round it: for as the city has been <lb/>
            mounded up to a considerable height, but the temple has not <lb/>
            been moved, it is conspicuous as it was originally built. A <lb/>
            wall sculptured with figures runs round it; and within is a <lb/>
            grove of lofty trees, planted round a large temple in which the <note type="footnote"> 6 See II. 108 </note> <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="139-141.]"/> <lb/>
            Image is placed. The width and length of the precinct is each <lb/>
            way a stade. Along the entrance is a road paved witH stone, <lb/>
            about three stades in length, leading through the square east­ <lb/>
            ward ; and in width it is about four plethra: on each side of <lb/>
            the road grow trees of enormous height: it leads to the tem­ <lb/>
            ple or Mercury. Such then is the situation of this precinct; <lb/>
            139. They related that the final departure of the Ethiopian <lb/>
            occurred in the following manner : that he, having seen a <lb/>
            vision of the following kind in his sleep, fled away: it appear­ <lb/>
            ed to him that a man, standing by him, advised him to assem­ <lb/>
            ble all the priests in Egypt, and to cut them in two down the <lb/>
            middle ; but" he, having seen this vision, said, that he thought <lb/>
            the gods held out this as a pretext to him, in order that he, <lb/>
            having been guilty of impiety in reference to sacred things,' <lb/>
            might draw down some evil on himself from gods or from <lb/>
            men ; he would not therefore do so ; but as the time was ex­ <lb/>
            pired during which it was foretold that he should reign over <lb/>
            Egypt, he would depart from the country ; for while he was <lb/>
            yet in Ethiopia, the oracles which the Ethiopians have re­ <lb/>
            course to answered, that he was fated to reign over Egypt <lb/>
            fifty years. Since, then, this period had elapsed, and the <lb/>
            vision of the dream troubled him, Sabacon of his own accord <lb/>
            withdrew from Egypt. 140. When therefore the Ethiopian <lb/>
            departed from Egypt, the blind king resumed the govern­ <lb/>
            ment, having returned from the fens, where he had lived fifty <lb/>
            years, having formed an island of ashes and earth. For when <lb/>
            any of the Egyptians came to him bringing provisions, as <lb/>
            they were severally ordered unknown to the Ethiopian, he <lb/>
            bade them bring some ashes also as a present. No one before: <lb/>
            Amyrtæus was able to discover this island ; but for more <lb/>
            than seven hundred years, the kings who preceded Amyrtæus <lb/>
            were unable to find it out: the name of this island was Elbo; <lb/>
            its size is about ten stades in each direction. 1</p>
          <p>141. After him reigned the priest of Vulcan; whose name <lb/>
            vas Sethon : he held in no account and despised the military <lb/>
            taste of the Egyptians, as not having need of their services <lb/>
            and accordingly, among other indignities, he took away their <lb/>
            lands ; to each of whom, under former kings, twelve chosen <lb/>
            acres7 had been assigned After this, Senacherib, king of the <note type="footnote"> 7 The arura, here rendered " acre," was an Egyptian measure, con­ <lb/>
            taining a square of 100 Egyptian cubits. </note> <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [142, 143. </note> <lb/>
            Arabians and Assyrians, marched a large army against Egypt <lb/>
            whereupon the Egyptian warriors refused to assist him ; and <lb/>
            the priest, being reduced to a strait, entered the temple, and <lb/>
            bewailed before the image the calamities he was in danger of <lb/>
            suffering. While he was lamenting, sleep fell upon him, and <lb/>
            it appeared to him in a vision, that the god stood by and en <lb/>
            couraged him, assuring him that he should suffer nothing dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable in meeting the Arabian army, for he would himself <lb/>
            send assistants to him. Confiding in this vision, he took with <lb/>
            him such of the Egyptians as were willing to follow him, and <lb/>
            encamped in Pelusium, for here the entrance into Egypt is ; <lb/>
            but none of the military caste followed him, but tradesmen, <lb/>
            mechanics, and sutlers. When they arrived there, a number <lb/>
            of field mice, pouring in upon their enemies, devoured their <lb/>
            quivers and their bows, and moreover, the handles of their <lb/>
            shields; so that on the next day, when they fled bereft of <lb/>
            their arms, many of them fell. And to this day, a stone statue <lb/>
            of this king stands in the temple of Vulcan, with a mouse in <lb/>
            his hand, and an inscription to the following effect: "Who­ <lb/>
            ever looks on me, let him revere the gods."</p>
          <p>142. Thus much of the account the Egyptians and the <lb/>
            priests related, showing that from the first king to this priest <lb/>
            of Vulcan who last reigned, were three hundred forty and one <lb/>
            generations of men ; and during these generations, there were <lb/>
            the same number of chief priests and kings. Now, three hun­ <lb/>
            dred generations are equal to ten thousand years, for three <lb/>
            generations of men are one hundred years: and the forty-one <lb/>
            remaining generations that were over the three hundred, <lb/>
            make one thousand three hundred and forty years. Thus, <lb/>
            they said, in eleven thousand three hundred and forty years, <lb/>
            no god had assumed the form of a man ; neither, they said, <lb/>
            had any such thing happened before, or afterwards, in the <lb/>
            time of the remaining kings of Egypt. During this time, they <lb/>
            related, that the sun had four times risen out of his usual <lb/>
            quarter, and that he had twice risen where he now sets, and <lb/>
            twice set where he now rises; yet, that no change in the <lb/>
            things in Egypt was occasioned by this, either with regard to the <lb/>
            productions of the earth or the river, or with regard to dis <lb/>
            eases, or with respect <unclear/> deaths. 143. In former time, the <lb/>
            priests of Jupiter did to Hecatæus the historian, when he <lb/>
            was tracing his own genealogy, and connecting his family <pb n="153"/>
             <note type="margin">144, 145.] </note> <lb/>
            with a god in the sixteenth degree, the same as they did to <lb/>
            me, though I did not trace my genealogy. Conducting me <lb/>
            into the interior of an edifice that was spacious, and showing <lb/>
            me wooden colossuses to the number I have mentioned, they <lb/>
            reckoned them up ; for every high priest places an image of <lb/>
            himself there during his lifetime ; the priests, therefore, reek­ <lb/>
            oning them and showing-them to me, pointed out that each <lb/>
            was the son cf his own father; going through them all, from <lb/>
            the image of him that died last, until they had pointed them <lb/>
            all out. But when Hecataeus traced his own genealogy, and <lb/>
            connected himself with a god in the sixteenth degree, they <lb/>
            controverted his genealogy by computation, not admitting that <lb/>
            a man could be born from a god; and they thus controverted <lb/>
            his genealogy, saying that each of the colossuses was a Pi­ <lb/>
            romis, sprung from a Piromis ; until they pointed out the <lb/>
            three hundred and forty-five colossuses, each a PiTomis <lb/>
            sprung from a Piromis, and they did not connect them with <lb/>
            any god or hero. Piromis means, in the Grecian language, <lb/>
            " a noble and good man." 144. They pointed out to me there­ <lb/>
            fore, that all those of whom there were images, were of that <lb/>
            character, but were very far from being gods ; that, indeed, be­ <lb/>
            fore the time of these men, gods had been the rulers of Egypt, <lb/>
            and had dwelt amongst men ; and that one of them always <lb/>
            had the supreme power, and that Orus, the son of Osiris, whom <lb/>
            the Greeks call Apollo, was the last who reigned over it; he, <lb/>
            having deposed Typhon, was the last who reigned over Egypt. <lb/>
            Now, Osiris in the Grecian language means Bacchus.</p>
          <p>145. Among the Greeks, the most recent of the gods are <lb/>
            thought to be Hercules, Bacchus, and Pan ; but by the <lb/>
            Egyptians Pan is esteemed the most ancient, and one of the <lb/>
            eight gods called original; but Hercules is among the second, <lb/>
            among those called the twelve ; and Bacchus is of the third, <lb/>
            who were sprung from the twelve gods. I have already de­ <lb/>
            clared8 how many years the Egyptians say there were from <lb/>
            Hercules to the reign of Amasis ; but from Pan a still greater <lb/>
            number of years are said to have intervened, and from Bac­ <lb/>
            elms fewest of all; and from him there are computed to have <lb/>
            been fifteen thousand years to the reign of Amasis. The <lb/>
            Egyptians say they know these things with accuracy, because <lb/>
            they always compute and register the years. Now from <unclear>Bas­</unclear> <note type="footnote"> ' See chap. 43. </note> <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[146—148"/> <lb/>
            chus, who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of <lb/>
            Cadmus, to my time, is about sixteen hundred years, and from <lb/>
            Hercules the son of Alcmena, about nine hundred years ; but <lb/>
            from Pan, born of Penelope, (for Pan is said by the Greeks to <lb/>
            have sprung from her and Mercury,) is a less number of <lb/>
            years than from the siege of Troy, about eight hundred, to my <lb/>
            time. 146. Of these two accounts, each person may adopt that <lb/>
            which he thinks most credible ; I have therefore declared my <lb/>
            own opinion respecting them. For if these deities had been <lb/>
            well known, and had grown old in Greece, as Hercules, who <lb/>
            was sprung from Amphitryon, and especially Bacchus the <lb/>
            son of Semele, and Pan who was borne by Penelope; some <lb/>
            one might say, that these later ones, though mere men, bore: <lb/>
            the names of the gods who were long before them; Now, the <lb/>
            Greeks say of Bacchus, that Jupiter sewed him into his thigh <lb/>
            as soon as he was born, and carried him to Nyssa, which is <lb/>
            above Egypt in Ethiopia ; and concerning Pan, they are un­ <lb/>
            able to say whither he was taken at his birth. It'is evident <lb/>
            to me, therefore, that the Grecians learnt their name!; later <lb/>
            than those of the other gods ; and from the time when they <lb/>
            learnt them they trace their origin, therefore they ascribe <lb/>
            their generation to that time, and not higher. These things <lb/>
            then the Egyptians themselves relate.</p>
          <p>f 147. What things both other men and the Egyptians agree <lb/>
            in saying occurred in this country, I shall now proceed to <lb/>
            relate, and shall add to them some things of my own observ­ <lb/>
            ation. The Egyptians having become free, after the reign of <lb/>
            the priest of Vulcan, for they were at no time able to live <lb/>
            without a king, established twelve kings, having divided' all <lb/>
            Egypt into twelve parts. These having contracted inter- <lb/>
            marriages, reigned, adopting the following regulations: that <lb/>
            they would not attempt the subversion of one another, nor <lb/>
            one seek to acquire more than another, and that they should <lb/>
            maintain the strictest friendship. They made these regula­ <lb/>
            tions and strictly upheld them, for the following reason : it <lb/>
            had been foretold them by an oracle when they first assumed <lb/>
            the government, " that whoever among them should offer a <lb/>
            libation in the temple of Vulcan from a brazen bowl, should <lb/>
            be king of all Egypt;” for they used to assemble in all the <lb/>
            temples. 148. Now, they determined to leave in common a <lb/>
            memorial of themselves ; and having so determined, they <lb/>
            built a labyrinth, a little above the lake of Mœris, situated <pb n="155"/>
             <note type="margin">149.] </note> <lb/>
            near that called the city of Crocodiles ; this I have myself <lb/>
            seen, and found it greater than can be described. For if any <lb/>
            one should reckon up the buildings and public works of the <lb/>
            Grecians, they would be found to have cost less labour and <lb/>
            expense than this labyrinth ; though the temple in Ephesus is <lb/>
            deserving of mention, and also that in Samos. The pyramids <lb/>
            likewise were beyond description, and each of them com­ <lb/>
            parable to many of the great Grecian structures. Yet the <lb/>
            labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids. For it has twelve <lb/>
            courts enclosed with walls, with doors opposite each other, six <lb/>
            facing the north, and six the south, contiguous to one another; <lb/>
            and the same exterior wall encloses them. It contains two <lb/>
            kinds of rooms, some under ground and some above ground <lb/>
            over them, to the number of three thousand, fifteen hundred <lb/>
            of each. The rooms above ground I myself went through <lb/>
            and saw, and relate from personal inspection. But the under­ <lb/>
            ground rooms I only know from report; for the Egyptians who <lb/>
            have charge of the building would, on no account, show me <lb/>
            them, saying, that there were the sepulchres of the kings who <lb/>
            originally built this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I <lb/>
            can therefore only relate what I have learnt by hearsay con­ <lb/>
            cerning the lower rooms; but the upper ones, which surpass <lb/>
            all human works, I myself saw ; for the passages through the <lb/>
            corridors, and the windings through the courts, from their <lb/>
            great variety, presented a thousand occasions of wonder, as I <lb/>
            passed from a court to the rooms, and from the rooms to halls, <lb/>
            and to other corridors from the halls, and to other courts from <lb/>
            the rooms. The roofs of all these are of stone, as also are the <lb/>
            walls; but the walls are full of sculptured figures. Each <lb/>
            court is surrounded with a colonnade of white stone, closely <lb/>
            fitted. And adjoining the extremity of the labyrinth is a <lb/>
            pyramid, forty orgyæ in height, on which large figures are <lb/>
            carved, and a way to it has been made under ground.</p>
          <p>149. Although this labyrinth is such as I have described, <lb/>
            yet the lake named from Mœris, near which this labyrinth is <lb/>
            built, occasions greater wonder: its circumference measures <lb/>
            three thousand six hundred stades, or sixty schoenes, equal to <lb/>
            the sea-coast of Egypt. The lake stretches lengthways, <lb/>
            north and south, being in depth in the deepest part fifty <lb/>
            orgyæ. That it is made by hand and dry, this circumstance <lb/>
            proves, for about the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, <pb n="156"/>
             <note type="margin">[150, 151 </note> <lb/>
            each rising fifty orgyæ above the surface of the water, and <lb/>
            the part built under water extends to an equal depth: on each <lb/>
            of these is placed a stone statue, seated on a throne. Thus <lb/>
            these pyramids are one hundred orgyæ in height; and a hun­ <lb/>
            dred orgyæ are equal to a stade of six plethra; the orgya <lb/>
            measuring six feet, or four cubits; the foot being four palms, <lb/>
            and the cubit six palms. The water in this lake does not <lb/>
            spring from the soil, for these parts are excessively dry, but <lb/>
            it is conveyed through a channel from the Nile, and for six <lb/>
            months it flows into the lake, and six months out again into the <lb/>
            Nile. And during the six months that it flows out it yields a <lb/>
            talent of silver every day to the king's treasury from the fish ; <lb/>
            but when the water is flowing into it, twenty minæ. 150. The <lb/>
            people of the country told me that this lake discharges itself <lb/>
            under ground into the Syrtis of Libya, running westward to­ <lb/>
            wards the interior by the mountain above Memphis. But <lb/>
            when I did not see any where a heap of soil from this excava­ <lb/>
            tion, for this was an object of curiosity to me, I inquired of the <lb/>
            people who lived nearest the lake, where the soil that had been <lb/>
            dug out was to be found; they told me where it had been <lb/>
            carried, and easily persuaded me, because I had heard that a <lb/>
            similar thing had been done at Nineveh, in Assyria. For <lb/>
            certain thieves formed a design to carry away the treasures of <lb/>
            Sardanapalus, king of Nineveh, which were very large, and <lb/>
            preserved in subterraneous treasuries; the thieves therefore, <lb/>
            beginning from their own dwellings, dug under ground by <lb/>
            estimated measurement to the royal palace, and the soil that <lb/>
            was taken out of the excavations, when night came on, they <lb/>
            threw into the river Tigris, that flows by Nineveh; and so <lb/>
            they proceeded until they had effected their purpose. The <lb/>
            same method I heard was adopted in digging the lake in <lb/>
            Egypt, except that it was not done by night, but during the <lb/>
            day; for the Egyptians who dug out the soil carried it to the <lb/>
            Nile, and the river receiving if, soon dispersed it. Now, this <lb/>
            lake is said to have been excavated in this way.</p>
          <p>151. While the twelve kings continued to observe justice <lb/>
            in course of time, as they were sacrificing in the temple of Vul­ <lb/>
            can, and were about to offer a libation on the last day of the <lb/>
            festival, the high priest, mistaking the number, brought out <lb/>
            eleven of the twelve golden bowls with which he used to make <lb/>
            the libation. Whereupon he who stood last of them, Psam. <pb n="157"/>
             <note type="margin">152] </note> <lb/>
            mitichus, since he had not a bowl, having taken off his helmet, <lb/>
            which was of brass, held it out and made the libation. All <lb/>
            the other kings were in the habit-of wearing helmets, and at <lb/>
            that time had them on. Psammitichus therefore, without any <lb/>
            sinister intention, held out his helmet: but they having taken <lb/>
            into consideration what was done by Psammitichus, and the <lb/>
            oracle, that had foretold to them, "that whoever among them <lb/>
            should offer a libation from a brazen bowl, should be sole king <lb/>
            of Egypt;" calling to mind the oracle, they did not think it <lb/>
            right to put him to death, since upon examination they found <lb/>
            that he had done it by no premeditated design. But they de­ <lb/>
            termined to banish him to the marshes, having divested him <lb/>
            of the greatest part of his power; and they forbade him to leave <lb/>
            the marshes, or have any intercourse with the rest of Egypt. <lb/>
            152. This Psammitichus, who had before fled from Sabacon <lb/>
            the Ethiopian, who had killed his father Neco—having at <lb/>
            that time fled into Syria, the Egyptians, who belong to the <lb/>
            Saitic district, brought back when the Ethiopian withdrew in <lb/>
            consequence of the vision in a dreamt And afterwards, hav­ <lb/>
            in- been made king, he was a second time constrained1 by the <lb/>
            eleven kings to go into exile among the marshes on account of <lb/>
            the helmet. Knowing, then, that he had been exceedingly in­ <lb/>
            jured by them, he entertained the design of avenging himself <lb/>
            on his persecutors; and when he sent to the city of Buto to <lb/>
            consult the oracle of Latona, where is the truest oracle that <lb/>
            the Egyptians have, an answer came, " that vengeance would <lb/>
            come from the sea, when men of brass should appear." He, <lb/>
            however, was very incredulous2 that men of brass would come <lb/>
            to assist him. But when no long time had elapsed, stress of <lb/>
            weather compelled some Ionians and Carians, who had sailed <lb/>
            out for the purpose of piracy, to bear away to Egypt; and <lb/>
            when they had disembarked and were clad in brazen armour, <lb/>
            an Egyptian, who had never before seen men clad- in brass, <lb/>
            went to the marshes to Psammitichus, and told him that men <lb/>
            of brass, having arrived from the sea, were ravaging the plains. <lb/>
            He perceiving that the oracle was accomplished, treated these <lb/>
            Ionians and Carians in a friendly manner, and having promised <lb/>
            them great things, persuaded them to join with him: and <lb/>
            when he had succeeded in persuading them, he thus, with the <note type="footnote"> 9 See II. 139. </note><note type="footnote">1 Literally, " it befel him." </note><note type="footnote"> ' Literally " great incredulity was poured secretly into him." </note> <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[153-155"/> <lb/>
            help of such Egyptians as were well affected to him, and witl <lb/>
            these allies, overcame the other kings.</p>
          <p>153. Psammitichus, having made himself master of all <lb/>
            Egypt, constructed the portico to Vulcan's temple at Memphis, <lb/>
            that faces the south wind ; and he built a court for Apis, in <lb/>
            which he is fed whenever he appears, opposite the portico, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by a colonnade, and full of sculptured figures; and in <lb/>
            stead of pillars, statues twelve cubits high are placed under <lb/>
            the piazza. Apis, in the language of the Greeks, means <lb/>
            Epaphus. 154. To the Ionians, and those who with them <lb/>
            had assisted him, Psammitichus gave lands opposite each <lb/>
            other, with the Nile flowing between ; to these lands was <lb/>
            given the name of Camps. And besides these lands he gave <lb/>
            them all that he had promised ; and he moreover put Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian children under their care, to be instructed in the Greek <lb/>
            language ; and from those who learnt the language the pre­ <lb/>
            sent interpreters in Egypt are descended. The Ionians and <lb/>
            the Carians continued for a long time to inhabit these lands, <lb/>
            md they are situated near the sea, a little below the city of <lb/>
            Bubastis, on that which is called the Pelusiac mouth of the <lb/>
            Nile; these, in after-time, king Amasis removed and settled at <lb/>
            Memphis, making them his body-guard against the Egyptians. <lb/>
            From the time of the settlement of these people in Egypt, we <lb/>
            Greeks have had such constant communication with them, <lb/>
            that we are accurately informed of all that has happened in <lb/>
            Egypt, beginning from the reign of Psammitichus to the pre­ <lb/>
            sent time. These were the first people of a different language <lb/>
            who settled in Egypt. The docks for their ships, and the <lb/>
            ruins of their buildings, were to be seen in ray time in the <lb/>
            places from which they were removed. Thus then Psammi­ <lb/>
            tichus became master of Egypt.</p>
          <p>155. Of the oracle that is in Egypt, I have already made <lb/>
            frequent mention ;3 and I shall now give an account of it, as <lb/>
            well deserving notice. This oracle in Egypt is a temple sacred <lb/>
            to Latona, situated in a large city, near that which is called <lb/>
            the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile, as one sails upwards from <lb/>
            the sea. The name of this city, where the oracle is, is Buto, <lb/>
            as I have already mentioned. There is also in this Buto a <lb/>
            precinct sacred to Apollo and Diana: and the temple of La­ <lb/>
            tona, in which the oracle is, is spacious, and has a portico ten <note type="footnote"> 3 See If. 83, 133, 152 </note> <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="156-158]"/> <lb/>
            orgyæ in height. But of all the things I saw there, I will <lb/>
            describe that which occasioned most astonishment. There is <lb/>
            in this enclosure a temple of Latona made from one stone, <lb/>
            both in height and length; and each wall is equal to them :* <lb/>
            each of these measures forty cubits: for the roof, another <lb/>
            stone is laid over it, having a cornice four cubits deep.5 156. <lb/>
            This temple, then, is the most wonderful thing that I saw <lb/>
            about this precinct: next to it, is the island called Chemmis, <lb/>
            situated in a deep and broad lake near the precinct in Buto. <lb/>
            This is said by the Egyptians to be a floating island, but I <lb/>
            myself saw it neither floating nor moving, and I was astonished <lb/>
            when I heard that there really was a floating island. In this, <lb/>
            then, is a spacious temple of Apollo, and in it three altars are <lb/>
            placed; and there grow in it great numbers of palms, and <lb/>
            many other trees, both such as produce fruit, and such as do <lb/>
            not. The Egyptians, when they affirm that it floats, add the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing story: they say that in this island, which before did not <lb/>
            float, Latona, who was one of the eight primary deities, dwell­ <lb/>
            in-,, in Buto, where this oracle of hers now is, received Apollo <lb/>
            as a deposit from the hands of Isis, and saved him, by conceal­ <lb/>
            ing him in this, which is now called the floating island, when <lb/>
            Typhon arrived, searching every where, and hoping to find <lb/>
            the son of Osiris. For they say that Apollo and Diana are the <lb/>
            offspring of Bacchus and Isis, and that Latona was their <lb/>
            nurse and preserver: in the language of Egypt, Apollo is <lb/>
            called Orus; Ceres, Isis; and Diana, Bubastis. Now, from <lb/>
            this account, and no other, AEschylus, the son of Euphorion, <lb/>
            alone among the earlier poets, derived the tradition that I will <lb/>
            mention ; for he made Diana to be the daughter of Ceres. On <lb/>
            this account they say that the island was made to float. Such <lb/>
            is the account they give.</p>
          <p>157. Psammitichus reigned in Egypt fifty-four years; <lb/>
            during twenty-nine of which he sat down before and besieged <lb/>
            Azotus, a large city of Syria, until he took it. This Azotus, <lb/>
            of all the cities we know of, held out against a siege the <lb/>
            longest period. 158. Neco was son of Psammitichus, and <lb/>
            became king of Egypt: he first set about the canal that leads <note type="footnote"> 4 That is to say, its external surface forms a perfect cube. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 This isusually translated “having a projecting roof to the extent of <lb/>
            four cuoits;” but see Letronne's remark in Baehr. Cary's Lexieon <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [159, 160 </note> <lb/>
            to the Red Sea, which Darius the Persian afterwards corn­ <lb/>
            pleted. Its length is a voyage of four days, and in width it <lb/>
            was dug so that two triremes might sail rowed abreast. The <lb/>
            water is drawn into it from the Nile, and it enters it a little <lb/>
            above the city Bubastis,passes near the Arabian city Patumos, <lb/>
            and reaches to the Red Sea.. The parts of the Egyptian plain <lb/>
            that lie towards Arabia were dug first; above this plain is <lb/>
            situated the mountain that stretches towards Memphis, in <lb/>
            which are the quarries. Along the base of this mountain <lb/>
            therefore the canal is carried lengthways from the west to the <lb/>
            east, and then it stretches to the defiles, passing from the <lb/>
            mountain towards the meridian and the south inward, as far as <lb/>
            the Arabian Gulf. But in the part where is the shortest and <lb/>
            most direct passage from the northern sea to the southern, <lb/>
            which is the same as that called the Red Sea, namely, froin <lb/>
            Mount Casius, that separates Egypt from Syria, from this <lb/>
            point the distance is a thousand stades to the Arabian Gulf: <lb/>
            this, then, is the most direct way ; but the canal is very much <lb/>
            longer, in that it is more winding, in the digging of which one <lb/>
            hundred and twenty thousand Egyptians perished in the reign <lb/>
            of Neco. Now, Neco stopped digging it in the middle of the <lb/>
            work, the following oracle having caused an impediment, <lb/>
            " that he was working for a barbarian;" for the Egyptians <lb/>
            call all men barbarians who do not speak the same language <lb/>
            as themselves. 159. But Neco, having put a stop to his ex­ <lb/>
            cavation, turned his attention to military affairs; and triremes <lb/>
            were constructed, some on the northern sea, and others in the <lb/>
            Arabian Gulf, or the Red Sea, of which the docks are still <lb/>
            to be seen. These he used as he had occasion; and Neco, <lb/>
            having come to an engagement with the Syrians on land at <lb/>
            Magdolus, conquered them, and after the battle took Cadytis, <lb/>
            which is a large city in Syria. The garments he wore during <lb/>
            these actions he consecrated to Apollo, having sent them to <lb/>
            Branchidæ of the Milesians. Afterwards, having reigned <lb/>
            sixteen years in all, he died and left the kingdom to his son, <lb/>
            Psammis.</p>
          <p>160. While this Psammis was reigning over Egypt, am­ <lb/>
            bassadors arrived from the Eleans, boasting that they had <lb/>
            established the Olympian games under the most just and ex­ <lb/>
            cellent regulations in the world, and believing that not even <lb/>
            the Egypt ians, the wisest of mankind, could invent any thing <pb n="161"/>
             <note type="margin">161, 162.] </note> <lb/>
            surpassing them. When the Eleans, having arrived in Egypt, <lb/>
            mentioned for what purpose they had come, this king there­ <lb/>
            upon summoned those who were reputed to be the wisest <lb/>
            among the Egyptians; and the Egyptians, having met together, <lb/>
            heard the Eleans relate what was settled for them to do with <lb/>
            regard to the games ; and they, having mentioned every thing, <lb/>
            said, they had come to inquire "whether the Egyptians could <lb/>
            invent any thing more equitable." And they, having con­ <lb/>
            sulted together, asked the Eleans whether their own citizens <lb/>
            were permitted to enter the lists ; they said that they and all <lb/>
            other Grecians, who wished, were allowed to contend; but the <lb/>
            Egyptians replied, " that in making such enactments they had <lb/>
            totally deviated from the rules of justice, for that they could <lb/>
            not contrive so as not to favour a citizen of their own to the <lb/>
            prejudice of a stranger. But if they really wished to make <lb/>
            just enactments, and had come into Egypt for this purpose, <lb/>
            they advised them to establish games for foreign candidates, <lb/>
            and to allow no Elean to enter the lists." Such was the sug­ <lb/>
            gestion that the Egyptians made to the Eleans.</p>
          <p>161. When Psammis had reigned only six years over Egypt, <lb/>
            and made an expedition into Ethiopia, and shortly afterwards <lb/>
            died, Apries his son succeeded to the kingdom. He, next to his <lb/>
            grandfather Psammitichus, enjoyed greater prosperity than <lb/>
            any of the former kings, during a reign of five and twenty <lb/>
            years, in which period he marched an army against Sidon, and <lb/>
            engaged the Tyrian by sea. But when it was destined for <lb/>
            him to meet with adversity, it happened on an occasion, which <lb/>
            I shall narrate more fully in my Libyan history,6 and briefly <lb/>
            in this place. For Apries, having sent an army against the <lb/>
            Cyrenæans, met with a signal defeat; but the Egyptians, com­ <lb/>
            plaining of this, revolted from him, suspecting that Apries <lb/>
            had designedly sent them to certain ruin, in order that they <lb/>
            might be destroyed, and he might govern the rest of the <lb/>
            Egyptians with greater security; both those that returned <lb/>
            and the friends of those who perished, being very indignant <lb/>
            at this, openly revolted against him. 162. Apries, having <lb/>
            heard of this, sent Amasis to appease them by persuasion. <lb/>
            But when he, having come to them, was endeavouring to re­ <lb/>
            strain them, as he was urging them to desist from their enter­ <lb/>
            prise, one of the Egyptians standing behind him placed <note type="footnote"> 6 See B. IV. chap. 159. </note><pb n="162"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[163—165"/> <lb/>
            helme on his head, and as he put it on said, "that he put it <lb/>
            on him to make him king." And this action was not at all <lb/>
            disagreeable to Amasis, as he presently showed. For whep <lb/>
            the revolters had appointed him king of the Egyptians, he <lb/>
            prepared to lead an army against Apries; but Apries, being <lb/>
            informed of this, sent to Amasis a considerable person among <lb/>
            the Egyptians that adhered to him, whose name was Patarbe­ <lb/>
            mis, with orders to bring Amasis alive into his presence. <lb/>
            When Patarbemis arrived and summoned Amasis, Amasis, <lb/>
            raising his leg, (for he happened to be on horseback,) broke <lb/>
            wind and bade him carry that to Apries. Nevertheless Pa­ <lb/>
            tarbemis begged of him, since the king had sent for him, to go <lb/>
            to him; but he answered, " that he had been some time pre­ <lb/>
            paring to do so, and that Apries should have no cause of com­ <lb/>
            plaint, for that he would not only appear himself, but would <lb/>
            bring others with him." Patarbemis, perceiving his design <lb/>
            from what was said, and seeing preparations being made, re­ <lb/>
            turned in haste, as he wished to inform the king as soon as <lb/>
            possible of what was going on: when, however, he came to <lb/>
            Apries without bringing Amasis, Apries, taking no time for <lb/>
            deliberation, in a transport of passion commanded his ears and <lb/>
            nose to be cut off. The rest of the Egyptians, who still ad­ <lb/>
            hered to him, seeing one of the most distinguished among <lb/>
            them treated in so unworthy a manner, did not delay a mo­ <lb/>
            ment, but went immediately over to the others and gave them­ <lb/>
            selves to Amasis. 163. When Apries heard of this, he armed <lb/>
            his auxiliaries and marched against the Egyptians; but he <lb/>
            had with him Carian and Ionian auxiliaries to the number of <lb/>
            thirty thousand; and he had a palace in the city of Sais, that <lb/>
            was spacious and magnificent. Now Apries' party advanced <lb/>
            against the Egyptians, and the party of Amasis against the <lb/>
            foreigners. They met near the city Momemphis, and pre­ <lb/>
            pared to engage with each other.</p>
          <p>164. There are seven classes of Egyptians, and of these <lb/>
            some are called priests, others warriors, others herdsmen, <lb/>
            others swineherds, others tradesmen, others interpreters, and <lb/>
            lastly, pilots; such are the classes of Egyptians; they take <lb/>
            their names from the employments they exercise. Their <lb/>
            warriors are called Calasiries or Hermotybies, and they are of <lb/>
            the following districts, for all Egypt is divided into districts. <lb/>
            165, The following are the districts of the Hermotybies, <pb n="163"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="168—169.]"/> <lb/>
            Busiris, Sais, Chemmis, Papremis, the island called Prosopitis <lb/>
            and the half of Natho. From these districts are the Hermo­ <lb/>
            tybies, being in number, when they are most numerous, a <lb/>
            hundred and sixty thousand. None of these learn any me­ <lb/>
            chanical art, but apply themselves wholly to military affairs. <lb/>
            166. These next are the districts of the Calasiries; Thebes, <lb/>
            Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennys, Athribis, Phar­ <lb/>
            bæthis, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anysis, Mycephoris ; this district is <lb/>
            situated in an island opposite the city Bubastis. These are the <lb/>
            districts of the Calasiries, being in number, when they are most <lb/>
            numerous, two hundred and fifty thousand men: neither are <lb/>
            these allowed to practise any art, but they devote themselves <lb/>
            to military pursuits alone, the son succeeding to his father.. <lb/>
            167. Whether the Greeks learnt this custom from the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians I am unable to determine with certainty, seeing that the <lb/>
            Thracians, Scythians, Persians, Lydians, and almost all bar­ <lb/>
            barous nations, hold in less honour than their other citizens, <lb/>
            those who learn any art and their descendants, but deem such <lb/>
            to be noble as abstain from handicrafts, and particularly those <lb/>
            who devote themselves to war. All the Greeks, moreover, <lb/>
            have adopted the same notion, and especially the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians ; but the Corinthians hold handicraftsmen in least dis­ <lb/>
            esteem. 168. To these alone of all the Egyptians, besides the <lb/>
            priests, the following special privileges are attached; to each <lb/>
            twelve chosen acres7 free from tribute: the acre contains a <lb/>
            square of one hundred Egyptian cubits, and the Egyptian <lb/>
            cubit is equal to that of Samos: these privileges were attached <lb/>
            to them all, but others enjoyed them by turns, and the same <lb/>
            persons never more than once. A thousand of the Calasiries, <lb/>
            and as many of the Hermotybies, each served for a year as <lb/>
            the king's body-guard: to these accordingly was given the <lb/>
            following allowance daily, in addition to the acres, to each five <lb/>
            minæ in weight of baked bread, two minæ of beef, and four <lb/>
            arysters of wine. This was the constant allowance of the <lb/>
            body-guard.</p>
          <p>169. When therefore Apries, leading Iris auxiliaries, and <lb/>
            Amasis, all the Egyptians, met together at Momemphis, they <lb/>
            came to an engagement, and the foreigners fought well, but <lb/>
            being far inferior in numbers, were, on that account, defeated. <note type="footnote"> See chap. 141, and note there. </note> <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note><pb n="164"/>
             <note type="margin">[170, 171. </note> <lb/>
            Apries is said to have been of opinion that not even a god <lb/>
            could deprive him of his kingdom, so securely did he think <lb/>
            himself established: now, however, when he came to an en­ <lb/>
            gagement he was beaten, and being taken prisoner, he was <lb/>
            carried back to Sais, to that which was formerly his own <lb/>
            palace, but which now belonged to Amasis: here he was <lb/>
            maintained for some time in the royal palace, and Amasis <lb/>
            treated him well. But at length the Egyptians complaining <lb/>
            that he did not act rightly in preserving a man who was the <lb/>
            greatest enemy both to them and to him, he thereupon de­ <lb/>
            livered Apries to the Egyptians; but they strangled him, and <lb/>
            afterwards buried him in his ancestral sepulchre; this is in the <lb/>
            sacred precinct of Minerva, very near the temple, on the left <lb/>
            hand as you enter. The Saitæ used to bring all the kings <lb/>
            sprung from this district within the sacred precinct; however, <lb/>
            the tomb of Amasis is further from the temple than that of <lb/>
            Apries and his progenitors, but even8 this is in the court of the <lb/>
            sacred precinct, consisting of a large stone chamber, adorned <lb/>
            with columns, made in imitation of palm-trees, and with <lb/>
            other ornaments; inside this chamber are placed folding doors, <lb/>
            and within the doors is the sepulchre. 170. At Sais also, in <lb/>
            the sacred precinct of Minerva, behind the chapel and joining <lb/>
            the whole of the wall, is the tomb of one whose name I con­ <lb/>
            sider it impious to divulge on such an occasion. And in the en­ <lb/>
            closure stand large stone obelisks, and there is a lake near, or­ <lb/>
            namented with a stone margin, formed in a circle, and in size, <lb/>
            as appeared to me, much the same as that in Delos, which is <lb/>
            called the Circular. 171. In this lake they perform by night <lb/>
            the representation of that person's adventures, which they call <lb/>
            mysteries. On these matters, however, though accurately <lb/>
            acquainted with the particulars of them, I must observe a <lb/>
            discreet silence. And respecting the sacred rites of Ceres, <lb/>
            which the Greeks call Thesmophoria, although I am ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with them, I must observe silence except so far <lb/>
            as it is lawful for me to speak of them. The daughters of <lb/>
            Danaus were they who introduced these ceremonies from <lb/>
            Egypt, and taught them to the Pelasgian women : but after­ <lb/>
            wards, when almost the whole Peloponnese was depopulated <lb/>
            by the Dorians, these rites were lost; but the Arcadians, who <note type="footnote"> 8 All former translators of Herodotus have misconstrued this passage, <lb/>
            by neglecting to give the force of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεντοὶ</foreign>. </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> 172, 173. </note> <lb/>
            were the only Peloponnesians left, and not expelled, alone <lb/>
            preserved them.</p>
          <p>172. Apries being thus dethroned, Amasis, who was of the <lb/>
            Saitic district, reigned in his stead; the name of the city <lb/>
            from which he came was Siuph. At first the Egyptians de­ <lb/>
            spised, and held him in no great estimation, as having been <lb/>
            formerly a private person, and of no illustrious family ; but <lb/>
            afterwards he conciliated them by his address, without any <lb/>
            arrogance. He had an infinite number of other treasures, and <lb/>
            besides a golden foot-pan, in which Amasis himself, and all <lb/>
            his guests, were accustomed to wash their feet. Having then <lb/>
            broken this in pieces, he had made from it the statue of a god, <lb/>
            and placed it in the most suitable part of the city; but the <lb/>
            Egyptians, flocking to the image, paid it the greatest reverence. <lb/>
            But Amasis, informed of their behaviour, called the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians together, and explained the matter to them, saying, " that <lb/>
            the statue was made out of the foot-pan in which the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians formerly vomited, made water, and washed their feet, and <lb/>
            which they then so greatly reverenced; now then, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to say, the same had happened to him as to the foot- <lb/>
            pan ; for though he was before but a private person, yet he <lb/>
            was now their king ;" he therefore required them to honour <lb/>
            and respect him : by this means he won over the Egyptians, <lb/>
            so that they thought fit to obey him. 173. He adopted <lb/>
            the following method of managing his affairs : early in the <lb/>
            morning, until the time of full-market, he assiduously des­ <lb/>
            patched the business brought before him ; after that he drank <lb/>
            and jested with his companions, and he talked loosely and <lb/>
            sportively. But his friends, offended at this, admonished <lb/>
            him, saying, " You do not, 0 king, control yourself properly, <lb/>
            in making yourself too common. For it becomes you, who <lb/>
            sit on a venerable throne, to pass the day in transacting pub­ <lb/>
            lic business ; thus the Egyptians would know that they are <lb/>
            governed by a great man, and you would be better spoken of. <lb/>
            But now you act in a manner not at all becoming a king." <lb/>
            But he answered them as follows: " They who have bows, <lb/>
            when they want to use them, bend them ; but when they <lb/>
            have done using them, they unbend them ; for if it were <lb/>
            kept always bent, it would break, so that he could not use it <lb/>
            when he had need. Such is the condition of man ; if lie <lb/>
            should incessantly attend to serious business, and not give <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[174, 175. </note> <lb/>
            himself up sometimes to sport, he would unawares become <lb/>
            mad or stupified. I, being well aware of this, give up &amp; por­ <lb/>
            tion of my time to each." Thus he answered his friends. <lb/>
            174. Amasis is said to have been, even when a private per­ <lb/>
            son, fond of drinking and jesting, and by no means inclined <lb/>
            to serious business ; and when the means failed him for <lb/>
            drinking and indulging himself, he used to go about pilfering. <lb/>
            Such persons as accused him of having their property, on his <lb/>
            denying it, used to take him to the oracle of the place, and <lb/>
            he was oftentimes convicted by the oracles, and oftentimes <lb/>
            acquitted. When, therefore, he came to the throne, he acted <lb/>
            as follows : whatever gods had absolved him from the charge <lb/>
            of theft, of their temples he neither took any heed, nor con­ <lb/>
            tributed any thing towards their repair ; neither did lie fre­ <lb/>
            quent them, and offer sacrifices, considering them of no con­ <lb/>
            sequence at all, and as having only lying responses to give. <lb/>
            But as many as had convicted him of the charge of theft, to <lb/>
            them he paid the highest respect, considering them as truly <lb/>
            gods, and delivering authentic responses.</p>
          <p>. 175. Moreover, he built an admirable portico to the temple <lb/>
            of Minerva at Sais, far surpassing all others both in height <lb/>
            and size, as well as in the dimensions and quality of the stones; <lb/>
            he likewise dedicated large statues, and huge andro-sphinxes, <lb/>
            and brought other stones of a prodigious size for repairs : of <lb/>
            these he brought some from the quarries near Memphis; but <lb/>
            those of the greatest magnitude, from the city of Elephantine, <lb/>
            distant from Sais a passage of twenty days. But of these, <lb/>
            that which Inct the least, rather the most admire, is this; he <lb/>
            brought a building of one stone from the city of Elephantine, <lb/>
            and two thousand men, who Were appointed to convey it, <lb/>
            were occupied three whole years in its transport, and these <lb/>
            men were all pilots. The length of this chamber, outside, is <lb/>
            twenty-one cubits, the breadth fourteen, and the height <lb/>
            eight. This is the measure of the outside of the one-stoned <lb/>
            chamber. But inside, the length is eighteen cubits and <lb/>
            twenty digits, and the width twelve cubits, and the height <lb/>
            five cubits. This chamber is placed near the entrance of the <lb/>
            sacred precinct; for they say that he did not draw it within <lb/>
            the precinct for the following reason: the architect, as the <lb/>
            chamber was being drawn along, heaved a deep sigh, being <lb/>
            wearied with the work, over which so long a time had been <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="176-178.]"/> <lb/>
            spent; whereupon Amasis, making a religious scruple of this, <lb/>
            would not suffer it to be drawn any farther. Some persons <lb/>
            however say, that one of the men employed at the levers was <lb/>
            crushed to death by it, and that on that account it was not <lb/>
            drawn into the precinct. 176. Amasis dedicated in all the <lb/>
            most famous temples works admirable for their magnitude; <lb/>
            and amongst them at Memphis, the reclining colossus before <lb/>
            the temple of Vulcan, of which the length is seventy-five <lb/>
            feet; and on the same base stand two statues of Ethiopian <lb/>
            stone, each twenty feet in height, one on each side of the <lb/>
            temple. There is also at Sais another similar statue, lying in <lb/>
            the same manner as that at Memphis. It was Amasis also <lb/>
            who built the temple to Isis at Memphis, which is spacious <lb/>
            and well worthy of notice.</p>
          <p>1-77. Under the reign of Amasis Egypt is said to have en­ <lb/>
            joyed the greatest prosperity, both in respect to the benefits <lb/>
            derived from the river to the land, and from the land to the <lb/>
            people ; and it is said to have contained at that time twenty <lb/>
            thousand inhabited cities. Amasis it was who established <lb/>
            the law among the Egyptians, that every Egyptian should <lb/>
            annually declare to the governor of his district, by what <lb/>
            means he maintained himself; and if he failed to do this, or <lb/>
            did not show that he lived by honest means, he should be <lb/>
            punished with death. Solon the Athenian, having brought <lb/>
            this law from Egypt, established it at Athens; and that peo­ <lb/>
            ple still continue to observe it, as being an unobjectionable <lb/>
            regulation. 178. Amasis, being partial to the Greeks, both <lb/>
            bestowed other favours on various of the Greeks, and more­ <lb/>
            over gave the city of Naucratis for such as arrived in Egypt <lb/>
            to dwell in; and to such as did not wish to settle there, but <lb/>
            only to trade by sea, he granted places where they might erect <lb/>
            altars and temples to the gods. Now, the most spacious of <lb/>
            these sacred buildings, which is also the most renowned and <lb/>
            frequented, called the Hellenium, was erected at the common <lb/>
            charge of the following cities: of the Ionians, Chios, Teos, <lb/>
            Phocæa, and Clazomenæ; of the Dorians, Rhodes, Cnidus, <lb/>
            Halicarnassus, Phaselis; and of the Æolians, Mitylene alone. <lb/>
            So that this temple belongs to them, and these cities appoint <lb/>
            officers to preside over the mart: and whatever other cities <lb/>
            claim a share in it, claim what does not belong to them. <lb/>
            Besides this, the people of Ægina built a temole to Jupiter <pb n="168"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[179-181"/> <lb/>
            for themselves; and the Samians another to Juno, and the <lb/>
            Milesians one to Apollo. 179. Naucratis was anciently the <lb/>
            only place of resort for merchants, and there was no other in <lb/>
            Egypt: and if a man arrived at any other mouth of the Nile, <lb/>
            he was obliged to swear " that he had come there against his <lb/>
            will and having taken such an oath, he must sail in the <lb/>
            same ship to the Canopic mouth; but if he should be pre­ <lb/>
            vented by contrary winds from doing so, he was forced to un­ <lb/>
            load his goods, and carry them in barges round the Delta <lb/>
            until he reached Naucratis. So great were the privileges of <lb/>
            Naucratis. 180. When the Amphyctions contracted to build <lb/>
            the temple that now stands at Delphi for three hundred <lb/>
            talents, (for the temple that was formerly there had been <lb/>
            burnt by accident, and it fell upon the Delphians to supply a <lb/>
            fourth part of the sum,) the Delphians went about from city <lb/>
            to city and solicited contributions ; and doing this they brought <lb/>
            home no small amount from Egypt. For Amasis gave them <lb/>
            a thousand talents of alum, and the Grecians who were settled <lb/>
            in Egypt twenty minæ.</p>
          <p>181. Amasis also contracted a friendship and an alliance <lb/>
            with the Cyrenæans; and resolved to take a wife from that <lb/>
            country, either out of a desire of having a Grecian woman, or <lb/>
            from some peculiar affection to the Cyrenæans. He therefore <lb/>
            married, as some say, the daughter of Battus ; others, of Ar­ <lb/>
            cesilaus; though others, of Critobulus, a person of distinction <lb/>
            among the citizens; her name was Ladice. Whenever <lb/>
            Amasis lay with her he was unable to have connexion with <lb/>
            her, which was not the case with respect to other women: <lb/>
            upon the continuance of this for a long time, Amasis said to <lb/>
            this woman, who was called Ladice ; " 0 woman, you have <lb/>
            used charms against me, and no contrivance can prevent your <lb/>
            perishing by the most cruel death of all women." But La­ <lb/>
            dice, finding that Amasis was not at all appeased by her denial <lb/>
            of the fact, made a mental vow to Venus, that if Amasis should <lb/>
            have intercourse with her that night, (for this was the only <lb/>
            remedy left,) she would send a statue of the goddess to Cy­ <lb/>
            rene. Immediately after the vow, Amasis had intercourse <lb/>
            with her; and from that time forward, whenever he came to <lb/>
            her, he was able to have connexion ; and after this he was ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly fond of her. But Ladice performed her vow to the <lb/>
            goddess, for having caused a statue to be made, she sent it to <pb n="169"/>
             <note type="margin">182.] </note> <lb/>
            Cyrene, and it was still safe in my time, facing out of the city <lb/>
            of Cyrene. When Cambyses had conquered Egypt, and learnt <lb/>
            who this Ladice was, he sent her back unharmed to Cyrene. <lb/>
            182. Amasis also dedicated offerings in Greece. In the first <lb/>
            place, a gilded statue of Minerva at Cyrene, and his own por­ <lb/>
            trait painted; secondly,, to Minerva in Lindus two stone <lb/>
            statues and a linen corselet well worthy of notice ; thirdly, to <lb/>
            Juno at Samos two images of himself carved in wood, which <lb/>
            stood in the large temple even in my time, behind the doors. <lb/>
            Now he made this offering at Samos, on account of the friend­ <lb/>
            ship that subsisted between himself and Polycrates the son of <lb/>
            Æaces; but those at Lindus, not on account of any friendship, <lb/>
            but because it is reported that the daughters of Danaus <lb/>
            founded the temple of Minerva at Lindus, when they touched <lb/>
            there in their flight from the sons of Egyptus: and these were <lb/>
            the offerings that Amasis made. He was the first who con­ <lb/>
            quered Cyprus, and subjected it to the payment of tribute.</p><pb n="170"/>

          <p>AGAINST this Amasis, Cambyses, son of Cyrus, made war, <lb/>
            leading with him both others, his own subjects, and of the <lb/>
            Grecians, Ionians and Æolians. The cause of the war was <lb/>
            this : Cambyses, having sent a herald into Egypt, demanded <lb/>
            the daughter of Amasis; and. he made. this demand at, the <lb/>
            suggestion of an Egyptian physician, who out of spite served <lb/>
            Amasis in this manner, because, having selected him out of <lb/>
            all the physicians in Egypt, and torn him from his wife and <lb/>
            children, he had sent him as a present to the Persians, when <lb/>
            Cyrus, having sent to Amasis, required of him the best ocu­ <lb/>
            list in Egypt. The Egyptian therefore, having this spite <lb/>
            against him, urged on Cambyses by his suggestions, bidding <lb/>
            him demand the daughter of Amasis, in order that if he should <lb/>
            comply he might be grieved, or if he refused he might incur <lb/>
            the hatred of Cambyses. But Amasis, dreading the power of <lb/>
            the Persians, and being alarmed, knew not whether to give <lb/>
            or to deny ; for he was well aware that Cambyses purposed to <lb/>
            take her, not as his wife, but his mistress. Having consider­ <lb/>
            ed these things, he did as follows. There was a daughter of <lb/>
            Apries, the former king, very tall and beautiful, the only sur­ <lb/>
            vivor of the family; her name was Nitetis. This damsel, <lb/>
            Amasis, having adorned with cloth of gold, sent to Persia as <lb/>
            his own daughter. After a time, when Cambyses saluted her, <lb/>
            addressing her by her father's name, the damsel said to him, <lb/>
            “ 0 king, you do not perceive that you have been imposed <lb/>
            upon by Amasis, who, having dressed me in rich attire, sent <lb/>
            me to you, presenting me as his own daughter; whereas, in <lb/>
            truth, I am the daughter of Apries, whom he, though lie was <lb/>
            his own master, put to death, after he had incited the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians to revolt.” These words, and this accusation, induced <pb n="171"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="2-4.]"/> <lb/>
            Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, being greatly enraged, to invade <lb/>
            Egypt. Such is the account the Persians give. 2. But the <lb/>
            Egyptians claim Cambyses as their own, saying, that he was <lb/>
            born from this daughter of Apries ; for that it was Cyrus, and <lb/>
            not Cambyses, who sent to Amasis for his daughter ; but in <lb/>
            saying this they err. Nor indeed could it escape their no­ <lb/>
            tice, (for if any people are well acquainted with the Persian <lb/>
            customs, the Egyptians are so,) that first of all, it is not cus­ <lb/>
            tomary with them for a natural son to reign, when there is a <lb/>
            legitimate son living; and secondly, that Cambyses was the <lb/>
            son of Cassandane, daughter of Pharnaspes, one of the Achæ­ <lb/>
            menidæ, and not of the Egyptian woman. But they pervert <lb/>
            the truth, claiming to be related to the family of Cyrus. And <lb/>
            this is the real state of the case. 3. This other story is also <lb/>
            told, which to me seems incredible. A certain Persian lady <lb/>
            visited Cyrus's women, and when she saw the children of <lb/>
            Cassandane, beautiful and tall, standing by her, praised them <lb/>
            highly, being exceedingly struck with them; but Cassandane, <lb/>
            wife of Cyrus, said, " Though I am the mother of such chil­ <lb/>
            dren, Cyrus holds me in disdain, and honours her whom he <lb/>
            has obtained from Egypt." This she said through envy of <lb/>
            Nitetis ; but the eldest of her sons, Cambyses, said, " There­ <lb/>
            fore, mother, when I am a man, I will turn all Egypt upside <lb/>
            down." He said this when he was about ten years of age, <lb/>
            and the women were much astonished ; but he, bearing it in <lb/>
            mind when lie grew up and was possessed of the kingdom, <lb/>
            accordingly invaded Egypt.</p>
          <p>4. The following other incident also occurred to promote <lb/>
            this invasion. There was among the auxiliaries of Amasis a <lb/>
            man by birth an Halicarnassian, whose name was Phanes, one <lb/>
            able in counsel and valiant in war. This Phanes, owing some <lb/>
            spite to Amasis, escaped in a ship from Egypt, with a design <lb/>
            to confer with Cambyses. But as he was a man of no small <lb/>
            consequence among the auxiliaries, and was very accurately <lb/>
            acquainted with the affairs of Egypt, Amasis sent in pursuit <lb/>
            of him, making every effort to take him ; and he sent the <lb/>
            most trusty of his eunuchs in pursuit of him, with a tri­ <lb/>
            reme, who caught him in Lycia, but having taken him, did <lb/>
            not bring him back to Egypt, for Phanes overreached him by <lb/>
            artifice ; for having intoxicated his guards, he got away to the <lb/>
            Persians ; and coming over to Cambyses as he was <unclear>prepa</unclear>- <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[5-8."/> <lb/>
            to march against Egypt, and was in doubt about his route, how <lb/>
            he should pass the arid desert, he informed him both of other <lb/>
            affairs of Amasis, and explained to him the route, thus ad­ <lb/>
            vising him: to send to the king of the Arabians, and ask <lb/>
            him to grant him a safe passage through his territories. 5. <lb/>
            By this way only is there an open passage into Egypt. For <lb/>
            from Phœnicia to the confines of the city of Cadytis, which <lb/>
            belongs to those who are called the Syrians of Palestine, and <lb/>
            from Cadytis, which is a city in my opinion not much less <lb/>
            than Sardis, the sea-ports as far as the city of Jenysus <lb/>
            belong to the Arabian king: and again, from Jenysus, as <lb/>
            far as the lake Serbonis, near which Mount Casius stretches <lb/>
            to the sea, belongs to the Syrians : and from the lake Ser­ <lb/>
            bonis, in which Typhon is reported to have been concealed, <lb/>
            Egypt begins. Now, the country between the city of Jenysus, <lb/>
            Mount Casius, and the lake Serbonis, which is no small tract, <lb/>
            but about a three days' journey, is utterly destitute of water. <lb/>
            6. A circumstance that few of those who have made voyages to <lb/>
            Egypt have noticed, I shall now proceed to mention. From every <lb/>
            part of Greece, and also from Phoenicia, earthen vessels filled <lb/>
            with wine are imported into Egypt twice every year, and yet, so <lb/>
            to speak, not a single one of these wine jars is afterwards to be <lb/>
            seen. In what way then, some one may ask, are they disposed <lb/>
            of ? This I will also relate. Every magistrate is obliged to <lb/>
            collect all the vessels from his own city, and send them to <lb/>
            Memphis; but the people of that city, having filled them with <lb/>
            water, convey them to those arid parts of Syria; so the <lb/>
            earthen vessels continually imported and landed in Egypt, are <lb/>
            added to those already in Syria. 7. Thus the Persians, as <lb/>
            soon as they became masters of Egypt, facilitated the passage <lb/>
            into that country, by supplying it with water in the manner <lb/>
            above mentioned. But as, at that time, water was not pro­ <lb/>
            vided, Cambyses, by the advice of the Halicarnassian stranger, <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to the Arabian, and requested a safe passage, <lb/>
            which he obtained, giving to and receiving from him pledges <lb/>
            of faith.</p>
          <p>8. The Arabians observe pledges as religiously as any <lb/>
            people; and they make them in the following manner : when <lb/>
            any wish to pledge their faith, a third person, standing be­ <lb/>
            tween the two parties, makes an incision with a sharp stone <lb/>
            in the palm of the hand, near the longest fingers, of both the <pb n="173"/>
             <note type="margin">9, 10.] </note> <lb/>
            contractors; then taking some of the nap from the garment <lb/>
            of each, he smears seven stones, placed between them, with <lb/>
            the blood; and as he does this, he invokes Bacchus and <lb/>
            Urania. When this ceremony is completed, the person who <lb/>
            pledges his faith, binds his friends as sureties to the stranger, <lb/>
            or the citizen, if the contract be made with a citizen, and the <lb/>
            friends also hold themselves obliged to observe the engage­ <lb/>
            ment. They acknowledge no other gods than Bacchus and <lb/>
            Urania, and they say that their hair is cut in the same way as <lb/>
            Bacchus's is cut; but they cut it in a circular form, shearing <lb/>
            it round the temples. They call Bacchus, Orotal; and <lb/>
            Urania, Alilat. 9. When therefore the Arabian had ex <lb/>
            changed pledges with the ambassadors who came from Cam <lb/>
            byses, he adopted the following contrivance: having filled <lb/>
            camels' skins with water, he loaded them on all his living <lb/>
            camels; and having done this, lie drove them to the arid <lb/>
            region, and there awaited the army of Cambyses. This is <lb/>
            the most credible of the accounts that are given; yet it is <lb/>
            right that one less credible should be mentioned, since it is <lb/>
            likewise affirmed. There is a large river in Arabia called <lb/>
            Corys, which discharges itself into that called the Red Sea. <lb/>
            From this river then it is said that the king of the Arabians, <lb/>
            having sewn together a pipe of ox-hides and other skins, <lb/>
            reaching in length to the arid region, conveyed the water <lb/>
            through it; and that in the arid region he dug large reser­ <lb/>
            voirs, to receive and preserve the water. It is a twelve days' <lb/>
            journey from the river to the arid region ; he therefore con­ <lb/>
            veyed water through three several pipes into three different <lb/>
            places.</p>
          <p>10. Psammenitus the son of Amasis lay encamped at that <lb/>
            called the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, awaiting Cambyses ; <lb/>
            for Cambyses did not find Amasis alive when he marched <lb/>
            against Egypt; but Amasis died after a reign of forty-four <lb/>
            years, during which no great calamity had befallen him. But <lb/>
            having died, and being embalmed, he was buried in the sepulchre <lb/>
            that is in the sacred precinct, which he himself had built.' <lb/>
            During the reign of Psammenitus son of Amasis, a most re­ <lb/>
            markable prodigy betel the Egyptians; for rain fell at <lb/>
            Egyptian Thebes, which had never happened before, nor <lb/>
            since, to ny time, as the Thebans themselves affirm. For no <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book II. chap. 169. </note> <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[11-13."/> <lb/>
            rain ever falls in the upper regions of Egypt; but at that <lb/>
            time rain fell in drops at Thebes. 11. The Pasians, having <lb/>
            marched through the arid region, halted near he Egyptians, <lb/>
            as if with a design of engaging ; there the auxiliaries of the <lb/>
            Egyptians, consisting of Greeks and Carians, condemning <lb/>
            Phanes because he had led a foreign army against Egypt, <lb/>
            adopted the following expedient against him : Phanes had left <lb/>
            his sons in Egypt; these they brought to the camp, within <lb/>
            sight of their father, and placed a bowl midway between tlio <lb/>
            two armies, then dragging the children one by one, they slew <lb/>
            them over the bowl. When they slaughtered all the children, <lb/>
            they poured wine and water into the bowl; and, after all the <lb/>
            auxiliaries had drank of the blood, they immediately joined <lb/>
            battle. A hard battle having been fought, and when great <lb/>
            numbers had fallen on both sides, the Egyptians were put to <lb/>
            flight. 12. Here I saw a very surprising fact, which the <lb/>
            people of the country informed me of. For as the bones of <lb/>
            those who were killed in that battle lie scattered about separ­ <lb/>
            ately, (for the bones of the Persians lay apart in one place, as <lb/>
            they did at first, and those of the Egyptians in another,) the <lb/>
            skulls of the Persians were so weak, that if you should hit <lb/>
            them only with a single pebble, you would break a hole in <lb/>
            them ; whereas those of the Egyptians are so hard, that you <lb/>
            could scarcely fracture them by striking them with a stone <lb/>
            The cause of this, they told me, is as follows, and I readily as­ <lb/>
            sented ; that the Egyptians begin from childhood and shave <lb/>
            their heads, and the bone is thickened by exposure to the sun : <lb/>
            from the same cause also they are less subject to baldness, for <lb/>
            one sees fewer persons bald in Egypt than in any other country. <lb/>
            This, then, is the cause of their having such strong skulls : <lb/>
            and the reason why the Persians have weak skulls is this; <lb/>
            they shade them from the first, wearing tiaras for hats. Now, <lb/>
            I myself saw that such was the case; and I also observed the <lb/>
            same thing at Papremis, with respect to those who were slain <lb/>
            with Achæmenes 2 son of Darius, by Inarus the Libyan.</p>
          <p>13. The Egyptians, when they were defeated, fled in com­ <lb/>
            plete disorder from the battle. When they had shut them­ <lb/>
            selves up in Memphis, Cambyses sent a Mitylenæan bark up <lb/>
            the river, with a Persian herald on board, to invite the <lb/>
            Egyptians to terms. But they, when they saw the bark <note type="footnote"> a See Book VII. chap. 7 </note> <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="margin"> 14. <lb/>
            </note>entering Memphis, rushed in a mass from the wall, destroyed the <lb/>
            ship, and having torn the crew to pieces, limb by limb, they car­ <lb/>
            ried them into the citadel. After this the Egyptians were be­ <lb/>
            sieged, and at length surrendered. The neighbouring Libyans, <lb/>
            fearing what had befallen Egypt, gave themselves up without <lb/>
            resistance; and submitted to pay a tribute, and sent presents. In <lb/>
            like manner the Cyrenæans and Barcaeans, being equally alarm­ <lb/>
            ed with the Libyans, did as they had done. But Cambyses re­ <lb/>
            ceived very graciously the presents that came from the Libyans; <lb/>
            but was displeased with those of the Cyrenæans, as I suppose, <lb/>
            because they were inconsiderable. For the Cyrenæans sent only <lb/>
            five hundred mint of silver, which he grasped and dispersed <lb/>
            with his own hand among the soldiers. 14. On the tenth day <lb/>
            after Cambyses had taken the citadel of Memphis, having seated <lb/>
            Psammenitus, the king of the Egyptians, who had reigned <lb/>
            only six months, at the entrance of the city, by way of insult, <lb/>
            -having seated him with other Egyptians, he made trial of <lb/>
            his courage by the following means. Having dressed his <lb/>
            daughter in the habit of a slave, he sent her with a pitcher to <lb/>
            fetch water ; and he sent with her other virgins selected from <lb/>
            the principal families; dressed in the same manner as the <lb/>
            king's daughter. As the virgins, with loud lamentation and <lb/>
            weeping, came into the presence of their fathers, all the other <lb/>
            fathers answered them with wailing and weeping, when they <lb/>
            beheld their children thus humiliated. But Psammenitus <lb/>
            alone, when he saw and knew what was going on, only bent <lb/>
            his eyes to the ground. When these water-carriers had <lb/>
            passed by, he next sent his son, with two thousand Egyptians <lb/>
            of the same age, with halters about their necks, and a bridle <lb/>
            in their mouths ; and they were led out to suffer retribution <lb/>
            for those Mitylenaeans who had perished at Memphis with the <lb/>
            ship. For the royal judges had given sentence, that for each <lb/>
            man ten of the principal Egyptians should be put to death. Yet <lb/>
            he, when he saw them passing by, and knew that his son was <lb/>
            being led out to death, though all the rest of the Egyptians <lb/>
            who sat round him wept and made loud lamentations, did the <lb/>
            same as he had done in his daughter's case. When these had <lb/>
            passed by, it happened that one of his boon-companions, a man <lb/>
            somewhat advanced in years, who had lost his all, and possessed <lb/>
            nothing but such things 'as a beggar has, asking alms of the <lb/>
            soldiery, passed by Psammenitus the son of Amasis, and the <pb n="176"/>
             <note type="margin">[15. </note> <lb/>
            Egyptians seated in the suburbs; but Psammenitus, when he <lb/>
            saw him, weeping bitterly, and calling his companion by <lb/>
            name, smote his head. There were, however, spies there who <lb/>
            communicated to Cambyses every thing that was done by him <lb/>
            at each procession : but Cambyses, surprised at this behaviour, <lb/>
            sent a messenger and inquired of him as follows: " Psamme­ <lb/>
            nitus, your master Cambyses inquires why, when you saw <lb/>
            your daughter humiliated and your son led to execution, you <lb/>
            did not bewail or lament; and have been so highly concerned <lb/>
            for a beggar, who is no way related to you, as he is informed." <lb/>
            lie then asked this question, but Psammenitus answered as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " Son of Cyrus, the calamities of my family are too great <lb/>
            to be expressed by lamentation ; but the griefs of my friend <lb/>
            were worthy of tears, who, having fallen from abundance and <lb/>
            prosperity, has come to beggary on the threshold of old age." <lb/>
            When this answer was brought back by the messenger, it ap­ <lb/>
            peared to Cambyses to be well said; and, as the Egyptians re­ <lb/>
            late, Crœsus wept, for he had attended Cambyses into Egypt, <lb/>
            and the Persians that were present wept also; and Cambyses <lb/>
            himself was touched with pity, and gave immediate orders to <lb/>
            preserve his son out of those who were to perish, and to re­ <lb/>
            move him and bring him from the suburbs into his presence. <lb/>
            15. Those who were sent found the son no longer alive, <lb/>
            having been the first that suffered; but having removed <lb/>
            Psammenitus himself they conducted himto Cambyses, with <lb/>
            whom he afterwards lived, without experiencing any violence. <lb/>
            And had it not been suspected 3 that he was planning innova­ <lb/>
            tions, he would probably have recovered Egypt, so as to have <lb/>
            the government intrusted to him. For the Persians are ac­ <lb/>
            customed to honour the sons of kings, and even if they have <lb/>
            revolted from them, nevertheless bestow the government upon <lb/>
            their children ; that such is their custom may be proved from <lb/>
            many other examples, and amongst them by that of Than­ <lb/>
            nyras, the son of Inarus the Libyan, who recovered the govern­ <lb/>
            ment which his father had; and by that of Pausiris, son <lb/>
            of Amyrtæus, for he also recovered his father's government: <lb/>
            yet none ever did more mischief to the Persians than Inarus <lb/>
            and Amyrtæus. But now Psammenitus, devising mischief, <lb/>
            received his reward, for he was discovered inciting the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians to revolt; and when he was detected by Cambyses he <note type="footnote"> 3 See Cary's Lexiccn, v. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απιστέειν</foreign>. </note> <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="margin"> 16, 17.] </note> <lb/>
            was compelled to drink the blood of a bull, and died imme­ <lb/>
            diately. Such then was his end.</p>
          <p>16. Cambyses proceeded from Memphis to the city of Sais, <lb/>
            purposing to do what he did effect; for when he entered the <lb/>
            palace of Amasis, he presently commanded the dead body of <lb/>
            Amasis to be brought out of the sepulchre; and when this was <lb/>
            done he gave orders to scourge it, to pull off the hair, to prick <lb/>
            it, and to abuse it in every possible manner. But when they <lb/>
            were wearied with this employment, (for the dead body, since <lb/>
            it was embalmed, resisted, and did not at all fall in pieces,) <lb/>
            Cambyses gave orders to burn it, commanding what is im­ <lb/>
            pious. For the Persians consider fire to be a god ; therefore <lb/>
            to burn the dead is on no account allowed by either nation; <lb/>
            not by the Persians, for the reason above-mentioned, for they <lb/>
            say it is not right to offer to a god the dead body of a man ; <lb/>
            and by the Egyptians fire is held to be a living beast, and that <lb/>
            it devours every thing it can lay hold of, and when it is glutted <lb/>
            with food it expires with what it has consumed; therefore it <lb/>
            is their law, on no account to give a dead body to wild beasts, <lb/>
            and for that reason they embalm them, that they may not lie <lb/>
            and be eaten by worms. Cambyses, therefore, commanded a <lb/>
            thing repugnant to the customs of both nations. However, <lb/>
            as the Egyptians say, it was not Amasis that was thus treated, <lb/>
            but some other Egyptian of the same stature as Amasis whom <lb/>
            the Persians insulted, thinking they insulted Amasis. For <lb/>
            they say, that Amasis, having been informed by an oracle of <lb/>
            what should happen to him after death, in order to remedy the <lb/>
            impending evil, buried the body of this very man who was <lb/>
            scourged, near the door of his own sepulchre,4 and charged his <lb/>
            son to deposit his own in the remotest part of the vault. Now, <lb/>
            these commands of Amasis, touching his own burial, and this <lb/>
            man, appear to me never to have been given, but the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians falsely boast of them.</p>
          <p>17. After this, Cambyses planned three several expeditions ; <lb/>
            one against the Carthaginians, another against the Am­ <lb/>
            monians, and a third against the Macrobian Ethiopians, who <lb/>
            inhabit that part of Libya which lies upon the South Sea. <lb/>
            And in forming his plans he determined to send a naval fore <lb/>
            against the Carthaginians, and against the Ammonians a de­ <lb/>
            tachment of his land forces; and against the Ethiopians, spie* <note type="footnote">4 See Book II. ch. 169 </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="18-21.]"/> <lb/>
            in the first instance, who were to see the table of the sun, <lb/>
            which was said to exist among the Ethiopians, and besides to <lb/>
            explore other things, and to cover their design they were to <lb/>
            carry presents to the king. 18. The table of the sun is said <lb/>
            to be of the following description : there is a meadow in the <lb/>
            suburbs filled with the cooked flesh of all sorts of quadrupeds ; <lb/>
            in this the several magistrates of the city, for some purpose, <lb/>
            place the flesh at night, and in the day-time whoever chooses <lb/>
            comes and feasts on it. The inhabitants say that the earth <lb/>
            itself, from time to time, produces these things. Such is the <lb/>
            description given of what is called the table of the sun. 19. <lb/>
            When Cambyses had determined to send the spies, he imme­ <lb/>
            diately sent to Elephantine for some of the Ichthyophagi, who <lb/>
            understood the Ethiopian language ; and while they were <lb/>
            fetching these, he commanded the naval force to sail against <lb/>
            Carthage. But the Phœnicians refused to obey, for that they <lb/>
            were bound by solemn oaths, and that they should act im­ <lb/>
            piously if they made war against their own descendants. As <lb/>
            the Phœnicians would not go, the rest were not fit for such <lb/>
            an enterprise: thus, therefore, the Carthaginians escaped <lb/>
            slavery at the hands of the Persians. For Cambyses did not <lb/>
            think it right to employ force towards the Phœnicians, be­ <lb/>
            cause they had voluntarily submitted to the Persians, and the <lb/>
            whole naval force depended on them. The Cyprians too, <lb/>
            having given themselves up to the Persians, joined the expe­ <lb/>
            dition against Egypt. 20. When the Ichthyophagi came to <lb/>
            Cambyses from Elephantine, he despatched them to the <lb/>
            Ethiopians, having instructed them what to say, carrying <lb/>
            presents, consisting of a purple cloak, a golden necklace, <lb/>
            bracelets, an alabaster box of ointment, and a cask of palm <lb/>
            wine. These Ethiopians, to whom Cambyses sent, are said <lb/>
            to be the tallest and handsomest of all men ; and they say <lb/>
            that they have customs different from those of other nations, <lb/>
            and especially the following, with regard to the regal power; <lb/>
            for they confer the sovereignty upon the man whom they <lb/>
            consider to be of the largest stature, and to possess strength <lb/>
            proportionable to his size.</p>
          <p>21. When therefore the Ichthyophagi arrived among this <lb/>
            people, they gave the presents to the king, and addressed <lb/>
            him as follows : “ Cambyses, king of the Persians, desirous <lb/>
            of becoming your friend and ally, has sent us, bidding us <pb n="179"/>
             <note type="margin">22, 23.] </note> <lb/>
            confer with you, and he presents you with these gifts, which are <lb/>
            such as he himself most delights in." But the Ethiopian, know­ <lb/>
            in,, that they came as spies, spoke thus to them : " Neither <lb/>
            has the king of the Persians sent you with presents to me, be­ <lb/>
            cause he valued my alliance; nor do you speak the truth ; <lb/>
            for ye are come as spies of my kingdom. Nor is he a just <lb/>
            man; for if he were just, he would not desire any other terri­ <lb/>
            tory than his own ; nor would he reduce people into servi­ <lb/>
            tude who have done him no injury. However, give him this <lb/>
            bow, and say these words to him : ‘The king of the Ethiopians <lb/>
            advises the king of the Persians, when the Persians can thus <lb/>
            easily draw a bow of this size, then to make war on the Ma­ <lb/>
            crobian Ethiopians with more numerous forces ; but until <lb/>
            that time let him thank the gods, who have not inspired the <lb/>
            sons of the Ethiopians with a desire of adding another land <lb/>
            to their own.'" 22. Having spoken thus and unstrung the <lb/>
            how, he delivered it to the comers. Then taking up the pur­ <lb/>
            ple cloak, he asked what it was, and how made ; and when <lb/>
            the Ichthyophagi told him the truth respecting the purple, <lb/>
            and the manner of dyeing, he said that the men are de­ <lb/>
            cepuve, and their garments are deceptive also. Next he in­ <lb/>
            quired about the necklace and bracelets, and when the Ich­ <lb/>
            thyophagi explained to him their use as ornaments, the king <lb/>
            laughing, and supposing them to be fetters, said that they have <lb/>
            stronger fetters than these. Thirdly, he inquired about the <lb/>
            ointment; and when they told him about its composition and <lb/>
            use, he made the same remark as he had on the cloak. But <lb/>
            when he came to the wine, and inquired how it was made, <lb/>
            being very much delighted with the draught, he further ask­ <lb/>
            ed what food the king made use of, and what was the longest <lb/>
            age to which a Persian lived. They answered, that he fed <lb/>
            on bread, describing the nature of wheat; and that the long­ <lb/>
            est period of the life of a Persian was eighty years. Upon <lb/>
            this the Ethiopian said, that he was not at all surprised if <lb/>
            men who fed on dung lived so few years ; and they would not <lb/>
            be able to live so many years, if they did not refresh them­ <lb/>
            selves with this beverage, showing the wine to the Ichthyo­ <lb/>
            phagi : for in this he admitted they were surpassed by the <lb/>
            Persians. 23. The Ichthyophagi inquiring in turn of the <lb/>
            king concerning the life and diet'of the Ethiopians, he said, <lb/>
            that most of them attained to a hundred and twenty years, <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="margin"> [24, 25 </note> <lb/>
            and some even exceeded that term, and that their food was <lb/>
            boiled flesh, and their drink milk. And when the spies express­ <lb/>
            ed their astonishment at the number of years, he led them to a <lb/>
            fountain, by washing in which they became more sleek, as if <lb/>
            it had been of oil, and an odour proceeded from it as of violets. <lb/>
            The water of this fountain, the spies said, is so weak, that <lb/>
            nothing is able to float upon it, neither wood, nor such things <lb/>
            as are lighter than wood; but every thing sinks to the bottom. <lb/>
            If this water is truly such as it is said to be, it may be they are <lb/>
            long-lived by reason of the abundant use of it. Leaving this <lb/>
            fountain, he conducted them to the common prison, where all <lb/>
            were fettered with golden chains; for among these Ethiopians <lb/>
            brass is the most rare and precious of all metals. After having <lb/>
            viewed the prison, they next visited that which is called the <lb/>
            table of the sun. 24. After this, they visited last of all their <lb/>
            sepulchres, which are said to be prepared from crystal in the <lb/>
            following manner. When they have dried the body, either as <lb/>
            the Egyptians do, or in some other way, they plaster it all <lb/>
            over with gypsum, and paint it, making it as much as possi­ <lb/>
            ble resemble real life; they then put round it a hollow column <lb/>
            made of crystal, which they dig up in abundance, and is <lb/>
            easily wrought. The body being in the middle of the column <lb/>
            is plainly seen, nor does it emit an unpleasant smell, nor is it <lb/>
            in any way offensive: and it is all visible5 as the body itself. <lb/>
            The nearest relations keep the column in their houses for a <lb/>
            year, offering to it the first-fruits of all, and performing <lb/>
            sacrifices; after that time they carry it out and place it some <lb/>
            where near the city.</p>
          <p>25. The spies, having seen every thing, returned home; <lb/>
            and when they had reported all that had passed, Cambyses, <lb/>
            being greatly enraged, immediately marched against the <lb/>
            Ethiopians, without making any provision for the subsistence <lb/>
            of his army, or once considering that he was going to carry <lb/>
            his arms to the remotest parts of the world; but as a madman, <lb/>
            and not in possession of his senses, as soon as he heard the <lb/>
            report of the Icthyophagi, he set out on his march, ordering <lb/>
            the Greeks who were present to stay behind, and taking with <lb/>
            him all his land forces. When the army reached Thebes, he <note type="footnote"> 5 The Egyptian mummies could only be seen in front, the back being <lb/>
            covered by a box or coffin; the Ethiopian bodies could be seen all round <lb/>
            as the column of glass was transparent. </note> <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin"> 26, 27.] </note> <lb/>
            detached about fifty thousand men, and ordered them to reduce <lb/>
            the Ammonians to slavery, and to burn the oracular temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter, while he with the rest of his army marched against <lb/>
            the Ethiopians. But before the army had passed over a fifth <lb/>
            part of the way, all the provisions 6 that they had were ex­ <lb/>
            hausted, and after the provisions, the beasts of burden were <lb/>
            eaten and likewise failed. Now if Cambyses, when he learnt <lb/>
            this, had altered his purpose, and had led back his army, even <lb/>
            after his first error, he would have proved himself to be a wise <lb/>
            man. But now, without any reflection, he still continued ad­ <lb/>
            vancing. The soldiers, as long as they could gather any from <lb/>
            the earth, supported life by eating herbs; but when they <lb/>
            reached the sands, some of them had recourse to a horrid ex­ <lb/>
            pedient, for taking one man in ten by lot, they devoured him : <lb/>
            ' when Cambyses heard this, shocked at their eating one <lb/>
            another, he abandoned his expedition against the Ethi­ <lb/>
            opians, marched back and reached Thebes, after losing a <lb/>
            great part from his army. From Thebes he went down to <lb/>
            Memphis, and suffered the Greeks to sail away. Thus ended <lb/>
            the expedition against the Ethiopians. 26. Those who had <lb/>
            been sent on the expedition against the Ammonians, after <lb/>
            having set out from Thebes, marched under the conduct of <lb/>
            guides, and are known to have reached the city Oasis, which <lb/>
            is inhabited by Samians, said to be of the Æschrionian tribe; <lb/>
            and they are distant seven days' march from Thebes, across <lb/>
            the sands. This country in the Greek language is called the <lb/>
            Island of the Blessed. It is said then that the army reached <lb/>
            this country; but afterwards none, except the Ammonians and <lb/>
            those who have heard their report, are able to give any ac­ <lb/>
            count of them; for they neither reached the Ammonians, nor <lb/>
            returned back. But the Ammonians make the following re­ <lb/>
            port : when they had advanced from this Oasis towards then <lb/>
            across the sands, and were about half-way between them and <lb/>
            Oasis, as they were taking dinner, a strong and vehement <lb/>
            south wind blew, and carrying with it heaps of sand, covered <lb/>
            them over, and in this manner they disappeared. The Am­ <lb/>
            monians say that such was the fate of this army.</p>
          <p>27. When Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis, whom the <note type="footnote"> 8 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιτίων</foreign> <unclear>ἐχόρoτα</unclear>. This expression is very common in <lb/>

            Greeks call Epaphus, appeared to the Egyptians; and when <lb/>
            this manifestation took place, the Egyptians immediately put <lb/>
            on their richest apparel, and kept festive holiday. Cambyses, <lb/>
            seeing them thus occupied, and concluding that they made <lb/>
            these rejoicings on account of his ill success, summoned the <lb/>
            magistrates of Memphis; and when they came into his pre­ <lb/>
            sence, he asked " why the Egyptians had done nothing of the <lb/>
            kind when he was at Memphis before, but did so now, when <lb/>
            he had returned with the loss of a great part of his army." <lb/>
            They answered, that their god appeared to them, who was ac­ <lb/>
            customed to manifest himself at distant intervals, and that <lb/>
            when he did appear, then all the Egyptians were used to re­ <lb/>
            joice and keep a feast. Cambyses, having heard this, said they <lb/>
            lied, and as liars he put them to death. 28. Having slain them, <lb/>
            he next summoned the priests into his presence; and when the <lb/>
            priests gave the same account, lie said, that he would find out <lb/>
            whether a god so tractable had come among the Egyptians; <lb/>
            and having said this, he commanded the priests to bring Apis <lb/>
            to him; they therefore went away to fetch him. This Apis, <lb/>
            or Epaphus, is the calf of a cow incapable of conceiving an­ <lb/>
            other offspring; and the Egyptians say, that lightning descends <lb/>
            upon the cow from heaven, and that from thence it brings <lb/>
            forth Apis. This calf, which is called Apis, has the following <lb/>
            marks: it is black, and has a square spot of white on the fore­ <lb/>
            head ; and on the back the figure of an eagle; and in the tail <lb/>
            double hairs; and on the tongue a beetle. 29. When the <lb/>
            priests brought Apis, Cambyses, like one almost out of his <lb/>
            senses, drew his dagger, meaning to strike the belly of Apis, <lb/>
            but hit the thigh; then falling into a fit of laughter, he said to <lb/>
            the priests, "Ye blockheads, are there such gods as these, i <lb/>
            consisting of blood and flesh, and sensible of steel? This, <lb/>
            truly, is a god worthy of the Egyptians. But you shall not <lb/>
            mock me with impunity." Having spoken thus, he com­ <lb/>
            manded those, whose business it was, to scourge the priests, <lb/>
            and to kill all the Egyptians whom they should find feasting. <lb/>
            Thus the festival of the Egyptians was put an end to, and the <lb/>
            priests were punished. But Apis, being wounded in the thigh, <lb/>
            lay and languished in the temple; and at length, when he had <lb/>
            died of the wound, the priests buried him without the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of Cambyses.</p>
          <p>30. But Cambyses, as the Egyptians say, immediately became <pb n="183"/>
             <note type="margin">31.] </note> <lb/>
            mad in consequence cf this atrocity, though indeed he was not <lb/>
            cf pound mind before. His first crime he committed against his <lb/>
            brother Smerdis, who was born of the same father and mother; <lb/>
            him he sent back from Egypt to Persia through envy, because <lb/>
            he alone of all the Persians had drawn the bow, which the <lb/>
            Ichthyophagi brought from the Ethiopian, within two fingers' <lb/>
            breadth: of the other Persians no one was able to do this. <lb/>
            After the departure of Smerdis for Persia, Cambyses saw the <lb/>
            following vision in his sleep: he imagined that a messenger <lb/>
            arrived from Persia and informed him that Smerdis was seated <lb/>
            on the royal throne, and touched the heavens with his head. <lb/>
            Upon this, fearing for himself, lest his brother should kill him, <lb/>
            and reign, he sent Prexaspes, who was a man the most faith­ <lb/>
            ful to him of the Persians, to Persia, with orders to kill <lb/>
            Smerdis. And he, having gone up to Susa, killed Smerdis ; <lb/>
            some say, when he had taken him out to hunt; but others, <lb/>
            that he led him to the Red Sea and drowned him. 31. This <lb/>
            they say was the first of the crimes of Cambyses: the second <lb/>
            he committed against his sister, who had accompanied him <lb/>
            into Egypt, and whom he married, and who was his sister by <lb/>
            both parents. He married her in the following way: for be­ <lb/>
            fore, the Persians were on no account accustomed to inter­ <lb/>
            marry with their sisters. Cambyses became enamoured of <lb/>
            one of his sisters, and then being desirous of making her his <lb/>
            wife, because lie purposed doing what was not customary, <lb/>
            he summoned the royal judges, and asked them if there was <lb/>
            any law permitting one who wished to marry his sister. The <lb/>
            royal judges are men chosen from among Persians, who con­ <lb/>
            tinue in office until they die, or are convicted of some in­ <lb/>
            justice. They determine causes between the Persians, and <lb/>
            are the interpreters of the ancient constitutions, and all ques­ <lb/>
            tions are referred to them. When, therefore, Cambyses put <lb/>
            the question, they gave an answer that was both just and safe; <lb/>
            saying that they could find no law permitting a brother to <lb/>
            marry his sister, but had discovered another law which per­ <lb/>
            mitted the king of Persia to do whatever he pleased. Thus <lb/>
            they did not abrogate the law through fear of Cambyses; but <lb/>
            that they might not lose their lives by upholding the law, they <lb/>
            found out another that favoured his desire of marrying his <lb/>
            sister. Thereupon, Cambyses married her of whom he was <lb/>
            enamoured, and shortly afterwards he had another sister. The <pb n="184"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[32—34."/> <lb/>
            youngest of these, then, who followed him into Egypt, he put <lb/>
            to death. 32. With respect to her death, as well as that of <lb/>
            Smerdis, a twofold account is given. The Greeks say, that <lb/>
            Cambyses made the whelp of a lion fight with a young dog ; <lb/>
            and that this wife was also looking on ; and that the dog <lb/>
            being over-matched, another puppy of the same litter broke <lb/>
            his chain, and came to his assistance, and thus the two dogs <lb/>
            united got the better of the whelp. Cambyses was delighted <lb/>
            at the sight, but she, sitting by him, shed tears. Cambyses <lb/>
            observing this, asked her why she wept. She answered, that <lb/>
            she wept seeing the puppy come to the assistance of his bro­ <lb/>
            ther, remembering Smerdis, and knowing that there was no <lb/>
            one to avenge him. The Greeks say, that for this speech she <lb/>
            was put to death by Cambyses. But the Egyptians say, that <lb/>
            as they were sitting at table, his wife took a lettuce, and strip­ <lb/>
            ped off its leaves, and then asked her husband, "Whether the <lb/>
            lettuce stripped of its leaves, or thick with foliage, was the <lb/>
            handsomer:" he said, "When thick with foliage:" where­ <lb/>
            upon she remarked, " Then you have imitated this lettuce, in <lb/>
            dismembering the house of Cyrus." Whereupon he, being <lb/>
            enraged, kicked her when she was with child ; and she mis­ <lb/>
            carried and died.</p>
          <p>33. Thus madly did Cambyses behave towards his own <lb/>
            family; whether on account of Apis, or from some other <lb/>
            cause, from which, in many ways, misfortunes are wont to be­ <lb/>
            fal mankind. For Cambyses is said, even from infancy, <lb/>
            to have been afflicted with a certain severe malady, which <lb/>
            some called the sacred disease.7 In that case, it was not at <lb/>
            all surprising that, when his body was so diseased, his mind <lb/>
            should not be sound. 34. And towards the other Persians <lb/>
            he behaved madly in the following instances: for it is report­ <lb/>
            ed that he said to Prexaspes, whom he highly honoured, and <lb/>
            whose office it was to bring messages to him, and whose son <lb/>
            was cup-bearer to Cambyses, and this is no trifling honour : <lb/>
            he is reported to have spoken as follows : "Prexaspes, what <lb/>
            sort of a man do the Persians think me ? and what remarks <lb/>
            do they make about me ? " He answered, “ Sir, you are highly <lb/>
            extolled in every other respect, but they say you are too <lb/>
            much addicted to wine." Prexaspes said this of the Persians, <lb/>
            but the king, enraged, answered as follows: "Do the Persians <note type="footnote"> 7 Epilepsy. </note> <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin"> 35, 36.] </note> <lb/>
            indeed say that, by being addicted to wine, I am beside my­ <lb/>
            self, and am not in my senses ? then their former words were <lb/>
            not true." For, on a former occasion, when the Persians and <lb/>
            Crœsus were sitting with him, Cambyses asked, what sort of <lb/>
            a man he appeared to be in comparison with his father Cyrus; <lb/>
            they answered, that he was superior to his father, for that <lb/>
            he held all that Cyrus possessed, and had acquired besides <lb/>
            Egypt and the empire of the sea. Crœsus, being present, not <lb/>
            being pleased with this decision, spoke thus to Cambyses : <lb/>
            “ To me now, 0 son of Cyrus, you do not appear comparable <lb/>
            to your father, for you have not yet such a son as he left be­ <lb/>
            hind him." Cambyses was delighted at hearing this, and <lb/>
            commended the judgment of Crœsus. 35. Therefore, remem­ <lb/>
            bering this, he said in anger to Prexaspes, " Observe now <lb/>
            yourself, whether the Persians have spoken the truth, or <lb/>
            whether they who say such things are not out of their senses: <lb/>
            for if I shoot that son of yours who stands under the portico, <lb/>
            and hit him in the heart, the Persians will appear to have <lb/>
            said nothing to the purpose ; but if I miss, then say that the <lb/>
            Persians have spoken truth, and that I am not of sound <lb/>
            mind." Having said this, and bent his bow, he hit the boy ; <lb/>
            and when the boy had fallen, he ordered them to open him <lb/>
            and examine the wound ; and when the arrow was found in <lb/>
            the heart, he said to the boy's father, laughing, "Prexaspes, <lb/>
            it has been clearly shown to you that I am not mad, but that <lb/>
            the Persians are out of their senses. Now tell me, did you <lb/>
            ever see a man take so true an aim ? " But Prexaspes, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving him to be out of his mind, and being in fear for his <lb/>
            own life, said, " Sir, I believe that a god himself could not <lb/>
            have shot so well." At that time he committed such an <lb/>
            atrocity ; and at another time, having, without any just <lb/>
            cause, seized twelve Persians of the first rank, he had them <lb/>
            buried alive up to the head.</p>
          <p>36. While he was acting in this manner, Crœsus the Ly­ <lb/>
            than thought fit to admonish him in the following terms : “0 <lb/>
            king, do not yield entirely to your youthful impulses and <lb/>
            anger, but possess and restrain yourself. It is a good thing <lb/>
            to be provident, and wise to have forethought. You put men <lb/>
            to death who are your own subjects, having seized them with­ <lb/>
            out any just cause ; and you slay their children. If you per­ <lb/>
            sist in such a course, beware lest the Persians revolt from <pb n="186"/>
             <note type="margin">[37, 38 </note> <lb/>
            you. Your father Cyrus strictly .harged me to admonish <lb/>
            you, and suggest whatever I might discovei for your good. IS <lb/>
            He then manifested his good will, in giving this advice ; but <lb/>
            Cambyses answered, "Do you presume to give me advice, <lb/>
            you, who so wisely managed your own country ; and so well <lb/>
            advised my father, when you persuaded him to pass the <lb/>
            river Araxes, and advance against the Massagetæ, when they <lb/>
            were willing to cross over into our territory ? You have first <lb/>
            ruined yourself by badly governing your own country, and <lb/>
            then ruined Cyrus, who was persuaded by your advice. But <lb/>
            you shall have no reason to rejoice ; for I have long wanted <lb/>
            to find a pretext against you." So saying, he took up his <lb/>
            bow for the purpose of shooting him ; but Crœsus jumped up <lb/>
            and ran out. Cambyses, when he was unable to shoot him, <lb/>
            commanded his attendants to seize him, and put him to death. <lb/>
            But the attendants, knowing his temper, concealed Crœsus for <lb/>
            the following reason, that if Cambyses should repent, and in­ <lb/>
            quire for Crœsus, they, by producing him, might receive re­ <lb/>
            wards for preserving him alive ; or if he should not repent, <lb/>
            or regret him, then they would put him to death. Not long <lb/>
            afterwards Cambyses did regret Crœsus, and the attendants, <lb/>
            knowing this, acquainted him that he was still living; on <lb/>
            which Cambyses said, "I am rejoiced that Crœsus is still <lb/>
            alive; they, however, who saved him, shall not escape with <lb/>
            impunity, but I will have them put to death." And he made <lb/>
            good his word.</p>
          <p>37. He, then, committed many such mad actions, both <lb/>
            against the Persians and his allies, while he staid at Mem­ <lb/>
            phis, both opening ancient sepulchres, and examining the dead <lb/>
            bodies; he also entered the temple of Vulcan, and derided the <lb/>
            image, for the image of Vulcan is very like the Phœnician <lb/>
            Pataici, which the Phœnicians place at the prows of their tri­ <lb/>
            remes. For the benefit of any one who has not seen them, I <lb/>
            will describe them ; it is a representation of a pigmy. He <lb/>
            likewise entered the temple of the Cabeiri, (into which it is <lb/>
            unlawful for any one except the priest to enter,) and these <lb/>
            images he burnt, after he had ridiculed them in various ways: <lb/>
            these also are like that of Vulcan ; and they say that they are <lb/>
            the sons of this latter. 38. It is then in every way clear to <lb/>
            me that Cambyses was outrageously mad ; otherwise he would <lb/>
            not have attempted to deride things sacred and established <pb n="187"/>
             <note type="margin">39, 40.] </note> <lb/>
            customs. For if any one should propose to all men, to select <lb/>
            the best institutions of all that exist, each, after considering <lb/>
            them all, would choose their own ; so certain is it that each <lb/>
            thinks his own institutions by far the best. It is not there­ <lb/>
            fore probable, that any but a madman would make such things <lb/>
            the subject of ridicule. That all men are of- this mind re­ <lb/>
            specting their own institutions, may be inferred from many <lb/>
            and various proofs, and amongst them by the following. Da­ <lb/>
            rius having summoned some Greeks under his sway, who <lb/>
            were present, asked them for what sum they would feed <lb/>
            upon the dead bodies of their parents." They answered, that <lb/>
            they would not do it for any sum. Darius afterwards having <lb/>
            summoned some of the Indians called Callatians, who are ac­ <lb/>
            customed to eat their parents, asked them in the presence of <lb/>
            the Greeks, and who were informed of what was said by an <lb/>
            interpreter, " for what sum they would consent to burn their <lb/>
            fathers when they die ?" but they, making loud exclamations, <lb/>
            begged he would speak words of good omen. Such then is <lb/>
            the effect of custom : and Pindar appears to me to have said <lb/>
            rightly, " That custom is the king of all men."</p>
          <p>39. Whilst Cambyses was invading Egypt, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians made an expedition against Samos and Polycrates, <lb/>
            the son of Æaces, who had made an insurrection and seized <lb/>
            on Samos. At first, having divided the state into three parts, <lb/>
            he shared it with his brothers Pantagnotus and Syloson ; but <lb/>
            afterwards, having put one of them to death, and expelled <lb/>
            Syloson, the younger, he held the whole of Samos ; and hold­ <lb/>
            ing it, made a treaty of friendship with Amasis king of <lb/>
            Egypt, sending presents, and receiving others from him in <lb/>
            return. In a very short time the power of Polycrates in­ <lb/>
            reased, and was noised abroad throughout Ionia and the rest <lb/>
            f Greece; for wherever he turned his arms, every thing <lb/>
            lrned out prosperously. He had a hundred fifty-oared gal­ <lb/>
            eys, and a thousand archers.. And he plundered all without <lb/>
            istinction ; for he said that he gratified a friend more by <lb/>
            estoring what he had seized, than by taking nothing at <lb/>
            .1. ' He accordingly took many of the islands, and many <lb/>
            caties on the continent; he moreover overcame in a sea-fight, <lb/>
            and took prisoners, the Lesbians, who came to assist the Mi­ <lb/>
            lesians with all their forces: these, being put in chains, dug the <lb/>
            whole trench that surrounds the walls of Samos. 40. Some- <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[41, </note> <lb/>
            how the exceeding good fortune of Polycrates did not escaj <lb/>
            the notice of Amasis, but was the cause of uneasiness to hin <lb/>
            and when his successes continued to increase, having writte <lb/>
            a letter in the following terms, he despatched it to Samos <lb/>
            "Amasis to Polycrates says thus: It is pleasant to hear ( <lb/>
            the successes of a friend and ally. But your too great goo <lb/>
            fortune does not please me, knowing, as I do, that the divinit <lb/>
            is jealous. As for me, I would rather choose that both I an <lb/>
            those for whom I am solicitous, should be partly successful i <lb/>
            our undertakings, and partly suffer reverses ; and so pass lift <lb/>
            meeting with vicissitudes of fortune, than being prosperous in <lb/>
            all things. For I cannot remember that I ever heard of an <lb/>
            man, who, having been constantly successful, did not at la. <lb/>
            utterly perish. Be advised therefore by me, and act tht <lb/>
            with regard to your good fortune. Having considered wha <lb/>
            you can find that you value most, and the loss of which woul <lb/>
            most pain your soul; this so cast away, that it may neve <lb/>
            more be seen of man : and if after this successes are nc <lb/>
            mingled interchangeably with reverses, again have recoup <lb/>
            to the remedy I have suggested." 41. Polycrates, havir <lb/>
            read this letter, and conceived that Amasis had given his <lb/>
            good advice, inquired of himself by the loss of which <lb/>
            his valuables he should most afflict his soul; and on inquir. <lb/>
            he discovered the following : he had a seal which he wore, s <lb/>
            in gold, made of an emerald, and it was the workmanship <lb/>
            Theodorus, the son of Telecles, a Samian ; when therefore <lb/>
            had determined -to cast this away, he did as follows. Havin <lb/>
            manned a fifty-oàred galley, he went on board it, and the <lb/>
            ordered to put out to sea ; and when he was a considerable dis­ <lb/>
            tance from the island, he took off the seal, and in the sight <lb/>
            all on board, threw it into the sea. This done, he sailed ba <lb/>
            again ; and having reached his palace, he mourned it a <lb/>
            great misfortune. 42. But on the fifth or sixth day after I <lb/>
            the following circumstance occurred : a fisherman, have <lb/>
            caught a large and beautiful fish, thought it a present worth is <lb/>
            be given to Polycrates ; he accordingly carried it to the g se <lb/>
            and said that he wished to be admitted to the presence ofys <lb/>
            lycrates ; and when this was granted, he presented the <unclear>ar</unclear> <lb/>
            and said, " 0 king, having caught this, I did not think <lb/>
            right to take it to market, although I get my living by <unclear>his</unclear> <lb/>
            labour ; but 't seemed to me worthy of you and your <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="8-45.]"/> <lb/>
            lire: I bring it therefore, and present it to you." He, <unclear/> <lb/>
            pleased with these words, replied, " You have done well, and <lb/>
            I give you double thanks for your speech and your present, and <lb/>
            I invite you to supper." The fisherman, thinking a great deal <lb/>
            of this, went away to his own home ; but the servants, open­ <lb/>
            ing the fish, found the seal of Polycrates in its belly; and <lb/>
            as soon as they had seen it, and taken it out, they carried it <lb/>
            with great joy to Polycrates, and as they gave him the seal they <lb/>
            acquainted him in what manner it had been found. But when <lb/>
            it occurred to him that the event was superhuman, he wrote <lb/>
            an account of what he had done, and of what had happened, <lb/>
            and having written, he despatched the account to Egypt. <lb/>
            43. But Amasis, having read the letter that came from Poly­ <lb/>
            crates, felt persuaded that it was impossible for man to rescue <lb/>
            nan from the fate that awaited him, and that Polycrates <lb/>
            could not come to a good end, since he was fortunate in <lb/>
            very thing, and even found what he had thrown away ; <lb/>
            laving therefore sent a herald to Samos, he said that he must <lb/>
            enounce his friendship. He did this for the following rea­ <lb/>
            rm, lest if some dreadful and great calamity betel Polycrates, <lb/>
            e might himself be grieved for him, as for a friend.</p>
          <p>44. Against this Polycrates, then, who was so universally <lb/>
            losperous, the Lacedæmonians made war, at the solicita­ <lb/>
            tion of those Samians who afterwards founded Cydonia in <lb/>
            rete.8 Polycrates, having sent to Cambyses the son of Cy­ <lb/>
            us, as he was collecting an army for the invasion of Egypt, <lb/>
            egged that he would send to him at Samos and demand <lb/>
            me troops. When Cambyses heard this, he readily sent to <lb/>
            Famos, requesting Polycrates to furnish a naval force to at­ <lb/>
            end him in his invasion of Egypt. Whereupon he, having <lb/>
            selected those citizens whom he most suspected of seditious <lb/>
            designs, sent them away in forty galleys, enjoining Cambyses <lb/>
            not to send them home again, 45. Now, some say that <lb/>
            these Samians who were sent out by Polycrates never reached <lb/>
            Egypt, but when they were off Carpathius, they conferred to­ <lb/>
            gether and resolved to sail no farther. Others say, that hav­ <lb/>
            ing arrived in Egypt, and finding themselves watched, they <lb/>
            made their escape from thence ; and as they were sailing back <lb/>
            to Samos, Polycrates met them with a fleet, and came to an en­<note type="footnote">a See chap. 59. </note> <pb n="190"/>
            <note type="margin"> [46, 47 </note> <lb/>
            gagement; and they who were returning gained the victory. <lb/>
            and landed on the island, and there having fought on land, <lb/>
            they were worsted, and so set sail for Lacedæmon. There are <lb/>
            some who say that the party from Egypt conquered Poly­ <lb/>
            crates ; in my opinion, giving an erroneous account: for there <lb/>
            would have been no need for their calling in the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans, if they were themselves able to get the better of Polycrates. <lb/>
            Besides, it is not at all probable that one who had a numerous <lb/>
            body of foreign mercenaries, and of native archers, should be <lb/>
            beaten by the Samians who returned, who were few in number. <lb/>
            Moreover, Polycrates, having shut up together in the arsenals <lb/>
            the children and wives of the citizens who were subject to <lb/>
            him, had them ready to burn, together with the arsenals them­ <lb/>
            selves, in case they should go over to those who were return­ <lb/>
            ing. 46. When the Samians, expelled by Poly crates, arrived <lb/>
            at Sparta, having presented themselves before the magistrates, <lb/>
            they made a long harangue, as people very much in earnest. <lb/>
            But they, at this first audience, answered them, that they had <lb/>
            forgotten the first part of their speech, and did not understand <lb/>
            the last. After this, having presented themselves a second <lb/>
            time, they brought a sack, and said nothing else than " the <lb/>
            sack wants meal but the Lacedæmonians replied, that the <lb/>
            word "sack" was superfluous : it was, however, decreed that <lb/>
            they should assist them. 47. Then the Lacedæmonians, hav­ <lb/>
            ing made preparations, set out with an army against Samos ; <lb/>
            as the Samians say, requiting a former kindness, because they <lb/>
            had formerly assisted them with some ships against the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians ; but as the Lacedæmonians say, they undertook this <lb/>
            expedition, not so much for the purpose of assisting the <lb/>
            Samians who entreated them, as from a desire to revenge the <lb/>
            seizure of the bowl.9 which they sent to Crœsus, and the <lb/>
            corselet which Amasis king of Egypt had sent to them as a <lb/>
            present; for the Samians had robbed them of the corselet the <lb/>
            year before they took the bowl. This corselet was made of <lb/>
            linen, with many figures of animals inwrought, and adorned <lb/>
            with gold and cotton-wool: and on this account each thread <lb/>
            of the corselet makes it worthy of admiration ; for though it <lb/>
            is fine, it contains three hundred and sixty threads, all distinct. <lb/>
            Such another is that which Amasis dedicated to Minerva at <lb/>
            Lindus.1 <note type="footnote"> 2 See Book I. ch. 70. </note><note type="footnote">1 See Book If. ch 182. </note> <pb n="191"/>

          <p>48. The Corinthians readily assisted in abetting the expe­ <lb/>
            ition against Samos; because an injury had been also done <lb/>
            o them by the Samians in the age preceding this expedition, <lb/>
            lone about the same time as the seizure of the bowl. For <lb/>
            'eriander, son of Cypselus, had sent three hundred youths, of <lb/>
            he noblest families of the Corcyraeans, to Alyattes at Sardis, <lb/>
            or the purpose of emasculation ; but when the Corinthians <lb/>
            rho were conducting the youths touched at Samos, the Sami­ <lb/>
            ns, having ascertained for what purpose they were being con­ <lb/>
            lucted to Sardis, first of all instructed the youths to touch the <lb/>
            emple of Diana, and afterwards would not suffer the Corin­ <lb/>
            hians to remove the suppliants from the sanctuary; and when <lb/>
            he Corinthians denied the youths any sustenance, the Samians <lb/>
            nstituted a festival, which they still observe in the same way. <lb/>
            'or when night came on, as long as the youths continued <lb/>
            uppliants, they instituted choruses of virgins and young men, <lb/>
            nd made a law that they should carry cakes of sesame and <lb/>
            oney, in order that the Corcyræan youths might seize them <lb/>
            nd have food. This was continued until the Corinthians, <lb/>
            who had charge of the youths, went away and left them ; then <lb/>
            tie Samians sent home the youths to Corcyra. 49. Now if, <lb/>
            fter the death of Periander, the Corinthians had been on <lb/>
            dendly terms with the Corcyræans, they would not have as­ <lb/>
            isted in the expedition against Samos for the above-mentioned <lb/>
            use: but in fact, from the first colonization of the island, <lb/>
            ey have always been at variance with one another: for this <lb/>
            eason, therefore, the Corinthians remembered their grudge <lb/>
            gainst the Samians. But Periander had selected the sons of <lb/>
            lie Corcyraean nobles, and sent them to Sardis to be emascu­ <lb/>
            ited, in revenge of an insult offered him; for the Corcyraeans <lb/>
            ad first committed an outrageous deed against him. 50. <lb/>
            Then Periander had killed his own wife Melissa, it happened <lb/>
            lat another calamity succeeded the former. He had two sons <lb/>
            y Melissa, one seventeen, the other eighteen years of age. <lb/>
            hese their maternal grandfather, Procles, who was tyrant of <lb/>
            Epidaurus, sent for, and treated affectionately, as was natural, <lb/>
            ney being the sons of his own daughter. But when he sent <lb/>
            lem home, as he escorted them on their way, he said, " Do you <lb/>
            :now, my sons, who killed your mother ? " The elder of them <unclear/> <lb/>
            look no notice of these words; but the younger, whoso namo <lb/>
            ras Lycophron, when he heard it, was so grieved at hearing <pb n="192"/>
             <note type="margin">[51, 52. </note> <lb/>
            this, that on his return at Corinth, he neither addressed his <lb/>
            father, regarding him as the murderer of his mother, nor en­ <lb/>
            tered into conversation with him, nor answered a word to his <lb/>
            questions. At last Periander, being exceedingly angry, drove <lb/>
            him from the palace. 51. Having driven him out, he inquired <lb/>
            of the elder one what their grandfather had said to them. lie <lb/>
            related to him how kindly he had received them ; but he did <lb/>
            not mention the words Procles said as he was escorting them, <lb/>
            for he had paid no attention to them. But Periander affirmed <lb/>
            that it was impossible but that he had suggested something to <lb/>
            them ; and he persevered in his inquiries, till the young man <lb/>
            recovered his memory, and mentioned this also. Periander, <lb/>
            reflecting on this, and resolving not to show any indulgence, <lb/>
            sent a messenger to the persons by whom the son who was <lb/>
            driven out was entertained, and forbade them to receive him <lb/>
            in their houses. But lie, when being driven out from one <lb/>
            house he came to another, was driven from this also, since Pe­ <lb/>
            riander threatened all that received him, and required them to <lb/>
            expel him. Being thus driven about, he went to some other <lb/>
            of his friends ; and they, though in dread, yet received him as <lb/>
            the son of Periander. 52. At last Periander made a pro­ <lb/>
            clamation, that whoever should either receive him in his house, <lb/>
            or converse with him, should pay a sacred fine to Apollo, men­ <lb/>
            tioning the amount. In consequence of this proclamation, <lb/>
            therefore, no one would either converse with him, or receive <lb/>
            him into their houses ; besides he himself did not think it right <lb/>
            to attempt what was forbidden, but persisting in his purpose <lb/>
            strayed among the porticoes. On the fourth day Periander, <lb/>
            seeing him reduced to a state of filth and starvation, felt com­ <lb/>
            passion, and relaxing his anger approached him, and said, <lb/>
            " My son, which of these is preferable, your present mode of <lb/>
            life, or by accommodating yourself to your father's wishes, to <lb/>
            succeed to the power and riches which I now possess? You, <lb/>
            who are my son, and a prince of wealthy Corinth, have chosen <lb/>
            a vagabond life, by opposing and showing anger towards him, <lb/>
            whom, least of all, you ought so to treat. For if any calamity <lb/>
            has occurred in our family on account of which you have COIl­ <lb/>
            ceived any suspicion of me, it has fallen upon me, and I bear <lb/>
            the chief burden of it, inasmuch as I murdered her. Dc you, <lb/>
            therefore, having learnt how much better it is to be envied than <lb/>
            pitied, and at the same time what it is to be angry with parents <pb n="193"/>
             <note type="margin">53.] </note> <lb/>
            and superiors, return to your home." With these words <lb/>
            Periander endeavoured to restrain him. He, however, gave <lb/>
            his father no other answer, but said, that lie had made himself <unclear/> <lb/>
            liable to pay the sacred fine to the god, by having spoken to <lb/>
            him. Periander therefore perceiving that the distemper of <lb/>
            his son was impracticable and invincible, put him on board a <lb/>
            ship, and sent him out of his sight to Corcyra, for he was also <lb/>
            master of that island. Periander having sent him away, <lb/>
            made war on his father-in-law, Procles, as being the principal <lb/>
            author of the present troubles; and he took Epidaurus, and <lb/>
            took Procles himself and kept him prisoner. 53. But when, <lb/>
            in lapse of time, Periander grew old, and became conscious <lb/>
            that he was no longer able to superintend and manage <lb/>
            public affairs, having sent to Corcyra, he recalled Lycophron <lb/>
            to assume the government, for he did not perceive in his <lb/>
            eldest son any capacity for government,2 but he appeared to <lb/>
            him dull of intellect. But Lycophron did not deign to give <lb/>
            an answer to the bearer of the message. Nevertheless Peri­ <lb/>
            ander, having a strong affection for the youth, next sent to <lb/>
            him his sister, who was his own daughter, thinking she would <lb/>
            be most likely to persuade him. On her arrival she thus ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him: "Brother, would you that the government <lb/>
            should pass to others, and that your father's family should be <lb/>
            utterly destroyed, rather than yourself return and possess it ? <lb/>
            Come home, then, and cease to punish yourself. Obstinacy is a <lb/>
            sorry possession: think not to cure one evil by another. Many <lb/>
            have preferred equity to strict justice; and many, ere this, in <lb/>
            seeking their mother's rights have lost their father's inherit­ <lb/>
            ance. A kingdom is an uncertain possession, and many are <lb/>
            suitors for it. He is now old, and past the vigour of life. Do <lb/>
            not give your own to others." Thus she, having been in­ <lb/>
            structed by her father, said what was most likely to persuade <lb/>
            him. But he in answer said, that he would never return to <lb/>
            Corinth so long as he should hear his father was living. When <lb/>
            she brought back this answer, Periander sent a third time by a <lb/>
            herald to say, that he himself intended to go to Corcyra; and <lb/>
            urged him to return to Corinth and become his successor in <lb/>
            the kingdom. The son consenting to this proposal, Periander <lb/>
            prepared to set out for Corcyra, and his son for Corinth; but <note type="footnote"> * After <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνεώα, τὸ εἶαι δυνατὸν τὰ πράγματα διέπειν</foreign>, must be sup­ <lb/>
            plied to complete the sentence. <unclear/></note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[54-57."/> <lb/>
            the Corcyræans being informed of each particular, in order <lb/>
            that Periander might not come to their country, killed the <lb/>
            young man: and in return for this, Periander took vengeance <lb/>
            on the Corcyræans.</p>
          <p>54. The Lacedæmonians, arriving with a great armament. <lb/>
            besieged Samos, and having attacked the fortifications, they had <lb/>
            passed beyond the tower that faced the sea near the suburbs ; <lb/>
            but afterwards, when Polycrates himself advanced with a large <lb/>
            force, they were driven back. Immediately after, the auxiliaries <lb/>
            and many of the Samians poured down from the upper tower, <lb/>
            which stands on the ridge of the mountain ; and having with­ <lb/>
            stood the Lacedæmonians for a short time, they fled back <lb/>
            again, and the enemy pursued them with great slaughter. <lb/>
            55. Now, if all the Lacedæmonians who were present on that <lb/>
            day had behaved as well as Archias and Lycopas, Samoa <lb/>
            would have been taken. For Archias and Lycopas alone <lb/>
            rushing on with the Samians as they fled to the wall, and be­ <lb/>
            in- shut out from retreat, died in the city of the Samians. <lb/>
            Another Archias, the son of Samius, son of Archias, the third <lb/>
            in descent from this Archias, I myself met with in Pitane, for <lb/>
            he was of that tribe. He esteemed the Samians above all <lb/>
            other strangers, and said, that the surname of Samian was <lb/>
            given to his father, because he was son to that Archias who <lb/>
            fell so gloriously at Samos ; and he said that he honoured the <lb/>
            Samians, because his grandfather had been buried by them at <lb/>
            the public charge. 56. The Lacedæmonians, after forty days <lb/>
            had been spent in besieging Samos, finding their affairs were <lb/>
            not at all advanced, returned to Peloponnesus; though a ground­ <lb/>
            less report has gone abroad, for it is said that Polycrates, <lb/>
            having coined a large quantity of the country money in lead, <lb/>
            had it gilt and gave it to them; and that they, having received <lb/>
            it, thereupon took their departure. This was the first ex­ <lb/>
            pedition that the Lacedæmonian Dorians undertook against <lb/>
            Asia.</p>
          <p>57. Those of the Samians who had fomented the war <lb/>
            against Polycrates, when the Lacedæmonians were about to <lb/>
            abandon them, set sail for Siphnus, for they were in want of <lb/>
            money. The affairs of the Siphnians were at that time in a <lb/>
            flourishing condition, and they were the richest of all tht <lb/>
            islanders, having in the island gold and silver mines, so thai <lb/>
            from the tenth of the money accruing from thence, a treasure <pb n="195"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="58 -60.]"/> <lb/>
            is laid up at Delphi equal to the richest; and they used every <lb/>
            year to divide the riches that accrued from the mines. When, <lb/>
            therefore, they established this treasure, they consulted the <lb/>
            oracle, whether their present prosperity should continue with <lb/>
            them for a long time ; but the Pythian answered as follows : <lb/>
            " When the Prytaneum in Siphnus shall be white, and the <lb/>
            market white-fronted, then there is need of a prudent man <lb/>
            to guard against a wooden ambush and a crimson herald." <lb/>
            The market and Prytaneum of the Siphnians were then <lb/>
            adorned with Parian marble. 58. This response they were <lb/>
            unable to comprehend, either then on the moment, or when <lb/>
            the Samians arrived. For as soon as the Samians reached <unclear/> <lb/>
            Siphnus, they sent one of their ships conveying ambassadors <lb/>
            to the city. Formerly, all ships were painted red. And this <lb/>
            it was that the Pythian forewarned the Siphnians, bidding <lb/>
            them beware of a wooden ambush and a crimson herald. These <lb/>
            ambassadors then, having arrived, requested the Siphnians to <lb/>
            lend them ten talents; but when the Siphnians refused the loan, <lb/>
            the Samians ravaged their territory. But the Siphnians having <lb/>
            heard of it, came, out to protect their property, and having <lb/>
            engaged were beaten, and many of them were cut off from the <lb/>
            city by the Samians; and they afterwards exacted from them <lb/>
            a hundred talents. 59. From the Hermionians they received <lb/>
            an island instead of money, Thyrea, near Peloponnesus, and <lb/>
            gave it in charge to the Trcezenians; and they themselves <lb/>
            founded Cydonia in Crete; though they did not sail thither <lb/>
            for that purpose, but to expel the Zacynthians from the island. <lb/>
            They continued in this settlement, and were prosperous for <lb/>
            five years; so much so that these are the people who erected <lb/>
            the sacred precincts that are now in Cydonia, and the temple <lb/>
            of Dictynna. But in the sixth year the Æginetæ, having <lb/>
            vanquished them in a sea-fight, reduced them to slavery, to­ <lb/>
            ,-ether with the Cretans; and they cut off the prows of their <lb/>
            ships, which represented the figure of a boar, and dedicated <lb/>
            them in the temple of Minerva, in Ægina. The Æginetæ <lb/>
            did this on account of a grudge they bore the Samians; for <lb/>
            former Samians, when Amphicrates reigned in Samos, having <lb/>
            made war against Ægina, did the Æginetæ much mischief <lb/>
            and suffered in return. This, then, was the cause.</p>
          <p>-60. I have dwelt longer on the affairs of the Samians, be­ <lb/>
            cause they have three works the greatest that have been ac­ <note type="footnote">o 2 </note><pb n="196"/>
             <note type="margin">[61, 62.</note> <lb/>
            complished by all the Greeks. The first is of a mountain, <lb/>
            one hundred and fifty orgyæ in height; in this is dug a tunnel, <lb/>
            beginning from the base, with an opening at each side. The <lb/>
            length of the excavation is seven stades, and the height and <lb/>
            breadth eight feet each; through the whole length of it is dug <lb/>
            another excavation twenty cubits deep, and three feet broad, <lb/>
            through which the water conveyed by pipes reaches the city, <lb/>
            drawn from a copious fountain. The architect of this excava­ <lb/>
            tion was a Megarian, Eupalinus, son of Naustrophus. This, <lb/>
            then, is one of the three. The second is a mound in the sea <lb/>
            round the harbour, in depth about one hundred orgyæ; and <lb/>
            the length of the mound is more than two stades. The third <lb/>
            work of theirs is a temple, the largest of all we have ever <lb/>
            seen; of this, the first architect was Rhcecus, son of Phileus, <lb/>
            a native. On account of these things I have dwelt longer on <lb/>
            the affairs of the Samians.</p>
          <p>61. While Cambyses, son of Cyrus, tarried in Egypt, and <lb/>
            was acting madly, two magi, who were brothers, revolted. <lb/>
            One of these, Cambyses had left steward of his palace. He <lb/>
            accordingly revolted, having been informed of the death of <lb/>
            Smerdis, and that it was kept secret, and that there were few <lb/>
            of the Persians who were acquainted with it, for the general­ <lb/>
            ity thought him still alive. Therefore, having formed the <lb/>
            following design, he determined to make an attempt on the <lb/>
            throne. He had a brother, who, I have said, joined him in <lb/>
            the revolt, in person very like Smerdis, son of Cyrus, whom <lb/>
            Cambyses, although he was his own brother, had put to <lb/>
            death. The magus Patizithes, having persuaded this man <lb/>
            that he would manage every thing for him, set him on the <lb/>
            throne ; and having done this, he sent heralds in various di­ <lb/>
            rections, and particularly to Egypt, to proclaim to the army, <lb/>
            that they must in future obey Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and not <lb/>
            Cambyses. 62. The other heralds, therefore, made this pro­ <lb/>
            clamation ; and he, moreover, who was appointed to Egypt, <lb/>
            finding Cambyses and his army at Ecbatana in Syria, stand­ <lb/>
            ing in the midst, proclaimed what had been ordered by the <lb/>
            magus. Cambyses having heard this from the herald, and <lb/>
            believing that he spoke the truth, and that he had himself <lb/>
            been betrayed by Prexaspes, (for that he, when sent to kill <lb/>
            Smerdis, had not done so,) looked towards Prexaspes, and <lb/>
            said, " Prexaspes, hast thou thus performed the business I en­ <pb n="197"/>
             <note type="margin">63, 64.] <lb/>
            </note>joined thee ?" But ne answered, " Sir, it is not true that your <lb/>
            brother Smerdis has revolted against you, nor that you can <lb/>
            !iave any quarrel, great or small, with him. For I myself put <unclear/> <lb/>
            your order in execution, and buried him with my own hands. <lb/>
            If, however, the dead rise again, expect that Astyages the <lb/>
            Mede will rise up against you. But if it is now as formerly, <lb/>
            nothing new can spring up to you from him. It appears to <lb/>
            me, however, that we should pursue the herald, and find out <lb/>
            by inquiry from whom he comes to proclaim to us that we <lb/>
            ire to obey king Smerdis." 63. When Prexaspes had spoken <lb/>
            thus, as the advice was approved by Cambyses, the herald <lb/>
            was immediately pursued, and brought back. When he <lb/>
            irrived, Prexaspes questioned him as follows : "Friend, since <lb/>
            you say that you come as the messenger of Smerdis, son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, now speak the truth, and depart in peace. Whether <lb/>
            lid Smerdis himself appear in person before you, and give <lb/>
            these orders, or some one of his ministers ? " He answered, <lb/>
            " I have not so much as seen Smerdis, son of Cyrus, since <lb/>
            king Cambyses marched for Egypt ; but the magus whom <lb/>
            Cambyses appointed steward of his palace gave me these <lb/>
            orders, saying that Smerdis, son of Cyrus, was the person <lb/>
            who charged me to deliver this message to you." Thus the <lb/>
            man spoke without adding any untruth. But Cambyses said, <lb/>
            " Prexaspes, you, like a faithful man, having executed your <lb/>
            instructions, have escaped all blame : but what Persian can <lb/>
            this be, who has revolted against me, usurping the name of <lb/>
            Smerdis ?" He replied, " I think I understand the whole <lb/>
            matter, 0 king : the magi are the persons who have revolted <lb/>
            against you, Patizithes, whom you left steward of the palace, <lb/>
            and his brother Smerdis." 64. When Cambyses heard the <lb/>
            name of Smerdis, the truth of this account and of the dream 3 <lb/>
            struck him ; for he fancied in his sleep that some one an­ <lb/>
            nounced to him that Smerdis, seated on the royal throne, <lb/>
            touched the heavens with his head. Perceiving, therefore, <lb/>
            that he had destroyed his brother without a cause, he wept <lb/>
            for Smerdis ; and after he had lamented him, and bitterly de­ <lb/>
            plored the whole calamity, he leapt upon his horse, resolving <lb/>
            with all speed to march to Susa against the magus. But <lb/>
            as he was leaping on his horse, the chape of his sword's <lb/>
            scabbard fell off, and the blade, being laid bare, struck the <unclear/><note type="footnote">3 See chap. 30</note> <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="margin">[65. </note> <lb/>
            thigh ; being wounded in that part where he himself had for­ <lb/>
            merly smitten the Egyptian god Apis Cambyses, when lie <lb/>
            thought that he was mortally wounded, asked what was the <lb/>
            name of the city. They said it was Ecbatana. And it had <lb/>
            been before prophesied to him from the city of Buto, that lie <lb/>
            should end his life in Ecbatana. He therefore imagined he <lb/>
            should die an old man in Ecbatana of Media, where all his <lb/>
            treasures were ; but the oracle in truth meant, in Ecbatana of <lb/>
            Syria. When he had thus been informed, on inquiry, of the <lb/>
            name of the city, though smitten by his misfortune, as well <lb/>
            that proceeding from the magus as from the wound, he re­ <lb/>
            turned to his right mind; and comprehending the oracle, said, <lb/>
            " Here it is fated that Cambyses, son of Cyrus, should die."</p>
          <p>65. So much he said at that time ; but about twenty days <lb/>
            after, having summoned the principal men of the Persians <lb/>
            who were with him, he addressed them as follows : "I am <lb/>
            constrained to disclose to you a matter, which above all others <lb/>
            I desired to conceal. When I was in Egypt I saw a vision in <lb/>
            my sleep, which I wish I had never seen. I thought that a <lb/>
            messenger arrived from my palace and announced to me that <lb/>
            Smerdis, seated on the royal throne, touched the heavens with <lb/>
            his head. Fearing lest I should be deprived of my kingdom <lb/>
            by my brother, I acted with more precipitation than wisdom ; <lb/>
            for in truth it belongs not to human nature to avert what is <lb/>
            destined to happen. But I foolishly sent Prexaspes to Susa <lb/>
            to put Smerdis to death : since that crime was perpetrated I <lb/>
            have lived in security, never considering whether, now <lb/>
            that Smerdis was removed, some other mortal might not rise <lb/>
            up against me. But utterly mistaking what was about to <lb/>
            happen, I became a fratricide to no purpose, and am never­ <lb/>
            theless deprived of my kingdom. For Smerdis the magus <lb/>
            was the person whom the deity forewarned me in the vision <lb/>
            would rise up against me. The deed, then, has been perpe­ <lb/>
            trated by me; consider, therefore, that Smerdis, son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, is no more ; but the magi have possessed them­ <lb/>
            selves of the throne, he whom I left steward of my palace <lb/>
            and his brother Smerdis. Now, he, who of right should have <lb/>
            revenged the indignity I suffer from the magi, has perished <lb/>
            impiously by the hand of his nearest relation. Since, therefore, <lb/>
            he is no more, in the next place, of the other injunctions that <lb/>
            I have to lay upon you, 0 Persians, the most necessary is, to <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" 66-68.]"/> <lb/>
            let you Know what - would have you do after my death. I <lb/>
            therefore, in the name of the gods who protect the throne; <lb/>
            charge you, and all of you, especially those of the Achæmeni­ <lb/>
            de who are present, never to permit the government to re­ <lb/>
            turn into the hands of the Medes : and if they have possessed <lb/>
            themselves of it by craft, by craft be it recovered by you ; or <lb/>
            if they accomplish it by force, by force to the utmost win it <lb/>
            back again. And if you do thus, may the earth bring forth her <lb/>
            increase; may your wives and your flocks be fruitful, and you <lb/>
            remain for ever free. But if you do not win back, nor attempt <lb/>
            to win back the sovereign power, I imprecate upon you the con­ <lb/>
            trary of all these things: and moreover, may such an end befal. <lb/>
            every Persian as has befallen me." When Cambyses had spoken <lb/>
            thus, he deplored his whole fortunes. 66. The Persians, when <lb/>
            they .saw their king weep, all rent the garments they had on, and <lb/>
            gave themselves to abundant lamentation. But afterwards, <lb/>
            when the bone became infected and- the thigh mortified, it car­ <lb/>
            ried off Cambyses, son of Cyrus, after he had reigned in all <lb/>
            seven years and five months, having never had any children,, <lb/>
            either male or female. Great incredulity stole over the Persians <lb/>
            who were present, as to the story that the magi had possession of <lb/>
            the government; but they thought that Cambyses said what lie <lb/>
            did calumniously, respecting the death of Smerdis, in order <lb/>
            that the whole Persian nation might be made hostile to him. <lb/>
            They therefore believed that Smerdis, son of Cyrus, had risen <lb/>
            up and seized the kingdom : Prexaspes, moreover, vehement­ <lb/>
            ly denied that he had killed Smerdis ; for it was not safe for <lb/>
            turn, now that Cambyses was dead, to own that he had killed <lb/>
            the son of Cyrus with his own hand.</p>
          <p>67. Accordingly, the magus, after the death of Cambyses, <lb/>
            relying on his having the same name as Smerdis the son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, reigned securely during the seven months that remain­ <lb/>
            ed to complete the eighth year of Cambyses; in which time <lb/>
            lie treated all his subjects with such beneficence, that at his <lb/>
            death, all the people of Asia, except the Persians, regretted <lb/>
            his! loss. For the magus, having despatched messengers to <lb/>
            every nation he ruled over, proclaimed a general exemption <lb/>
            from military service and tribute for the space of three years : <lb/>
            and he made this proclamation immediately on assuming the <lb/>
            sovereignty. 68 But in the eighth month he was discovered <unclear/> <pb n="200"/>
             <note type="margin">[69. </note> <lb/>
            in the following manner. Otanes, son of Pharnaspes, was <lb/>
            by birth and fortune equal to the first of the Persians. <lb/>
            This Otanes first suspected the magus not to be Smerdis <lb/>
            the son of Cyrus, but the person who he really was; <lb/>
            forming his conjecture from this circumstance, that he never <lb/>
            went out of the citadel, and that he never summoned any of <lb/>
            the principal men of Persia to his presence. Having con­ <lb/>
            ceived suspicion of him, he contrived the following artifice. <lb/>
            Cambyses had married his daughter, whose name was Phæ­ <lb/>
            dyma; the magus therefore had her as his wife, and cohabited <lb/>
            with her, as well as with all the rest of the wives of Cam­ <lb/>
            byses.. Otanes therefore, sending to this daughter, inquired <lb/>
            with what man she lay, whether with Smerdis son of Cyrus, <lb/>
            or some other person : she sent back word to him, saying, that <lb/>
            she did not know, for that she had never seen Smerdis son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, nor knew who it was that cohabited with her. Otanes <lb/>
            sent a second time, saying, " If you do not yourself know <lb/>
            Smerdis son of Cyrus, then inquire of Atossa who this <lb/>
            man is, with whom she as well as you cohabits, for she must <lb/>
            of necessity know her own brother." To this his daughter <lb/>
            replied, " I can neither have any conversation with Atossa, <lb/>
            nor see any of the women who used to live with me; for as <lb/>
            soon as this man, whoever he is, succeeded to the throne, he <lb/>
            dispersed us all, assigning us separate apartments." 69. When <lb/>
            Otanes heard this, the matter appeared much more plain; <lb/>
            and he sent a third message to her in these words: " Daughter, <lb/>
            it becomes you, being of noble birth, to undertake any peril <lb/>
            that your father may require you to incur. For if this <lb/>
            Smerdis is not the son of Cyrus, but the person whom I sus­ <lb/>
            pect, it is not fit that he, lying with you and possessing the <lb/>
            empire of the Persians, should escape with impunity, but suf­ <lb/>
            fer the punishment due to his offences. Now therefore <lb/>
            follow my directions : when he sleeps with you, and you know <lb/>
            him to be sound asleep, touch his ears ; and if you find he has <lb/>
            ears, be assured that you cohabit with Smerdis son of Cyrus ; <lb/>
            but if he has none, with Smerdis the magus." To this <lb/>
            message Phædyma answered, saying, " that she should incur <lb/>
            very great danger by doing so ; for if he had no ears, and she <lb/>
            should be discovered touching him, she well knew that be <lb/>
            would put her to death nevertheless she would make the <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> 70, 71.] </note> <unclear/><lb/>
            ttempt." She accordingly promised to accomplish this for <lb/>
            ler father. Now Cyrus, son of Cambyses, during his reign, <lb/>
            lad cut off the ears of this Smerdis, the magus, for some grave <lb/>
            iffence. This Phædyma, daughter of Otanes, therefore, de­ <lb/>
            ermining to execute all that she had promised her father, <lb/>
            when her turn came to approach the magus, (for in Persia the <lb/>
            rives visit their husbands in regular succession,) went and <lb/>
            lept with him : and when the magus was sound asleep, she <lb/>
            elt for his ears, and perceiving without any difficulty that the <lb/>
            nan had no ears, as soon as it was day, she sent and made <lb/>
            known to her father what the case was.</p>
          <p>70. Thereupon Otanes, having taken with him Aspa­ <lb/>
            hines and Gobryas, who were the noblest of the Persians, and <lb/>
            arsons on whom he could best rely, related to them the whole <lb/>
            ffair: they too had themselves suspected that the case was <lb/>
            o; and when Otanes had adduced his reasons, they admitted <lb/>
            heir force; and they agreed that each should associate with <lb/>
            himself a Persian in whom he could place most reliance <lb/>
            )tanes accordingly introduced Intaphernes; Gobryas, Mega­ <lb/>
            yzus; and Aspathines, Hydarnes. These six being associ­ <lb/>
            ted, Darius son of Hystaspes arrived at Susa from Persia, <lb/>
            where his father was governor. When therefore he arrived, <lb/>
            he six Persians determined to admit Darius to the confederacy. <lb/>
            1. These seven having met, exchanged pledges with each <lb/>
            ther and conferred together. When it came to the turn of <lb/>
            arius to declare his opinion, he addressed them as follows: <lb/>
            I thought that I was the only person who knew that it was <lb/>
            he magus who reigns, and that Smerdis son of Cyrus is dead ; <lb/>
            nd for this very reason I hastened hither in order to contrive <lb/>
            he death of the magus. But since it proves that you also are <lb/>
            cquainted with the fact, and not I only, it appears to me that <lb/>
            re should act immediately, and not put it off; for that would <lb/>
            e of no advantage." Otanes said to this, " Son of Hystas­ <lb/>
            pes, you are born of a noble father, and show yourself not at <lb/>
            11 inferior to him; do not however so inconsiderately hasten <lb/>
            his enterprise, but set about it with more caution : for we <lb/>
            nust increase our numbers, and then attempt it." Darius re­ <lb/>
            lied to this, "Be assured, ye men who are here present, if <lb/>
            ou adopt the plan proposed by Otanes, you will all miserably <lb/>
            erish: for some one will discover it to the magus, consulting <unclear/> <pb n="202"/>
             <note type="margin">[72, 73 <lb/>
            </note>his own private advantage : and indeed you ought to have <lb/>
            carried out your project immediately, without communicating <lb/>
            it to any one else;4 but since you have thought fit to refer it <lb/>
            to others, and ye have disclosed it to me, let us carry it out <lb/>
            this very day, or be assured, that if this day passes over, no <lb/>
            one shall be beforehand with me and become my accuser, but <lb/>
            I myself will denounce you to the magus." 72. Otanes, see­ <lb/>
            ing Darius so eager, replied, " Since you compel us to pre­ <lb/>
            cipitate our enterprise, and will not permit us to defer it, <lb/>
            come, do you tell us in what way we are to enter the palace <lb/>
            and attack them ; for you yourself know, if not having seen <lb/>
            them, yet surely by report, that guards are stationed at inter­ <lb/>
            vals ; and how shall we pass them?" Darius answered <lb/>
            Otanes, " There are many things that cannot be made clear by <lb/>
            words, but may by action : and there are other things that <lb/>
            seem practicable in description, but no signal effect proceeds <lb/>
            from them. Be assured that the guards stationed there will not <lb/>
            be at all difficult to pass by : for in the. first place, seeing out­ <lb/>
            rank, there is no one who will not allow us to pass, partly <lb/>
            from respect, and partly from fear ; and in the next place, I <lb/>
            have a most specious pretext by which we shall gain admis­ <lb/>
            sion, for I will say that I am just arrived from Persia, and <lb/>
            wish to report a message to the king from my father. For <lb/>
            when a lie must be told, let it be told : for we all aim at the <lb/>
            same ends, both they who tell lies, and they who keep to the <lb/>
            truth. Some tell lies when, by persuading with falsehoods, <lb/>
            they are likely to gain some advantage ; whilst others speak the <lb/>
            truth, in order that, by the truth, they may acquire some ad­ <lb/>
            vantage, and something further may be intrusted to them: thus <lb/>
            by different processes we aim at the same end. But if nothing <lb/>
            were likely to be gained, as well he who speaks truth would lie, <lb/>
            and he who lies would speak truth. Whoever of the doorkeep­ <lb/>
            ers, therefore, shall willingly let us pass, shall be rewarded in <lb/>
            due time; but whoever offers to oppose us must instantly be <lb/>
            treated as an enemy; and when we have forced our passage, we <lb/>
            must accomplish our work." 73. After this Gobryas said : <lb/>
            " Friends, shall we ever have a better opportunity to recover <lb/>
            the sovereign power, or if we shall be unable to do so, to die ? <note type="footnote">4 More literally, "deliberating upon it by yourselves," or " having <lb/>
            kept your own counsel." </note> <pb n="203"/>
             <note type="margin"><unclear/>[74, 75.] </note> <lb/>
            seeing we who are Persians, are governed by a Medic magus, <lb/>
            and one without ears. Those among you who were present <lb/>
            with Cambyses when he lay sick, well remember the impreca­ <lb/>
            ions he uttered at the point of death against the Persians, it <lb/>
            they should not attempt to repossess themselves of the sove­ <lb/>
            reign power : we did not then believe his story, but thought <lb/>
            that Cambyses spoke from ill-will. I therefore give my voice <lb/>
            that we yield to Darius, and that on breaking up this confer­ <lb/>
            ence we go no where else than direct to the magus." Thus <lb/>
            spoke Gobryas, and all assented to his proposal.</p>
          <p>74. Whilst they were deliberating on these things, the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing events happened to take place. The magi, on consult­ <lb/>
            ition, determined to make Prexaspes their friend; both be­ <lb/>
            cause he had suffered grievous wrong from Cambyses, who <lb/>
            shot his son dead with an arrow; and because he alone of all <lb/>
            the Persians knew of the death of Smerdis, son of Cyrus, <lb/>
            having despatched him with his own hand; and moreover, be­ <lb/>
            cause Prexaspes was in high repute with the Persians. For <lb/>
            these reasons, therefore, having sent for Prexaspes, they en­ <lb/>
            leavoured to win his friendship, binding him by pledges and <lb/>
            aths, that he would keep to himself, and never divulge to any <lb/>
            man, the cheat they had put upon the Persians, assuring him <lb/>
            that they would give him every thing in abundance. When <lb/>
            Prexaspes had promised that he would do as the magi per­ <lb/>
            suaded him, they made a second proposal, saying, that they <lb/>
            would assemble all the Persians under the walls of the palace, <lb/>
            and desired that he would ascend a tower, and harangue them, <lb/>
            assuring them that they were governed by Smerdis son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, and by no one else. This they enjoined him, as being <lb/>
            it man most trusted by the Persians, and as having frequently <lb/>
            affirmed his belief, that Smerdis son of Cyrus was still living, <lb/>
            and having utterly denied his murder. 75. When Prexaspes <lb/>
            said that he was ready to do that also, the magi, having <lb/>
            convoked the Persians, placed him on the top of a turret, <lb/>
            ind commanded him to harangue the people. But he pur­ <lb/>
            posely forgot what they desired him to say, and, beginning <lb/>
            from Achæmenes, described the genealogy of Cyrus's family ; <lb/>
            and afterwards, when he came down to him, he ended by tell­ <lb/>
            ing them what great benefits Cyrus had done the Persians : <lb/>
            and having gone through these, he declared the whole truth, <lb/>
            saying, that he had before concealed it, as it was not safe for <pb n="204"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[76-78"/> <lb/>
            him to tell what had happened; but that in the present <lb/>
            emergency, necessity constrained him to make it known. He <lb/>
            accordingly told them that he, being compelled by Cambyses: <lb/>
            had put Smerdis, son of Cyrus, to death, and that the magi <lb/>
            then reigned. After he had uttered many imprecations against <lb/>
            the Persians, if they should not recover back the sovereign <lb/>
            power, and punish the magi, he threw himself headlong from <lb/>
            the tower. Thus died Prexaspes, a man highly esteemed <lb/>
            during the course of his whole life.</p>
          <p>76. The seven Persians, having resolved to attack the magi <lb/>
            without delay, set out after they had offered prayers to the <lb/>
            gods ; and while they were in the midst of their way they were <lb/>
            informed of all that had occurred with respect to Prexaspes ; <lb/>
            whereupon, standing aside out of the way, they again con­ <lb/>
            ferred together; and some with Otanes strongly advised to <lb/>
            defer the enterprise, and not to attempt it while affairs were <lb/>
            in such a ferment; but others, with Darius, urged to proceed <lb/>
            at once, and to do what had been determined on, and on no ac­ <lb/>
            count to defer it. While they were hotly disputing there ap­ <lb/>
            peared seven pairs of hawks pursuing two pairs of vultures, and <lb/>
            plucking and tearing them. The seven, on seeing this, all ap­ <lb/>
            proved the opinion of Darius, and forthwith proceeded to the <lb/>
            palace, emboldened by the omen. 77. When they approached the <lb/>
            gates, it happened as Darius had supposed: for the guards, out <lb/>
            of respect for men of highest rank among the Persians, and not <lb/>
            suspecting any such design on their part, let them pass by, <lb/>
            moved as they were by divine impulse; nor did any one ques­ <lb/>
            tion them. But when they reached the hall, they fell in with <lb/>
            the eunuchs appointed to carry in messages, who inquired of <lb/>
            them for what purpose they had come; and at the same time <lb/>
            that they questioned them they threatened the doorkeepers <lb/>
            for permitting them to pass, and endeavoured to prevent the <lb/>
            seven from proceeding any farther. But they, having ex­ <lb/>
            horted each other, and drawn their daggers, stabbed all that <lb/>
            opposed their passage on the spot, and then rushed to the <lb/>
            men's apartment. 78. The magi happened to be both within <lb/>
            at the time, and were consulting about the conduct of Prex­ <lb/>
            aspes. When, therefore, they saw the eunuchs in confusion, <lb/>
            and heard their outcry, they both hurried out, and when they <lb/>
            perceived what was going on, put themselves on the defensive. <lb/>
            One of them accordingly snatched up a bow and the other <pb n="205"/>
             <note type="margin"><unclear/>[79, 80.] </note> <lb/>
            had recourse to a javelin, and thereupon the parties engaged <lb/>
            with each other. The one who had taken up the bow, seeing <lb/>
            his enemies were near and pressing upon them, found it of no <lb/>
            use; but the other made resistance with his spear, and first <lb/>
            wounded Aspathines in the thigh, and next Intaphernes in the <lb/>
            eye; and Intaphernes lost his eye from the wound, but did not <lb/>
            die. Thus one of the magi wounded those two; but the other, <lb/>
            when he found his bow of no service, fled to a chamber ad­ <lb/>
            joining the men's apartment, purposing to shut to the door, <lb/>
            and two of the seven, Darius and Gobryas, rushed in with <lb/>
            him; and as Gobryas was grappling with the magus, Darius <lb/>
            standing by was in perplexity, fearing lest he should strike <lb/>
            Gobryas in the dark; but Gobryas, seeing that he stood by <lb/>
            inactive, asked him why he did not use his hand ; he answered, <lb/>
            " Fearing for you, lest I should strike you." But Gobryas <lb/>
            replied, " Drive your sword even through both of us." Da­ <lb/>
            rius obeying, made a thrust with his dagger, and by good for­ <lb/>
            tune hit the magus.</p>
          <p>79. Having slain the magi, and cut off their heads, they <lb/>
            left the wounded of their own party there, as well on account <lb/>
            of their exhaustion as to guard the acropolis ; but the other <lb/>
            five of them, carrying the heads of the magi, ran out with <lb/>
            shouting and clamour, and then called upon the rest of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, relating what they had done, and showing them the heads ; <lb/>
            and at the same time they slew every one of the magi that <lb/>
            came in their way. The Persians, informed of what had been <lb/>
            done by the seven, and of the fraud of the magi, determined <lb/>
            themselves also to do the like ; and having drawn their dag­ <lb/>
            gers, they slew every magus they could find; and if night <lb/>
            coming on had not prevented, they would not have left a <lb/>
            single magus alive. This day the Persians observe in COIn­ <lb/>
            mon more than any other, and in it they celebrate a great <lb/>
            festival, which they call The slaughter of the magi." On <lb/>
            that day no magus is allowed to be seen in public, but they <lb/>
            shut themselves up in their own houses during the whole of <lb/>
            thatday.</p>
          <p>80. When the tumult had subsided, and five days had <lb/>
            elapsed, those who had risen up against the magi deliberated on <lb/>
            thestate of affairs ; and speeches were made that are disbelieved <lb/>
            bysome of the Greeks, however they were made. Otanes <unclear/> <lb/>
            advisedthat they should commit the government to the Per- <pb n="206"/>
             <note type="margin">[81, </note> <lb/>
            sians at large,. speaking as follows: "It appoars that to one <lb/>
            of us should henceforward be a monarch, for it is neither agree­ <lb/>
            able nor good. For you know to what a pitch the insolence <lb/>
            of Cambyses reached, and you have experienced the insolence <lb/>
            of the magus. And indeed how can a monarchy be a well­ <lb/>
            constituted government, where one man is allowed to do what­ <lb/>
            ever he pleases without control ? for if even the best of men <lb/>
            were placed in such power, he would depart from his wonted <lb/>
            thoughts. For insolence is engendered in him by the advan­ <lb/>
            tages that surround him, and envy is implanted in man from <lb/>
            his birth, and having these two, he has every vice ; for puffed <lb/>
            up by insolence he commits many nefarious actions, and others <lb/>
            through envy. One would think that a man who holds sove­ <lb/>
            reign power should be free from envy, since he possesses <lb/>
            every advantage; but the contrary to this takes place in his con­ <lb/>
            duct towards the citizens, for he-envies-the best who continue <lb/>
            to live, and delights in the worst men of the nation ; he very <lb/>
            readily listens to calumny, and is the most inconsistent of all <lb/>
            men ; for if you show him respect in moderation he is offended <lb/>
            because he is not sufficiently honoured ; and if any one honours <lb/>
            him very much he is offended as with a flatterer. But I pro­ <lb/>
            ceel to relate what is most important. He changes the insti­ <lb/>
            tutions of our ancestors, violates women, and puts men to death <lb/>
            without trial. But a popular government bears the fairest name <lb/>
            of all, equality of rights ; and secondly, is guilty of none of those <lb/>
            excesses that a monarch is. Themagistrate obtains his office <lb/>
            by lot, and exercises it under responsibility, and refers all plans <lb/>
            to the public. I therefore give my opinion, that we should do <lb/>
            away with monarchy, and exalt the people, for in the many <lb/>
            all things are found." Otanesaccordingly advanced this <lb/>
            opinion. 81. Megabyzus advisedthem to intrust the govern­ <lb/>
            ment to an oligarchy, and spoke as follows: "I concur with <lb/>
            what Otanes has said about abolishing tyranny; but in bid­ <lb/>
            ding us transfer the power to the people, he has erred from <lb/>
            the best opinion ; for nothing is more foolish and insolent than! <lb/>
            a useless crowd, therefore it is on no account to be endured, <lb/>
            that men, who are endeavouring to avoid the insolence of a <unclear/> <lb/>
            tyrant, should fall under the insolence of an unrestrained mul­ <lb/>
            titude. The former, when he does any thing, does it know. <lb/>
            ingly, but the latter have not the means of knowing, for hows <lb/>
            should they know who have neither been taught, nor are ac-&gt; <unclear/> <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"><unclear/> [82, 83.] </note> <lb/>
            quainted with any thing good or fitting; they who, rushing <lb/>
            on without reflection, precipitate affairs like a winter tor. <lb/>
            rent. Let those, then, who desire the ruin of the Persians <lb/>
            adopt a democracy; but let us, having chosen an association <lb/>
            of the best men, commit the sovereign power to them, for <lb/>
            among them we ourselves shall be included, and it is reason­ <lb/>
            able to expect that the best counsels will proceed from the best <lb/>
            men." Megabyzus accordingly advanced this opinion. 82. <lb/>
            Darius expressed his opinion the third, saying: "In what <lb/>
            Megabyzus has said concerning the people, he appears to me <lb/>
            to have spoken rightly; but concerning an oligarchy, not so. <lb/>
            For if three forms are proposed, and each of these which I al­ <lb/>
            lude to the best in its kind, the best democracy, and oligarchy, <lb/>
            and monarchy, I affirm that the last is far superior. For <lb/>
            nothing can be found better than one man, who is the best; <lb/>
            since acting upon equally wise plans, he would govern the <lb/>
            people without blame, and would keep his designs most secret <lb/>
            from the ill-affected. But in an oligarchy, whilst many are ex­ <lb/>
            erting their energies for the public good, strong private enmi­ <lb/>
            ties commonly spring up; for each-wishing to be chief, and to <lb/>
            carry his own opinions, they come to deep animosities one <lb/>
            against another, from whence seditions arise ; and from sedi­ <lb/>
            tions, murder ; and from murder it results in monarchy: and <lb/>
            thus it is proved how much this form of government is the <lb/>
            best. But when the people rule, it is impossible but that evil <lb/>
            should spring up ; when, therefore, evil springs up, mutual <lb/>
            enmities do not arise among the bad, but powerful combina­ <lb/>
            tions, for they who injure the commonwealth act in concert; <lb/>
            and this lasts until some one of the people stands forward and <lb/>
            puts them down ; and on this account he is admired by the <lb/>
            people, and being admired, he becomes a monarch ; and in <lb/>
            this he too shows that a monarchy is best. But to com­ <lb/>
            prehend all in one word, whence came our freedom ? and <lb/>
            who gave it ? was it from the people, or an oligarchy, or <lb/>
            a monarch ? My opinion therefore is, that as we were made <lb/>
            free by one man, we should maintain the same kind of go­ <lb/>
            vernment ; and moreover, that we should not subvert the <lb/>
            institutions of our ancestors, seeing they are good; for that <lb/>
            were not well."</p>
          <p>83. These three opinions were proposed , and four of the seven <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin"> [84, </note> <lb/>
            adhered to the last. When the opinion of Otancs, who was a<unclear/>. <lb/>
            ious to introduce equality among the Persians, was overruled, <lb/>
            thus spoke in the midst of them : "Associates, since it is evid e <lb/>
            that some one of us must be made king, either appointed <lb/>
            lot, or by the body of the Persians, intrusting the government <lb/>
            to whom they may choose, or by some other way ; now I <lb/>
            not enter into competition with you ; for I wish neither ., <lb/>
            govern nor be governed. But on this condition I give up al <lb/>
            claim to the government, that neither I nor any of my pos <lb/>
            terity may be subject to any one of you." When he had salt <lb/>
            this, and the six had agreed to these terms, he did not join ir <lb/>
            the contest, but withdrew from the assembly; and this famil) <lb/>
            alone, of all the Persians, retains its liberty to this day, anc <lb/>
            yields obedience only so far as it pleases, but without trans­ <lb/>
            gressing the laws of the Persians. 84. The rest of the sever <lb/>
            consulted how they might appoint a king on the most equit­ <lb/>
            able terms ; and they determined that to Otanes and his pos­ <lb/>
            terity for ever, if the kingdom should devolve on any othei <lb/>
            of the seven, should be given a Median vest yearly, by way <lb/>
            of distinction, together with all such presents as are account­ <lb/>
            ed most honourable among the Persians. They decreed thai <lb/>
            these things should be given him for this reason, because he <lb/>
            first advised the enterprise, and associated them together. <lb/>
            These honours were conferred on Otanes by way of distinc­ <lb/>
            tion. And they made the following resolutions with regard <lb/>
            to the whole body: that every one of the seven should have <lb/>
            liberty to enter into the palace without being introduced, un­ <lb/>
            less the king should happen to be in bed with one of his <lb/>
            wives ; and that the king should not be allowed to marry <lb/>
            a wife out of any other family than of the conspirators. <lb/>
            With regard to the kingdom, they came to the following de­ <lb/>
            termination, that he whose horse should first neigh in the <lb/>
            suburbs at sunrise, while they were mounted, should have <lb/>
            the kingdom.</p>
          <p>85. Darius had a groom, a shrewd man, whose name vas <lb/>
            CEbares; to this person, when the assembly had broken up, <lb/>
            Darius spoke as follows: "CEbares, we have determined with <lb/>
            respect to the kingdom to do in this manner ; he whose horse <lb/>
            shall neigh first at sunrise, when we ourselves are mounted, <lb/>
            is to have the kingdom, Now therefore. if you have any <pb n="209"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="6—88."/>agenuity, contrive that I may obtain this honour, and not <lb/>
            nother." (Ebares answered, "If, sir, it indeed depends on <lb/>
            his, whether you shall be king or not, be confident on this <lb/>
            point, and keep up your spirits ; for no one else shall be king <lb/>
            iefore you ; I have a charm for the occasion." Darius said, <lb/>
            If you have any such contrivance, it is time to put it in <lb/>
            iractice, and not to delay ; for to-morrow our trial is to be." <lb/>
            Ebares having heard this, did as follows : as soon as it was <lb/>
            night, he led the mare which Darius's horse was most fond <lb/>
            of, to the suburbs, tied her up, and led Darius's horse to her ; <lb/>
            and he led him several times round near the mare, gradually <lb/>
            ringing him nearer, and at last let the horse cover her. 86. <lb/>
            At dawn of day, the six, as they had agreed, met together <lb/>
            in horseback; and as they were riding round the suburbs, <lb/>
            when they came to the spot where the mare had been tied the <lb/>
            receding night, Darius's horse ran forward and neighed ; <lb/>
            and as the horse did this, lightning and thunder came from a <lb/>
            :lear sky. These things happening to Darius, consummated <lb/>
            he auspices, as if done by appointment. The others, dis­ <lb/>
            counting from their horses, did obeisance to Darius as king. <lb/>
            17. Some say that (Ebares had recourse to the foregoing <lb/>
            rtifice ; others, to the following; (for the story is told both <lb/>
            vays by the Persians ;) that having rubbed his hand upon the <lb/>
            genital part of the mare, he kept it concealed under his <lb/>
            rowsers, and at sun-rise, when the horses were about to <lb/>
            start, Œbares drew out his hand and put it to the nostrils of <lb/>
            Darius's horse, and that he, taking the scent, began to snort <lb/>
            md neigh.</p>
          <p>88. Accordingly Darius, son of Hystaspes, was declared <lb/>
            king, and all the people of Asia, except the Arabians, were <lb/>
            subject to him, Cyrus having first subdued them, and after­ <lb/>
            yards Cambyses. The Arabians never submitted to the <lb/>
            Persian yoke, but were on friendly terms, and gave Cam­ <lb/>
            &gt;yses a free passage into Egypt; for without the consent of <lb/>
            he Arabians the Persians could not have penetrated into <lb/>
            Egypt. Darius contracted his first marriages with Per­ <lb/>
            ians ; he married two daughters of Cyrus, Atossa and Arty­ <lb/>
            tona : Atossa had been before married to her brother Cam­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            oyses, and afterwards to the magus, but Artystona was a <lb/>
            irgin. He married another also, daughter of Smerdis, son <lb/>
            if Cyrus, whose name was Parmys ; and he had besides the <note type="footnote">p </note> <pb n="210"/>
             <note type="margin">[89, 90. </note> <lb/>
            daughter of Otanes who detected the magus. His power was <lb/>
            fully established on all sides. Having then first of all made a <lb/>
            stone statue, he had it erected ; and a figure was upon it re­ <lb/>
            presenting a man on horseback; and he had engraved on it <lb/>
            the following inscription, DARIUS, SON OF HYSTASPES, BY THE <lb/>
            SAGACITY OF HIS HORSE, (here mentioning the name,) AND BY <lb/>
            THE ADDRESS OF ŒBARES, HIS GROOM, OBTAINED THE EM­ <lb/>
            PIRE OF THE PERSIANS. 89. Having done this in Persia, he <lb/>
            constituted twenty governments, which they call satrapies ; <lb/>
            and having constituted the governments and set governors <lb/>
            over them, he appointed tributes to be paid to him from each <lb/>
            nation, both connecting the adjoining people with the several <lb/>
            nations, and omitting some neighbouring people, he annexed <lb/>
            to some others that were more remote. He distributed the <lb/>
            governments, and the annual payment of tribute, in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner. Such of them as contributed silver, were <lb/>
            required to pay it according to the standard of the Baby­ <lb/>
            lonian talent; and such as contributed gold, according to <lb/>
            the Euboic talent. The Babylonian talent is equal to seventy <lb/>
            Euboic minae. During the reign of Cyrus, and afterwards of <lb/>
            Cambyses, there was no fixed regulation with regard to tri­ <lb/>
            bute, but they brought in presents. In consequence of this <lb/>
            imposition of tribute, and other things of a similar kind, the <lb/>
            Persians say Darius was a trader, Cambyses a master, and <lb/>
            Cyrus a father. The first, because he made profit of every <lb/>
            thing ; the second, because he was severe and arrogant; the <lb/>
            latter, because he was mild, and always aimed at the good of <lb/>
            his people. 90. From the Ionians, the Magnesians in Asia,5 <lb/>
            the Æolians, Carians, Lycians, Milyens, and Pamphylians, for <lb/>
            one and the same tribute was imposed on them all, there <lb/>
            came in a revenue of four hundred talents in silver ; this <lb/>
            then composed the first division. From the Mysians, Lydians, <lb/>
            Lasonians, Cabalians, and Hygennians, five hundred talents ; <lb/>
            this was the second division. From the Hellespontians, who <lb/>
            dwell on the right as one sails in, the Phrygians, the Thira. <lb/>
            cians in Asia, Paphlagonians, Mariandynians, and Syrians, <lb/>
            there was a tribute of three hundred and sixty talents ; this <lb/>
            was the third division. From the Cilicians, three hundred <lb/>
            and sixty white horses, one for every day, and five hundred <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> There were also Magnesians in Thessaly See Book VII ch. 183 </note> <pb n="211"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-93.]"/> <lb/>
            alents of silver; of these a hundred and forty were ex­ <lb/>
            pended on the cavalry that guarded the Cilician territory, and <lb/>
            he remaining three hundred and sixty went to Darius ; this <lb/>
            vas the fourth division. 91. From the city of Poseideium, <lb/>
            vhich Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus, founded on the con­ <lb/>
            ines of the Cilicians and Syrians, beginning from this down <lb/>
            to Egypt, except a district belonging to Arabians, which <lb/>
            vas exempt from taxation, was paid a tribute of three hun- <lb/>
            Ired and fifty talents ; and in this division is included all <lb/>
            Phœnicia, Syria which is called Palestine, and Cyprus; this <lb/>
            was the fifth division. From Egypt, and the Libyans bor­ <lb/>
            lering on Egypt, and from Cyrene and Barce, (for these were <lb/>
            annexed to the Egyptian division,) accrued seven hundred <lb/>
            talents, besides the revenue arising from lake Mœris, which <lb/>
            was derived from the fish : in addition, then, to this money, <lb/>
            and the fixed supply of corn, there accrued seven hundred ta­ <lb/>
            lenta ; for they furnish in addition 120,000 measures of corn <lb/>
            for the Persians who occupy the white fortress at Memphis, <lb/>
            md their allies : this was the sixth division.. The Sattagy­ <lb/>
            dæ, Gandarians, Dadicæ, and Aparytæ, joined together, con­ <lb/>
            tributed one hundred and seventy talents ; this was the seventh <lb/>
            division. From Susa, and the rest of the country of the Cis­ <lb/>
            sians, three hundred talents ; this was the eighth division. <lb/>
            92. From Babylon and the rest of Assyria, there accrued to <lb/>
            him a thousand talents of silver, and five hundred young <lb/>
            eunuchs; this was the ninth division. From Ecbatana and <lb/>
            the rest of Media, and the Paricanians and Orthocorybantes, <lb/>
            four hundred and fifty talents ; this was the tenth division. <lb/>
            The Caspians, Pausicæ, Pantimathians, and Daritæ, contri­ <lb/>
            buting together, paid two hundred talents ; this was the ele­ <lb/>
            venth division. From the Bactrians as far as the Æglæ, was <lb/>
            a tribute of three hundred and sixty talents; this was the <lb/>
            welfth division. 93. From Pactyica, and the Armenians, <lb/>
            and the neighbouring people as far as the Euxine Sea, four <lb/>
            hundred talents; this was the thirteenth division. From the <lb/>
            Sagartians, Sarangeans, Thamanaeans, Utians, Mycians, and <lb/>
            those who inhabit the islands on the Red Sea, in which the <lb/>
            king settles transported convicts; from all these came a tribute <lb/>
            of six hundred talents; this was the fourteenth division. The <lb/>
            Sacæ and Caspians paid two hundred and fifty talents; this <lb/>
            was the fifteenth division. The Parthians, Chorasmians, <note type="footnote"> P 2</note><pb n="212"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="94—97"/> <lb/>
            Sogdians, and Arians, three hundred talents; this was the <lb/>
            sixteenth division. 94. The Paricanians and Asiatic Ethio­ <lb/>
            plans paid four hundred talents; this was the seventeenth <lb/>
            division. The Matienians, Saspires, and Alarodians, were <lb/>
            taxed at two hundred talents; this was the eighteenth division. <lb/>
            From the Moschians, Tibarenians, Macronians, Mosynoecians, <lb/>
            and Marsians three hundred talents were demanded ; this was <lb/>
            the nineteenth division. Of the Indians the population is by <lb/>
            far the greatest of all nations whom we know of, and they paid <lb/>
            a tribute proportionably larger than all the rest, three hundred <lb/>
            and sixty talents of gold dust; this was the twentieth division. <lb/>
            95. Now the Babylonian standard, compared with the Euboic <lb/>
            talent, makes the total nine thousand five hundred and forty <lb/>
            talents ; and the gold estimated at thirteen times the value of <lb/>
            silver, the gold dust will be found to amount to four thousand six <lb/>
            hundred and eighty Euboic talents. Therefore, if the total of <lb/>
            all these are computed together, fourteen thousand five hun­ <lb/>
            dred and sixty Euboic talents were collected by Darius as an <lb/>
            annual tribute ; and passing over less sums than these, I do <lb/>
            not mention them. 96. This tribute accrued to Darius from <lb/>
            Asia, and a small part of Libya; but in the course of time <lb/>
            another tribute accrued from the islands, and the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Europe as far as Thessaly.. This tribute the king treasures <lb/>
            up in the following manner: having melted it, he pours it into i <lb/>
            earthen jars, and having filled it he takes away the earthen <lb/>
            mould ; and when he wants money he cuts off so much as he <lb/>
            has occasion for from time to time.</p>
          <p>97. These, then, were the governments and the imposts on <lb/>
            each. The Persian territory alone has not been mentioned as <lb/>
            subject to tribute ; for the Persians occupy their land free <lb/>
            from taxes. They indeed were not ordered to pay any tribute, <lb/>
            but brought gifts. The Ethiopians bordering on Egypt, <lb/>
            whom Cambyses subdued when he marched against the Ma­ <lb/>
            crobian Ethiopians, and who dwell about the sacred city of <lb/>
            Nysa, and celebrate festivals of Bacchus,—these Ethiopians, <lb/>
            and their neighbours, use the same grain as the Calantian In­ <lb/>
            dians, and live in subterraneous dwellings ;-both these bring <lb/>
            every third year, and they continued to do so to my time, twos <lb/>
            choonices of unmolten gold, two hundred blocks of ebony, five <lb/>
            Ethiopian boys, and twenty large elephants' tusks. The Col­ <lb/>
            chians numbered themselves among those who gave presents, <pb n="213"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="96—100.]"/> <lb/>
            as well as the neighbouring nations, as far as Mount Caucasus; <lb/>
            for to this mountain the dominions of Persia extend. But <lb/>
            the people to the north side of the Caucasus pay no regard to <lb/>
            the Persians. These, then, for the gifts they imposed on <lb/>
            themselves, furnished, even to my time, every five years one <lb/>
            hundred boys, and one hundred virgins. The Arabians also <lb/>
            furnished every year a thousand talents of frankincense. <lb/>
            These, then, brought to the king the above gifts besides the <lb/>
            tribute.</p>
          <p>98. The Indians obtain the great quantity of gold, from <lb/>
            which they supply the before-mentioned dust to the king, in <lb/>
            the manner presently described. That part of India towards <lb/>
            the rising sun is all sand; for of the people with whom we <lb/>
            are acquainted, and of whom any thing certain is told, the <lb/>
            Indians live the furthest towards the east and the sun-rise of <lb/>
            all the inhabitants of Asia; for the Indians' country towards <lb/>
            the east is a desert, by reason of the sands. There are many <lb/>
            nations of Indians, and they do not speak the same language <lb/>
            as each other; some of them are nomades, and others not. <lb/>
            Some inhabit the marshes of the river, and feed on raw fish, <lb/>
            which they take going out in boats made of reeds; one joint of <lb/>
            the reed makes a boat. These Indians wear a garment made <lb/>
            of rushes, which, when they have cut the reed from the river <lb/>
            and beaten it, they afterwards plait like a mat and wear it as <lb/>
            a corselet. 99. Other Indians, living to the east of these, are <lb/>
            nomades, and <unclear>raw</unclear> flesh ; they are called Padæans. They <lb/>
            are said to use <unclear>the</unclear> following customs. When any one of the <lb/>
            community is sick, whether it be a woman or a man, if it be a <lb/>
            man the men who are his nearest connexions put him to death, <lb/>
            alleging that if he wasted by disease his flesh would be spoilt; <lb/>
            but if he denies that he is sick, they, not agreeing with him, <lb/>
            kill and feast upon him. And if a woman be sick, in like <lb/>
            manner the women who are most intimate with her do the <lb/>
            same as the men. And whoever reaches to old age, they <lb/>
            sacrifice and feast upon; but few among them attain to this <lb/>
            state, for before that, they put to death every one that falls <lb/>
            into any distemper.. 100. Other Indians have the following <lb/>
            different custom; they neither kill any thing that has life, nor <lb/>
            sow any thing, nor are they wont to have houses, but they live <lb/>
            upon herbs, and they have a grain of the size of millet in a <lb/>
            pod, which springs spontaneously from the earth, this they <pb n="214"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[101—104."/> <lb/>
            gather, and boil it and eat it with the pod. When any one of <lb/>
            them falls into any disorder, he goes and lies down in the desert, <lb/>
            and no one takes any thought about him, whether dead or <lb/>
            sick. 101. The intercourse of all these Indians whom I have <lb/>
            mentioned takes place openly as with cattle ; and all have a <lb/>
            complexion closely resembling the Ethiopians. The seed <lb/>
            they emit is not white, as that of other men, but black as <lb/>
            their skin ; the Ethiopians also emit similar seed. These In­ <lb/>
            dians are situated very far from the Persians, towards the <lb/>
            south, and were never subject to Darius.</p>
          <p>102. There are other Indians bordering on the city of Cas­ <lb/>
            patyrus and the country of Pactyica, settled northward of the <lb/>
            other Indians, whose mode of life resembles that of the Bac­ <lb/>
            triana. They are the most warlike of the Indians, and these <lb/>
            are they who are sent to procure the gold ; for near this part is <lb/>
            a desert by reason of the sand. In this desert then, and in the <lb/>
            sand, there are ants in size somewhat less indeed than dogs, <lb/>
            but larger than foxes. Some of them are in the possession of <lb/>
            the king of the Persians, which were taken there. These <lb/>
            ants, forming their habitations under ground, heap up the <lb/>
            sand, as the ants in Greece do, and in the same manner ; and <lb/>
            they are very like them in shape. The sand that is heaped up <lb/>
            is mixed with gold. The Indians therefore go to the desert <lb/>
            to get this sand, each man having three camels, on either side <lb/>
            a male one harnessed to draw by the side, and a female <lb/>
            in the middle, this last the man mounts himself, having <lb/>
            taken care to yoke one that has been separated from her <lb/>
            young as recently born as possible ; for camels are not infe­ <lb/>
            rior to horses in swiftness, and are much better able to carry <lb/>
            burdens. 103. What kind of figure the camel has I shall not <lb/>
            describe to the Greeks, as they are acquainted with it; but; <lb/>
            what is not known respecting it I will mention. A camel <lb/>
            has four thighs and four knees in his hinder legs, and his <lb/>
            private parts are turned between the hinder legs to the tail. <lb/>
            101. The Indians then, adopting such a plan and such a method I <lb/>
            of harnessing, set out for the gold, having before calculated <lb/>
            the time, so as to be engaged in their plunder during the hot­ <lb/>
            test part of the day, for during the heat the ants hide them­ <lb/>
            selves under ground. Amongst these people the sun is <lb/>
            hottest in the morning, and not, as amongst others, at mid-' <lb/>
            day from the time that it has risen some way, to the break - <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="105—107.]"/> <lb/>
            ing up of the market; during this time it scorches much­ <lb/>
            more than at mid-day in Greece ; so that, it is said, they then <lb/>
            refresh themselves in water. Mid-day scorches other men <lb/>
            much the same as the Indians ; but as the day declines, the <lb/>
            sun becomes to them as it is in the morning to others ; and <lb/>
            after this, as it proceeds it becomes still colder, until sun-set, <lb/>
            then it is very cold. 105. When the Indians arrive at the <lb/>
            spot, having sacks with them, they fill these with the sand, <lb/>
            and return with all possible expedition. For the ants, as the <lb/>
            Persians say, immediately discovering them by the smell, <lb/>
            pursue them, and they are equalled in swiftness by no other <lb/>
            animal, so that if the Indians did not get the start of them <lb/>
            while the ants were assembling, not a man of them could be <lb/>
            saved. Now the male camels (for they are inferior in speed <lb/>
            to the females) slacken their pace, dragging on,6 not both <lb/>
            equally; but the females, mindful 'of the young they have <lb/>
            left, do not slacken their pace. Thus the Indians, as the <lb/>
            Persians say, obtain the greatest part of their gold ; and they <lb/>
            have some small quantity more that is dug in the country.</p>
          <p>106. The extreme parts of the inhabited world somehow <lb/>
            possess the most excellent products ; as Greece enjoys by far <lb/>
            the best tempered climate. For in the first place, India is the <lb/>
            farthest part of the inhabited world towards the east, as I <lb/>
            have just observed : in this part then all animals, both qua­ <lb/>
            drupeds and birds, are much larger than they are in other <lb/>
            countries, with the exception of horses ; in this respect they <lb/>
            are surpassed by the Medic breed called the Nysæan horses. <lb/>
            In the next place, there is abundance of gold there, partly <lb/>
            dug, partly brought down by the rivers, and partly seized in <lb/>
            the manner I have described. And certain wild trees there <lb/>
            bear wool instead of fruit, that in beauty and quality excels <lb/>
            that of sheep ; and the Indians make their clothing from these <lb/>
            trees. 107. Again, Arabia is the farthest of inhabited <lb/>
            countries towards the south; and this is the only region in <lb/>
            which grow frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon, and leda­ <lb/>
            num. All these, except myrrh, the Arabians gather with <lb/>
            difficulty. The frankincense they gather by burning styrax, <lb/>
            which the Phœnicians import into Greece; they take it by <lb/>
            burning this; for winged serpents, small in size, and various <note type="footnote"> 6 For the various modes of translating this difficult passage, see Baehr's <lb/>
            Vote, or Cary’s Lexicon. </note> <pb n="216"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[108-110"/> <lb/>
            in form, guard the trees that bear frankincense, a great <lb/>
            number round each tree. These are the same serpents that <lb/>
            invade Egypt.7 They are driven from the trees by nothing <lb/>
            else but the smoke of the styrax. 108. The Arabians say <lb/>
            this also, that the whole land would be filled by these serpents, <lb/>
            if some such thing did not take place with regard to them, as <lb/>
            I know happens to vipers. And the providence of God, as <lb/>
            was likely, proves itself wise: whatever creatures are timid, <lb/>
            and fit for food, have been made very prolific, lest the species <lb/>
            should be destroyed by constant consumption ; but such as are <lb/>
            savage and noxious, unprolific. For instance, the hare, which <lb/>
            is hunted by all, beasts, birds, and men, is so prolific that it <lb/>
            alone of all beasts conceives to superfetation, having in its <lb/>
            womb some of its young covered with down, others bare, <lb/>
            others just formed, and at the same time conceives again. <lb/>
            Such then is the case. Whereas a lioness, which is the <lb/>
            strongest and fiercest of beasts, bears only one once in her <lb/>
            life; for in bringing forth she ejects her matrix with the <lb/>
            whelp ; and this is the cause : when the whelp begins to move <lb/>
            in the womb, he, having claws, much sharper than those of <lb/>
            any other beast, lacerates the womb ; and as he increases in <lb/>
            strength, he continues tearing it much more ; and when the <lb/>
            birth approaches, not a single part of it remains sound. 109. <lb/>
            So also if vipers and the winged serpents of Arabia multiplied <lb/>
            as fast as their nature admits, men could not possibly live. <lb/>
            But now when they couple together, and the male is in the <lb/>
            very act of impregnating, as he emits the seed, the female <lb/>
            seizes him by the neck, and clinging to him, never lets him go <lb/>
            until she has gnawed through him. In this manner the male <lb/>
            dies, and the female pays the following retribution to the <lb/>
            male: the offspring, while yet in the womb, avenging their <lb/>
            father, eat through the matrix ; and having gnawed through <lb/>
            her bowels, thus make their entrance into the world. But <lb/>
            other serpents, which are not hurtful to men, lay eggs, and <lb/>
            hatch a vast number of young. Now vipers are found in all <lb/>
            parts of the world; but flying serpents are abundant in Arabia, <lb/>
            and no where else, there they appear to be very numerous.</p>
          <p>] 10. The Arabians obtain the frankincense in the manner <lb/>
            I have described ; and the cassia as follows : when they have <lb/>
            covered their whole body and face, except the eyes, with hide <note type="footnote"> T See Book II chao .75 </note> <pb n="217"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="-114.] "/>other skins, they go to the cassia; it grows in a shallow <lb/>
            ; and around the lake. and in it lodge winged animals <lb/>
            like bats, and they screech fearfully, and are exceedingly <lb/>
            ;e. These they keep off from their eyes; and so gather the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ia. 111. The cinnamon they collect in a still more won­ <lb/>
            ul manner. Where it grows and what land produces it, <lb/>
            ■ are unable to tell; except that some, giving a probable <lb/>
            unt, say that it grows in those countries in which Bacchus <lb/>
            nursed. And they say that large birds bring those rolls <lb/>
            lark, which we, from the Phoenicians, call cinnamon, the, <lb/>
            s bring them for their nests, which are built with clay, <lb/>
            nst precipitous mountains, where there is no access for</p>
          <p>. The Arabians, to surmount this difficulty, have in­ <lb/>
            ;ed the following artifice : having cut up into large pieces <lb/>
            limbs of dead oxen, and asses, and other beasts of burden, <lb/>
            ■ carry them to these spots, and having laid them near the <lb/>
            s, they retire to a distance. But the birds flying down <lb/>
            y up the limbs of the beasts to their nests, which not being <lb/>
            ng enough to support the weight, break and fall to the <lb/>
            md. Then the men, coming up, in this manner gather the <lb/>
            amon, and being gathered by them it reaches other coun­ <lb/>
            . 112. But the ledanum, which the Arabians call lada­ <lb/>
            i, is still more wonderful than this; for though it comes <lb/>
            a most stinking place, it is itself most fragrant. For it <lb/>
            iund sticking like gum to the beards of he-goats, which <lb/>
            ect it from the wood. It is useful for many ointments, <lb/>
            the Arabians burn it very generally as a perfume. 113. <lb/>
            Lay suffice to have said thus much of these perfumes ; and <lb/>
            e breathes from Arabia, as it were, a divine odour. They <lb/>
            a two kinds of sheep worthy of admiration, which are seen <lb/>
            vhere else. One kind has large tails, not less than three <lb/>
            ts in length, which, if suffered to trail, would ulcerate, <lb/>
            the tails rubbing on the ground. But every shepherd <lb/>
            ws enough of the carpenter's art to prevent this, for they <lb/>
            the little -arts and fasten them under the tails, binding <lb/>
            tail of each separate sheep to a separate cart. The other <lb/>
            I of sheep have broad tails, even to a cubit in breadth.</p>
          <p>. Where the meridian declines8 towards the setting sun, <lb/>
            Ethiopian territory reaches, being the extreme part of the <lb/>
            itable world. It produces much gold, huge elephants, wild <note type="footnote">8 That is,, If south-west " </note><pb n="218"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[115—117"/> <lb/>
            trees of all kinds, ebony, and men of large stature, veryj <lb/>
            handsome, and long-lived..</p>
          <p>115. These, then, are the extremities of Asia and Libya. <lb/>
            Concerning the western extremities of Europe I am unable to <lb/>
            speak with certainty, for I do not admit that there is a river, <lb/>
            called by barbarians Eridanus, which discharges itself into the <lb/>
            sea towards the north, from which amber is said to come; nor <lb/>
            am I acquainted with the Cassiterides islands, from whence our <lb/>
            tin comes. For in the first place, the name Eridanus shows <lb/>
            that it is Grecian and not barbarian, and feigned by some <lb/>
            poet; in the next place, though I have diligently inquired, I <lb/>
            have never been able to hear from any man who has himself <lb/>
            seen it, that there is a sea on that side of Europe. However, <lb/>
            both tin and amber come to us from the remotest parts. <lb/>
            116. Towards the north of Europe there is evidently a very <lb/>
            great quantity of gold, but how procured I am unable to say <lb/>
            with certainty ; though it is said that the Arimaspians, a one- <lb/>
            eyed people, steal it from the griffins. Neither do I believe <lb/>
            this, that men are born with one eye, and yet in other re­ <lb/>
            spects resemble the rest of mankind. However, the extremi­ <lb/>
            ties of the world seem to surround and enclose the rest of the <lb/>
            earth, and to possess those productions which we account most <lb/>
            excellent and rare.</p>
          <p>117. There is a plain in Asia shut in on every side by a <lb/>
            range of mountains, and there are five defiles in the mountain. <lb/>
            This plain formerly belonged to the Chorasmians, situated on! <lb/>
            the confines of these Chorasmians, of the Hyrcanians, Par-! <lb/>
            thians, Sarangæans, and Thamanæans; but since the Persians <lb/>
            have had the empire it belongs to the king. From this range <lb/>
            of mountains then, that shuts in this plain, there flows a great <lb/>
            river, the name of which is Aces ; it formerly, being divided <lb/>
            into five several channels, used to irrigate the lands of the na­ <lb/>
            tions before mentioned, being conducted to each nation through' <lb/>
            each separate defile. But since they have become subject to the <lb/>
            Persian, they have suffered the following calamity. The king <lb/>
            having caused the clefts of the mountains to be blocked up <lb/>
            placed gates at each cleft, and the passage of the water being <lb/>
            stopped, the plain within the mountains has become a sea, <lb/>
            the river continued to pour in, and had no where any <unclear>ex</unclear> <lb/>
            The people, therefore, who before were in the habit of usi <lb/>
            the water, not being able to use it any longer, were reduced <unclear/> <pb n="219"/>

            eat. extremities ; for though in winter heaven supplies them <lb/>
            ith rain, as it does other men, yet in summer, when they sow <lb/>
            illet and sesame, they stood in need of water. When, there­ <lb/>
            re, no water was allowed them, they and their wives going <lb/>
            the Persians, and standing before the king's palace, raised <lb/>
            great outcry. But the king gave order that the gates should <unclear/> <lb/>
            open towards those lands that were most in need; and <lb/>
            hen their land was satiated by imbibing water, these gates <lb/>
            are shut, and he ordered others to be opened to those who <lb/>
            ere next in greatest need. And as I have been informed, <lb/>
            e opens them after he has exacted large sums of money, in <lb/>
            dition to the tribute. Now these things are so.</p>
          <p>118. Of the seven men that conspired against the magus, it <lb/>
            opened that one of them, Intaphernes, having committed <lb/>
            e following act of insolence, lost his life shortly after the re­ <lb/>
            )lution. He wished to enter the palace in order to confer <lb/>
            ith Darius ; for the law was so settled among those who had <lb/>
            inspired against the magus, that they should have access to <lb/>
            e king without a messenger, unless the king should happen <lb/>
            be in bed with one of his wives. Intaphernes, therefore, <lb/>
            determined that no one should announce him ; but, because he <lb/>
            as one of the seven, chose to enter; the door-keeper, how­ <lb/>
            ver, and the messenger, would not let him pass, saying, that <lb/>
            e king was then in bed with one of his wives : but Inta­ <lb/>
            lernes, suspecting they told a falsehood, did as follows: <lb/>
            having drawn his scimetar, he cut off their ears and noses, <lb/>
            had having strung them to the bridle of his horse, he hung <lb/>
            em round their necks, and so dismissed them. 119. They <lb/>
            presented themselves to the king, and told him the cause for <lb/>
            Inch they had been so treated. Darius, fearing lest the six <lb/>
            ad done this in concert, sent for them, one by one, and en­ <lb/>
            avoured to discover their opinions, whether they approved of <lb/>
            hat had been done. But when he discovered that Intapher­ <lb/>
            s had not done this with their privity, he seized Intaphernes <lb/>
            mself, and his children, and all his family, having many <lb/>
            asons to suspect that he, with his relations, would raise a <lb/>
            bellion against him. And having seized them, he bound <lb/>
            tern as for death: but the wife of Intaphernes, going to the <lb/>
            ites of the palace, wept and lamented aloud; and having <lb/>
            )ne this continually, she prevailed on Darius to have com­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            assion on her. He therefore, having sent a messenger, spoke <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [120, 121 </note> <lb/>
            as follows : Madam, king Darius allows you to release one <lb/>
            of your relati ons who are now in prison, whichever of them <lb/>
            all you please." But she, having deliberated, answered as <lb/>
            follows : " Since the king grants me the life of one, I choose <lb/>
            my brother from them all." Darius, when he heard this, <lb/>
            wondering at her choice, having sent again, asked, " Madam, <lb/>
            the king inquires the reason why, leaving your husband and chil­ <lb/>
            dren, you have chosen that your brother should survive; who <lb/>
            is not so near related to you as your children, and less en­ <lb/>
            deared to you than your husband ? ” She answered as follows: <lb/>
            " 0 king, I may have another husband if God will, and other <lb/>
            children if I lose these; but as my father and mother are nd <lb/>
            longer alive, I cannot by any means have another brother <lb/>
            for this reason I spoke as I did." The woman appeared to <lb/>
            Darius to have spoken well, and he granted to her the one <lb/>
            whom she asked, and her eldest son, he was so pleased with <lb/>
            her : all the rest he put to death. Of the seven, therefore, <lb/>
            one very soon perished in the manner now mentioned.</p>
          <p>120. Near about the time of Cambyses' illness, the follow­ <lb/>
            in- events took place. Orœtes, a Persian, had been appointed <lb/>
            governor of Sardis by Cyrus ; this man conceived an impious <lb/>
            project; for without having sustained any injury, or heard a <lb/>
            hasty word from Polycrates the Samian, and without having <lb/>
            seen him before, he conceived the design of seizing him and <lb/>
            putting him to death ; as most people say, for some such cause <lb/>
            as this. Orcetes and another Persian, whose name was Mi­ <lb/>
            trobates, governor of the district of Dascylium, were sitting <lb/>
            together at the palace gates, and fell into a dispute. As they <lb/>
            were quarrelling about valour, Mitrobates said to Orœtes <lb/>
            tauntingly: “Are you to be reckoned a brave man, who <lb/>
            have not yet acquired for the king the island of Samos, that <lb/>
            lies near your government, and is so easy to be subdued ? <lb/>
            which one of its own inhabitants, having made an insurrection <lb/>
            with fifteen armed men, obtained possession of, and now <lb/>
            reigns over ?" Some say, that he, having heard this, and being <lb/>
            stung with the reproach, conceived a desire, not so much to! <lb/>
            revenge himself on the man who said it, as of utterly de-­ <lb/>
            stroying Polycrates, on whose account he had been reproached. <lb/>
            121. A fewer number say, that Orœtes sent a herald to Samos,, <lb/>
            to make some demand which is not mentioned, and that Poly­ <lb/>
            crates happened to be reclining in the men's apartment, and <pb n="221"/>
             <note type="margin"><unclear>122</unclear>, 123.] </note> <lb/>
            hat Anacreon of Teos was with him; and somehow, (whether <unclear/> <lb/>
            designedly disregarding the business of Orœtes, or by chance <lb/>
            t so happened,) when the herald of Orœtes came forward and <lb/>
            elivered his message, Polycrates, as his face chanced to be <lb/>
            urned towards the wall, neither turned about, nor made any <lb/>
            nswer. 122. These twofold causes are assigned for the death <lb/>
            f Polycrates; every man may give credit to whichever he <lb/>
            leases. However, Orœtes, who resided in Magnesia, situ­ <lb/>
            ted on the river Mæander, being acquainted with the inten­ <lb/>
            ions of Polycrates, sent Myrsus a Lydian, son of Gyges, with <lb/>
            message to Samos ; for Polycrates is the first of the Gre­ <lb/>
            ians of whom we know, who formed a design to make him­ <lb/>
            elf master of the sea, except Minos the Cnossian, or any <lb/>
            ther, who before his time obtained the empire of the sea : <lb/>
            ut within what is called the historical9 age, Polycrates is the <lb/>
            rst who had entertained great expectations of ruling Ionia <lb/>
            nd the islands. Orœtes therefore, having ascertained that <lb/>
            e had formed this design, sent a message to the following <lb/>
            ffect : " ORŒTES TO POLYCRATES SAYS AS FOLLOWS: I un­ <lb/>
            erstand that you are planning vast enterprises, and that you <lb/>
            ave not money answerable to your projects. Now, if you <lb/>
            rill do as I advise, you will promote your own success, and <lb/>
            reserve me ; for king Cambyses meditates my death, and <lb/>
            f this I have certain information. Now, do you convey me <lb/>
            nd my wealth out of the country, and take part of it, and <lb/>
            uffer me to enjoy the rest: by means of the wealth, you will <lb/>
            ecome master of all Greece. If you doubt what I say con­ <lb/>
            erning my riches, send to me the most trusty of your serv­ <lb/>
            nts, to whom I will show them." 123. Polycrates, having <lb/>
            eard this, was delighted, and accepted the offer; and as he was <lb/>
            ery eager for wealth, he first sent Mæandrius, son of Mæandri­ <lb/>
            s, to view it, a citizen who was his secretary: he not long after <lb/>
            edicated to the temple of Juno all the ornamental furniture <lb/>
            om the men's apartment of Polycrates, which was indeed <lb/>
            magnificent. Orcetes, having learnt that an inspector might be <lb/>
            xpected, did as follows: having filled eight chests with stones, <lb/>
            xcept a very small space round the brim, he put gold on the <lb/>
            urface of the stones, and having made the chests fast with <unclear/> <lb/>
            ords, he kept them in readiness. But Mæandrius, having come <note type="footnote"> . In opposition to It the fabulous.” </note><pb n="222"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[124-126 "/>and inspected the chests, took back a report to Polycrates. <lb/>
            124. He, though earnestly dissuaded by the oracles and by <lb/>
            his friends, resolved to go in person ; and moreover, though <lb/>
            his daughter had seen in a dream this vision ; she imagined <lb/>
            she saw her father elevated in the air, washed by Jupiter, and <lb/>
            anointed by the sun. Having seen this vision, she endeavoured <lb/>
            by all possible means to divert Polycrates from going from <lb/>
            home to Oroetes; and as he was going on board a fifty-oared <lb/>
            galley, she persisted in uttering words of bad omen. But he <lb/>
            threatened her, if he should return safe, that she should long <lb/>
            continue unmarried; and she prayed that so it might be <lb/>
            brought to pass; for she chose to continue a longer time un­ <lb/>
            married, than be deprived of her father. 125. Thus Poly­ <lb/>
            crates, disregarding all advice, set sail to visit Orœtes, taking <lb/>
            with him many others of his friends, and among them Demo­ <lb/>
            cedes son of Calliphon, a Crotonian, who was a physician, <lb/>
            and the most skilful practitioner of his time. But Polycrates, <lb/>
            on his arrival at Magnesia, was put to death in a horrid man­ <lb/>
            ner, unworthy of himself and his lofty thoughts: for with the <lb/>
            exception of those who have been tyrants of Syracuse, not on. <lb/>
            of all the Grecian tyrants deserves to be compared with Poly­ <lb/>
            crates for magnificence. But Orcetes, having put him to <lb/>
            death in a manner not to be described, caused him to be cru­ <lb/>
            cified: of those that accompanied Polycrates, as many as were <lb/>
            Samians, he dismissed, bidding them to feel thankful to him <lb/>
            for their liberty : but as many as were strangers and servants <lb/>
            he detained and treated as slaves. Thus Polycrates, being <lb/>
            crucified, fulfilled the vision of his daughter in every par­ <lb/>
            ticular ; for he was washed by Jupiter, when it rained, and <lb/>
            was anointed by the sun, himself emitting moisture from his <lb/>
            body. Thus the constant good fortune of Polycrates ended <lb/>
            as Amasis, king of Egypt, had foretold.1</p>
          <p><unclear/> 126. Not long after, vengeance on account of Polycrates over­ <lb/>
            took Orœtes: for after the death of Cambyses, and during the <lb/>
            reign of the magi, Orcetes, continuing at Sardis, gave no assist­ <lb/>
            ance to the Persians, who had been deprived of the government <lb/>
            by the Medes; but he in this confusion put to death Mitre­ <lb/>
            bates, governor of Dascylium, who had upbraided him with <lb/>
            his conduct to Polycrates, together with Mitrobates' son <lb/>
            Cranaspes. men of high repute among the Persians; and he <note type="footnote"> I See chapters 40—43. </note> <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin"> 127, 128.] </note> <lb/>
            committed various other atrocities ; and a certain courier of <lb/>
            Darius who came to him, because he brought him an unwel­ <lb/>
            come message, he had assassinated on his return, having set <lb/>
            men to way-lay him; and when he had caused him to be <lb/>
            slain, he had him and his horse put out of sight. 127. Darius, <lb/>
            therefore, when he got possession of the throne, was anxious <lb/>
            to punish Orœtes for all his iniquities, and especially for the <lb/>
            leath of Mitrobates and his son. But he did not think it <lb/>
            prudent to send an army against him openly, as his affairs <lb/>
            were still in a ferment, and he had but just got possession ot <lb/>
            the throne, and he heard that Orcetes had great strength ; for <lb/>
            lie had a body-guard of a thousand Persians, and held the <lb/>
            Government of Phrygia, Lydia, and Ionia. Under these cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, therefore, Darius had recourse to the following <lb/>
            plan : having called the most eminent of the Persians to­ <lb/>
            ,-ether, he addressed them as follows: " Which of you, 0 <lb/>
            Persians, will undertake to accomplish for me this by address, <lb/>
            ind not by force and numbers ? for where skill is required, <lb/>
            force is of no avail. Which of you, then, will either bring me <lb/>
            Orœtes alive, or put him to death ? He has never done the <lb/>
            Persians any service, but has brought great mischiefs upon <lb/>
            them. In the first place, he destroyed two of us, Mitrobates <lb/>
            ind his son ; and in the next place, he slew the messenger sent <lb/>
            by me to recall him, displaying intolerable insolence. He <lb/>
            must therefore be stopped by death, before he has perpetrated <lb/>
            my greater evils against the Persians." 128. Darius asked <lb/>
            tile above questions; and thirty men offered to undertake it, <lb/>
            each being willing to accomplish the plan alone. But Darius <lb/>
            put an end to their competitions, by desiring them to cast lots ; <lb/>
            nd when they cast lots- it fell to Bagæus, son of Artontes. <lb/>
            Bagæus, having obtained it, did as follows: having written <lb/>
            several letters relating to a variety of affairs, he affixed to <lb/>
            hem Darius's seal, and then proceeded with them to Sardis. <lb/>
            On his arrival, having come into the presence of Orœtes, he <lb/>
            opened the letters one by one, and gave them to the royal <lb/>
            secretary to read; for all the governors have royal secretaries. <lb/>
            Bagæus gave the letters in order to make trial of the guards <lb/>
            whether they would listen to a revolt from Orœtes: and per­ <lb/>
            ceiving they paid great respect to the letters, and still more to <lb/>
            he contents, he gave one in which were these words: " Per­ <lb/>
            ians, King Darius forbids you to be guards to Oroetes ” <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin"> [129, 130 </note> <lb/>
            They, when they heard this, lowered their lances to him. <lb/>
            When Bagæus saw them so obedient to the letter, he there­ <lb/>
            upon took confidence, and delivered the last letter to the <lb/>
            secretary, in which was written: " King Darius commands <lb/>
            the Persians at Sardis to put Orœtes to death." The guards, <lb/>
            when they heard this, drew their scimetars, and killed him <lb/>
            immediately. Thus vengeance overtook Orœtes the Persian, <lb/>
            on account of Polycrates the Samian.</p>
          <p>129. When the treasures of Orœtes had been removed, and <lb/>
            had arrived at Susa, it happened not long after that Darius, <lb/>
            in leaping from his horse while hunting, twisted his foot, and <lb/>
            it was twisted with such violence that the ancle-bone was dis­ <lb/>
            located ; and at first thinking he had about him those of the <lb/>
            Egyptians who had the first reputation for skill in the healing <lb/>
            art, he made use of their assistance. But they, by twisting the <lb/>
            foot, and using force, made the evil worse ; and from the pain <lb/>
            which he felt, Darius lay seven days and seven nights without <lb/>
            sleep. On the eighth day, as he still continued in a bad state, <lb/>
            some one who had before heard at Sardis of the skill of De­ <lb/>
            mocedes the Crotonian, made it known to Darius; and lie <lb/>
            ordered them to bring him to him as quickly as possible. <lb/>
            They found him among the slaves of Orœtes, altogether neg­ <lb/>
            lected; and brought him forward, dragging fetters behind <lb/>
            him, and clothed in rags. 130.'As he stood before him, <lb/>
            Darius asked him whether he understood the art. He denied <lb/>
            that he did, fearing lest, if he discovered himself, he should be <lb/>
            altogether precluded from returning to Greece. But he ap­ <lb/>
            peared to Darius to dissemble, although he was skilled in the <lb/>
            art; he therefore commanded those who had brought him <lb/>
            thither to bring out whips and goads. Whereupon he dis­ <lb/>
            covered himself, saying that he did not know it perfectly, but, <lb/>
            having been intimate with a physician, he had some poor <lb/>
            knowledge of the art. Upon which, when Darius put him­ <lb/>
            self under his care, by using Grecian medicines, and applying <lb/>
            lenitives after violent remedies, he caused him to sleep, and in <lb/>
            a little time restored him to his health, though he had before <lb/>
            despaired of ever recovering the use of his foot. After this <lb/>
            cure, Darius presented him with two pair of golden fetters; <lb/>
            but Democedes asked him, if he purposely gave him a double <lb/>
            evil because he had restored him to health. Darius, pleased <lb/>
            with the speech, sent him to his own wives ; and the eunuchs, <pb n="225"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="131—133]"/> <lb/>
            introducing him, said to the women, that this was the man <lb/>
            who had saved the king's life ; whereupon each of them, dip­ <lb/>
            ping a goblet into a chest of gold, presented Democedes <lb/>
            with such a munificent gift, that a servant whose name was <lb/>
            Sciton, following behind, picked up the staters that fell from <lb/>
            the goblets, and collected a large quantity of gold.</p>
          <p>131. This Democedes visited Polycrates, after having left <lb/>
            Crotona on the following account. He was harshly treated at <lb/>
            Crotona by his father, who was of a severe temper, and being <lb/>
            unable to endure this, he left him and went to Ægina; hav­ <lb/>
            ing settled there, in the first year, though he was unprovided <lb/>
            with means, and had none of the instruments necessary for the <lb/>
            exercise of his art, he surpassed the most skilful of their phy­ <lb/>
            sicians ; and in the second year, the Æginetæ engaged him for <lb/>
            a talent out of the public treasury; and in the third year the <lb/>
            Athenians, for a hundred mince; and in the fourth year Poly­ <lb/>
            crates, for two talents; thus he came to Samos. From this man <lb/>
            the Crotonian physicians obtained a great reputation ; for at <lb/>
            this period the physicians of Crotona were said to be the first <lb/>
            throughout Greece, and the Cyrenæans the second. At the <lb/>
            same time the Argives were accounted the most skilful of the <lb/>
            Greeks in the art of music. 132. At that time then Demo­ <lb/>
            cedes, having completely cured Darius at Susa, had a very <lb/>
            large house, and had a seat at the king's table; and he had <lb/>
            every thing he could wish for, except the liberty of returning <lb/>
            to Greece. And in the first place he obtained from the king <lb/>
            a pardon for the Egyptian physicians, who first attended the <lb/>
            king, and were about to be empaled, because they had been <lb/>
            outdone by a Greek physician; and in the next place he pro­ <lb/>
            cured the liberty of a prophet of Elis, who had attended <lb/>
            Polycrates, and lay neglected among the slaves. In short, <lb/>
            Democedes had great influence with the king.</p>
          <p>I 133. Not long after these things, the following events took <lb/>
            place: Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, and wife to Darius, had <lb/>
            a tumour on her breast; after some time it burst, and spread <lb/>
            considerably. As long as it was small, she concealed it, and <lb/>
            from delicacy informed no one of it; when it became dan­ <lb/>
            gerous, she sent for Democedes and showed it to him. He, say­ <lb/>
            ing that he could cure her, exacted from her a solemn promise, <lb/>
            that she in return would perform for him whatever he should <lb/>
            require of her, but added that he would ask nothing which <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="margin"> [134, 135. </note> <lb/>
            might bring disgrace on her. 134. When therefore he had <lb/>
            healed her, and restored her to health, Atossa, instructed by <lb/>
            Democedes, addressed Darius, as he lay in bed, in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing words: “0 king, you who possess so great power, sit <lb/>
            idle, and do not add any nation or power to the Persians. It <lb/>
            were right that a man who is both young and master of such <lb/>
            vast treasures, should render himself considerable by his <lb/>
            actions, that the Persians may know that they are governed <lb/>
            by a man. Two motives should influence you to such a <lb/>
            course; first, that the Persians may know that it is a man who <lb/>
            rules over them, and secondly, that they may be worn in war, <lb/>
            and not tempted by too much ease to plot against you. You <lb/>
            should therefore perform some illustrious action, while you are <lb/>
            in the flower of your age; for the mind grows with the <lb/>
            growth of the body, and as it grows old, grows old with it, <lb/>
            and dull for every action." She spoke thus according to her <lb/>
            instructions, and he answered, "Lady, you have mentioned <lb/>
            the very things that I myself purpose to do ; for I have de­ <lb/>
            termined to make a bridge and march from this continent to the <lb/>
            other, against the Scythians ; and this shall shortly be put in ex­ <lb/>
            ecution." Atossa replied, " Look you now, give up the thought <lb/>
            of marching first against the Scythians, for they will be in <lb/>
            your power whenever you choose ; but take my advice, and <lb/>
            lead an army into Greece ; for from the account I have <lb/>
            heard, I am anxious to have Lacedæmonian, Argive, Atheni­ <lb/>
            an, and Corinthian attendants : and you have the fittest man <lb/>
            in the world to show and inform you of every thing concern­ <lb/>
            ing Greece ; I mean the person who cured your foot. Da­ <lb/>
            rius answered, " Lady, since you think I ought to make my <lb/>
            first attempt against Greece, I think it better first to send <lb/>
            some Persians thither as spies with the man you mention ; <lb/>
            they, when they are informed of and have seen every particu­ <lb/>
            lar, will make a report to me ; and then, being thoroughly in-, <lb/>
            formed, I will turn my arms against them." 135. Thus he, <lb/>
            spoke; and no sooner said than done; for as soon as day <lb/>
            dawned, having summoned fifteen eminent Persians, he com­ <lb/>
            manded them to accompany Democedes, and pass along the <lb/>
            maritime parts of Greece ; and to take care that Democedes <lb/>
            did not escape from them, but they must by all means bring <lb/>
            him back again. Having given these commands to them, lie <lb/>
            next summoned Democedes himself, and requested him, when. <pb n="227"/>
             <note type="margin">136 137.] </note> <lb/>
            he had conducted the Persians through all Greece, and shown <lb/>
            it to them, to return back again ; he also commanded him to <lb/>
            take with him all his movables as presents to his father and <lb/>
            brothers, promising to give him many times as much instead. <lb/>
            Moreover, he said, that for the purpose of transporting the <lb/>
            presents he would give a merchant ship, filled with all kinds <lb/>
            of precious things, which should accompany him on his voy­ <lb/>
            age. Now Darius, in my opinion, promised him these things <lb/>
            without any deceitful intention; but Democedes, fearing lest <lb/>
            Darius was making trial of him, received all that was given, <lb/>
            without eagerness, but said that he would leave his own <lb/>
            goods where they were, that he might have them on his re­ <lb/>
            turn ; the merchant ship which Darius promised him to con­ <lb/>
            vey the presents to his brothers, he said he would accept of. <lb/>
            Darius having given him these instructions, sent them down <lb/>
            to the coast.</p>
          <p>136. Accordingly, going down to Phœnicia and Sidon, a <lb/>
            city of Phœnicia, they manned two triremes, and with them <lb/>
            also a large trading vessel, laden with all kinds of precious <lb/>
            things; and having prepared every thing, they set sail for <lb/>
            Greece ; and keeping to the shore, they surveyed the coasts, <lb/>
            and made notes in writing; at length, having inspected the <lb/>
            greatest part of it, and whatever was most remarkable, they <lb/>
            proceeded to Tarentum in Italy. There, out of kindness to­ <lb/>
            vards Democedes, Aristophilides, king of the Tarentines, first <lb/>
            ook off the rudders of the Median ships, and next shut up <lb/>
            he Persians as spies. Whilst they were in this condition <lb/>
            Democedes went to Crotona, and when he had reached his <lb/>
            wn home, Aristophilides set the Persians at liberty, and re­ <lb/>
            tored what he had taken from their ships. 137. The Per­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ians sailing from thence, and pursuing Democedes, arrived at <lb/>
            Crotona, and having found him in the public market, they laid <lb/>
            ands on him. Some of the Crotonians, dreading the Persian <lb/>
            weT, were ready to deliver him up; but others seized the <lb/>
            ersians in turn, and beat them with staves, though they ex­ <lb/>
            ostulated in these terms: " Men of Crotona, have a care what <lb/>
            ou do, you are rescuing a man who is a runaway from the <lb/>
            ing; how will king Darius endure to be thus insulted ? How <lb/>

            What city shall we sooner attack than this ? What sooner <unclear/> <lb/>
            all we endeavour to reduce to slavery?” Saying this, they <note type="footnote"> <unclear>Q</unclear> 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            did not persuade the Crotonians; but being forcibly deprived <lb/>
            of Democedes, and having had the trading vessel which they <lb/>
            brought with them taken from them, they sailed back to Asia; <lb/>
            nor, as they were deprived of their guide, did they attempt to <lb/>
            explore Greece any further. At their departure Democedes <lb/>
            enjoined them to tell Darius that he had Milo's daughter <lb/>
            affianced to him as his wife, for the name of Milo, the wrestler, <lb/>
            stood high with the king; and on this account it appears to <lb/>
            me that Democedes spared no expense to hasten this marriage, <lb/>
            that he might appear to Darius to be a man of consequence in <lb/>
            his own country. 138. The Persians, having set sail from <lb/>
            Crotona, were driven to Iapygia, and being made slaves there, <lb/>
            Gillus, a Tarentine exile, ransomed them, and conducted them <lb/>
            to king Darius; and he in return for this professed himself <lb/>
            ready to give him whatever he should desire. But Gillus, <lb/>
            having first related his misfortunes, asked to be restored to <lb/>
            Tarentum; but that he might not disturb Greece, if on his <lb/>
            account a great fleet should sail to Italy, he said that the <lb/>
            Cnidians alone would suffice to effect his restoration ; thinking <lb/>
            that by them, as they were on terms of friendship with the <lb/>
            Tarentines, his return would be most easily effected. Darius I <lb/>
            having promised this, performed it; for having despatched a <lb/>
            messenger to Cnidus, he bade them restore Gillus to Taren­ <lb/>
            tum ; but the Cnidians, though they obeyed Darius, could not <lb/>
            persuade the Tarentines, and were not strong enough to em­ <lb/>
            ploy force. Thus these things ended: and these were the <lb/>
            first Persians who came from Asia to Greece, and they, on <lb/>
            fhat. occasion, were spies.</p>
          <p>139. After these things, king Darius took Samos, first of <lb/>
            all the cities, either Grecian or barbarian, and he took it for, <lb/>
            the following reason. When Cambyses, son of Cyrus, invaded <lb/>
            Egypt, many Grecians resorted thither; some, as one ma <lb/>
            conjecture, on account of trade; others, to serve as soldiers <lb/>
            others, to view the country. Of these, the last was Syloson <lb/>
            son of Æaces, brother to Polycrates, and an exile from Samos. <lb/>
            The following piece of good luck betel this Syloson: having <lb/>
            put on a scarlet cloak, he walked in the streets of Memphis <lb/>
            and Darius, who was one of Cambyses' guard, and as yet as, <lb/>
            man of no great account, seeing him, took a fancy to the cloak, <lb/>
            and coming up, wished to purchase it. But Syloson, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that Darius was very anxious to have the cloak, <pb n="229"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="140-142.]"/> <lb/>
            impelled by a divine impulse, said, " I will not sell it for any <lb/>
            sum, but I will give it you for nothing, if so it must needs be." <lb/>
            Darius, having accepted his offer with thanks, took the cloak. <lb/>
            140. Syloson thought afterwards that he had lost it through his <lb/>
            good nature, but when, in course of time, Cambyses died, and <lb/>
            the seven rose up against the magus, and of the seven, Darius <lb/>
            possessed the throne, Syloson heard that the kingdom had <lb/>
            devolved on the man to whom he had given his cloak in <lb/>
            Egypt on his requesting it; so having gone up to Susa he <lb/>
            seated himself at the threshold of the king's palace, and said <lb/>
            he had been a benefactor to Darius. The porter, having heard <lb/>
            this, reported it to the king; but he, wondering, said to the <lb/>
            man, " What Grecian is my benefactor, to whom I owe a debt <lb/>
            of gratitude, having so lately come to the throne ? Scarcely <lb/>
            one of them has as yet come up hither; nor can I mention any <lb/>
            thing that I owe to a Greek. However, bring him in. that I <lb/>
            may know the meaning of what he says." The porter intro <lb/>
            duced Syloson, and as he stood in the midst, the interpreters <lb/>
            asked him who he was, and what he had done, that he said he <lb/>
            had been a benefactor to the king. Then Syloson related all <lb/>
            that had passed respecting the cloak, and that he was the per­ <lb/>
            son who gave it To this the king answered, " Most generous of <lb/>
            men ! art thou then the man who, when as yet I had no power, <lb/>
            made me a present, small as it was ? yet the obligation is the <lb/>
            same as if I were now to receive a thing of great value. In <lb/>
            return I will give thee abundance of gold and silver, so that <lb/>
            thou shalt never repent having conferred a favour on Da­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            rius son of Hystaspes." To this Syloson replied, " 0 king, <lb/>
            give me neither gold nor silver; but recover and give me <lb/>
            back my country, Samos, which now, since my brother Poly­ <lb/>
            rates died by the hands of Orœtes, a slave of ours has pos­ <lb/>
            essed himself of. Give me this without bloodshed and <lb/>
            bondage. 141. When Darius heard this, he sent an army <lb/>
            mder the conduct of Otanes, one of the seven, with orders <lb/>
            to accomplish whatever Syloson should desire. Whereupon <lb/>
            Otanes, going down to the sea, embarked his army.</p>
          <p>142. Maeandrius, son of Mæandrius, held the government <lb/>
            if Samos, having had the administration intrusted to him by <lb/>
            Polycrates : though he wished to prove himself the most just <lb/>
            f men, he was unable to effect his purpose. For when the <lb/>
            eath of Polycrates was made known to him, he did as fol <pb n="230"/>
             <note type="margin">[143, 144 </note> <lb/>
            lows. First he erected an altar to Jupiter Liberator, and <lb/>
            marked round it the sacred enclosure, which is now in the <lb/>
            suburbs. Afterwards, when he had done this, he summoned <lb/>
            an assembly of all the citizens, and spoke as follows: " To <lb/>
            me, as you know, the sceptre and all the power of Polycrates <lb/>
            has been intrusted, and I am now able to retain the govern­ <lb/>
            ment. But what I condemn in another, I will myself, to the <lb/>
            utmost of my ability, abstain from doing. For neither did <lb/>
            Polycrates please me in exercising despotic power over men <lb/>
            equal to himself, nor would any other who should do the <lb/>
            like. Now Polycrates has accomplished his fate; and I, sur­ <lb/>
            rendering the government into your hands, proclaim equality <lb/>
            to all. I require, however, that the following remuneration <lb/>
            should be granted to myself; that six talents should be given <lb/>
            me out of the treasures of Polycrates ; and in addition, I <lb/>
            claim for myself and my descendants for ever, the priesthood <lb/>
            of the temple of Jupiter Liberator ; to whom I have erected <lb/>
            an altar, and under whose auspices I restore to you your <lb/>
            liberties." He then made these demands of the Samians ; <lb/>
            but one of them rising up said, " You forsooth are not worthy <lb/>
            to rule over us, being as you are a base and pestilent fellow ; <lb/>
            rather think how you will render an account of the wealth that <lb/>
            you have had the management of." 143. Thus spoke a man <lb/>
            of eminence among the citizens, whose name was Telesar­ <lb/>
            chus. But Mæandrius, perceiving that if he should lay down <lb/>
            the power, some other would set himself up as tyrant in his <lb/>
            place, no longer thought of laying it down. To which end, <lb/>
            when he had withdrawn to the citadel, sending for each ono <lb/>
            severally, as if about to give an account of the treasures, he <lb/>
            seized them and put them in chains. They then were kept, <lb/>
            in confinement; but after this, disease attacked Mæandrius ; <lb/>
            and his brother, whose name was Lycaretus, supposing that <lb/>
            he would die, in order that he might the more easily possess <lb/>
            himself of the government of Samos, put all the prisoners to <lb/>
            death ; for, as it seems, they were not willing to be free.</p>
          <p>144. When therefore the Persians arrived at Samos, bring­ <lb/>
            ing Syloson with them, no one raised a hand against them, <lb/>
            and the partisans of Maeandrius, and Mæandrius himself, said <lb/>
            they were ready to quit the island under a treaty ; and when <lb/>
            Otanes had assented to this, and had ratified the agreement, <lb/>
            the principal men of the Persians, having had seats placed for <pb n="231"/>
             <note type="margin">145, 146.] </note> <lb/>
            them, sat down opposite the citadel. 145. The tyrant Mæan­ <lb/>
            drius had a brother somewhat out of his senses, whose name <lb/>
            was Charilaus ; he, for some fault he had committed, was <lb/>
            confined in a dungeon ; and having at that time overheard <lb/>
            what was doing, and having peeped through his dungeon, <lb/>
            when he saw the Persians sitting quietly down, he shouted <lb/>
            and said that he wished to speak with Masandrius ; but Mæ­ <lb/>
            andrius, having heard this, commanded him to be released, and <lb/>
            brought into his presence ; and as soon as he was brought <lb/>
            there, upbraiding and reviling his brother, he urged him to <lb/>
            attack the Persians, saying, " Me, 0 vilest of men, who am <lb/>
            your own brother, and have done nothing worthy of bonds, <lb/>
            you have bound and adjudged to a dungeon ; but when you <lb/>
            see the Persians driving you out and making you houseless, <lb/>
            you dare not avenge yourself, though they are so easy to be <lb/>
            subdued.. But if you are in dread of them, lend me your aux­ <lb/>
            iliaries, and I will punish them for coming here, and I am <lb/>
            ready also to send you out of the island. 146. Thus spoke <lb/>
            Charilaus; and Mæandrius accepted his offer, as I think, not <lb/>
            that he had reached such a pitch of folly as to imagine that <lb/>
            his own power could overcome that of the king, but rather <lb/>
            out of envy to Syloson, if without a struggle he should <lb/>
            possess himself of the city uninjured. Having therefore <lb/>
            provoked the Persians, he wished to make the Samian <lb/>
            power as weak as possible, and then to give it up: being well <lb/>
            assured that the Persians, if they suffered any ill-treatment, <lb/>
            would be exasperated against the Samians ; and knowing also <lb/>
            that he had for himself a safe retreat from the island, when­ <lb/>
            ever he chose, for he had had a secret passage dug leading <lb/>
            from the citadel to the sea. Accordingly Mæandrius himself <lb/>
            sailed away from Samos; but Charilaus, having armed all the <lb/>
            auxiliaries, and having thrown open the gates, sallied out <lb/>
            upon the Persians, who did not expect any thing of the kind, <lb/>
            but thought every thing had been agreed upon; and the aux­ <lb/>
            iliaries, falling on, slew those of the Persians who were seated <lb/>
            in chairs,2 and who were the principal men among them. But <lb/>
            the rest of the Persian army came to their assistance, and the <lb/>
            auxiliaries, being hard pressed, were shut up again within the <note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διφροφορευυένους</foreign> Baehr thinks refers to those Persians who were be­ <lb/>

            and others. thinks it means " those who we re carried on litters." </note> <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[147—150"/> <lb/>
            citadel. 147. But Otanes the general, when he saw that the <lb/>
            Persians had suffered great loss, purposely 3 neglected to obey <lb/>
            the orders which Darius had given him at his departure, that <lb/>
            he should neither kill nor take prisoner any of the Samians, <lb/>
            but deliver the island to Syloson without damage; on the <lb/>
            contrary, he commanded his army to put to death every one <lb/>
            they met with, both man and child alike. Whereupon, one <lb/>
            part of the army besieged the citadel, and the rest killed every <lb/>
            one that came in their way, all they met, as well within the <lb/>
            temples as without. 148. Mæandrius, having escaped from <lb/>
            Samos, sailed to Lacedæmon ; and having arrived there, and <lb/>
            carried with him all the treasures that he had when he set out, <lb/>
            he did as follows. When he had set out his silver and golden <lb/>
            cups, his servants began to clean them ; and he, at the same <lb/>
            time, holding a conversation with Cleomenes, son of Anaxan­ <lb/>
            drides, then king of Sparta, led him on to his house. When <lb/>
            the king saw the cups, he was struck with wonder and aston­ <lb/>
            ishment ; upon which Mæandrius bade him take away what­ <lb/>
            ever he pleased, and when Mæandrius had repeated this offer <lb/>
            two or three times, Cleomenes showed himself a man of the <lb/>
            highest integrity, who refused to accept what was offered ; and <lb/>
            being informed that by giving to other citizens he would gain <lb/>
            their support, he went to the Ephori, and said that it would <lb/>
            be better for Sparta that this Samian stranger should quit the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, lest he should persuade him or some other of <lb/>
            the Spartans to become base. But they, having assented, <lb/>
            banished Mæandrius by public proclamation. 149. The Per­ <lb/>
            sians, having drawn Samos as with a net,4 delivered it to Sy­ <lb/>
            loson, utterly destitute of inhabitants. Afterwards, however, <lb/>
            Otanes, the general, repeopled it, in consequence of a vision in <lb/>
            a dream, and a distemper which seized him in his private <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <p>150. Whilst the naval armament was on its way to Samos, <lb/>
            the Babylonians revolted, having very well prepared them­ <lb/>
            selves. For while the magus reigned, and the seven rose <lb/>
            up against him, during all that time, and in the confusion, <lb/>
            they had made preparations for a siege, and somehow in doing <lb/>
            this had escaped observation. But when they openly revolt­ <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="151-154.] "/>ed they did as follows : having excepted their mothers, each <lb/>
            man selected one woman besides, whomever he chose, from <lb/>
            his own family, but all the rest they assembled together and <lb/>
            strangled: the one woman each man selected to cook his food. <lb/>
            They strangled them, that they might not consume their pro­ <lb/>
            visions. 151. Darius, being informed of this, and having col­ <lb/>
            lected all his forces, marched against them; and having ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to Babylon, he besieged them, who were not at all <lb/>
            solicitous about the event, for the Babylonians, mounting on <lb/>
            the ramparts of the wall, danced, and derided Darius and his <lb/>
            army, and one of them spoke as follows : " Why sit ye there, <lb/>
            0 Persians ? will ye not be off? for ye will then take us <lb/>
            when mules bring forth young." One of the Babylonians said <lb/>
            this, who never expected that a mule would breed. 152. When <lb/>
            a year and seven months had now passed, Darius was vexed, <lb/>
            and all his army, that they were not able to take the Babyloni­ <lb/>
            ans ; though Darius had recourse to every kind of stratagem <lb/>
            and artifice against them. But even so he could not take <lb/>
            them; and having tried other stratagems, he made trial of <lb/>
            that also by which Cyrus had taken them. However, the <lb/>
            Babylonians kept strict guard, and he was not able to sur­ <lb/>
            prise them.</p>
          <p>153. Thereupon, in the twentieth month, to Zopyrus, son <lb/>
            of that Megabyzus, who was one of the seven who dethroned <lb/>
            the magus,—to this Zopyrus, son of Megabyzus, the following <lb/>
            prodigy happened ;one of his sumpter-mules brought forth <lb/>
            young : but when the news was told him, Zopyrus himself, not <lb/>
            believing it, went to see the foal, and having strictly charged his <lb/>
            servants not to tell any one what had happened, he considered <lb/>
            on it: and in consequence of the words of the Babylonian, <lb/>
            who at the beginning said, " When even mules bring forth <lb/>
            young, then would the city be taken,”—in consequence of <lb/>
            this omen, he thought that Babylon could now be taken ; for <lb/>
            that the man had spoken under divine influence, and that his <lb/>
            own mule had brought forth young. 154. When he thought <lb/>
            that it was fated for Babylon to be now taken, he went to <lb/>
            Darius, and asked him whether he deemed the taking of <lb/>
            Babylon as of very great importance ; and having learnt that <lb/>
            he valued it at a high price, he next considered how he might <lb/>
            be the person to take it, and the work might be his own ; for <lb/>
            among the Persians great achievements are honoured in the <pb n="234"/>
             <note type="margin">155 </note> <lb/>
            highest degree. Now, he concluded that he should not be <lb/>
            able to reduce it in any other way, than if he should mutilate <lb/>
            himself, and desert to the enemy. Thereupon, considering <lb/>
            that as a light matter, he inflicted on himself an irremediable <lb/>
            mutilation, for having cut off his nose and ears, and having <lb/>
            cut his hair in a disgraceful manner, and having scourged <lb/>
            himself, he presented himself before Darius. 155. Darius <lb/>
            was very much grieved when he beheld a man of high rank so <lb/>
            mutilated, and having started from his throne, he shouted <lb/>
            aloud and asked who had mutilated him, and for what cause. <lb/>
            He answered, " 0 king, there is no man except yourself who <lb/>
            could have power to treat me thus ; no stranger has done this, <lb/>
            O king, but I have done it to myself deeming it a great in­ <lb/>
            dignity that the Assyrians should dei ide the Persians." He <lb/>
            replied, " Most wretched of men, you have given the fairest <lb/>
            name to the foulest deed, in saying that you have injured <lb/>
            yourself thus incurably on account of those who are besieged. <lb/>
            How, foolish man, because you are mutilated, will the enemy <lb/>
            sooner submit? Have you lost your senses, that you have <lb/>
            thus ruined yourself?" He said in answer, "If I had com­ <lb/>
            municated to you what I was about to do, you would not have <lb/>
            permitted me, but now, having deliberated with myself, I have <lb/>
            done it; now, therefore, if you are not wanting to your own <lb/>
            interests, we shall take Babylon. For I, as I am, will desert <lb/>
            to the city, and will tell them that I have been thus treated by <lb/>
            you ; and I think that when I have persuaded them that such <lb/>
            is the case, I shall obtain the command of their i my. Do <lb/>
            you then, on the tenth day after I shall have entered the city, <lb/>
            of that part of your army whose loss you would least regret, <lb/>
            station a thousand men over against the gates called after <lb/>
            Semiramis; again after that, on the seventh day after the <lb/>
            tenth, station two thousand more against the gate called from <lb/>
            Nineveh ; and from the seventh day let an interval of twenty <lb/>
            days elapse, and then place four thousand more against the <lb/>
            gate called from the Chaldseans ; but let neither the first nor <lb/>
            these carry any defensive arms except swords, but let them <lb/>
            have those. After the twentieth day, straightway command <lb/>
            the rest of the army to invest the wall on all sides, but station <lb/>
            the Persians for me at those called the Belidian and Cissian <lb/>
            gates ; for as I think, when I have performed great exploits. <lb/>
            the Babylonians will intrust every thing to me, and, more- <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="156—158.]"/> <lb/>
            over, the keys of the gates, and then it will be mine and the <lb/>
            Persians' care to do what remains to be done.</p>
          <p>156. Having given these injunctions, he went to the gates, <lb/>
            turning round as if he were really a deserter. But those who <lb/>
            were stationed in that quarter, seeing him from the turrets, ran <lb/>
            down, and having opened one door of the gate a little, asked him <lb/>
            who he was, and for what purpose he came. He told them that <lb/>
            lie was Zopyrus, and had deserted to them: the door-keepers <lb/>
            therefore, when they heard this, conducted him to the assem­ <lb/>
            bly of the Babylonians, and standing before them he deplored <lb/>
            his condition, saying that he had suffered from Darius the in­ <lb/>
            juries he had inflicted on himself, and that he was so treated <lb/>
            because he had advised to raise the siege, since there appeared <lb/>
            no means of taking the city. "Now, therefore," he said, <lb/>
            "I come to you, 0 Babylonians, the greatest blessing; and to <lb/>
            Darius, his army, and the Persians, the greatest mischief; for <lb/>
            lie shall not escape with impunity, having thus mutilated ine; <lb/>
            and I am acquainted with all his designs." 157. Thus he <lb/>
            spoke: but the Babylonians, seeing a man of distinction <lb/>
            among the Persians deprived of his ears and nose, and covered <lb/>
            with stripes and blood, thoroughly believing that he spoke the <lb/>
            truth, and that he had come as an ally to them, were ready to <lb/>
            intrust him with whatever he should ask: and he asked the <unclear/> <lb/>
            command of the forces. But he, having obtained this from them, <lb/>
            acted as he had preconcerted with Darius ; for on the tenth day, <lb/>
            leading out the army of the Babylonians, and having surround­ <lb/>
            ed the thousand, whom he had instructed Darius to station there <lb/>
            first, he cut them all in pieces. The Babylonians therefore <lb/>
            perceiving that he performed deeds suitable to his promises, <lb/>
            were exceedingly rejoiced, and were ready to obey him in <lb/>
            every thing. He, therefore, having suffered the appointed <lb/>
            number of days to elapse, and again having selected a body of <lb/>
            Babylonians, led them out and slaughtered the two thousand <lb/>
            of Darius's soldiers. But the Babylonians witnessing this action <lb/>
            also, all had the praises of Zopyrus on their tongues. Then <lb/>
            he again, having suffered the appointed number of days to <lb/>
            elapse, led out his troops according to the settled plan, and <lb/>
            having surrounded the four thousand, he cut them in pieces. <lb/>
            And when he had accomplished this, Zopyrus was every thing <lb/>
            to the Babylonians, and he was appointed commander-in-chief, <lb/>
            and guardian of the walls. 158. But when Darius, according <pb n="236"/>
             <note type="margin">[159, 160. </note> <lb/>
            to agreement, invested the wall all round, then Zopyrus dis­ <lb/>
            covered his whole treachery; for the Babylonians, mounting <lb/>
            on the wall, repelled the army of Darius that was attacking <lb/>
            them; but Zopyrus, having opened the Cissian and Belidian <lb/>
            gates, led the Persians within the wall. Those of the Baby­ <lb/>
            lonians who saw what was done, fled into the temple of Jupiter <lb/>
            Belus; and those who did not see it, remained each at their <lb/>
            post, until they also discovered that they had been betrayed.</p>
          <p>159. Thus Babylon was taken a second time. But when <lb/>
            Darius had made himself master of the Babylonians, first of all, <lb/>
            he demolished the walls and bore away all the gates, for when <lb/>
            Cyrus had taken Babylon before, he did neither of these <lb/>
            things ; and secondly, Darius impaled about three thousand <lb/>
            of the principal citizens, and allowed the rest of the Baby­ <lb/>
            lonians to inhabit the city. And that the Babylonians might <lb/>
            have wives, in order that offspring might grow up from them, <lb/>
            Darius made the following provision ; for the Babylonians had <lb/>
            strangled their wives, as already has been mentioned, to pre­ <lb/>
            vent the consumption of their provisions ; and to that end <lb/>
            he enjoined the neighbouring provinces to send women tc <lb/>
            Babylon, taxing each at a certain number, so that a total of fifty <lb/>
            thousand women came together; and from these the Baby­ <lb/>
            lonians of our time are descended. 160. No Persian, in the <lb/>
            opinion of Darius, either of those who came after, or lived <lb/>
            before, surpassed Zopyrus in great achievements, Cyrus only <lb/>
            excepted ; for with him no Persian ever ventured to compare <lb/>
            himself. It is also reported that Darius frequently expressed <lb/>
            this opinion, that he would rather Zopyrus had not suffered <lb/>
            ignominious treatment, than acquire twenty Babylons in ad. <lb/>
            dition to that he had. And he honoured him exceedingly ; <lb/>
            for he every year presented him with those gifts which are <lb/>
            most prized by the Persians, and he assigned him Babylon to <lb/>
            hold free from taxes during his life, and gave him many other <lb/>
            things in addition. From this Zopyrus sprung Megazybus, <lb/>
            who commanded the army in Egypt against the Athenians and <lb/>
            their allies; and from this Megabyzus sprung Zopyrus, who <lb/>
            deserted to the Athenians from the Persians.</p><pb n="237"/>

          <p>AFTER the capture of Babylon, Darius's expedition against <lb/>
            the Scythians took place ; for as Asia was flourishing in men, <lb/>
            and large revenues came in, Darius was desirous of re­ <lb/>
            venging himself upon the Scythians, because they formerly, <lb/>
            having invaded the Median territory, and defeated in battle <lb/>
            those that opposed them, were the first beginners of violence <lb/>
            For the Scythians, as I have before mentioned,1 ruled over <lb/>
            Upper Asia eight-and-twenty years. For while in pur­ <lb/>
            suit of the Cimmerians, they entered Asia, and overthrew the <lb/>
            empire of the Modes ;for these last, before the arrival of the <lb/>
            Scythians ruled over Asia. Those Scythians, however, after <lb/>
            they had been abroad eight-and-twenty years, and returned to <lb/>
            their own country, after such an interval, a task no less than the <lb/>
            invasion of Media awaited : for they found an army of no in­ <lb/>
            considerable force ready to oppose them ; for the wives of the <lb/>
            Scythians, seeing their husbands were a long time absent had <lb/>
            sought the company of. their slaves. 2. The Scythians de­ <lb/>
            prive all their slaves of sight for the sake of the milk which <lb/>
            they drink, doing as follows : when they have taken bone <lb/>
            tubes very like flutes, they thrust them into the genital parts <lb/>
            of the mares, and blow with their mouths; while some blow, <lb/>
            others milk.They say they do this for the following reason : <lb/>
            because the veins of the mare, being inflated, become filled, <lb/>
            and the udder is depressed. When they have finished milk­ <lb/>
            ing, they pour it into hollow wooden vessels, and having <lb/>
            placed the blind men round about the vessels, they agitate the <lb/>
            milk : and having skimmed off that which swims on the sur­<lb/>
            face,they consider it the most valuable, but that which sub-<note type="footnote"> 1 See Book 1. <unclear>cn</unclear>. 103, 105 </note> <pb n="238"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[3—5."/> <lb/>
            sides is of less value than the other. On this account the <lb/>
            Scythians put out the eyes of every prisoner they take ; for <lb/>
            they are not agriculturists, but feeders of cattle. 3. From <lb/>
            these slaves then and the women a race of youths had grown <lb/>
            up, who, when they knew their own extraction, opposed those <lb/>
            who were returning from Media. And first they cut off the <lb/>
            country by digging a wide ditch, stretching from Mount Tau­ <lb/>
            rus to the lake Mæotis, which is of great extent, and after­ <lb/>
            wards encamping opposite, they came to an engagement with <lb/>
            the Scythians, who were endeavouring to enter. When <lb/>
            several battles had been fought, and the Scythians were unable <lb/>
            to obtain any advantage, one of them said, " Men of Scythia, <lb/>
            what are we doing ? by fighting with our slaves, both we our­ <lb/>
            selves by being slain become fewer in number, and by killing <lb/>
            them we shall hereafter have fewer to rule over. Now there­ <lb/>
            fore it seems to me, that we should lay aside our spears and <lb/>
            bows, and that every one, taking a horsewhip, should go di­ <lb/>
            rectly to them; for so long as they saw us with arms, they <lb/>
            considered themselves equal to us, and born of equal birth ; <lb/>
            but when they shall see us with our whips instead of arms, <lb/>
            they will soon learn that they are our slaves, and being con­ <lb/>
            scious of that, will no longer resist." 4. The Scythians, hav­ <lb/>
            ing heard this, adopted the advice; and the slaves, struck <lb/>
            with astonishment at what was done, forgot to fight, and fled. <lb/>
            Thus the Scythians both ruled over Asia, and being after­ <lb/>
            wards expelled by the Medes, returned in this manner to their <lb/>
            own country : and for the above-mentioned reasons, Darius, <lb/>
            desiring to take revenge, assembled an army to invade them.</p>
          <p>5. As the Scythians say, theirs is the most recent of all <lb/>
            nations ; and it arose in the following manner. The first mail <lb/>
            that appeared in this country, which was a wilderness, was <lb/>
            named Targitaus : they say that the parents of this Targitaus, <lb/>
            in my opinion relating what is incredible,-they say, however, <lb/>
            that they were Jupiter and a daughter of the river Borys­ <lb/>
            thenes; that such was the origin of Targitaus: and that he <lb/>
            had three sons, who went by the names of Lipoxais, Apoxais, <lb/>
            and the youngest, Colaxais ; that during their reign a plough, <lb/>
            a yoke, an axe, and a bowl of golden workmanship, dropping <lb/>
            down from heaven, fell on the Scythian territory; that the <lb/>
            eldest, seeing them first, approached, intending to take them <lb/>
            up, but as he came near, the gold began to burn; when he <pb n="239"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="6—8.]"/> <lb/>
            had retired the second went up, and it did the same again; <lb/>
            accordingly the burning gold repulsed these; but when the <lb/>
            youngest went up the third, it became extinguished, and he <lb/>
            carried the things home with him; and that the elder brothers <lb/>
            in consequence of this giving way, surrendered the whole au­ <lb/>
            thority to the youngest. 6. From Lipoxais, they say, are <lb/>
            descended those Scythians who are called Auchatæ; from the <lb/>
            second, Apoxais, those who are called Catiari and Traspies; <lb/>
            and from the youngest of them, the royal race, who are called <lb/>
            Paralatæ. But all have the name of Scoloti, from the sur­ <lb/>
            name of their king; but the Grecians call them Scythians. <lb/>
            7. The Scythians say that such was their origin; and they <lb/>
            reckon the whole number of years from their first beginning, <lb/>
            from King Targitaus to the time that Darius crossed over <lb/>
            against them, to be not more than a thousand years, but just <lb/>
            that number. This sacred gold the kings watch with the <lb/>
            greatest care, and annually approach it with magnificent <lb/>
            sacrifices to render it propitious. If he who has the sacred <lb/>
            gold happens to fall asleep in the open air on the festival, the <lb/>
            Scythians say he cannot survive the year, and on this account <lb/>
            they give him as much land as he can ride round on horse­ <lb/>
            baick in one day. The country being very extensive, Colaxais <lb/>
            established three of the kingdoms for his sons, and made that <lb/>
            one the largest in which the gold is kept. The parts beyond <lb/>
            he north of the inhabited districts the Scythians say can <lb/>
            neither be seen nor passed through, by reason of the feathers2 <lb/>
            shed there; for that the earth and air are full of feathers, and <lb/>
            that it is these which intercept the view.</p>
          <p>8. Such is the account the Scythians give of themselves, <lb/>
            and of the country above them: but the Greeks who inhabit <lb/>
            Pontus give the following account: they say, that Hercules, <lb/>
            as he was driving away the herds of Geryon, arrived in this <lb/>
            country, that was then a desert, and which the Scythians now <lb/>
            nhabit: that Geryon, fixing his abode outside the Pontus, in­ <lb/>
            habited the island which the Greeks call Erythia, situate near <lb/>
            Gades, beyond the columns of Hercules in the ocean. The <unclear/> <lb/>
            cean, they say, beginning from the sun-rise, flows round the <lb/>
            vhole earth, but they do not prove it in fact; that Hercules <lb/>
            hence came to the country now called Scythia, and as a storm <lb/>
            nd frost overtook him, he drew his lion's skin over him, and <note type="footnote"> a See chap. 31. </note> <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="margin"> [9, 10 <lb/>
            </note>went to sleep ; and in the mean while his mares, which were <lb/>
            feeding apart from his chariot, vanished by some divine chance. <lb/>
            9. They add, that when Hercules awoke, he sought for them ; <lb/>
            and that having gone over the whole country, he at length came <lb/>
            to the land called Hylæa; there he found a monster, having two <lb/>
            natures, half virgin, half viper, of which the upper parts from <lb/>
            the buttocks resembled a woman, and the lower parts a serpent: <lb/>
            when he saw he was astonished, but asked her if she had any <lb/>
            where seen his strayed mares. She said that she herself had <lb/>
            them, and would not restore them to him before she had lain with <lb/>
            him : Hercules accordingly lay with her on these terms. She <lb/>
            however delayed giving back the mares, out of a desire to enjoy <lb/>
            the company of Hercules as long as she could; he however <lb/>
            was desirous of recovering them and departing; at last as she <lb/>
            restored the mares, she said, " These mares that strayed <lb/>
            hither I preserved for you, and you have paid me salvage, for <lb/>
            I have three sons by you ; tell me, therefore, what must I do <lb/>
            with them when they are grown up ; whether shall I establish <lb/>
            them here, for I possess the rule over this country, or shall I <lb/>
            send them to you ?" She asked this question, but he replied, <lb/>
            they say, "When you see the children arrived at the age of <lb/>
            men, you cannot err if you do this : whichever of them you <lb/>
            see able thus to bend this bow, and thus girding himself with <lb/>
            this girdle, make turn an inhabitant of this country ; and <lb/>
            whichever fails in these tasks which I enjoin, send out of the <lb/>
            country. If you do this, you will please yourself and perform <lb/>
            my injunctions. 10. Then having drawn out one of his bows, <lb/>
            for Hercules carried two at that time, and having shown her <lb/>
            the belt, he gave her both the bow and the belt, which had a <lb/>
            golden cup at the extremity of the clasp, and having given <lb/>
            them, he departed. But she, when the sons who were born to <lb/>
            her attained to the age of men, in the first place gave them <lb/>
            names ; to the first, Agathyrsis, to the second, Gelonus, and <lb/>
            to the youngest, Scythes ; and, in the next place, remembering <lb/>
            the orders, she did what had been enjoined ; and two of her <lb/>
            sons, Agathyrsis and Gelonus, being unable to come up to the <lb/>
            proposed task, left the country, being expelled by their mother; <lb/>
            but the youngest of them, Scythes, having accomplished it, <lb/>
            remained there. From this Scythes, son of Hercules, are de­ <lb/>
            scended those who have been successively kings of the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians ; and from the cup, the Scythians even to this day wear <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> 11, 12,] </note> <lb/>
            cups from their belts. This thing only the mother did for <lb/>
            Scythes. Such is the account given by the Greeks who in-habit Pontus</p>
          <p>11. There is another account, to the following effect, to <lb/>
            which I who myself rather incline. It is said, that the Scythian no­<lb/>
            mades who dwelt in Asia, being harassed in war by the Massa­<lb/>
            getæ, crossed the river Araxes, and entered the Cimmerian terri <lb/>
            tory: for the country which the Scythians now inhabit is said <lb/>
            have formerly belonged to the Cimmerians. The Cim­ <lb/>
            merians, when the Scythians invaded them, deliberated, see­ <lb/>
            ing a large army was coming against them ; however, their <lb/>
            opinions were divided, which both vehemently upheld, though <lb/>
            that of the kings was the best: for the opinion of the people <lb/>
            was, that it was, was necessary to retire, and that there was no <lb/>
            need3 to hazard a battle against superior numbers: but the <lb/>
            opinion of the kings was, that they should fight to the last for <lb/>
            their country against the invaders. When, therefore, neither <lb/>
            the people would submit to the kings, nor the kings to the <lb/>
            people; and one party resolved to depart without fighting <lb/>
            and abandon the country to the invaders, whilst the kings de­ <lb/>
            termined to die and be buried in their own country, and not <lb/>
            fly with the people, considering what great advantages they <lb/>
            had enjoyed, and how many misfortunes would probably befal <lb/>
            them if this they fled from their country: when they had come <lb/>
            to resolution, having divided, and being equal in num­ <lb/>
            bers, they fought with one another ; and the one party, the <lb/>
            royal race, having all perished, the people of the Cimmerians <lb/>
            buried them near the river Tyras; and their sepulchre is still <lb/>
            to be seen. After they had buried them, they then abandoned the <lb/>
            country, and the Scythians coming up, took possession of the <lb/>
            deserted country. 12. And there are now in Scythia Cim­ <lb/>
            merian fortifications and Cimmerian Porthmia4; there is also <lb/>
            a district named Cimmeria, and a bosphorus called Cimmeri­ <lb/>
            an .The Cimmerians evidently appear to have fled from the <lb/>
            Scythians into Asia, and settled in the peninsula in which the <lb/>
            Grecian city Sinope now stands: and it is evident that the <lb/>
            Scythians, pursuing them, and entering the Median territory, <lb/>
            missed their way ; the Cimmerians fled constantly by the <lb/>
            sea-coast; whereas the Scythians pursued, keeping Caucasus <lb/>
            on the right, until they entered the Median territory, towards <note type="footnote"> see Cary s I exicon v <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δέειν</foreign> num. 3. Passages or ferric. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[13—15,"/>the midland. This last account is given in common both by <lb/>
            Greeks and Barbarians.</p>
          <p>13. But Aristeas, son of Caystrobius, a native of Proconnesus, <lb/>
            says in his epic verses, that, inspired by Apollo, he came to the <lb/>
            Issedones ; that beyond the Issedones dwell the Arimaspians, a <lb/>
            people that have only one eye; and beyond them the gold-guard­ <lb/>
            ing griffins; and beyond these the Hyperboreans, who reach to <lb/>
            the sea: that all these, except the Hyperboreans, beginning <lb/>
            from the Arimaspians, continually encroached upon their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours ; that the Issedones were expelled from their country by <lb/>
            the Arimaspians, the Scythians by the Issedones, and that the <lb/>
            Cimmerians, who inhabited on the south sea, being pressed by <lb/>
            the Scythians, abandoned their country. Thus lie does not <lb/>
            agree with the Scythians respecting this country. 14. Of <lb/>
            what country Aristeas, who made these verses, was, has <lb/>
            already been mentioned, and I shall now relate the account I <lb/>
            heard of him in Proconnesus and Cyzicus. They say that <lb/>
            Aristeas, who was inferior to none of the citizens by birth, <lb/>
            entering into a fuller's shop in Proconnesus, died suddenly; <lb/>
            and that the fuller, having closed his workshop, went to ac­ <lb/>
            quaint the relatives of the deceased. When the report had <lb/>
            spread through the city, that Aristeas was dead, a certain <lb/>
            Cyzicenian, arriving from Artace, fell into a dispute with <lb/>
            those who made the report, affirming that he had met and <lb/>
            conversed with him on his way to Cyzicus ; and he vehemently <lb/>
            disputed the truth of the report, but the relations of the de­ <lb/>
            ceased went to the fuller's shop, taking with them what was <lb/>
            necessary, for the purpose -of carrying the body away, but <lb/>
            when the house was opened, Aristeas was not to be seen <lb/>
            either dead or alive.- They say, that afterwards, in the <lb/>
            seventh year he appeared in Proconnesus, composed those <lb/>
            verses, which by the Greeks are now called Arimaspian, and <lb/>
            having composed them, disappeared a second time. Such is <lb/>
            the story current in these cities. 15. But these things I <lb/>
            know happened to the Metapontines in Italy, three hundred <lb/>
            and forty years after the second disappearance of Aristeas, as <lb/>
            I discovered by computation in Proconnesus and Metapontium. <lb/>
            The Metapontines, say, that Aristeas himself, having <unclear>appeared</unclear> <lb/>
            in their country, exhorted them to erect an altar to Apollo, <lb/>
            and to place near it a statue bearing the name of Aristeas the <lb/>
            Proconnesian; for he said, that Apollo had visited their coun- <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="16—18.]"/> <lb/>
            try only of all the Italians, and that he himself, who was now <lb/>
            Aristeas, accompanied him; and that when he accompanied <lb/>
            the god, he was a crow; and after saying this, he vanished; <lb/>
            and the Metapontines say they sent to Delphi to inquire of <lb/>
            the god what the apparition of the man meant; but the <lb/>
            Pythian bade them obey the apparition, and if they obeyed, it <lb/>
            would conduce to their benefit: they accordingly, having re­ <lb/>
            ceived this answer, fulfilled the injunctions. And now a <lb/>
            statue bearing the name of Aristeas is placed near the image <lb/>
            of Apollo, and around it laurels are planted: the image is <lb/>
            placed in the public square. Thus much concerning Aristeas.</p>
          <p>16. No one knows with certainty what is beyond the coun­ <lb/>
            try, about which this account proceeds to speak ; for I have <lb/>
            not been able to hear of any one who says he has seen them <lb/>
            with his own eyes; nor even did Aristeas, of whom I have <lb/>
            just now made mention, say in his poems, that he went farther <lb/>
            than the Issedones, but of the parts beyond he spoke by hear­ <lb/>
            say, stating that the Issedones gave him his information. <lb/>
            But as far as we have been able to arrive at the truth with <lb/>
            accuracy from hearsay, the whole shall be related. 17. From <lb/>
            the port of the Borysthenitæ, for this is the most central part <lb/>
            of the sea-coast of all Scythia, the first people are the Calli­ <lb/>
            pidæ," being Greek-Scythians; beyond these is another nation, <lb/>
            called Alazones. These and the Callipidæ, in other respects, <lb/>
            follow the usages of the Scythians, but they both sow and <lb/>
            feed on wheat, onions, garlic, lentils, and millet; but beyond <lb/>
            the Alazones, dwell husbandmen, who do not sow wheat for <lb/>
            food, but for sale. Beyond these the Neuri5 dwell; and to <lb/>
            the; north of the Neuri the country is utterly uninhabited, as <lb/>
            far as I know. These nations are by the side of the river <lb/>
            Hypanis, to the west of the Borysthenes. 18. But if one <lb/>
            crosses the Borysthenes, the first country from the sea, is <lb/>
            Hylæa ; and from this higher up live Scythian agriculturists, <lb/>
            where the Greeks settled on the river Hypanis, called Borys­ <lb/>
            thenitæ, but they call themselves Olbiopolitæ. These Scythian <lb/>
            husbandmen then occupy the country eastward, for three <lb/>
            days' journey, extending to the river whose name is Panti­ <lb/>
            capes; and northward a passage of eleven days up the <lb/>
            Borysthenes. Beyond this region the country is desert for a <lb/>
            reat distance; and beyond the desert Androphagi6 dwell, who <note type="footnote"> 5 See chap. 51, 105 1 6 See chap. 106. </note> <note type="footnote"> B. i </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[19-23"/> <lb/>
            are a distinct people, and not in any respect Scythian. Be­ <lb/>
            yond this is really desert, and no nation of men is found <lb/>
            there, as far as we know. 19. The country eastward of these <lb/>
            Scythian agriculturists, when one crosses the river Panticapes, <lb/>
            nomodes occupy, who neither sow at all, nor plough; and all <lb/>
            this country is destitute of trees, except Hylæa. These nomades <lb/>
            occupy a tract eastward for fourteen days' journey, stretching <lb/>
            to the river Gerrhus. 20. Beyond the Gerrhus are the parts <lb/>
            called the Royal, and the most valiant and numerous of the <lb/>
            Scythians, who deem all other Scythians to be their slaves. <lb/>
            These extend southward to Taurica, and eastward to the <lb/>
            trench, which those sprung from the blind men dug, and to <lb/>
            the port on the lake Maeotis, which is called Cremni, and <lb/>
            some of them reach to the river Tanais. The parts above to <lb/>
            the north of the Royal Scythians, the Melanchlæni7 inhabit, a <lb/>
            distinct race, and not Scythian. But above the Melanchlæni <lb/>
            are lakes, and an uninhabited desert, as far as we know.</p>
          <p>21. After one crosses the river Tanais, it is no longer <lb/>
            Scythian, but the first region belongs to the Sauromatae,8 <lb/>
            who, beginning from the recess of the lake Mæotis, occupy the <lb/>
            country northward, for a fifteen days' journey, all destitute <lb/>
            both of wild and cultivated trees. Above these dwell the <lb/>
            Budini,9 occupying the second region, and possessing a coun­ <lb/>
            try thickly covered with all sorts of trees. 22. Above the <lb/>
            Budini, towards the north, there is first a desert of seven days' <lb/>
            journey, and next to the desert, if one turns somewhat to­ <lb/>
            wards the east, dwell the Thyssagetæ, a numerous and distinct <lb/>
            race, and they live by hunting. Contiguous to these, in the <lb/>
            same regions, dwell those who are called Iyrcæ, who also live <lb/>
            by hunting in the following manner: the huntsman, having <lb/>
            climbed a tree, lies in ambush, (and the whole country is <lb/>
            thickly wooded,) and each man has a horse ready, taught to <lb/>
            lie on his belly, that he may not be much above the ground, <lb/>
            and a dog besides. When he sees any game from the tree, <lb/>
            having let fly an arrow, and mounted his horse, he goes in <lb/>
            pursuit, and the do- keeps close to him. Above these, as one <lb/>
            bends towards the east, dwell other Scythians, who revolted <lb/>
            from the Royal Scythians, and so came to this country. 23. <lb/>
            As far as the territory of these Scythians, the whole country <note type="footnote"> 7 See chap. 107. </note><note type="footnote">8 See chap 116. </note><note type="footnote">9 See chap. 108. </note> <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin"> 24, 25.] </note> <lb/>
            that has been described is level and deep-soiled; but after <lb/>
            this it is stony and rugged. When one has passed through a <lb/>
            considerable extent of the rugged country, a people are found <lb/>
            living at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all <lb/>
            bald from their birth, both men and women alike, and they <lb/>
            are flat-nosed, and have large chins; they speak a peculiar <lb/>
            language, wear the Scythian costume, and live on the fruit of <lb/>
            a tree: the name of the tree on which they live is called ponti­ <lb/>
            con, about the size of a fig-tree ; it bears fruit like a bean, and <lb/>
            has a stone. When this is ripe they strain it through a cloth, <lb/>
            and a thick and black liquor flows from it; the name of what <lb/>
            flows from it is aschy; this they suck, and drink mingled with <lb/>
            milk: from the thick sediment of the pulp they make cakes, <lb/>
            and feed on them; for they have not many cattle in these <lb/>
            parts, as the pastures there are not good. Every man lives <lb/>
            under a tree in the winter; when he has covered the tree with <lb/>
            a thick white woollen covering; but in summer, without the <lb/>
            woollen covering. No man does any injury to this people, for <lb/>
            they are accounted sacred; nor do they possess any warlike <lb/>
            weapon. And in the first place, they determine the differences <lb/>
            that arise among their neighbours; and in the next place, <lb/>
            whoever takes refuge among them, is injured by no one. <lb/>
            They are called Argippæi.</p>
          <p>24. As tar, then, as these bald people, our knowledge re­ <lb/>
            specting the country and the nations before them is very <lb/>
            good, for some Scythians frequently go there, from whom it is <lb/>
            not difficult to obtain information, as also from Greeks be­ <lb/>
            longing to the port of the 'Borysthenes, and other ports in <lb/>
            Pontus. The Scythians who go to them transact business by <lb/>
            means ot seven interpreters and seven languages. 25. So far <lb/>
            then is known; but beyond the bald men no one can speak <lb/>
            with certainty, for lofty and impassable mountains form their <lb/>
            boundary, and no one has ever crossed them; but these bald <lb/>
            men say, what to me is incredible, that men with goats' feet <lb/>
            inhabit these mountains; and when one has passed beyond <lb/>
            them, other men are found, who sleep six months at a time, <lb/>
            but this I do not at all admit. However, the country eastward <lb/>
            of the bald men is well known, being inhabited by Issedones, <lb/>
            though the country above to the north, either of the bald men <lb/>
            or the Issedones, is utterly unknown, except only such things <pb n="246"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[26—28"/> <lb/>
            as these people relate. 26. The Issedones are said to observe <lb/>
            these customs. When a man's father dies, all his relations <lb/>
            oring cattle, and then having sacrificed them, and cut up the <lb/>
            flesh, they cut up also the dead parent of their host, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing mingled all the flesh together, they spread out a banquet; <lb/>
            then having made bare and cleansed his head, they gild it; <lb/>
            and afterwards they treat it as a sacred image,1 performing <lb/>
            grand annual sacrifices to it. A son does this to his father, as <lb/>
            the Greeks celebrate the anniversary of their father's death. <lb/>
            These people are likewise accounted just; and the women <lb/>
            have equal authority with the men. These, then, are well <lb/>
            known.</p>
          <p>27. Above them, the Issedones affirm, are the men with <lb/>
            only one eye, and the gold-guarding griffins. The Scythians <lb/>
            repeat this account, having received if from them ; and we <lb/>
            have adopted it from the Scythians, and call them, in the Scy­ <lb/>
            thian language, Arimaspi ; for Arima, in the Scythian lan­ <lb/>
            guage, signifies one, and Spou, the eye. 28. All this country <lb/>
            which I have been speaking of is subject to such a severe <lb/>
            winter, that for eight months the frost is so intolerable, that <lb/>
            if you pour water on the ground you will not make mud, but <lb/>
            if you light a fire you will make mud. Even the sea freezes, <lb/>
            and the whole Cimmerian bosphorus ; and the Scythians <lb/>
            who live within the trench, lead their armies and drive <lb/>
            their chariots over the ice to the Sindians, on the other side. <lb/>
            Thus winter continues eight months, and during the other <lb/>
            four it is cold there. And this winter is different in character <lb/>
            from the winters in all other countries; for in this no rain <lb/>
            worth mentioning falls in the usual season, but during the <lb/>
            summer it never leaves off raining. At the time when there <lb/>
            is thunder elsewhere there is none there, but in summer it is <lb/>
            violent: if there should be thunder in winter, it is account­ <lb/>
            ed a prodigy to be wondered at. So, should there be an earth­ <lb/>
            quake, whether in summer or winter, in Scythia it is ac­ <lb/>
            counted a prodigy. Their horses endure this cold, but their <lb/>
            esses and mules cannot endure it at all; but in other places, <lb/>
            horses that stand exposed to frost become frost-bitten in <note type="footnote"> I I have adopted Baehr's interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγάλματι</foreign>, in preference to <lb/>
            that of Schweighæuser, who considers it to mean " a sacred ormament, <lb/>
            or to that of Larcher, who takes it to mean "a precious vessel. </note> <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="29-33.]"/> <lb/>
            the cold, waste away but asses and mules endure it. 29. <lb/>
            On this account also the race of beeves appears to me to <lb/>
            be defective there, and not to have horns ; and the follow­ <lb/>
            ing verse of Homer, in his Odyssey,2 confirms my opinion : <lb/>
            " And Libya, where the lambs soon put forth their horns <lb/>
            rightly observing, that in warm climates horns shoot out <lb/>
            quickly ; but in very severe cold, the cattle either do not pro­ <lb/>
            duce them at all, or if they do produce them they do so with <lb/>
            difficulty. Here,then, such are the effects of the cold. 30. I <lb/>
            am surprised, (for my narrative has from its commencement <lb/>
            sought for digressions,) that in the whole territory of Elis <lb/>
            no mules are able to breed, though neither is the climate cold, <lb/>
            nor is there any other visible cause. The Eleans themselves <lb/>
            say, that mules do not breed with them in consequence of a <lb/>
            curse ; <unclear>therefors</unclear>, when the time for the mares breeding ap­ <lb/>
            proaches, they lead them to the neighbouring districts, and <lb/>
            there put the he-asses with them, until they are in foal; then <lb/>
            they drive them home again. 31. With respect to the feathers, <lb/>
            with which the Scythians say the air is filled, and that on aer <lb/>
            count of them it is not possible either to see farther upon the <lb/>
            continent, or to pass through it, I entertain the following <lb/>
            opinion : in the upper parts of this country it continually snows, <lb/>
            less in summer than in winter, as is reasonable ; now, who­ <lb/>
            ever has seen snow falling thick near him, will know what I <lb/>
            mean.; for snow is like feathers: and on account of the <lb/>
            winter' being so severe, the northern parts of this continent <lb/>
            are uninhabited. I think, then,that the Scythians and their <lb/>
            neighbours call the snow feathers, comparing3 them together. <lb/>
            These regions, therefore, which are said to be the most remote, <lb/>
            have been sufficiently described.</p>
          <p>32. Concerning the Hyperboreans, neither the Scythians <lb/>
            say any thing,'nor any people of those parts, except the Isse­ <lb/>
            dones; and, as I think, neither do they say any thing, for <lb/>
            then the Scythians would mention it, as they do the one-eyed <lb/>
            people. Hesiod, however, has made mention of the Hyper­ <lb/>
            boreans, and Homer, in the Epigorii, if indeed Homer was in <lb/>
            reality the author of that poem, 33. But the Delians say <lb/>
            very much more than any others about .them, affirming, that <lb/>
            sacred things, wrapped in wheat-straw, were brought from <lb/>
            the Hyperboreans and came to the Scythians; and from the <note type="footnote"> 2 a. IV. l. 85. </note><note type="footnote">4 That is, " speaking figuratively," </note> <pb n="248"/>
            <note type="margin"> [34, 35 </note> <lb/>
            Scythians each contiguous nation receiving them in succession, <lb/>
            carried them to the extreme west as far as the Adriatic ; that <lb/>
            being forwarded thence towards the south, the Dodonaeans, <lb/>
            the first of the Greeks, received them ; that from them they <lb/>
            descended to the Maliac Gulf, and passed over into Euboca, and <lb/>
            that one city sent them on to another as far as Carystus; that <lb/>
            after this Andros was passed by, for the Carystians conveyed <lb/>
            them to Tenos, and the Tenians to Delos: in this manner <lb/>
            they say these sacred things reached Delos. They add, that <lb/>
            the Hyperboreans first sent two virgins, whom they call by <lb/>
            the names of Hyperoche and Laodice, to carry these sacred <lb/>
            things; and with them, for the sake of safety, the Hypesboreans <lb/>
            sent five of their citizens as attendants, the same who are now <lb/>
            called Perpherees, and are held in high honour at Delos. But <lb/>
            when those who were sent out by the Hyperboreans did not <lb/>
            return, they, thinking it a grievous thing if it should always <lb/>
            happen to them not to receive back those whom they sent <lb/>
            out, therefore carried their offerings wrapped in wheat-straw <lb/>
            to their borders, and enjoined their neighbours to forward <lb/>
            them to the next nation ; and these being so forwarded, they <lb/>
            say, reached Delos. I myself know that the following prac­ <lb/>
            tice is observed, resembling that of these sacred things: <lb/>
            the Thracian and Pæonian women, when they sacrifice to <lb/>
            Royal Diana, do not offer their sacrifices without wheat- <lb/>
            straw ; and I know that they do this. 34. In honour of these <lb/>
            Hyperborean virgins who died in Delos, both the virgins and <lb/>
            youths of the Delians shear their hair: the former, having cut <lb/>
            off a lock before marriage, and having wound it about a dis­ <lb/>
            tant, lay it upon the sepulchre; the sepulchre is within the <lb/>
            temple of Diana, on the left as one enters, and on it grows an <lb/>
            olive tree: the youths of the Delians having wound some of <lb/>
            their hair round a plant, place it also on the sepulchre. These <lb/>
            virgins receive such honour from the inhabitants of Delos. <lb/>
            35. These same persons also affirm, that Arge and Opis, who <lb/>
            were Hyperborean virgins, passing through the same nations, <lb/>
            came to Delos, even before Hyperoche and Laodice: that <lb/>
            these last came to bring the tribute they bad agreed to pay to <lb/>
            Ilithya for a speedy delivery; but they say that Arge and <lb/>
            Opis arrived with the gods themselves, and that different <lb/>
            honours are paid them by themselves, for that the women col­ <lb/>
            lect contributions for them, calling on their names in a hymn. <pb n="249"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="36-39.]"/> <lb/>
            which Olen, a Lycian, composed for them; and that the island­ <lb/>
            ers and Ionians afterwards, having learnt it from them, cele­ <lb/>
            brate Opis and Arge in song, mentioning their names, and <lb/>
            collecting contributions; (now this Olen, coming from Lycia, <lb/>
            composed also the other ancient hymns which are sung in <lb/>
            Delos;) and that the ashes of the thighs burnt on the altar are <lb/>
            thrown and expended on the sepulchre of Opis and Arge: but <lb/>
            their sepulchre is behind the temple of Diana, facing the east. <lb/>
            very near the banqueting-room of the Ceians. 36. And thus <lb/>
            much may be said concerning the Hyperboreans, for I do not <lb/>
            relate the story concerning Abaris, who was said to be an <lb/>
            Hyperborean, to the effect that he carried an arrow round the <lb/>
            whole earth without eating any thing. If, however, there are <lb/>
            Hyperboreans, there must also be Hypernotians. But I smile <lb/>
            when I see many persons describing the circumference of the <lb/>
            earth, who have no sound reason to guide them; they describe <lb/>
            the ocean flowing round the earth, which is made circular as. <lb/>
            if by a lathe, and make4 Asia equal to Europe. I will there­ <lb/>
            fore briefly show the dimensions of each of them, and what is <lb/>
            the figure of each.</p>
          <p>37. The Persian settlements extend to the southern sea, <lb/>
            called the Erythræan ; above them to the north are the Medes ; <lb/>
            above the Medes, the Saspires; and above the Saspires, the <lb/>
            Colchians, who reach to the northern sea, into which the <lb/>
            river Phasis discharges itself. These four nations occupy <lb/>
            the space from sea to sea. 38. Thence westward two tracts <lb/>
            stretch out to the sea, which I shall describe. On one side, <lb/>
            the one tract, beginning at the north from the Phasis, extends <lb/>
            along the Euxine and the Hellespont, as far as the Trojan <lb/>
            Sigæum ; and on the south, this same tract, beginning from <lb/>
            the Myriandrian Gulf, which is adjacent to Phoenicia, stretches <lb/>
            towards the sea as far as the Triopian promontory. In this <lb/>
            tract dwell thirty different nations. This, then, is one of the <lb/>
            tracts. 39. The other, beginning at Persia, reaches to the <lb/>
            Red Sea; it comprises Persia, and after that Assyria, and after <lb/>
            Assyria, Arabia ; it terminates (terminating only by custom) <lb/>
            at the Arabian Gulf, into which Darius carried a canal5 from <note type="footnote"> 4 Baehr observes that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιεύντων</foreign> is the genitive participle, depending <lb/>
            on <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελω̄</foreign> preceding; "I smile when they make Asia equal to Europe." <lb/>
            It would be difficult to express the connexion in an English version. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 See B. II. chap. 158. </note> <pb n="250"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[40-43."/> <lb/>
            the Nile. Now, as far as Phœnicia from Persia the country it <lb/>
            wide and open, but from Phcenicia the same tract stretches <lb/>
            along this sea by Syrian Palestine and Egypt, where it ter­ <lb/>
            minates ; in it are only three nations. These, then, are the <lb/>
            parts of Asia that lie westward of Persia. 40. Beyond the <lb/>
            Persians, Medes, Saspires, and Colchians, towards the east <lb/>
            and rising sun, extends the Red Sea, and on the north the <lb/>
            Caspian Sea and the river Araxes, which flows towards the <lb/>
            rising sun. Asia is inhabited as far as India; but beyond <lb/>
            this, it is all desert towards the east, nor is any one abL; to <lb/>
            describe what it is. Such and so great is Asia.</p>
          <p>, 41. Libya is in the other tract; for Libya commences from <lb/>
            Egypt. Now in Egypt this tract is narrow ; for from this <lb/>
            sea to the Red Sea are a hundred thousand orgyæ, which make <lb/>
            one thousand stades. But from this narrow neck the tract <lb/>
            which is called Libya becomes very wide. 42. I wonder <lb/>
            therefore at those who have described the limits of and di­ <lb/>
            vided Libya, Asia, and Europe, for the difference between <lb/>
            them is not trifling : for in length Europe extends along both <lb/>
            of them, but with respect to width, it is evidently not to be <lb/>
            compared.6 Libya shows Itself to be surrounded by water, ex­ <lb/>
            cept so much of it as borders upon Asia. Neco, king of <lb/>
            Egypt, was the first whom we know of, that proved this; he, <lb/>
            when he had ceased digging the canal leading from the Nile <lb/>
            to the Arabian Gulf, sent certain Phœnicians in ships, with <lb/>
            orders to sail back through the pillars of Hercules into the <lb/>
            northern sea,7 and so to return to Egypt. The Phœnicians <lb/>
            accordingly, setting out from the Red Sea, navigated the <lb/>
            southern sea; when autumn came, they went ashore, and <lb/>
            sowed the land, by whatever part of Libya they happened to <lb/>
            be sailing, and waited for harvest; then having reaped the <lb/>
            corn, they put to sea again. When two years had thus pass­ <lb/>
            ed, in the third, having doubled the pillars of Hercules, they <lb/>
            arrived in Egypt, and related what to me does not seem <lb/>
            credible, but may to others, that as they sailed round <lb/>
            Libya, they had the sun on their right hand. Thus was <lb/>
            Libya first known. 43. Subsequently the Carthaginians say <lb/>
            that Libya is surrounded by water. For Sataspes, son of Te­ <lb/>
            aspes, one of the Achœmenidœ, did not sail round Libya <note type="footnote"> 5 He means, .. it is much wider than either of them." </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Meaning " the Mediterranean," which was north of Libyp </note> <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> 44.] <lb/>
            </note>though sent for that very purpose ; but dreading the length <lb/>
            of the voyage and the desolation, returned home and did not <lb/>
            accomplish the task which his mother imposed upon him: for <lb/>
            be had violated a virgin, daughter of Zopyrus, son of Mega­ <lb/>
            byzus ; whereupon, when he was about to be impaled for this <lb/>
            offence by king Xerxes, the mother of Sataspes, who was sis­ <lb/>
            ter to Darius, begged him off, promising that she would inflict <lb/>
            a greater punishment upon him than he would, for, she <lb/>
            wouldconstrain him to sail round Libya, until, sailing round, <lb/>
            he should reach the Arabian Gulf. Xerxes having agreed on <lb/>
            these terms, Sataspes went into Egypt, and having taken a ship <lb/>
            and men from thence, sailed through the pillars of Hercules <lb/>
            and having sailed through, and doubled the cape of Libya, <lb/>
            whose name is Solois, he steered to the southward: but after <lb/>
            traversing avast extent of sea in many months, when he <lb/>
            found that he had still more to pass, he turned back and sail­ <lb/>
            ed away for Egypt. From thence going to king Xerxes, he <lb/>
            ofhimnthat in the most distant part he sailed past a nation <lb/>
            of little men, who wore garments made of palm leaves, who, <lb/>
            whenever they drew to shore, left their cities and flew to the <lb/>
            mountains; that his men, when they entered their country, <lb/>
            did them no injury, but only took some cattle from them. Of <lb/>
            his not sailing completely round Libya, this he said was the <lb/>
            cause ; that his ship could not proceed any farther, but was <lb/>
            stopped. Xerxes, however, being persuaded that he did not <lb/>
            speak the truth, as he had not accomplished the task imposed <lb/>
            upon him, impaled him, inflicting the original sentence. A <lb/>
            eunuch of this Sataspes, as soon as he heard of his master'a <lb/>
            death, ran away to Samos with great wealth, which a Samian <lb/>
            detained : though I know his name, I purposely conceal it.</p>
          <p>44. A great part of Asia was explored under the direction <lb/>
            ofDarius.He being desirous to know in what part the Indus, <lb/>
            Inch is the second river that produces crocodiles, discharges <lb/>
            self into the sea, sent in ships both others on whom he could <unclear/> <lb/>
            cly to make a true report, and also Scylax of Caryanda. They <lb/>
            'cordingly, setting out from the city of Caspatyrus and thecoun­ <lb/>
            y of Pactyice, sailed down the river towards the east and sun­ <lb/>
            se to the sea; then sailing on the sea westward, they arrived in <lb/>
            e thirtieth month at that place where the king of Egypt des­ <lb/>
            tchedthe Phœnicians, whom I before mentioned, to sail <lb/>
            rund Libya. After these persons had sailed round, Darius <pb n="252"/>
             <note type="margin">[45, 46 </note> <lb/>
            subdued the Indians, and frequented this sea. Thus the other <lb/>
            parts of Asia, except towards the rising sun, are found to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit things similar to Libya.</p>
          <p>46. Whether Europe is surrounded by water either towards <lb/>
            the east or towards the north, has not been fully discovered <lb/>
            by any man ; but in length it is known to extend beyond both <lb/>
            the other continents. Nor can I conjecture for what reason <lb/>
            three different names have been given to the earth, which is <lb/>
            but one, and those derived from the names of women ; nor why <lb/>
            the Egyptian river Nile and the Colchian Phasis have been <lb/>
            assigned as boundaries to it; (some say, the Mæotian river <lb/>
            Tanais, and the Cimmerian Porthmeia ;) nor can I learn the <lb/>
            names of those who made this division, nor from whence they <lb/>
            derived the appellations. Libya is said by most of the Greeks <lb/>
            to take its name from a native woman of the name of Libya ; <lb/>
            and Asia, from the wife of Prometheus. But the Lydians <lb/>
            claim this name, saying that Asia was so called after Asius, son <lb/>
            of Cotys, son of Manes, and not after Asia the wife of Promethe­ <lb/>
            us ; from whom also a tribe in Sardis is called the Asian tribe. <lb/>
            Whether Europe, then, is surrounded by water is known by no <lb/>
            man ; nor is it clear whence it received this name, nor who <lb/>
            gave it, unless we will say that the region received the name <lb/>
            from the Tyrian Europa, but was before without a name, like <lb/>
            the others: yet she evidently belonged to Asia, and never <lb/>
            came into that country which is now called Europe by the <lb/>
            Grecians ; but only passed from Phœnicia to Crete, and from <lb/>
            Crete to Lycia. Thus much may suffice for this subject, for <lb/>
            we shall adopt the names in common use.</p>
          <p>46. The Euxine Sea, to which Darius led an army of all <lb/>
            countries, except the Scythians, exhibits the most ignorant <lb/>
            nations : for we are unable to mention any one nation of those <lb/>
            on this side the Pontus that has any pretensions to intelligence; <lb/>
            nor have we ever heard of any learned man among them, ex­ <lb/>
            cept the Scythian nation and Anacharsis. By the Scythian <lb/>
            nation one the most important of human devices has been con­ <lb/>
            trived more wisely than by any others whom we know ; their <lb/>
            other customs however I do not admire. This most important <lb/>
            device has been so contrived, that no one who attacks them <lb/>
            can escape ; and that, if they do not choose to be found, no one <lb/>
            is able to overtake them. For they, who have neither cities <lb/>
            nor fortifications, but carry their houses with them, who are <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="47—49.]"/> <lb/>
            all equesterian archers, living not from the cultivation of the <lb/>
            earth, but from cattle, and whose dwellings are waggons,­ <lb/>
            how must not such a people be invincible, and difficult to en­ <lb/>
            gage with ? 47. This device has been contrived by them, as <lb/>
            the country is fit for it, and the rivers aid them : for the <lb/>
            country, being level, abounds in herbage and is well watered ; <lb/>
            and rivers flow through it almost as numerous as the canals in <lb/>
            Egypt. Such of them as are celebrated and navigable from <lb/>
            the sea I will mention : the Ister, that has five mouths ; then <lb/>
            the ,Tyres, the Hypanis, the Borysthenes, the Panticapes, the <lb/>
            Hypacyris, the Gerrhus, and the Tanais. These flow as follows.</p>
          <p>48. The Ister, which is the greatest of all the rivers we <lb/>
            know, flows always with an equal stream both in summer and <lb/>
            winter. Flowing the first of those in Scythia from the west, <lb/>
            it is on this account the greatest, because other rivers discharge <lb/>
            themselves into it. The following are those that make it great: <lb/>
            there are five that flow through Scythia ; one which the <lb/>
            Scythians call Porata, but the Grecians Pyretos; another the <lb/>
            Tiarantus, then the Aratus, the Naparis, and the Ordessus. <lb/>
            The first mentioned of these rivers is large, and flowing to­ <lb/>
            wards the east, communicates its water with the Ister ; that <lb/>
            mentioned second, the Tiarantus, is more to the west and less; <lb/>
            the Aratus, the Naparis, and Ordessus, passing between these, <lb/>
            fall likewise into the Ister. These indigenous Scythian <lb/>
            rivers assist in filling it. 49. The river Marls, flowing from <lb/>
            the Agathyrsi, mingles with the Ister. From the summits of <lb/>
            Mount Haemus three other large rivers, flowing towards the <lb/>
            north, empty themselves into it, the Atlas, the Auras, and the <lb/>
            Tibisis: the Athres, the Noes, and the Atarnes, flowing <lb/>
            through Thrace and the Thracian Crobyzi, discharge them­ <lb/>
            selves into the Ister ; and from the Pæonians and Mount <lb/>
            Rhodope, the river Scios, dividing the Hæmus in the middle, <lb/>
            discharges itself into it. And the river Angrus, flowing from <lb/>
            the Illyrians towards the north, empties itself into the <lb/>
            Triballic plain and into the river Brongus, and the Brongus <lb/>
            into the Ister ; thus the Ister receives both these, which are <lb/>
            considerable. From the country above the Umbrici, the river <lb/>
            Carpis and another river, Alpis, flowing towards the north, <lb/>
            also discharge themselves into it. For the Ister flows through <lb/>
            all Europe, beginning from the Celts, who, next to the Cynetæ, 2 <note type="footnote"> 3 See B. II. chap. 33 </note> <pb n="254"/>

            inhabit the remotest parts of Europe towards the west; <lb/>
            and flowing through all Europe, enters the borders of Scythia. <lb/>
            50. By these, then, that have been mentioned, and many other <lb/>
            rivers that contribute their waters, the Ister becomes the <lb/>
            greatest of all rivers. For if we compare one stream with <lb/>
            another, the Nile surpasses in quantity; for into this no river <lb/>
            or fountain discharging itself contributes to its increase. But <lb/>
            the Ister always flows equal in summer and in winter, for the <lb/>
            following reason, as I think : during the winter it is about as <lb/>
            large as it usually is, and perhaps a little larger ; for this <lb/>
            country is very little moistened by rain during the winter, <lb/>
            but is entirely covered with snow : in the summer, the snow, <lb/>
            that fell in the winter in vast quantities, dissolving on all <lb/>
            sides, flows into the Ister ; and this snow flowing into it as­ <lb/>
            sists in filling it, and frequent and violent rains besides ; for <lb/>
            it rains much in summer. By how much therefore the sun <lb/>
            draws up to himself more water in summer than in winter, by <lb/>
            so much the waters mingled with the Ister are greater in sum­ <lb/>
            mer than in winter; and these things therefore being opposed, <lb/>
            an equilibrium results, so that it is always found to be equal.</p>
          <p>51. One of the rivers, then, of the Scythians is the Ister ; <lb/>
            after this is the Tyres, which proceeds from the north, and <lb/>
            begins flowing from a vast lake, which separates Scythia <lb/>
            and Neuris. At its mouth are settled Grecians, who are <lb/>
            called Tyritæ. 52. The third river, the Hypanis, proceeds <lb/>
            from Scythia and flows from a vast lake, around which wild <lb/>
            white horses graze. This lake is rightly called the mother-of <lb/>
            the Hypanis. The river Hypanis, then, rising from this, is <lb/>
            small and still sweet for a five days' voyage, but from thence, <lb/>
            for a four days' voyage to the sea, it is exceedingly bitter ; for <lb/>
            a bitter fountain discharges itself into it, which is so very <lb/>
            bitter, though small in size, that it taints the Hypanis, which <lb/>
            is a considerable river amongst small ones. This fountain is <lb/>
            on the borders of the territory of the Scythian husbandmen <lb/>
            and the Alazones ; the name of the fountain, and of the dis­ <lb/>
            trict whence it flows, is, in the Scythian language, Exampæus, <lb/>
            but in the language of the Greeks, " The sacred ways." The <lb/>
            Tyres and Hypanis contract their boundaries in the country <lb/>
            of the Alazones ; but after that, each turning away, flows en <lb/>
            widening the intermediate space.</p>
          <p>53. The fourth is the river Borysthenes, which is the <pb n="255"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="54—56.]"/> <lb/>
            largest of these after the Ister,'and, in my opinion, the most <lb/>
            productive, not only of the Scythian rivers, but of all others, <lb/>
            except the Egyptian Nile; for to this it is impossible to com­ <lb/>
            pare any other river, but of the rest the Borysthenes is the <lb/>
            most productive. It affords the most excellent and valuable <lb/>
            pasture for cattle, and fish of the highest excellence and in <lb/>
            great quantities ; it is most sweet to drink ; It flows pure in <lb/>
            the midst of turbid rivers; the sown land near it-is of the <lb/>
            best quality ; and the herbage, where the land is not sown, is <lb/>
            very, tall; at its mouth abundance of salt is crystallized spon­ <lb/>
            taneously ; and it produces large whales, without any spinal <lb/>
            bones, which they call Antacæi, fit for salting, and many <lb/>
            other things that deserve admiration. As far as the country <lb/>
            of Gerrhus, a voyage of forty days, this river is known to <lb/>
            flow from the north ; but above that, through what people it <lb/>
            flows no one is able to tell: but it evidently flows through a <lb/>
            desert to the country of the agricultural Scythians ; for these <lb/>
            Scythians dwell near it for the space of a ten days' voyage. <lb/>
            Of this river only, and of the Nile, I am unable to describe <lb/>
            the sources ; and I think that no Greek can do so. The <lb/>
            Borysthenes continues flowing near the sea, and the Hypanis <lb/>
            mingles with it, discharging itself into the same morass. <lb/>
            The space between these rivers, which is a projecting <lb/>
            piece of land, is called the promontory of Hippoleon, and in <lb/>
            it a temple of Ceres is built; beyond the temple on the Hy­ <lb/>
            panis the Borysthenitæ are settled. Thus much concerning <lb/>
            these rivers.</p>
          <p>54. After these is the fifth river, the name of which is the <lb/>
            Panticapes ; this also flows from the north, and out of a lake ; <lb/>
            and between this and the Borysthenes dwell the agricultural <lb/>
            Scythians ; it discharges itself into Hylæa, and having passed <lb/>
            through that region, mingles with the Borysthenes. 55. The <lb/>
            HypacyrisIS the sixth river, which proceeds from a lake, and <lb/>
            flowing through the middle of the Scythian nomades, dis­ <lb/>
            charges itself near the city Carcinitis, skirting Hylæa on the <lb/>
            right, and that which is called the Course of Achilles. 56. <lb/>
            The seventh river, the Gerrhus, is separated from the Borys­ <lb/>
            thenes near the place at which the Borysthenes is'first known. <lb/>
            It is separated then from this very spot, and has the same <lb/>
            lame as the country, Gerrhus ; and'flowing towards the sea. <lb/>
            t divides the territory of the Nomadic and the Royal Scy- <pb n="256"/>
             <note type="margin">57 </note> <lb/>
            thians, and discharges itself into the Hypacyris. 57. The <lb/>
            eighth river is the Tanais, which flows originally from a vast <lb/>
            lake, and discharges itself into a still larger lake, called Mæ­ <lb/>
            otis, which divides the Royal Scythians and the Sauromatæ. <lb/>
            Into this river Tanais runs another river, the name of which <lb/>
            is Hyrgis. 58. Thus the Scythians are provided with these <lb/>
            celebrated rivers. The grass that grows in Scythia is the <lb/>
            most productive of bile for cattle of any with which we are <lb/>
            acquainted ; and when the cattle are opened one may infer <lb/>
            that such is the case.</p>
          <p>59. Thus the greatest commodities are furnished them in <lb/>
            abundance. Their other customs are established as follows. <lb/>
            They propitiate the following gods only : Vesta, most of all; <lb/>
            then Jupiter, deeming the Earth to be the wife of Jupiter ; <lb/>
            after these Apollo, and Venus Urania, and Hercules, and <lb/>
            Mars. All the Scythians acknowledge these; but those who <lb/>
            are called Royal Scythians, sacrifice also to Neptune. Vesta, <lb/>
            in the Scythian language, is named Tabiti ; Jupiter is, in my <lb/>
            opinion, very rightly called Papaeus ; the Earth, Apia ; Apol­ <lb/>
            lo, Œtosyrus;. Venus Urania, Artimpasa; and Neptune, <lb/>
            Thamimasadas. They are not accustomed to erect images, <lb/>
            altars, and temples, except to Mars ; to him they are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed. 60. The same mode of sacrificing is adopted by all, <lb/>
            with respect to all kinds of victims, alike, being as follows : <lb/>
            the victim itself stands with its fore-feet tied together ; he <lb/>
            who sacrifices, standing behind the beast, having drawn the <lb/>
            extremity of the cord, throws it down ; and as the victim falls <lb/>
            he invokes the god to whom he is sacrificing ; then he throws <lb/>
            a halter round its neck, and having put in a stick, he twists it <lb/>
            round and strangles it, without kindling any fire, or performing <lb/>
            any preparatory ceremonies, or making any libation, but hav­ <lb/>
            ing strangled and flayed it he applies himself to cook it. 61. <lb/>
            As the Scythian country is wholly destitute of wood, they <lb/>
            have invented the following method of cooking flesh. When <lb/>
            they have flayed the victims, they strip the flesh from the <lb/>
            bones, then they put it into cauldrons made in the country, if <lb/>
            they happen to have any, which very much resemble Lesbian <lb/>
            bowls, except that they are much'larger ; having put it into <lb/>
            these, they cook it by burning underneath the bones of the <lb/>
            victims. If they have no cauldron at hand, they put all the <lb/>
            flesh into the paunches of the victims, and having poured in <pb n="257"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="62-64.]"/> <lb/>
            water, burn the bones underneath : they burn very well, and <lb/>
            the paunches easily contain the flesh stripped from the bones ; <lb/>
            thus the ox cooks himself, and all other victims each cooks it­ <lb/>
            self. When the flesh is cooked, he that sacrifices, offering <lb/>
            the first-fruits of the flesh and entrails, throws it before him. <lb/>
            They sacrifice both other cattle, and chiefly horses.</p>
          <p>62. In this manner then, and these victims, they sacrifice <lb/>
            to the other gods ; but to Mars, as follows. In each district, <lb/>
            in the place where the magistrates assemble, is erected a struc­ <lb/>
            ture sacred to Mars, of the following kind. Bundles of fag­ <lb/>
            gots are heaped up to the length and breadth of three stades, <lb/>
            but less in height; on the top of this a square platform is <lb/>
            formed ; and three of the sides are perpendicular, but on the <lb/>
            fourth it is accessible. Every year they heap on it one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and fifty waggon loads of faggots, for it is continually <lb/>
            sinking by reason of the weather. On this heap an old iron <lb/>
            scimetar is placed by each tribe, and this is the image of <lb/>
            Mars ; and to this scimetar they bring yearly sacrifices of <lb/>
            cattle and horses; and to these scimetars they offer more sa­ <lb/>
            crifices than to the rest of the gods. Whatever enemies <lb/>
            they take alive, of these they sacrifice one in a hundred, not <lb/>
            in the same manner as they do the cattle, but in a different <lb/>
            manner; for after they have poured a libation of wine on <lb/>
            their heads, they cut the throats of the men over a bowl; then <lb/>
            having carried the bowl on the heap of faggots, they pour the <lb/>
            blood over the scimetar. This then they carry up ; but be­ <lb/>
            low at the sacred precinct, they do as follows : having cut off <lb/>
            all the right shoulders of the men that have been killed, with <lb/>
            the arms, they throw them into the air; and then, having <lb/>
            finished the rest of the sacrificial rites, they depart; but the <lb/>
            arm lies wherever it has fallen, and the body apart. 63. <lb/>
            Such, then, are the sacrifices instituted amongst them. Swine <lb/>
            they never use, nor suffer them to be reared in their country <lb/>
            at all.</p>
          <p>64. Their military affairs are ordered as follows. When a <lb/>
            Scythian overthrows his first enemy, he drinks his blood; and <lb/>
            presents the king with the heads of the enemies he has killed <lb/>
            in battle; for if he brings a head, he shares the boocy that <lb/>
            they take; but not, if he does not bring ones. He skins it in <lb/>
            the following manner.. Having made a circular incision <lb/>
            round the ears and taking hold of the skin, itfrom <pb n="258"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[65—67"/> <lb/>
            the skull; then having scraped off the flesh with the rib of an <lb/>
            ox, he softens the skin with his hands; and having made it <lb/>
            supple, he uses it as a napkin: each man hangs it on the bridle <lb/>
            of the horse which he rides, and prides himself on it; for who­ <lb/>
            ever has the greatest number of these skin napkins, is accounted <lb/>
            the most valiant man. Many of them make cloaks of these <lb/>
            skins, to throw over themselves, sewing them together like <lb/>
            shepherd's coats; and many, having flayed the right hands of <lb/>
            their enemies that are dead, together with the nails, make <lb/>
            coverings for their quivers : the skin of a man, which is both <lb/>
            thick and shining, surpasses almost all other skins in the <lb/>
            brightness of its white. Many, having flayed men whole, and <lb/>
            stretched the skin on wood, carry it about on horseback. <lb/>
            Such usages are received amongst them. 65. The heads <lb/>
            themselves, not indeed of all, but of their greatest enemies, <lb/>
            they treat as follows: each, having sawn off all below the <lb/>
            eye-brows, cleanses it, and if the man is poor, he covers only <lb/>
            the outside with leather, and so uses it; but if he is rich, he <lb/>
            covers it indeed with leather, and having gilded the inside, he <lb/>
            so uses it for a drinking-cup. And they do this to their rela­ <lb/>
            tives, if they are at variance, and one prevails over another <lb/>
            in the presence of the king. When strangers of consideration <lb/>
            come to him, he produces these heads, and relates how, though <lb/>
            they were his relatives, they made war against him, and he <lb/>
            overcame them, considering this a proof of bravery. 66. <lb/>
            Once in every year, the governor of a district, each in his own <lb/>
            district, mingles a bowl of wine, from which those Scy­ <lb/>
            thians drink by whom enemies have been captured: but they <lb/>
            who have not achieved this, do not taste of this wine, but sit <lb/>
            at a distance in dishonour; this is accounted the greatest dis­ <lb/>
            grace : such of them as have killed very many men, having <lb/>
            two cups at once, drink them together.</p>
          <p>67. Soothsayers among the Scythians are numerous, who <lb/>
            divine by the help of a number of willow rods, in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing manner. When they have brought with them large bun­ <lb/>
            dles of twigs, they lay them on the ground and untie them; <lb/>
            and having placed each rod apart, they utter their predictions; <lb/>
            and whilst they are pronouncing them, they gather up the <lb/>
            rods again, and put them together again one by one. This is <lb/>
            their national mode of divination. But the Enarees,9 or Ar- <note type="footnote"> 9 See Book I. chap 105. </note> <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="68-70.]"/> <lb/>
            drogyni, say that Venus gave them the power of divining. <lb/>
            They divine by means of the bark of a linden-tree: when a man <lb/>
            has split the linden-tree in three pieces, twisting it round his <lb/>
            own fingers, and then untwisting it, he utters a response. <lb/>
            68. When the king of the Scythians is sick, he sends for three <lb/>
            of the most famous of these prophets, who prophesy in the <lb/>
            manner above mentioned ; and they generally say as follows, <lb/>
            that such or such a citizen has sworn falsely by the royal <lb/>
            hearth, mentioning the name of the citizen of whom they <lb/>
            speak: for it is a custom with the Scythians in general, to swear <lb/>
            by the royal hearth, when they would use the most solemn <lb/>
            oath. The person who, they say, has sworn falsely, is imme­ <lb/>
            diately seized, and brought forward; and when he is come, <lb/>
            the prophets charge him with being clearly proved by their <lb/>
            prophetic art to have sworn falsely by the royal hearth, and <lb/>
            for this reason the king is ill. He denies it, affirming that he <lb/>
            has not sworn falsely, and complains bitterly. On his denial, <lb/>
            the king sends for twice as many more prophets; and if they <lb/>
            also, examining into the prophetic art, condemn him with hav­ <lb/>
            ing sworn falsely, they straightway cut off his head, and the <lb/>
            first prophets divide his property between them ; but if the <lb/>
            prophets who came last acquit him, other prophets are called <lb/>
            in, and others after them. If, then, the greater number acquit <lb/>
            the man, it is decreed that the first prophets shall be put to <lb/>
            death. 69. They accordingly put them to death in the following <lb/>
            manner: when they have filled a waggon with faggots, and <lb/>
            have yoked oxen to it, having tied the feet of the prophets and <lb/>
            bound their hands behind them, and having gagged them, they <lb/>
            enclose them in the midst of the faggots; then having set fire <lb/>
            to them, they terrify the oxen, and let them go. Many oxen <lb/>
            therefore are burnt with the prophets, and many escape very <lb/>
            much scorched, when the pole has been burnt asunder. In this <lb/>
            manner, and for other reasons, they burn the prophets, calling <lb/>
            them false prophets. The king does not spare the children of <lb/>
            those whom he puts to death, but kills all the males, and does <lb/>
            not hurt the females. 70. The Scythians make solemn con­ <lb/>
            tracts in the following manner, with whomsoever they make <lb/>
            them. Having poured wine into a large earthen vessel, they <lb/>
            mingle with it blood taken from those who are entering into <lb/>
            covenant, having struck with an awl or cut with a knife a <lb/>
            small part of the body; then, having dipped a scimetar, some <note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>
            <note type="margin"> [71, 72. </note> <lb/>
            arrows, a hatchet, and a javelin in the vessel, when they <lb/>
            have done this, they make many solemn prayers, and then <lb/>
            both those who make the contract, and the most considerable <lb/>
            of their attendants, drink up the mixture.</p>
          <p>71. The sepulchres of the kings are in the country of the <lb/>
            Gerrhi, as far as which the Borysthenes is navigable. There, <lb/>
            when their king dies, they dig a large square hole in the <lb/>
            ground ; and having prepared this, they take up the corpse, <lb/>
            having the body covered with wax, the belly opened and <lb/>
            cleaned, filled with bruised cypress, incense, and parsley and <lb/>
            anise-seed, and then sown up again, and carry it in a chariot <lb/>
            to another nation : those who receive the corpse brought to <lb/>
            them, do the same as the Royal Scythians; they cut off part <lb/>
            of their ear, shave off their hair, wound themselves on the <lb/>
            arms, lacerate their forehead and nose, and drive arrows <lb/>
            through their left hand. Thence they carry the corpse of the <lb/>
            king to another nation whom they govern ; and those to whom <lb/>
            they first came accompany them. When they have carried <lb/>
            the corpse round all the provinces, they arrive among the <lb/>
            Gerrhi, who are the most remote of the nations they rule <lb/>
            over, and at the sepulchres. Then, when they have placed <lb/>
            the corpse in the grave on a bed of leaves, having fixed spears <lb/>
            on each side of the dead body, they lay pieces of wood over <lb/>
            it, and cover it over with mats. In the remaining space of <lb/>
            the grave they bury one of the king's concubines, having <lb/>
            strangled her, and his cup-bearer, a cook, a groom, a page, a <lb/>
            courier, and horses, and firstlings of every thing else, and <lb/>
            golden goblets; they make no use of silver or brass. Having <lb/>
            done this, they all heap up a large mound, striving and vie­ <lb/>
            in,, with each other to make it as large as possible. 72. <lb/>
            When a year has elapsed, they then do as follows: having <lb/>
            taken the most fitting of his remaining servants; they are all <lb/>
            native Scythians; for they serve him whomsoever the king <lb/>
            may order, and they have no servants bought with money: <lb/>
            when therefore they have strangled fifty of these servants, <lb/>
            and fifty of the finest horses, having taken out their bowels <lb/>
            and cleansed them, they fill them with chaff, and sow them <lb/>
            up again. Then having placed the half of a wheel, with its <lb/>
            concave side uppermost, on two pieces of wood, and the other <lb/>
            half on two other pieces of wood, and having fixed many cf <lb/>
            these in the same manner, then having thrust thick pieces of <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="73-75.]"/> <lb/>
            wood through the horses lengthwise, up to the writ, they <lb/>
            mount them on the half-wheels; and of these the foremost <lb/>
            part of the half-wheels supports the shoulders of the horses, <lb/>
            and the hinder part supports the belly near the thighs, but the <lb/>
            legs on both sides are suspended in the air: then having put <lb/>
            bridles and bits on the horses, they stretch them in front, and <lb/>
            fasten them to a stake; they then mount upon a horse each, <lb/>
            one of the fifty young men that have been strangled, mount­ <lb/>
            ing them in the following manner: when they have driven a <lb/>
            straight piece of wood along the spine as far as the neck, but <lb/>
            a part of this wood projects from the bottom, they fix it into <lb/>
            a hole bored in the other piece of wood that passes through <lb/>
            the horse. Having placed such horsemen round the monu­ <lb/>
            ment, they depart.</p>
          <p>73. Thus they bury their kings. But the other Scythians, <lb/>
            when they die, their nearest relations carry about among their <lb/>
            friends, laid in chariots; and of these each one receives and <lb/>
            entertains the attendants, and sets the same things before the <lb/>
            dead body, as before the rest. In this manner private persons <lb/>
            are carried about for forty days, and then buried. The <lb/>
            Scythians, having buried them, purify themselves in the follow­ <lb/>
            in- manner: having wiped and thoroughly washed their <lb/>
            heads, they do thus with regard to the body; when they have <lb/>
            set up three pieces of wood leaning against each other, they <lb/>
            extend around them woollen cloths; and having joined them <lb/>
            together as closely as possible, they throw red-hot stones into <lb/>
            a vessel placed in the middle of the pieces of wood and the <lb/>
            cloths. 74. They have a sort of hemp growing in this coun­ <lb/>
            try, very like flax, except in thickness and height; in this <lb/>
            respect the hemp is far superior : it grows both spontaneously <lb/>
            and from cultivation ; and from it the Thracians make gar­ <lb/>
            ments, very like linen, nor would any one who is not well <lb/>
            skilled in such matters distinguish whether they are made of <lb/>
            flax or hemp, but a person who has never seen this hemp <lb/>
            would think the garment was made of flax. 75. When there­ <lb/>
            fore the Scythians have taken some seed of this hemp, they <lb/>
            creep under the cloths, and then put the seed on the red- <lb/>
            hot stones; but this being put on smokes, and produces such <lb/>
            a steam, that no Grecian vapour-bath would surpass it. The <lb/>
            Scythians, transported with the vapour, shout aloud;1 and <note type="footnote">I See Book I. chap. 202. </note> <pb n="262"/>
            <note type="margin"> [76. </note> <lb/>
            this serves them instead of washing, for they Lever bathe the <lb/>
            body in water. Their women, pouring on water, pound on a <lb/>
            rough stone pieces of cypress, cedar, and incense-tree; and <lb/>
            then this pounded matter, when it is thick, they smear over <lb/>
            the whole body and face: and this at the same time gives <lb/>
            them an agreeable odour, and when they take off the cataplasm <lb/>
            on the following day, they become clean and shining.</p>
          <p>76. They studiously avoid the use of foreign customs, not <lb/>
            only therefore will they not adopt those of each other, but <lb/>
            least of all Grecian usages,2 as the example of Anacharsis, <lb/>
            and afterwards of Scylas, sufficiently demonstrated; for, in <lb/>
            the first place, Anacharsis, having visited many countries, and <lb/>
            having displayed great wisdom during his progress, was re­ <lb/>
            turning to the abodes of the Scythians, and sailing through the <lb/>
            Hellespont toward Cyzicus, and as he found the Cyzicenians <lb/>
            celebrating a festival to the-mother of the gods with great <lb/>
            magnificence, Anacharsis made a vow to the goddess, that if <lb/>
            he should return safe and sound to his own country, he would <lb/>
            sacrifice in the same manner as he saw the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Cyzicus doing, and would also institute a vigil. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when he arrived in Scythia, he returned into the country called <lb/>
            Hylæa, it is near the Course of Achilles, and is full of trees of <lb/>
            all kinds; -to this Anacharsis having retired, performed all the <lb/>
            rites-to the goddess, holding a timbrelin his hand, and fasten­ <lb/>
            ing images about his person. But one of the Scythians, <lb/>
            haying observed him doing this, gave information to the king, <lb/>
            Saulius; but he, having come in person, when he saw Ana­ <lb/>
            charsis thus employed, shot at him with an arrow, and killed <lb/>
            him. And now if any one speaks. about Anacharsis, the <lb/>
            Scythians say they do not know him, because he travelled <lb/>
            into Greece and adopted foreign customs. However I heard <lb/>
            from Timnes, the guardian of Ariapithes, that Anacharsis was <lb/>
            paternal uncle to Idanthyrsus, king of the Scythians, and that <lb/>
            he was son of Gnurus, son of Lycus, son of Spargapithes ; if, <lb/>
            then, Anacharsis was of this family, let him know he was <lb/>
            killed by his own brother ; for Idanthyrsus was son of Saulius, <note type="footnote">2 The simplest method of rendering this obscure passage appears to me <lb/>
            to be that suggested by Letronne, as quoted by Baehr, according to <lb/>
            which the usual signification of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκιϭτα</foreign> is retained without any <lb/>
            violence to the construction: it is as follows, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μή τι γε α̉ν</foreign> <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="77-79.]"/> <lb/>
            and it was Saulius who killed Anacharsis. 77. However, I <lb/>
            have heard another story told by the Peloponnesians, that <lb/>
            Anacharsis, being sent abroad by the king of the Scythians, <lb/>
            became a disciple of the Grecians; and on his return home he <lb/>
            said to the king who sent him abroad, that all the Greeks <lb/>
            were employed in acquiring all kinds of knowledge, except <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, but that they only were able to give and <lb/>
            receive a reason with prudence: but this story is told in sport <lb/>
            by the Greeks themselves. The man, then, was killed in the <lb/>
            manner before mentioned. Thus, therefore, he fared because <lb/>
            of foreign customs and intercourse with the Grecians.</p>
          <p>78. Many years afterwards, Scylas, son of Ariapithes, <lb/>
            met with a similar fate. For Ariapithes, king of the Scythi­ <lb/>
            ans, had, amongst other children, Scylas; he was born of an <lb/>
            Istrian woman, who did not in any way belong to the country: <lb/>
            his mother taught him the Grecian language and letters. <lb/>
            Afterwards, in course of time, Ariapithes met his death by <lb/>
            treachery at the hands of Spargapithes, king of the Agathyrsi, <lb/>
            and Scylas succeeded to the kingdom, and his father's wife, <lb/>
            whose name was Opœa; this Opœa was a native, by whom <lb/>
            Ariapithes had a son, Oricus. Scylas, though reigning over <lb/>
            the Scythians, was by <unclear>no</unclear> means pleased with the Scythian <lb/>
            mode of life, but was much more inclined to-theGrecian man­ <lb/>
            ners on account of: the education he had received; he, there­ <lb/>
            fore, acted thus. - Whenever he led the Scythian army to <lb/>
            the city of the Borysthenitæ, (now these Borysthenitæ say <lb/>
            they are Milesians,) as soon as Scylas reached them, he used <lb/>
            to leave his army in the suburbs, and, when he himself had <lb/>
            gone within the walls, and had closed the gates, having laid <lb/>
            aside his, Scythian dress, lie used to assume the Grecian <lb/>
            habit, and in. this dress he walked in public, unattended by <lb/>
            guards or any one else; and they kept watch at the gates, that <lb/>
            no Scythian might see him wearing this dress ; and in other <lb/>
            respects he adopted the Grecian mode of living, and performed <lb/>
            sacrifices to the gods according to the rites of the Grecians. <lb/>
            When he had stayed a month or more, he used to depart, re­ <lb/>
            suming the Scythian habit. This he used frequently to do; <lb/>
            he also built a palace in the Borysthenes, and married a native <lb/>
            woman, to inhabit it. 79. Since, however, it was fated that <lb/>
            misfortune should befal him, it happened on this occasion. He <lb/>
            was very desirous to be initiated in the mysteries of Bacchus; <pb n="264"/>
             <note type="margin"><unclear/>[80. </note> <lb/>
            and as he was just about to commence the sacred rites, a very <lb/>
            great prodigy occurred. He had in the city of the Borys­ <lb/>
            thenitæ a large and magnificent mansion,3 of which I have just <lb/>
            now made mention ; round it were placed sphinxes and griffins <lb/>
            of white marble ; on this the god hurled a bolt, and it was en­ <lb/>
            tirely burnt down; Scylas, nevertheless, accomplished his <lb/>
            initiation. Now, the Scythians reproach the Grecians on <lb/>
            account of their Bacchic ceremonies, for they say it is not <lb/>
            reasonable to discover such a god as this, who drives men to <lb/>
            madness. When Scylas had been initiated in the Bacchic <lb/>
            mysteries, one of the Borysthenitæ carried the information to <lb/>
            the Scythians, saying, “You Scythians laugh at us, because <lb/>
            we celebrate Bacchic rites, and the god takes possession of us: <lb/>
            now this same deity has taken possession of your king, and he <lb/>
            celebrates the rites of Bacchus, and is maddened by the god. <lb/>
            But if you disbelieve me, follow, and I will show you." The <lb/>
            chief men of the Scythians followed him ; and the Borysthe­ <lb/>
            nite, conducting them in, placed them secretly on a tower : but <lb/>
            when Scylas went past with a thyasus, and the Scythians <lb/>
            saw him acting the bacchanal, they regarded it as a very great <lb/>
            calamity ; and having returned, they acquainted all the army <lb/>
            with what they had seen. 80. After this, when Scylas re­ <lb/>
            turned to his own home, the Scythians, having set up his <lb/>
            brother Octamasades, born of the daughter of Tereus, re­ <lb/>
            volted from Scylas. But he, being informed of what was <lb/>
            being done against him, and the reason for which it was done, <lb/>
            fled to Thrace. Octamasades, being informed of this, marched <lb/>
            against Thrace, but when he arrived on the Ister, the Thra­ <lb/>
            cians advanced to meet him. As they were about to engage, <lb/>
            Sitalces sent to Octamasades, saying as follows : " Why need <lb/>
            we try each other's strength ? You are the son of my sister, <lb/>
            and have with you my brother. Do you restore him to me, <lb/>
            and I will deliver up Scylas to you, and so neither you nor I <lb/>
            shall expose our army to peril." Sitalces sent this message <lb/>
            to him by a herald ; for there was with Octamasades a brother <lb/>
            of Sitalces, who had fled from the latter. Octamasades ac­ <lb/>
            ceded to this proposal ; and having surrendered his maternal <lb/>
            uncle to Sitalces, received his brother Scylas in exchange. <lb/>
            Now Sitalces, having got his brother in his power, drew off <note type="footnote"> 3 Literally '' a circumference of a large and magnificent mansion. It </note> <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="81-83.]"/> <lb/>
            hisforces; but Octamasades beheaded Scylas on the same spot. <lb/>
            Thus the Scythians maintain their own customs, and impose <lb/>
            such punishments on those who introduce foreign usages.</p>
          <p>81. I have never been able to learn with accuracy the <lb/>
            amount of the population of the Scythians, but I heard differ­ <lb/>
            ent accounts concerning the number ; for some pretend that <lb/>
            they are exceedingly numerous, and others that there are very <lb/>
            few real Scythians : thus much however they exposed to my <lb/>
            sight. There is a spot between the river Borysthenes and <lb/>
            the Hypanis, called Exampæus,4 which I mentioned a little <lb/>
            before, saying that there was in it a fountain of bitter water, <lb/>
            from which the water flowing made the Hypanis unfit to be <lb/>
            drunk. In this spot lies a brass cauldron, in size six times as <lb/>
            large as the bowl at the mouth of the Pontus, which Pausani­ <lb/>
            as, son of Cleombrotus, dedicated. For the benefit of any one <lb/>
            who has never seen this, I will here describe it: the brass <lb/>
            cauldron amongst the Scythians easily contains six hundred <lb/>
            amphoræ ; and this Scythian vessel is six fingers in thickness. <lb/>
            Now, the inhabitants say it was made from the points of <lb/>
            arrows, for that their king, whose name was Ariantas, wish­ <lb/>
            ing to know the population of the Scythians, commanded all <lb/>
            the Scythians to bring him each severally one point of an <lb/>
            arrow, and he threatened death on whosoever should fail to <lb/>
            bring it. Accordingly a vast number of arrow points were <lb/>
            brought, and he resolved to leave a monument made from <lb/>
            them ; he therefore made this brass bowl, and dedicated it at <lb/>
            Exampæus. This I heard concerning the population of the <lb/>
            Scythians. 82. Their country has nothing wonderful, except <lb/>
            the rivers, which are very large and very many in number ; <lb/>
            but what it affords also worthy of admiration, besides the rivers <lb/>
            and the extent of the plains, shall be mentioned : they show <lb/>
            the print of the foot of Hercules upon a rock ; it resembles the <lb/>
            footstep of a man, is two cubits in length, near the river <lb/>
            Tyras. Such, then, is this ; but I will now return to the sub­ <lb/>
            ject I at first set out to relate.</p>
          <p>83. Whilst Darius was making preparations against the <lb/>
            Scythians, and sending messengers to command some to con­ <lb/>
            tribute land forces, and others a fleet, and others to bridge <lb/>
            over the Thracian Bosphorus; Artabanus, the son of Hystaspes, <lb/>
            and brother of Darius, entreated him on no account to make <lb/>
            an expedition against the Scythians, representing the poverty <note type="footnote">4 See chap. 52. </note> <pb n="266"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[84-86."/> <lb/>
            of Scythia ; but when he found that although he gave him <lb/>
            good counsel he could not persuade him, he desisted : Darius <lb/>
            therefore, when every thing was prepared, marched his army <lb/>
            from Susa. 84. At that time Œobazus, a Persian, who had three <lb/>
            sons all serving in the army, besought Darius that one might <lb/>
            be left at home for him. The king answered him, as a friend, <lb/>
            and one who made a moderate request, that he would leave him <lb/>
            all his sons ; he therefore was exceedingly delighted, hoping <lb/>
            that his sons would be discharged from the army. But Darius <lb/>
            commanded the proper officers to put all the sons of Œobazus <lb/>
            to death ; and they, being slain, were left on the spot.</p>
          <p>85. When Darius, marching from Susa, reached Chalcedon <lb/>
            on the Bosphorus, where a bridge was already laid across, <lb/>
            from thence going on board a ship he sailed to those called <lb/>
            the Cyanean islands, which the Grecians say formerly float­ <lb/>
            ed. There, sitting in the temple, he took a vew of the Eux­ <lb/>
            ine Sea, which is worthy of admiration; for of all seas it is <lb/>
            by nature the most wonderful: its length is eleven thousand <lb/>
            one hundred stades, and its width, in the widest part, three <lb/>
            thousand three hundred stades. The mouth of this sea is <lb/>
            four stades in width, and the length of the mouth, that is, <lb/>
            the neck, which is called the Bosphorus, where the bridge <lb/>
            was laid across, amounts toabout ahundred; and twenty <lb/>
            stades; and the Bosphorus extends to ,-the .Propontis. The <lb/>
            Propontis, which is five hundred stades in breadth, and one <lb/>
            thousand four hundred in length, discharges itself into the <lb/>
            Hellespont, which in the narrowest part is seven stades, and <lb/>
            in length four hundred ; the. Hellespont falls into an expanse <lb/>
            of the sea, which is called the Ægean. 86. These seas have <lb/>
            been measured as follows : a ship commonly makes in a long <lb/>
            day about seventy thousand orgyæ, and in a night about sixty <lb/>
            thousand. Now, from the mouth to the Phasis (for this is <lb/>
            the greatest length of the Pontus) is a voyage of nine days <lb/>
            and eight nights ; these make one million one hundred and <lb/>
            ten thousand orgyae, and these orgyæ are equal to eleven <lb/>
            thousand one hundred stades. From Sindica to Themiscyra, <lb/>
            on the river Thermodon, (for here is the broadest part of <lb/>
            the Pontus,) is a voyage of three days and two nights; these <lb/>
            make three hundred and thirty thousand orgyæ, <unclear>of</unclear> three <lb/>
            thousand three hundred stades. The Pontus, therefore, and <lb/>
            the Bosphorus, and the Hellespont, have been thus measured <lb/>
            by me, and are such as I have described. Moreover this <pb n="267"/>

            Pontus possesses a lake, that discharges itself into it, not <lb/>
            much less than itself; it is called Mæotis, and the mother of <lb/>
            the Pontus.</p>
          <p>87. Darius, when he had viewed the Pontus, sailed back <lb/>
            to the bridge, of which Mandrocles, a Samian, was the archi­ <lb/>
            tect. And having also viewed the Bosphorus, he erected twc <lb/>
            columns of white marble on the shore, engraving on one in <lb/>
            Assyrian characters, and on the other in Grecian, the names <lb/>
            of all the nations he had in his army, and he had some from <lb/>
            all ,whom he ruled over; of these, besides the navy, seven <lb/>
            hundred thousand were reckoned, including cavalry; and six <lb/>
            hundred ships were assembled.. Now these columns the By­ <lb/>
            zantians some time afterwards removed into their city, and <lb/>
            used in building, the altar of the Orthosian Diana, except one <lb/>
            stone; this was left near the temple of Bacchus in Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, covered with Assyrian letters. The spot of the Bos­ <lb/>
            phorus which king Darius caused the bridge to be laid over, <lb/>
            was, as I conjecture, mid-way between Byzantium and the <lb/>
            temple at the mouth. 88. Darius after this, being pleased <lb/>
            with the bridge, presented its architect, Mandrocles. the Sa­ <lb/>
            mian, with ten of every thing ; from these then Mandrocles, <lb/>
            having painted a picture of the whole junction of the Bos­ <lb/>
            phorus, with king. Darius seated on, a throne, and its -army <lb/>
            crossing over, having painted this, he. dedicated it as first- <lb/>
            fruits in the temple of Juno, with this inscription : “Man­ <lb/>
            drocles,.having thrown a bridge across the fishy Bosphorus, <lb/>
            dedicated to Juno amemorial of .the raft; laying up for him­ <lb/>
            self a crpwn, and for the Samians -glory, having completed, it <lb/>
            to the. satisfaction of kingDarius.” This,. then, was the me­ <lb/>
            morial of the man who constructed the bridge....!</p>
          <p>89. Darius, having rewarded Mandrocles, crossed over , in­ <lb/>
            to Europe, having commanded the Ionians to. sail by the <lb/>
            Pontus as far as the. river Ister ; and when they should <lb/>
            have reached the Ister, to throw a bridge over the river <lb/>
            and there wait , his arrival: for the Ionians, Æolians, and <lb/>
            Hellespontines conducted the naval armament. The fleet <lb/>
            accordingly, having sailed through the Cyanean islands, stood <lb/>
            direct, for the Ister; and having sailed up the river a two <lb/>
            days’ voyage from the sea, they joined the neck of the river <lb/>
            with a bridge, at the point where the. several mouths of the <lb/>
            later are separated But Darius, when. he. had passed over <pb n="268"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[90-94"/> <lb/>
            the Bosphorus by the bridge of boats, marched through <lb/>
            Thrace, and having arrived at the sources of the river Tearus, <lb/>
            encamped there three days. 90. The Tearus is said by the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the country to be the best of all rivers, both <lb/>
            for its other healing qualities, and especially for curing the <lb/>
            itch, in men and horses. Its springs are thirty-eight,flowing <lb/>
            from the same rock, and some of them are cold, others hot. <lb/>
            The distance to them is the same from Heræopolis, near Pe­ <lb/>
            rinthus, and from Apollonia on the Euxine Sea, each a two <lb/>
            days' journey. This Teams empties itself into the river <lb/>
            Contadesdus, the Contadesdus into the Agrianes, the Agri­ <lb/>
            anes into the Hebrus, and this last into the sea near the city of <lb/>
            Ænus. 91. Darius, then, having reached this river, when <lb/>
            he had encamped, was so delighted with the river, that he <lb/>
            erected a pillar here also, with the following inscription : THE <lb/>
            SPRINGS OF THE TEARUS YIELD THE BEST AND FINEST WATER <lb/>
            OF ALL RIVERS ; AND A MAN, THE BEST AND FINEST OF ALL <lb/>
            MEN, CAME TO THEM, LEADING AN ARMY AGAINST THE SCY­ <lb/>
            THIANS, DARIUS, SON OF HYSTASPES, KING OF TIlE PERSIANS, <lb/>
            AND OF THE WHOLE CONTINENT. 92. Darius, having set out <lb/>
            from thence, came to another river, the name of which is <lb/>
            Artiscus, which flows through the Odrysæ ; when he arrived <lb/>
            at this river, he did as follows : having marked out a certain <lb/>
            spot of ground to the army, he commanded every man as he <lb/>
            passed by to place a stone on this spot that was marked out; <lb/>
            and when the army had executed his order, having left vast <lb/>
            heaps of stones there, he continued his march.</p>
          <p>93. But before he reached the Ister, he subdued the Getæ <lb/>
            first, who think themselves immortal; for the Thracians who <lb/>
            occupy Salmydessus, and those who dwell above the cities of <lb/>
            Apollonia and Mesambria, who are called Scyrmiadæ and <lb/>
            Nypsæi, surrendered themselves to Darius without resist­ <lb/>
            ance ; but the Getæ, having recourse to obstinate resistance, <lb/>
            were soon reduced to slavery, though they are the most <lb/>
            valiant and the most just of the Thracians. 94. They think <lb/>
            themselves immortal in this manner. They imagine that <lb/>
            they themselves do not die, but that the deceased goes to the <lb/>
            deity Zalmoxis, and some of them think that he is the same <lb/>
            with Gebeleizis. Every fifth year they despatch one of them­ <lb/>
            selves, taken by lot, to Zalmoxis, with orders to let him know <lb/>
            on each occasion what they want. Their mode of sending <pb n="269"/>
             <note type="margin">95, 96. ] </note> <lb/>
            turn is this Some of them who are appointed hold three <lb/>
            javelins; whilst others, having taken up the man who is to <lb/>
            be sent to Zalmoxis by the hands and feet, swing him round, <lb/>
            and throw him into the air, upon the points. If he should die, <lb/>
            being transfixed, they think the god is propitious to them ; if <lb/>
            he should not die, they blame the messenger himself, saying, <lb/>
            that he is a bad man ; and having blamed him, they despatch <lb/>
            another, and they give him his instructions while he is yet <lb/>
            alive. These same Thracians, in time of thunder and light­ <lb/>
            ning, let fly their arrows toward heaven, and threaten the <lb/>
            god, thinking that there is no other god but their own. <lb/>
            95. But, as I am informed by the Greeks who dwell about <lb/>
            the Hellespont and the Pontus, this Zalmoxis was a man, and <lb/>
            lived in slavery at Samos ; he was slave to Pythagoras, son <lb/>
            of Mnesarchus ; and after that, having procured his liberty, <lb/>
            he acquired great riches, and having acquired them, he re­ <lb/>
            turned to his own country : but finding the Thracians lived <lb/>
            wretchedly and in a very uncivilized manner, this Zalmoxis, <lb/>
            being acquainted with the Ionian way of living, and with <lb/>
            manners more polite than those of Thrace, in that he had <lb/>
            been familiar with Greeks, and with Pythagoras, who was not <lb/>
            the meanest sage in Greece, had a hall built, in which, re­ <lb/>
            ceiving and entertaining the principal persons of the country, <lb/>
            lie taught them, that neither he nor any of his guests, nor <lb/>
            their posterity for ever, would die, but would go into a place <lb/>
            where they should live eternally, and have every kind of <lb/>
            blessing. While he did and said as above described, he, in <lb/>
            the mean time, had a subterraneous habitation made, and when <lb/>
            the building was completed, he disappeared from among the <lb/>
            Thracians; and having gone down to the subterraneous <lb/>
            habitation, he abode there three years. But they both re­ <lb/>
            gretted him, and lamented him as dead; but in the fourth <lb/>
            year he appeared to the Thracians : and thus what Zalmoxis <lb/>
            said became credible to them. Thus they say that he acted. <lb/>
            96. For my own part, I neither disbelieve nor entirely believe <lb/>
            the account of this person and the subterraneous habitation ; <lb/>
            but I am of opinion that this Zalmoxis lived many years be­ <lb/>
            fore Pythagoras. Yet, whether Zalmoxis were a man or a <lb/>
            native deity among the Getæ, I take my leave of him. These <lb/>
            people, then, who observe such a custom, when they were <lb/>
            subdued by the Persians, followed the rest of the army. <pb n="270"/>
             </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[97-99."/>
          <p>97. When Darius and his land forces with him reached <lb/>
            the Ister, all crossed over the river, and Darius commanded <lb/>
            the Ionians to loose the bridge, and follow him on the con­ <lb/>
            tinent with the forces from the ships. But as they were about <lb/>
            to loose the bridge and execute his orders, Goes, son of Er­ <lb/>
            xandrus, general of the Mitylenians, spoke as follows to Darius, <lb/>
            having first inquired whether it would be agreeable to him to <lb/>
            hear an opinion from one who wished to give it: "0 king, <lb/>
            since you are about to invade a country in which no culti­ <lb/>
            vated land will be seen, nor any inhabited city, do you let this <lb/>
            bridge remain where it is, leaving these men who constructed <lb/>
            it as its guard ; and if, having met with the Scythians, we <lb/>
            succeed according to our wishes, we have a way to return ; <lb/>
            but if we should not be able to meet with them, we shall at <lb/>
            least have a secure retreat. For I am not at all afraid that <lb/>
            we shall be conquered in battle by the Scythians ; but rather, <lb/>
            that, being unable to find them, we may suffer somewhat in <lb/>
            our wanderings. Perhaps some one may think I say this for <lb/>
            my own sake, that I may remain here ; but, 0 king, I advance <lb/>
            the opinion which I think is best for you ; nevertheless, I will <lb/>
            follow you myself, and would by no means be left behind." <lb/>
            Darius was much pleased with the advice, and answered him <lb/>
            as follows: " Lesbian friend, when I am safe back in my own <lb/>
            palace, fail not to present yourself to me, that I may requite <lb/>
            you for good advice with good deeds." 98. Having spoken thus <lb/>
            and tied sixty knots in a thong, and having summoned the <lb/>
            Ionian commanders to his presence, he addressed them as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " Men of Ionia, I have changed my former resolution <lb/>
            concerning the bridge; therefore, take this thong and do <lb/>
            thus: as soon as you see me march against the Scythians, <lb/>
            beginning from that time, untie one of these knots every day ; <lb/>
            and if I return not within that time, but the days numbered <lb/>
            by the knots have passed, do you sail away to your own coun­ <lb/>
            try. Till that time, since I have changed my determination, <lb/>
            do you guard the bridge, and apply the utmost care to pre­ <lb/>
            serve and secure it; and if you do this, you will oblige me <lb/>
            exceedingly.” Darius, having spoken thus, hastened forward.</p>
          <p>99. Thrace, in the part next the sea, projects before the <lb/>
            Scythian territory; and where a bay is formed in this coun­ <lb/>
            try Scythia begins, and the Ister discharges itself, having its <lb/>
            mouth turned towards the east, beginning from the <unclear>Ister</unclear>, <lb/>
            J <pb n="271"/>
             <note type="margin">100, 101.] </note> <lb/>
            I now proceed to describe by measurement the part of the <lb/>
            Scythian country that is on the sea coast. Now, from the Is­ <lb/>
            ter, that is ancient Scythia that lies towards the meridian and <lb/>
            the south wind, as far as the city called Carcinitis; next to <lb/>
            that, the Tauric nation inhabits the land extending along the <lb/>
            same sea, which is a mountainous country, and projects into <lb/>
            the Pontus as far as the Chersonesus called Trachea ; and it <lb/>
            reaches to the sea towards the east. For the two parts of the <lb/>
            boundaries of Scythia extend to the sea, one towards the <lb/>
            south, and the other towards the east, as is the case with the <lb/>
            region of Attica: and the Tauri inhabit parts of Scythia <lb/>
            similar to this, just as if any other people instead of the <lb/>
            Athenians possessed the promontory of Sunium,which ex­ <lb/>
            tends more into a point into the sea from the borough of Tho­ <lb/>
            ricus to that of Anaphlystus. I mention this, if I may com­ <lb/>
            pare small things with great. Such, then, is Taurica. But for <lb/>
            any one who has never sailed by that part of Attica, I will <lb/>
            explain the matter in another way: it is as if a nation dis­ <lb/>
            tinct from Japygia, and not the Japygians, beginning from <lb/>
            the port of Brundusium, should cut off the country as far as <lb/>
            Tarentum, and occupy the promontory. Mentioning these <lb/>
            two, I might mention many others, to which Taurica is like. <lb/>
            100. From Taurica, Scythians inhabit the country above the <lb/>
            Tauri, and the parts along the eastern sea, and the parts west­ <lb/>
            ward of the Cimmerian Bosphorus and the lake Mæotis, as far <lb/>
            as the river Tanais, which flows into the farthest recess of <lb/>
            that lake. Now, from the Ister at the parts above, stretching <lb/>
            to the interior, Scythia is shut off first by the Agathyrsi, <lb/>
            next by the Neuri, then by the Androphagi, and last by the <lb/>
            Melanchlæni. 101. Of Scythia, therefore, which is qua­ <lb/>
            drangular, with two parts reaching to the sea, that which <lb/>
            stretches to the interior and that along the coast is in every <lb/>
            way equal. For from the Ister to the Borysthenes is a jour­ <lb/>
            ney of ten days ; and from the Borysthenes to the lake Mæo­ <lb/>
            tis ten more ; from the sea to the interior, as far as the Melanch­ <lb/>
            æni, who inhabit above the Scythians, is a journey of twenty <lb/>
            days. The day's journey has been computed by meat two <lb/>
            hundred stades. Thus the extent of Scythia crossways would <lb/>
            be four thousand Blades ; and the direct route leading to the <lb/>
            interior would be the same number of stades. Such is the <lb/>
            extent of this country.</p><pb n="272"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[102—106."/>
          <p>102. The Scythians, considering with themselves that they <lb/>
            were not able alone to repel the army of Darius in a pitched <lb/>
            battle, sent messengers to the adjoining nations; and the <lb/>
            kings of those nations, having met together, consulted, since so <lb/>
            great an army was advancing against them. The kings who <lb/>
            met together were those of the Tauri, the Agathyrsi, the <lb/>
            Neuri, the Androphagi, the Melanchlæni, the Geloni, the Bu­ <lb/>
            dini, and the Sauromatæ. 103. Of these, the Tauri observe <lb/>
            the following customs: they sacrifice to the virgin all who <lb/>
            suffer shipwreck, and any Greeks they meet with driven on <lb/>
            their coasts, in the following manner : having performed the <lb/>
            preparatory ceremonies, they strike the head with a club ; <lb/>
            some say they throw the body down from a precipice, (for <lb/>
            their temple is built on a precipice,) and impale the head; but <lb/>
            others agree with respect to the head, but say that the body <lb/>
            is not thrown from the precipice, but buried in the earth. <lb/>
            The Tauri themselves say, that this deity to whom they sacri­ <lb/>
            fice is Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon. Enemies whom <lb/>
            they subdue they treat as follows : each having cut off a head, <lb/>
            carries it home with him, then having fixed it on a long pole, <lb/>
            he raises it far above the roof of his house, at all events <lb/>
            above the chimney; they say that these are suspended as <lb/>
            guards over the whole household. This people live by rapine <lb/>
            and war. 104. The Agathyrsi are a most luxurious people, <lb/>
            and wear a profusion of gold. They have promiscuous inter­ <lb/>
            course with women, to the end that they may be brethren one <lb/>
            of another, and being all of one family, may not entertain hatred <lb/>
            towards each other. In other respects they approach the usages <lb/>
            of the Thracians. 105. The Neuri observe Scythian customs. <lb/>
            One generation before the expedition of Darius, it happened tc <lb/>
            them to be driven out of their whole country by serpents; for <lb/>
            their country produced many serpents, and a much greater num <lb/>
            her came down upon them from the deserts above ; until, being <lb/>
            hard pressed, they abandoned their territory, and settled <lb/>
            among the Budini. These men seem to be magicians, for it is <lb/>
            said of them by the Scythians and the Greeks settled in <lb/>
            Scythia, that once every year each Neurian becomes a wolf <lb/>
            for a few days, and then is restored again to the same state. <lb/>
            Though they affirm this, however, they do not persuade me; <lb/>
            they affirm it nevertheless, and support their assertion with <lb/>
            an oath. 106. The Androphagi have the most savage <unclear>cus</unclear>- <pb n="273"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="107-110 ]"/> <lb/>
            toms of all men ; they pay no regard to justice, not make use <lb/>
            of any established law. They are nomades, and <unclear>wear</unclear> a dress <lb/>
            like the Scythian; they speak a peculiar language; and of <lb/>
            these nations, are the only people that eat human flesh. <lb/>
            107. The Melanchlæni all wear black garments, from which <lb/>
            circumstance they take their name. These follow Scythian <lb/>
            usages. 108. The Budini, who are a great and populous na­ <lb/>
            tion, paint their whole bodies with a deep blue and red. There <lb/>
            is in their country a city built of wood, its name is Gelonus ; <lb/>
            each side of the wall is thirty stades in length, it is lofty, and <lb/>
            made entirely of wood. Their houses also and their temples <lb/>
            are of wood : for there are there temples of the Grecian gods, <lb/>
            adorned after the Grecian manner with images, altars, and <lb/>
            shrines of wood. They celebrate the triennial festivals of <lb/>
            Bacchus, and perform the bacchanalian ceremonies: for the <lb/>
            Geloni were originally Grecians, but being expelled from the <lb/>
            trading ports, settled among the Budini; and they use a <lb/>
            language partly Scythian and partly Grecian. 109. The <lb/>
            Budini, however, do not use the same language as the Geloni, <lb/>
            nor the same mode of living; for the Budini, being indigen­ <lb/>
            ous, are nomades, and are the only people of these parts who <lb/>
            eat vermin ; whereas the Geloni are tillers of the soil, feed <lb/>
            upon corn, cultivate gardens, and are not at all like the Bu­ <lb/>
            dini in form or complexion. By the Greeks, however, the <lb/>
            Budini are called Geloni, though erroneously so called. Their <lb/>
            country is thickly covered with trees of all kinds ; and in the <lb/>
            thickest wood is a spacious and large lake, and a morass and <lb/>
            reeds around it: in this otters are taken, and beavers, and <lb/>
            other square-faced animals ; their skins are sewn as borders <lb/>
            to cloaks, and their testicles are useful for the cure of dis­ <lb/>
            diseases of the womb.</p>
          <p>110. Concerning the Sauromatæ the following account is <lb/>
            given. When the Grecians had fought with the Amazons. <lb/>
            (the Scythians call the Amazons Aiorpata, and this name in <lb/>
            the Grecian language means manslayers, for they call Aior a <unclear/> <lb/>
            man, and Pata to kill,) the story goes, that the Greeks, having <lb/>
            been victorious in the battle at the Thermodon, sailed away, <lb/>
            taking with them in three ships as many Amazons as they <lb/>
            had been able to take alive; but the Amazons attacking them <lb/>
            out at sea, cut the men to pieces. However, as they had nc <lb/>
            knowledge of navigation, nor any skill in the use of the rud­ <lb/>
            <pb n="274"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[111—"/><lb/>
            der, sails, or oars, when they had cut the men to pieces, they <lb/>
            were carried by the waves and wind, and arrived at Cremni <lb/>
            on the lake Mæotis, but Cremni belongs to-the territory of the <lb/>
            free Scythians. Here the Amazons, landing from the vessels, <lb/>
            marched to the inhabited parts and seized the first herd of <lb/>
            horses they happened to fall in with, and mounting on them, <lb/>
            plundered the lands of the Scythians. 111. The Scythians <lb/>
            knew not what to make of the matter; for they were not ac­ <lb/>
            quainted either with their language, dress, or nation, but <lb/>
            wondered from whence they came. They conjectured that <lb/>
            they were men of the same stature, they therefore gave them <lb/>
            battle; but after the battle the Scythians got possession of the <lb/>
            dead, and so discovered that they were women. On deliber­ <lb/>
            ation, therefore, they resolved on no account to kill them any <lb/>
            more, but to send out to them the youngest of their own party, <lb/>
            guessing a number equal to theirs; these were to encamp <lb/>
            near them, and do the same as they did ; should the Amazons <lb/>
            pursue them, they were not to fight, but fly; and when they <lb/>
            baited were to come and encamp near them. The Scythians <lb/>
            resolved on this, out of a desire to have children by these <lb/>
            women. 112. The young men, being despatched, did as they <lb/>
            were ordered: when the Amazons found that they had not <lb/>
            come to hurt them, they let them alone; and they drew one <lb/>
            camp nearer to the other every day. The youths, as well as <lb/>
            the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and horses, but <lb/>
            obtained their subsistence in the same way that the Amazons <lb/>
            did, by hunting and pillage. 113. The Amazons about mid- <lb/>
            day were wont to do as-follows: they separated themselves <lb/>
            into parties of one and two, at a distance from each other, <lb/>
            being dispersed for the purpose of easing themselves. The <lb/>
            Scythians observing this, did the same; and one of them <lb/>
            drew near one of the Amazons who was alone ; and she did <lb/>
            not repel him, but suffered him to enjoy her person. She <lb/>
            could not speak to him, because they did not understand each <lb/>
            other, but site made signs to him by her hand to come the <lb/>
            next day to the same place, and to bring another with him ; <lb/>
            signifying that they should be two, and she would oring <lb/>
            another with her. When the youth departed, he related this <lb/>
            to the rest, and on the next day he himself went to the place, <lb/>
            and took another with him, and found the Amazon with a <lb/>
            companion waiting for him. The rest c f the youths, when <pb n="275"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="114—117.]"/> <lb/>
            they heard this, conciliated the rest of the Amazons. 114. <lb/>
            Afterwards, having joined their camps, they lived together, <lb/>
            each having for his wife the person he first attached himself <lb/>
            to. The men were not able to learn the language of the <lb/>
            women, but the women soon attained that of the men. When, <lb/>
            therefore, they understood one another, the men spoke to the <lb/>
            Amazons as follows: " We have parents and possessions, let <lb/>
            us then no longer lead this kind of life, but let us return to the <lb/>
            bulk of our people and live with them ; we will have you as <lb/>
            our wives, and no others." To this they answered: "We <lb/>
            never could live with the women of your country, because we <lb/>
            have not the same customs with them. We shoot with the <lb/>
            bow, throw the javelin, and ride on horseback, and have never <lb/>
            learnt the employments of women. But your women do none <lb/>
            of the things we have mentioned, but are engaged in women's <lb/>
            employments, remaining in their waggons, and do not go out <lb/>
            to hunt, or any where else; we could not therefore consort <lb/>
            with them. If, then, you desire to have us for your wives, <lb/>
            and to prove yourselves honest men, go to your parents, claim <lb/>
            your share of their property, then return, and let us live by <lb/>
            ourselves." 115. The youths yielded, and acted accordingly, <lb/>
            but when they came back to the Amazons, having received <lb/>
            what fell to their share of the possessions, the women spoke <lb/>
            to them as follows: " Alarm and fear come upon us, when we <lb/>
            consider that we must live in this country; in the first place, <lb/>
            because we have deprived you of your parents; and in the <lb/>
            next, have committed great depredations in your territory. <lb/>
            Since, therefore, you think us worthy to be your wives, do <lb/>
            thus with us; come, let us leave this country, and having <lb/>
            crossed the river Tanais, let us settle there." 116. The youths <lb/>
            consented to this also; accordingly, having crossed the Tanais, <lb/>
            they advanced a journey of three days eastward from the <lb/>
            Tanais, and three from the lake Mæotis northward, and <lb/>
            having reached the country in which they are now settled, they <lb/>
            took up their abode there. From that time the wives of the <lb/>
            Sauromatæ retain their ancient mode of living, both going out <lb/>
            on horseback to hunt with their husbands, and without their <lb/>
            husbands, and joining in war, and wearing the same dress as <lb/>
            the men. 117. The Sauromatæ use the Scythian language, <lb/>
            speaking it corruptly from the first, since the Amazons never <lb/>
            learnt it correctly. Their rules respecting marriage are thus <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [118. 119 </note> <lb/>
            settled; no virgin is permitted to marry until she has killed <lb/>
            an enemy; some of them therefore die of old age without be­ <lb/>
            ing married, not being able to satisfy the law.</p>
          <p>118. The messengers of the Scythians, therefore, coming <lb/>
            to the assembled kings of the nations above mentioned, in­ <lb/>
            formed them that the Persian, when he had subdued all the <lb/>
            nations on the other continent, had constructed a bridge over <lb/>
            the neck of the Bosphorus, and crossed over to this continent; <lb/>
            and having crossed over and subdued the Thracians, he was <lb/>
            building a bridge over the river Ister, designing to make all <lb/>
            these regions also subject to him: Do you, therefore, on no <lb/>
            account, sit aloof, and suffer us to be destroyed, but with one <lb/>
            accord let us oppose the invader. If you will not do this, we, <lb/>
            being pressed, shall either abandon the country, or, if we stay, <lb/>
            shall submit to terms; for what would be our condition if you <lb/>
            refuse to assist us ? Nor will it fall more lightly on you on that <lb/>
            account; for the Persian is advancing not more against us <lb/>
            than against you; nor will he be content to subdue us and <lb/>
            abstain from you: and we will give you a strong proof of <lb/>
            what we say, for if the Persian had undertaken this expedi­ <lb/>
            tion against us only, wishing to revenge his former subjection <lb/>
            he would have abstained from all others, and have marched <lb/>
            directly against our territories, and would have made it clear <lb/>
            to all, that he was marching against the Scythians, and not <lb/>
            against others. But now, as soon as he crossed over to this <lb/>
            continent, he subdued all that lay in his way; and holds in <lb/>
            subjection the rest of the Thracians, and more particularly our <lb/>
            neighbours the Getae." 119. When the Scythians had made <lb/>
            this representation, the kings who had come from the several <lb/>
            nations consulted together, and their opinions were divided. <lb/>
            The Gelonian, Budinian, and Sauromatian, agreeing together, <lb/>
            promised to assist the Scythians; but the Agathyrsian, Neu­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            rian, Androphagian, and the Melanchlænian and Taurian <lb/>
            princes gave this answer to the Scythians : “If you, who <lb/>
            make the request that you now do, had not been the first tc <lb/>
            Injure the Persians, and begin war, you would have appeared <lb/>
            to us to speak rightly, and we, yielding to your wishes, would <lb/>
            have acted in concert with you. But in fact, you having in­ <lb/>
            vaded their territory without us, had the mastery of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians as long as the god allowed you; and they, when the <lb/>
            same god instigates them, repay you like for like. We, how- <pb n="277"/>
             <note type="margin">120, 121.; </note> <lb/>
            ever, neither on that occasion injured these men at all, nor <lb/>
            will we now be the first to attempt to injure them. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, should he invade our territory also, and become the <lb/>
            aggressor, we will not submit to it. But until we see that, <lb/>
            we will remain quiet at home ; for we think that the Persians <lb/>
            are not coming against us, but against those who were the <lb/>
            authors of wrong.”</p>
          <p>120. When the Scythians heard this answer brought back, <lb/>
            they determined to fight no battle in the open field, because <lb/>
            these allies did not come to their assistance; but to retreat <lb/>
            and draw off covertly, and fill up the wells they passed by, <lb/>
            and the springs, and destroy the herbage on the ground, hav­ <lb/>
            ing divided their forces into two bodies, and they resolved <lb/>
            that to one of the divisions, which Scopasis commanded, the <lb/>
            Sauromatæ should attach themselves, and that they should <lb/>
            retire, if the Persian should take that course, retreating di­ <lb/>
            rect to the river Tanais, along the lake Masotis ; and when <lb/>
            the Persian marched back, they were to follow him and harass <lb/>
            his rear. This was one division of the kingdom appointed <lb/>
            to pursue its march in the way that has been described. <lb/>
            The two other divisions of the kingdom, the greater one, <lb/>
            which Indathyrsus commanded, and the third, which Taxacis <lb/>
            ruled over, were directed to act in conjunction, and, with the <lb/>
            addition of the Geloni and Budini, to keep a day's march be­ <lb/>
            fore the Persians, and gradually retreat, retiring slowly, and <lb/>
            doing as had been determined : and first of all they were to <lb/>
            withdraw direct towards the territories of those who had re­ <lb/>
            nounced their alliance, in order that they might bring the <lb/>
            war upon them ; so that, though they would not willingly <lb/>
            take part in the war against the Persians, they might be com­ <lb/>
            pelled to engage in it against their will; afterwards they <lb/>
            were to return to their own country, and attack the enemy, <lb/>
            if, on consultation, it should seem advisable. 121. The Scy­ <lb/>
            thians, having come to this determination, went out to meet <lb/>
            Darius's army, having sent forward the best of their cavalry as <lb/>
            an advanced guard ; but the waggons, in which all their chil­ <lb/>
            dren and wives lived, and all the cattle, except so many as <lb/>
            were necessary for their subsistence, which they left behind­ <lb/>
            the rest they sent forward with the waggons, ordering them <lb/>
            to march continually towards the north. These, therefore. <lb/>
            were carried to a distance.</p><pb n="278"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[122-125"/>
          <p>122. When the advanced guard of the Scythians fell in <lb/>
            with the Persians, about three days' march from the Ister, <lb/>
            they, having fallen in with them, kept a day's march in ad­ <lb/>
            vance, and encamped, and destroyed all the produce of the <lb/>
            ground, but the Persians, when they saw the Scythian cavalry <lb/>
            before them, followed their track, while they continually re­ <lb/>
            tired ; and then, for they directed their march after one of <lb/>
            the divisions, the Persians pursued towards the east and the <lb/>
            Tanais; and when they had crossed the river Tanais, the <lb/>
            Persians also crossed over and pursued them, until, having <lb/>
            passed through the country of the Sauromatæ, they reached <lb/>
            that of the Budini. 123. As long as the Persians were <lb/>
            marching through the Scythian and Sauromatian regions, <lb/>
            they had nothing to ravage, as the country was all barren ; <lb/>
            but when they entered the territory of the Budini, there <lb/>
            meeting with the wooden town, the Budini having abandoned <lb/>
            it, and the town being emptied of every thing, they set it on <lb/>
            tire. Having done this, they continued to follow in the <lb/>
            track of the enemy, until, having traversed this region, they <lb/>
            reached the desert: this desert is destitute of inhabitants, and <lb/>
            is situate above the territory of the Budini, and is a seven days' <lb/>
            march in extent. Beyond the desert the Thyssagetæ dwell; <lb/>
            and four large rivers, flowing from them through the Mæo­ <lb/>
            tians, discharge themselves into the lake called Mæotis ; their <lb/>
            names are these, Lycus, Oarus, Tanais, and Syrgis. 124. When <lb/>
            Darius came to the desert, having ceased his pursuit, he en­ <lb/>
            camped his army on the river Oarus. And having done this, <lb/>
            he built eight large forts, equally distant from each other, <lb/>
            about sixty stades apart, the ruins of which remain to this day. <lb/>
            While he was employed about these, the Scythians who were <lb/>
            pursued, having made a circuit of the upper parts, returned <lb/>
            into Scythia : these having entirely vanished, when they <lb/>
            could no longer be seen, Darius left the forts half finished, <lb/>
            and himself wheeling round, marched westward, supposing <lb/>
            them to be all the Scythians, and that they had fled to the <lb/>
            west.</p>
          <p>125. Advancing with his army as quick as possible, when <lb/>
            he reached Scythia, he fell in with the two Scythian divi­ <lb/>
            sions, and having fallen in with them, he pursued them, but <lb/>
            they kept a day's march before him. The Scythians, for Da­ <lb/>
            rius did not relax his pursuit, fled, as had been determined, <pb n="279"/>
             <note type="margin">126. 127.] </note> <lb/>
            towards those nations that had refused to assist them, and <lb/>
            first they entered the territories of the Melanchlæni; and <lb/>
            when the Scythians and the Persians, entering into their coun­ <lb/>
            try, had put all things into confusion, the Scythians led the <lb/>
            way into the country of the Androphagi; and when they had <lb/>
            been thrown into confusion, they retreated to Neuris; and <lb/>
            when they were thrown into confusion, the Scythians ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in their flight towards the Agathyrsi. But the Aga­ <lb/>
            thyrsi, seeing their neighbours flying before the Scythians, <lb/>
            and thrown into confusion before the Scythians entered, des­ <lb/>
            patched a herald, and forbade the Scythians to cross their <lb/>
            borders ; warning them that if they should attempt to force <lb/>
            their way, they must first fight with them. The'Agathyrsi <lb/>
            having sent this message beforehand, advanced to protect <lb/>
            their frontiers, determined to repel the invaders. Whereas <lb/>
            the Melanchlæni, Androphagi, and Neuri, when the Persians <lb/>
            and Scythians together invaded them, offered no resistance, <lb/>
            but forgetting their former menaces, fled continually in great <lb/>
            confusion northward, towards the desert. The Scythians no <lb/>
            longer advanced towards the Agathyrsi, when they warned <lb/>
            them not to do so, but departing from the Neurian territory, <lb/>
            they led the Persians into their own.</p>
          <p>126. When this had continued for a considerable time, <lb/>
            and did not cease, Darius sent a horseman to Indathyrsus, <lb/>
            king of the Scythians, with the following message: " Most <lb/>
            miserable of men, why dost thou continually fly, when it is in <lb/>
            thy power to do one of these two other things ? For if thou <lb/>
            thinkest thou art able to resist my power, stand, and having <lb/>
            ceased thy wanderings, fight ; but if thou art conscious of <lb/>
            thy inferiority, in that case also cease thy hurried march, and <lb/>
            bringing earth and water as presents to thy master, come to a <lb/>
            conference." 127. To this Indathyrsus, the king of the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians, made answer as follows : “This is the case with me, <lb/>
            0 Persian; I never yet fled from any man out of fear, neither <lb/>
            before, nor do I now so flee from thee ; nor have I done any <lb/>
            thing different now from what I am wont to do, even in time <lb/>
            of peace ; but why I do not forthwith fight thee, I will now ex­ <lb/>
            plain. We have no cities nor cultivated lands, for which we are <lb/>
            under any apprehension lest they should be taken or ravaged, <lb/>
            and therefore should hastily offer you battle. Yet if it is by <lb/>
            all means necessary to come to this at once, we have the se- <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[128-130."/> <lb/>
            pulchres of our ancestors, come, find these, and attempt to <lb/>
            disturb them, then you will know whether we will fight for <lb/>
            our sepulchres or not ; but before that, unless we choose, we <lb/>
            will not engage with thee. Thus much about fighting. The <lb/>
            only masters I acknowledge are Jupiter my progenitor, and <lb/>
            Vesta queen of the Scythians ; but to thee, instead of pre­ <lb/>
            sents of earth and water, I will send such presents as are pro­ <lb/>
            per to come to thee. And in answer to thy boast, that thou <lb/>
            art my master, I bid thee weep." (This is a Scythian say­ <lb/>
            ing.) The herald therefore departed carrying this answer to <lb/>
            Darius.</p>
          <p>128. The kings of the Scythians, when they heard the <lb/>
            name of servitude, were filled with indignation ; whereupon <lb/>
            they sent the division united with the Sauromatæ, which <lb/>
            Scopasis commanded, with orders to confer with the Ionians, <lb/>
            who guarded the bridge over the Ister. Those who were <lb/>
            left resolved no longer to lead the Persians about, but <lb/>
            to attack them whenever they were taking their meals ; <lb/>
            accordingly, observing the soldiers of Darius taking their <lb/>
            meals, they put their design in execution. The Scythian ca­ <lb/>
            valry always routed the Persian cavalry, but the Persian <lb/>
            horsemen in their flight fell back on the infantry, and the in­ <lb/>
            fantry supported them. The Scythians, having beaten back <lb/>
            the cavalry, wheeled round through fear of the infantry. The <lb/>
            Scythians also made similar attacks at night. 129. A <lb/>
            very remarkable circumstance, that was advantageous to the <lb/>
            Persians and adverse to the Scythians, when they attacked <lb/>
            the camp of Darius, I will now proceed to mention : this was <lb/>
            the braying of the asses, and the appearance of the mutes ; <lb/>
            for Scythia produces neither ass nor mule, as I have before <lb/>
            observed;5 nor is there in the whole Scythian territory <lb/>
            a single ass or mule, by reason of cold. The asses, then, <lb/>
            growing wanton, put the Scythian horse into confusion ; and <lb/>
            frequently, as they were advancing upon the Persians, <lb/>
            when the horses heard, mid-way, the braying of the asses, <lb/>
            they wheeled round in confusion, and were greatly amazed, <lb/>
            pricking up their ears, as having never before heard such a <lb/>
            sound, nor seen such a shape ; now this circumstance in some <lb/>
            slight degree affected the fortune of the war.</p>
          <p>130 The Scythians, when they saw the Persians in great <note type="footnote"> * See chap. 28. </note> <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="131-133.]"/> <lb/>
            commotion, in order that they might remain longer in Scy­ <lb/>
            thia, and by remaining might be harassed through want of <lb/>
            all things necessary, adopted the following expedient: when <lb/>
            they had left some of their own cattle in the care of the herds­ <lb/>
            men, they themselves withdrew to another spot; and the <lb/>
            Persians coming up, took the cattle, and having taken <lb/>
            them, exulted in what they had done. 131. When this had <lb/>
            happened several times, at last Darius was in a great strait, <lb/>
            and the kings of the Scythians, having ascertained this, sent a <lb/>
            herald, bearing as gifts to Darius, a bird, a mouse, a frog, and <lb/>
            five arrows. The Persians asked the bearer of the gifts the <lb/>
            meaning of this present; but he answered, that he had no <lb/>
            other orders than to deliver them and return immediately.; <lb/>
            and he advised the Persians, if they were wise, to discover <lb/>
            what the gifts meant. The Persians, having heard this, con­ <lb/>
            sulted together. 132. Darius's opinion was, that the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians meant to give themselves up to him, as well as earth <lb/>
            and water ; forming his conjecture thus; since a mouse is bred <lb/>
            in the earth, and subsists on the same food as a man ; a frog <lb/>
            lives in the water ; a bird is very like a horse ; and the ar­ <lb/>
            rows they deliver up as their whole strength. This was the <lb/>
            opinion given by Darius. But the opinion of Gobryas, one <lb/>
            of the seven who had deposed the magus, did not coincide <lb/>
            with this ; he conjectured that the presents intimated : " Un­ <lb/>
            less, 0 Persians, ye become birds and fly into the air, or be­ <lb/>
            come mice and hide yourselves beneath the earth, or become <lb/>
            frogs and leap into the lakes, ye shall never return home <lb/>
            again, but be stricken by these arrows." And thus the other <lb/>
            Persians interpreted the gifts.</p>
          <p>133. In the mean time that division of the Scythians, that <lb/>
            had been before appointed to keep guard about the lake Mæotis, <lb/>
            and then to confer with the Ionians at the Ister, when they <lb/>
            arrived at the bridge, spoke as follows : “Men of Ionia, we <lb/>
            are come bringing freedom to you, if only you will listen to <lb/>
            us. We have heard that Darius commanded you to guard <lb/>
            the bridge sixty days only, and if he did not come up within <lb/>
            that time, then to return into your own country. Now there­ <lb/>
            fore, if you do this, you will be free from all blame as re­ <lb/>
            gards him and as regards us ; when you have waited the <lb/>
            appointed number of days, after that depart." On the It <unclear>nians</unclear> <pb n="282"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[134-135."/> <lb/>
            promising to do so, the Scythians hastened back with all <lb/>
            expedition.</p>
          <p>134. The rest of the Scythians, after they had sent the <lb/>
            presents to Darius, drew themselves opposite the Persians <lb/>
            with their foot and horse, as if they intended to come to an en­ <lb/>
            gagement ; and as the Scythians were standing in their ranks, <lb/>
            a hare started in the midst of them ; and each of them, as <lb/>
            they saw the hare, went in pursuit of it. The Scythians be­ <lb/>
            in,, in great confusion, and shouting loudly, Darius asked the <lb/>
            meaning of the uproar in the enemy's ranks; but when he <lb/>
            heard that they were pursuing a hare, he said to those he was <lb/>
            accustomed to address on such occasions : " These men treat <lb/>
            us with great contempt; and I am convinced that Gobryas <lb/>
            spoke rightly concerning the Scythian presents. Since, then, <lb/>
            I am of opinion that the case is so, we have need of the best <lb/>
            advice, how our return home may be effected in safety." <lb/>
            To this Gobryas answered : " 0 king, I was in some measure <lb/>
            acquainted by report with the indigence of these men ; but I <lb/>
            have learned much more since I came hither, and seen how <lb/>
            they make sport of us. My opinion therefore is, that as <lb/>
            soon as night draws on, we should light fires, as we are ac­ <lb/>
            customed to do, and having deceived those soldiers who are <lb/>
            least able to bear hardships, and having tethered all the asses, <lb/>
            should depart before the Scythians direct their march to the <lb/>
            Ister, for the purpose of destroying the bridge, or the Ionians <lb/>
            take any resolution which may occasion our ruin." Such was <lb/>
            the advice of Gobryas. 135. Afterwards night came on, and <lb/>
            Darius acted on this opinion: the infirm amongst the sol­ <lb/>
            diers, and those whose loss would be of the least conse­ <lb/>
            quence, and all the asses tethered, he left on the spot in the <lb/>
            camp. And he left the asses and the sick of his army for the <lb/>
            following reason; that the asses might make a noise: and the <lb/>
            men were left on this pretext, namely, that he with the <lb/>
            strength of his army was about to attack the Scythians, and <lb/>
            they, during that time, would defend the camp. Darius, hav­ <lb/>
            ing laid these injunctions on those he was preparing to aban­ <lb/>
            don, and having caused the fires to be lighted, marched away <lb/>
            with all speed towards the Ister. The asses, being deserted <lb/>
            by the multitude, began to bray much louder than usual; so <lb/>
            that the Scythians, hearing the asses, firmly believed that the <pb n="283"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="136-138.]"/> <lb/>
            Persians were still at their station. 136. Wlieu day appeared, <lb/>
            thia men that were abandoned, discovering that they had been <lb/>
            betrayed by Darius, extended their hands to the Scythians, <lb/>
            and told them what had occurred : when they heard this, the <lb/>
            two divisions of the Scythians, and the single one, the Sauro­ <lb/>
            matae, Budini, and Geloni, having joined their forces together <lb/>
            as quickly as possible, pursued the Persians straight towards <lb/>
            the Ister. But as a great part of the Persian army consisted <lb/>
            of infantry, and they did not know the way, there being no <lb/>
            roads cut, and as the Scythian army consisted of cavalry, and <lb/>
            knew the shortest route, they missed each other, and the <lb/>
            Scythians arrived at the bridge much before the Persians. <lb/>
            And having learnt that the Persians were not yet arrived, <lb/>
            they spoke to the Ionians who were on board the ships in <lb/>
            these terms: " Men of Ionia, the number of days appointed <lb/>
            for your stay is already passed, and you do not as you ought <lb/>
            in continuing here ; but if you remained before through fear, <lb/>
            now break up the passage and depart as quickly as possible, re­ <lb/>
            joicing that you are free, and give thanks to the gods and the <lb/>
            Scythians. As for the man who before was your master, we <lb/>
            will so deal with him, that he shall never hereafter make war <lb/>
            on any people."</p>
          <p>137. Upon this the Ionians held a consultation. The opin­ <lb/>
            ion of Miltiades the Athenian, who commanded and reigned over <lb/>
            the Chersonesites on the Hellespont, was, that they should com­ <lb/>
            ply with the request of the Scythians, and restore liberty to <lb/>
            Ionia. But Histiæus the Milesian was of a contrary opinion, <lb/>
            and said, "that every one reigned over his own city through <lb/>
            Darius ; and if Darius's power should be destroyed, neither <lb/>
            would he himself continue master of Miletus, nor any of the <lb/>
            rest of other places ; because every one of the cities would <lb/>
            choose to be governed rather by a democracy than a tyranny. <lb/>
            Histiæus had no sooner delivered this opinion, than all went <lb/>
            over to his side, who had before assented to that of Miltiades. <lb/>
            138. These were they who gave their votes and were in high <lb/>
            estimation with Darius; the tyrants of the Hellespontines, <lb/>
            Daphnis of Abydos, Hippocles of Lampsacus, Herophantus of <lb/>
            Parium, Metrodorus of Proconnesus, Aristagoras of Cyzicum, <lb/>
            and Ariston of Byzantium ; these were from the Hellespont. <lb/>
            From Ionia, Strattis of Chios, Æaces of Samos, Laodamas or <lb/>
            Phocæa, and Histiæus of Miletus. whose opinion was opposed <pb n="284"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[139-142."/> <lb/>
            to that of Miltiades. Of the Æolians the only person of <lb/>
            consideration present, was Aristagoras of Cyme.</p>
          <p>139. When these men had approved the opinion of Histiæus, <lb/>
            they determined to add to it the following acts and words: to <lb/>
            break up the bridge on the Scythian side, as far as a bow-shot <lb/>
            might reach, that they might seem to do something, when in <lb/>
            effect they did nothing ; and that the Scythians might not at­ <lb/>
            tempt to use violence and purpose to cross the Ister by the <lb/>
            bridge ; and to say, while they were breaking up the bridge <lb/>
            on the Scythian side, they would do every thing that might <lb/>
            be agreeable to the Scythians. This, then, they added to the <lb/>
            opinion of Histiæus. And, afterwards, Histiæus delivered the <lb/>
            answer in the name of all, saying as follows: “Men of <lb/>
            Scythia, you have brought us good advice, and urge it sea­ <lb/>
            sonably ; you, on your part, have pointed out the right way to <lb/>
            us, and we on ours readily submit to you ; for, as you see, we <lb/>
            are breaking up the passage, and'will use all diligence, de­ <lb/>
            siring to be free. But while we are breaking it up, it is fit­ <lb/>
            ting you should seek for them, and having found them, avenge <lb/>
            us and yourselves on them, as they deserve." 140. The <lb/>
            Scythians, believing a second time that the Ionians were sin­ <lb/>
            cere, turned back to seek the Persians ; but entirely missed <lb/>
            the way they had taken. Ti e Scythians themselves were <lb/>
            the cause of this, having destroyed the pastures for the horses <lb/>
            in this direction, and having filled in the wells; for if they <lb/>
            had not done this, they might easily have found the Persians <lb/>
            if they wished ; but now they erred in the very thing which they <lb/>
            thought they had contrived for the best. For the Scythians <lb/>
            sought the enemy by traversing those parts of the country <lb/>
            where there was forage and water for the horses, thinking <lb/>
            that they too would make their retreat by that way. But the <lb/>
            Persians, carefully observing their former track, returned by <lb/>
            it, and tliu.3 with difficulty found the passage. As they ar­ <lb/>
            rived in the night, and perceived the bridge broken off, they <lb/>
            fell into the utmost consternation, lest the Ionians had aban­ <lb/>
            doned them. 141. There was with Darius an Egyptian, who <lb/>
            had an exceedingly loud voice. This man Darius commanded <lb/>
            to stand on the bank of the Ister, and call Histiæus the Mi­ <lb/>
            lesian. He did so, and Histiæus, having heard the first shout, <lb/>
            brought up all the ships to carry the army across, and joined <lb/>
            the bridge. Thus the Persians escaped. 142. The Scythians <pb n="285"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="143-145.]"/> <lb/>
            in their search missed them a second time : and on the one <lb/>
            hand, considering the Ionians as free and cowardly, they deem <lb/>
            them to be the most base of men; but on the other, ac­ <lb/>
            counting the Ionians as slaves, they say that they are most <lb/>
            attached to their masters, and least inclined to run away. <lb/>
            These reproaches the Scythians fling out against the Ionians.</p>
          <p>143. Darius, marching through Thrace, reached Sestos in <lb/>
            the Chersonesus; and thence he himself crossed over on ship­ <lb/>
            board into Asia, and left Megabazus, a Persian, to be his <lb/>
            general in Europe. Darius once paid this man great honour, <lb/>
            having expressed himself in this manner in the presence of <lb/>
            the Persians : Darius being about to eat some pomegranates, <lb/>
            as soon as he opened the first, his brother Artabanus asked <lb/>
            him, Of what thing he would wish to possess a number equal <lb/>
            to the grains in the pomegranate. Darius said, that he would <lb/>
            rather have as many Megabazuses, than Greece subject to <lb/>
            him. By saying this, lie honoured him in the presence of the <lb/>
            Persians, and now he left him as general with eighty thou­ <lb/>
            sand men of his own army. 144. This Megabazus, by <lb/>
            making the following remark, left an everlasting memorial of <lb/>
            himself among the Hellespontines ; for when he was at By­ <lb/>
            zantium, he was informed that the Chalcedonians had settled <lb/>
            in that country seventeen years before the Byzantians ; but <lb/>
            when he heard it, he said, that the Chalcedonians must have <lb/>
            been blind at that time, for if they had not been blind, they <lb/>
            would never have chosen so bad a situation, when they might <lb/>
            have had so beautiful a spot to settle in. This Megabazus, <lb/>
            then, being left as general in the country of the Hellespont­ <lb/>
            ines, subdued those nations who were not in the interest of the <lb/>
            Medes. He accordingly did this.</p>
          <p>145. About the same time another great expedition was <lb/>
            undertaken against Libya, on what pretext I will relate, when <lb/>
            I have first given the following account by way of preface. <lb/>
            The descendants of the Argonauts, being expelled from Lem­ <lb/>
            nos by the Pelasgians who carried off the Athenian women <lb/>
            from Brauron,6 set sail for Lacedæmon, and seating them­ <lb/>
            selves on Mount Taygetus, lighted fires. The Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            having seen this, despatched a messenger to demand who and <lb/>
            whence they were. They said to the messenger who questioned <note type="footnote"> 6 See Cook VI. chap. 138 </note> <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [146, 147. </note> <lb/>
            them, that " they were Minyæ, descendants of those heroes <lb/>
            who sailed in the Argo, and that they, having touched at Lem­ <lb/>
            nos, begot them." The Lacedæmonians, having heard this <lb/>
            account of the extraction of the Minyæ, sent a second time <lb/>
            to inquire with what design they had come to their territory, <lb/>
            and lighted fires ; they said, that being ejected by the Pelas­ <lb/>
            giaus, they had come to their fathers ; for that it was most <lb/>
            proper for them so to do ; and they requested leave to dwell <lb/>
            with them, participating in their honours, and being allotted a <lb/>
            portion of land. The Lacedæmoniaus determined to receive <lb/>
            the Minyæ on the terms they themselves proposed ; and the <lb/>
            sailing of the Tyndaridæ in the Argo especially induced <lb/>
            them to do this : having, therefore, received the Minyæ, they <lb/>
            assigned them a portion of land, and distributed them among <lb/>
            their tribes, and they immediately contracted marriages, and <lb/>
            gave to others the wives they brought from Lemnos. 146. <lb/>
            But when no long time had elapsed, the Minyæ became inso­ <lb/>
            lent, and demanded a share in the sovereignty, and committed <lb/>
            other crimes. The Lacedæmonians therefore determined to <lb/>
            put them to death, and having seized them, they threw them <lb/>
            into prison. Now those whom they kill, the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans kill by night, but no one by day. When, therefore, they <lb/>
            were about to put them to death, the wives of the Minyæ, <lb/>
            who were citizens, and daughters to the principal Spar­ <lb/>
            tans, begged permission to enter the prison, and- confer each <lb/>
            with her husband. The Lacedaemonians gave them per­ <lb/>
            mission, not suspecting any fraud on their part, but they, <lb/>
            when they entered, did as follows : having given all the <lb/>
            clothes they had on to their husbands, themselves took their <lb/>
            husbands' clothes. Upon which, the Minyæ, having put on <lb/>
            the women's dress, passed out as women, and having thus <lb/>
            escaped, again seated themselves on Mount Taygetus.</p>
          <p>147. At the same time Theras, son of Austesion, son to <lb/>
            Tisamenus, son of Thersander, soil of Polynices, set out from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon on a colonizing expedition. This Theras was by <lb/>
            birth a Cadmæan, brother to the mother of Aristodemus's <lb/>
            sons, Eurysthenes and Procles ; and while these youths were <lb/>
            yet infants, Theras had the kingdom of Sparta under his <lb/>
            guardianship. But when the youths were grown up and as­ <lb/>
            sumed the government, Theras, not brooking to be ruled by <lb/>
            others after he had tasted the pleasures of power, declared <pb n="287"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="148-150.]"/> <lb/>
            that he would not remain at Lacedæmon, but would sail away <lb/>
            to his own kindred. In the island now called Thera, the <lb/>
            same that was formerly Callista, lived the descendants of <lb/>
            Membliares, the son of Pæciles a Phoenician. For Cadmus, <lb/>
            son of Agenor, when in quest of Europa, touched at the <lb/>
            island now called Thera ; and whether when he touched at it <lb/>
            the country pleased him, or whether for some other reason he <lb/>
            chose to do so, he left in this island both others of the Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicians, and, moreover, his own kinsman, Membliares : these <lb/>
            men, occupied the island, then called Callista, during eight <lb/>
            generations, before Theras came from Lacedæmon. 148. To <lb/>
            these people, then, Theras went, having, with a multitude <lb/>
            drawn out of the tribes, set out, purposing to dwell with <lb/>
            them, and on no account to drive them out, but by all means <lb/>
            to conciliate them. But when the Minyæ who had escaped <lb/>
            from the prison seated themselves on Mount Taygetus, <lb/>
            as the Lacedæmonians determined to destroy them, Theras <lb/>
            begged that they might not be put to death, and promised <lb/>
            that he would himself take them out of the country. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians acceding to his request, he set sail with <lb/>
            three thirty-oared galleys, to the descendants of Membliares, <lb/>
            taking with him not all the Minyæ, but some few of them ; <lb/>
            for the greater number of them went over to Paroreates and <lb/>
            Caucones ; and having driven them out from their country, <lb/>
            distributed themselves into six divisions, and then founded <lb/>
            the following cities there; Leprium, Macistus, Phrixas, <lb/>
            Pyrgus, Epium, and Nudium : most of these the Eleans <lb/>
            have destroyed in my time. The name of Thera was given <lb/>
            to the island after the founder. 149. His son refused to ac­ <lb/>
            company him in his voyage, therefore he said that he would <lb/>
            leave him as a sheep among wolves: in consequence of this <lb/>
            speech, the name of Oiolycus was given to this youth, and this <lb/>
            rame chanced to prevail. To this Oiolycus was born <lb/>
            Ægeus, from whom the Ægidæ, a principal tribe in Sparta, <lb/>
            are named. As the children of the men ofthis tribe did not <lb/>
            survive, they erected a temple, in obedience to an oracle, to <lb/>
            the furies of Laius and (Edipus; and after that, the same <lb/>
            thing happened in Thera to those who were descended from <lb/>
            these men.</p>
          <p>150. To this part of the story the Lacedæmonians agree <lb/>
            with the ; but after this, the Theræans only say <pb n="288"/>
             <note type="margin">[151, 152 </note> <lb/>
            that what fallows took place. Grinus, son of Æsanius, who <lb/>
            was a descendant of this Theras, and reigned over the island <lb/>
            Thera, came to Delphi, bringing a hecatomb from the city ; <lb/>
            and divers of the citizens attended him, and among them. Bat­ <lb/>
            tus, son to Polymnestus, who was of the family of Euphemus, <lb/>
            one of the Minyæ. And as Grinus, king of the Theræans, <lb/>
            was consulting the oracle concerning other affairs, the Pythian. <lb/>
            admonished him to "build a city in Libya." But he answer­ <lb/>
            ed, "I, 0 prince, am now too old and heavy to move myself; <lb/>
            therefore command one of these young men to do this ;" and <lb/>
            as he said these words, he pointed to Battus. At that time so <lb/>
            much passed. But after their departure, they paid no atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the oracle, neither knowing in what part of the world <lb/>
            Libya was, nor daring to send out a colony on an uncertainty. <lb/>
            151. For seven years after this, no rain fell in Thera; during <lb/>
            which period, every tree in the island, except one, was wither­ <lb/>
            ed up ; and when the Theræans consulted the oracle, the <lb/>
            Pythian objected to them the colonization of Libya. When <lb/>
            they found no remedy for the evil, they despatched messengers <lb/>
            to Crete, to inquire if any of the Cretans, or strangers settled <lb/>
            among them, had ever gone to Libya. These messengers, <lb/>
            wandering about the island, arrived in the city of Itanus ; and <lb/>
            here they became acquainted with a purple-dyer, whose name <lb/>
            was Corobius ; he said, that being driven by the winds, he <lb/>
            had gone to Libya, and to Platea, an island of Libya : having <lb/>
            persuaded this man by a promise of reward, they took him to <lb/>
            Thera. At first, men sailed from Thera to explore, not many <lb/>
            in number : and when Corobius had conducted them to this <lb/>
            island Platea, they left Corobius there with provisions for a few <lb/>
            months, and themselves sailed back with all speed to give the <lb/>
            Theræans tidings of the island. 152. But these men staying <lb/>
            away longer than the time agreed upon, Corobius was reduced <lb/>
            to the last necessity ; when a Saurian vessel, whose master <lb/>
            was Colæus, sailing for Egypt, was driven to this Platea. <lb/>
            The Samians, having heard the whole account from Corobius, <lb/>
            left him provisions for a year ; and they, having got under <lb/>
            weigh from the island, and being anxious to reach Egypt, set <lb/>
            sail, and were carried away by an cast wind ; and as the <lb/>
            wind did not abate, having passed through the columns of <lb/>
            Hercules, they arrived at Tartessus, under divine guidance. <lb/>
            Tint port was at that time unfrequented ; so that these men <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin"> 153, 154. </note> <lb/>
            returning home, gained from their cargo the largest profits of <lb/>
            any of the Grecians we know of with certainty, next to So­ <lb/>
            tratus, son of Laodamas of Ægina, for with him it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible for any one to compete. The Samians, therefore, having <lb/>
            set apart the tenth of their gains, amounting to six talents, <lb/>
            made a vessel of brass, after the fashion of an Argolic bowl, <lb/>
            and around it the heads of griffins project over; and they <lb/>
            dedicated it in the temple of Juno, having' placed under it <lb/>
            three colossal figures of brass, seven cubits in height, leaning <lb/>
            on their knees. And on this occasion, the Cyrenæans and <lb/>
            Theræans first contracted a great friendship with the Sa­ <lb/>
            mians. 153. The Theræans, when they left Corobius in the <lb/>
            island and returned to Thera, took back word that they had <lb/>
            taken possession of an island off the coast of Libya: the Theræans <lb/>
            therefore resolved to send one of every family,7 chosen by lot; <lb/>
            and to send men from all their districts, which were seven in <lb/>
            number ; and appointed Battus to be their leader and king. <lb/>
            Thus then they fitted out two fifty-oared galleys for Platea.</p>
          <p>154. The Theræans give this account; in the rest of the <lb/>
            story the Theræans are supported by the Cyrenaeans : for the <lb/>
            Cyrenæans in no respect agree with the Theræans in what <lb/>
            relates to Battus, for they tell the story thus. There is a <lb/>
            city of Crete called Axus, in which Etearchus was king ; he <lb/>
            having a motherless daughter, whose name was Phronima, <lb/>
            married another wife ; she coming into the family, thought <lb/>
            proper to be a stepmother indeed to Phronima, treating her <lb/>
            shamefully, and contriving every mischief she could against <lb/>
            her ; and at last, having charged her with unchastity, per­ <lb/>
            suaded her husband that such was the case. He, prevailed <lb/>
            on by his wife, formed a wicked design against his daughter. <lb/>
            There was then at Axus one Themison, a Theræan merchant; <lb/>
            this man Etearchus received hospitably, and made him swear <lb/>
            that he would serve him in any thing he should desire. When <lb/>
            he had bound him by oath, he delivered Ills daughter to him, <lb/>
            and commanded him to take her away, and throw her into <lb/>
            the sea. But Themison, grieved at the deceitfulness of the <lb/>
            oath, broke off the compact of friendship, and did as fol­ <lb/>
            lows. Having taken the damsel with him, he set sail; and <note type="footnote"> 7 Literally " brother from brothet.' </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <pb n="290"/>
            <note type="margin"> [155, 156 </note> <lb/>
            when he was in the open sea, for the purpose of absolving <lb/>
            himself from the oath imposed by Etearchus, he bound hei <lb/>
            round with ropes, and let her down into the sea ; then <lb/>
            having drawn her up again, he departed for Thera. 155. <lb/>
            After that Polymnestus, a man of distinction among the The­ <lb/>
            ræans, took Phronima for his concubine, and after some time <lb/>
            he had a son by her, who had an impediment in his speech <lb/>
            and lisped, to whom the name of Battus was given, as <lb/>
            both the Theræans and Cyrenæans say; but, as I am of opin­ <lb/>
            ion, some other name; and it was afterwards changed to <lb/>
            Battus when he arrived in Libya, deriving that name both <lb/>
            from the oracle pronounced to him at Delphi, and from the <lb/>
            rank to which he attained. For the Libyans call a king <lb/>
            Battus, and for this reason I think that the Pythian, when <lb/>
            delivering the oracle, addressed him in the Libyan tongue, <lb/>
            knowing that he would be a king in Libya. For when he <lb/>
            had reached man's estate, he came to Delphi about his voice ; <lb/>
            and to his inquiries the Pythian gave the following answer: <lb/>
            " Battus, you are come about your voice; king Phœbus <lb/>
            Apollo sends you to found a colony in Libya, abounding in <lb/>
            sheep." As if she had said in the Grecian language, "0 <lb/>
            king, you are come about your voice." He answered as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " 0 king, I came indeed to consult you about my voice, <lb/>
            but you give me an answer as to other impossible things, bid­ <lb/>
            ding me colonize Libya: with what power ? with what force ?" <lb/>
            By saying this he did not persuade the Pythian to give him <lb/>
            any other answer; and as she was repeating the same response <lb/>
            as before, he in the mean while left her, and returned to <lb/>
            Thera. 156. After this, Battus himself and the other The­ <lb/>
            ræans fell anew into troubles; but the Theræans, not knowing <lb/>
            whence their misfortunes came, sent to Delphi to inquire con­ <lb/>
            cerning their present sufferings. The Pythian answered, that <lb/>
            it would fare better with them, when with Battus they had <lb/>
            founded Cyrene in Libya. Upon this, the Theræans de­ <lb/>
            spatched Battus with two fifty-oared galleys. But these <lb/>
            having sailed to Libya, for they had nothing else that they <lb/>
            could do, returned back to Them; the Theræans, however, <lb/>
            beat them off as they drew to shore, and would not suffer <lb/>
            them to approach the land, but commanded them to sail back <lb/>
            again. Thus compelled, they sailed back again, and settled <pb n="291"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="157—159.]"/> <lb/>
            in an island that lies off Libya, whose name, as I before men­ <lb/>
            tioned, is Platea. This island is said to be equal in extent to <lb/>
            the present city of the Cyrenaeans.</p>
          <p>157. Having inhabited this island for two years, as nothing <lb/>
            turned out prosperously for them, they left one of their com­ <lb/>
            pany behind, and the rest set sail for Delphi; and having <lb/>
            come to the oracle, they consulted it, saying, that they had <lb/>
            settled in Libya, and fared no better since they had settled <lb/>
            there. But the Pythian gave them the following answer: <lb/>
            " If you, who have never been there, know Libya abounding <lb/>
            In sheep, better than I who have been there, I very much ad­ <lb/>
            mire your wisdom." When Battus and his companions heard <lb/>
            this, they sailed back again ; for the god did not release them <lb/>
            from founding the colony, until they had come to Libya itself. <lb/>
            Having, therefore, arrived at the island, they took on board <lb/>
            the man they had left there, and settled in a place on Libya <lb/>
            itself, opposite the island: its name was Aziris, and most <lb/>
            beautiful hills enclose it on two sides, and a river flows by it <lb/>
            on the third. 158. They inhabited this spot for six years, <lb/>
            but in the seventh, the Libyans, having promised to conduct <lb/>
            them to a better place, persuaded them to leave it. But the <lb/>
            Libyans, having removed them, conducted them from thence <lb/>
            towards the west; and in order that the Greeks might not <lb/>
            see the most beautiful part of their country as they passed <lb/>
            through, they computed the time of the day, so as to lead <lb/>
            them through it by night: the name of this country is Irasa. <lb/>
            Having conducted them to a fountain, accounted sacred, to <lb/>
            Apollo, they said, " Grecians, here it is fitting for you to <lb/>
            dwell, for here the heavens are open." 159. Now, during the <lb/>
            life of Battus the founder, who reigned forty years, and of his <lb/>
            son Arcesilaus, who reigned sixteen years, the Cyrenæans <lb/>
            continued the same in number as when they were first sent <lb/>
            to settle the colony: but under the third king, Battus, sur­ <lb/>
            named the Fortunate, the Pythian by an oracle encouraged all <lb/>
            Grecians to sail to Libya, and join the Cyrenaeas, in colo­ <lb/>
            nizing it; for the Cyrenæans invited them to a division of <lb/>
            the country. The words of the oracle were these : " He who <lb/>
            shall come too late to lovely Libya, when the land is divided, <lb/>
            shall hereafter one day repent." A great multitude having <lb/>
            assembled at Cyrene, the neighbouring Libyans and their <lb/>
            king, whose name was Adicran, being curtailed of much of <pb n="292"/>
             <note type="margin">[160, 161. </note> <lb/>
            their land, finding that they were deprived )f their territory, <lb/>
            and injuriously treated by the Cyrenæans, sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Egypt, and gave themselves up to Apries, king of Egypt: but <lb/>
            he, having assembled a large army of Egyptians, sent it against <lb/>
            Cyrene ; and the Cyrenæans, having drawn out their forces to <lb/>
            the district of Irasa, and near the fountain Thestes, came to an <lb/>
            engagement with the Egyptians, and conquered them: for the <lb/>
            Egyptians, not having before made trial of the Greeks, and <lb/>
            despising them, were so thoroughly defeated, that only a few <lb/>
            of them returned to Egypt. In consequence of this, the <lb/>
            Egyptians, laying the blame on Apries, revolted from him.</p>
          <p>160. This Battus had a son, Arcesilaus, who, having come <lb/>
            to the throne, first of all quarrelled with his own brothers, so <lb/>
            that they left him, and went to another part of Libya ; and <lb/>
            consulting among themselves, they founded the city which <lb/>
            was then and is still called Barce; and as they were building <lb/>
            it, they persuaded the Libyans to revolt from the Cyrenæans. <lb/>
            But afterwards Arcesilaus led an army against those Libyans <lb/>
            who had received them, and against the revolters themselves; <lb/>
            but the Libyans, through dread of him, fled to the eastern <lb/>
            Libyans. Arcesilaus pursued them in their flight, until he <lb/>
            overtook them at Leu con in Libya, and the Libyans resolved <lb/>
            to attack him ; and having come to an engagement, they con­ <lb/>
            quered the Cyrenæans so completely, that seven thousand <lb/>
            heavy-armed of the Cyrenæans fell upon the spot. After this <lb/>
            blow, his brother Learchus strangled Arcesilaus, who was sick, <lb/>
            and under the influence of some drug. The wife of Arcesilaus, <lb/>
            whose name was Eryxo, put Learchus to death by stratagem. <lb/>
            161. Battus the son of Arcesilaus, a lame man, and not perfect <lb/>
            in his feet, succeeded to the kingdom. The Cyrenæans, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of the disaster that had befallen them, sent to Delphi to <lb/>
            inquire of the Delphian oracle under what form of government <lb/>
            they might live most happily ; the Pythian commanded them to <lb/>
            procure an arbitrator from Mantinea, a city of the Arcadians. <lb/>
            The Cyrenæans accordingly asked, and the Mantineans gave <lb/>
            them a man, highly esteemed among the citizens, whose name <lb/>
            was Demonax. This person, therefore, having arrived in Cy­ <lb/>
            rene, and become acquainted with the state of affairs, first of <lb/>
            all formed them into three tribes, dividing them as follows: <lb/>
            of the Theræans and their immediate neighbours, he formed <lb/>
            one division ; another of Peloponnesians and Cretans; and a <pb n="293"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="162-164.]"/> <lb/>
            third of all the Islanders: and in the next place, having re­ <lb/>
            served certain portions of land and the office of the priesthood <lb/>
            for king Battus, he restored to the people everything else that <lb/>
            the kings had before.</p>
          <p>162. During the reign of this Battus matters continued in <lb/>
            this state; but in the time of his son Arcesilaus great dis­ <lb/>
            orders arose about the public offices. For Arcesilaus, son of <lb/>
            the lame Battus and Pheretime, declared he would not submit <lb/>
            to the constitutions of Demonax, but demanded back the pre­ <lb/>
            rogatives of his ancestors; and thereupon having raised a <lb/>
            sedition, he was defeated, and fled to Samos; and his mother <lb/>
            fled to Salamis, in Cyprus. At that time Euelthon bore rule <lb/>
            over Salamis, the same who dedicated the curious censer at <lb/>
            Delphi, which is deposited in the treasury of the Corinthians. <lb/>
            Pheretime, having come to him, asked for an army, which <lb/>
            should reinstate them in Cyrene; but Euelthon would give <lb/>
            her any thing rather than an army: but she, accepting what <lb/>
            was given, said, " This indeed is handsome, but it would be <lb/>
            still more handsome to give the army she asked for:" this <lb/>
            she said at every present that was made. At last, Euelthon <lb/>
            sent her a golden spindle and distaff, and some wool was on <lb/>
            it; and when Pheretime again made the same speech, Euel­ <lb/>
            thon said, " that women should be presented with such things, <lb/>
            and not with armies." 163. In the mean time Arcesilaus, con­ <lb/>
            tinuing at Samos, collected men of all classes, by a promise of <lb/>
            a division of lands; and when a large army was collected, <lb/>
            Arcesilaus set out to Delphi, to consult the oracle concerning <lb/>
            his return; and the Pythian gave him the following answer: <lb/>
            " Apollo grants you to reign over Cyrene, during the time of <lb/>
            four Battuses and four Arcesilauses, eight generations of <lb/>
            men; he advises you however not to attempt any more than <lb/>
            this. Do you therefore be quiet and return home; and if <lb/>
            you find a furnace full of amphoræ, do not bake the amphoræ, <lb/>
            but send them away with a favourable wind. But if you <lb/>
            heat the furnace, enter not into a place surrounded with <lb/>
            water; otherwise you will perish yourself, and the most <lb/>
            beautiful bull." 164. The Pythian gave this answer to <lb/>
            Arcesilaus; but he, having taken with him the men from. <lb/>
            Samos, returned to Cyrene; and having recovered the <lb/>
            mastery, he forgot the oracle, and exacted vengeance of the <lb/>
            Reverse party for his own exile ; so that some of them. <pb n="294"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[165-167"/> <lb/>
            abandoned their country altogether; and others Arcesilaus <lb/>
            seized and sent to Cyprus to be put to death: now these last, <lb/>
            being carried to their country, the Cnidians rescued, and sent <lb/>
            away to Thera. Some others of the Cyrenians, who had <lb/>
            taken refuge in a large private tower belonging to Agloma­ <lb/>
            chus, Arcesilaus surrounded with wood and burnt. After <lb/>
            this was done, understanding that this was the meaning of the <lb/>
            oracle, that the Pythian forbad him, when he found amphoræ <lb/>
            in a furnace, to bake them, he of his own accord withdrew <lb/>
            from the city of the Cyrenæans, dreading the predicted death, <lb/>
            and supposing that Cyrene was the place surrounded with <lb/>
            water. He had a wife who was his own kinswoman, and <lb/>
            daughter to the king of the Barcæans, whose name was <lb/>
            Alazir; to him he retired : and the Barcæans, and some of <lb/>
            the exiles from Cyrene, having discovered him in the public <lb/>
            place, killed him, and moreover his father-in-law Alazir. <lb/>
            Thus Arcesilaus, whether wilfully or otherwise, disobeying <lb/>
            the oracle, accomplished his own destiny.</p>
          <p>165. While Arcesilaus was living at Barce, working out <lb/>
            his own destruction, his mother Pheretime held the honours of <lb/>
            her son at Cyrene, both exercising his other functions, and <lb/>
            taking her seat in the council; but when she heard that her <lb/>
            son had been put to death at Barce, she fled to Egypt; for <lb/>
            Arcesilaus had performed some services for Cambyses son of <lb/>
            Cyrus, for it was this Arcesilaus who gave Cyrene to Cam­ <lb/>
            byses, and imposed a tribute on himself. Pheretime having <lb/>
            arrived in Egypt, seated herself as a suppliant of Aryandes, <lb/>
            entreating him to avenge her, alleging as a pretext, that her <lb/>
            son had, died-in consequence of his attachment to the Medes. <lb/>
            166. Aryandes had been appointed governor of Egypt by <lb/>
            Cambyses ; he in succeeding time was put to death for at­ <lb/>
            tempting to make himself equal with Darius. For having <lb/>
            been informed that Darius desired to leave such a memorial of <lb/>
            himself as had been accomplished by no other king, he imitated <lb/>
            him until he received the reward of his presumption. For <lb/>
            Darius, having refined gold to the utmost perfection, coined <lb/>
            money ; and Aryandes, governor of Egypt, made the same in <lb/>
            silver; now this Aryandian silver is the purest. But Da­ <lb/>
            rius, when informed that he had done this, brought another <lb/>
            charge against him, that he designed to rebel, and put him to <lb/>
            death 167. At that time, however, this Aryandes, taking <pb n="295"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="168—171.]"/> <lb/>
            compassion on Pheretime, gave her all the forces of Egypt, <lb/>
            both army and navy; and he appointed Amasis, a Maraphian, <lb/>
            commander of the army; and of the fleet, Badres, a Pasarga­ <lb/>
            than by birth. But before he despatched the forces, he sent <lb/>
            a herald to Barce, to inquire who it was that had slain Arce- <lb/>
            Bilaus. All the Barcaeans took it upon themselves ; for that <lb/>
            they had suffered many injuries at his hands. And when <lb/>
            Aryandes received their answer, he despatched the army with <lb/>
            Pheretime. Now this cause was only a pretext for his pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding ; but in my opinion, the expedition was undertaken <lb/>
            with the intention of subduing the Libyans. For there are <lb/>
            many and various nations of Libyans, and some few of them <lb/>
            were subject to the king, but the greater part paid no regard <lb/>
            to Darius.</p>
          <p>168. The Libyans dwell as follows. Beginning from <lb/>
            Egypt the Adrymachidæ are the first of the Libyans we meet <lb/>
            with: they for the most part observe the usages of Egypt, <lb/>
            but they wear the same dress as the other Libyans. The <lb/>
            women wear a chain of brass on each leg ; they let their hair <lb/>
            grow long, and when they catch vermin, each bites those <lb/>
            from her own person, and then throws them away; these <lb/>
            alone of the Libyans do this ; and they alone exhibit to the <lb/>
            king their virgins who are about to marry ; and should any <lb/>
            one be agreeable to the king, she is deflowered by him. These <lb/>
            Adrymachidæ reach from Egypt to the harbour named Plu­ <lb/>
            nus. 169. Next to these are the Giligammae, who occupy <lb/>
            the country westward, as far as the island Aphrodisias. <lb/>
            Midway on this coast the island of Platea is situate, which <lb/>
            the Cyrenæans colonized, and on the continent is the port of <lb/>
            Menelaus, with Aziris, which the Cyrenæans inhabited. At <lb/>
            this place the plant Silphium is first found, and extends from <lb/>
            the island of Platea to the mouth of the Syrtis. These peo. <lb/>
            ple use nearly the same customs as the others. 170. The <lb/>
            Asbystæ adjoin the Giligammæ westward; they inhabit the <lb/>
            country above Cyrene, but the Asbystae do not reach to the <lb/>
            sea; for the Cyrenæans occupy the sea-coast. They drive <lb/>
            four-horsed chariots, more than any of the Libyans ; and en­ <lb/>
            deavour to imitate most of the customs of the Cyrenseans. <lb/>
            171. The Auschisæ adjoin the Asbystæ westward; these are <lb/>
            situate above Barce, extending to the sea near the Euespe­ <lb/>
            rides. In the midst of the territory of the Auschisæ, the <pb n="296"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[172-175."/> <lb/>
            Cabales, a small nation, dwell, extending to Tauchira, a city <lb/>
            of Barcæa. They observe the same customs as those who <lb/>
            dwell above Cyrene. 172. The Nasamones, a very numerous <lb/>
            people, adjoin these Auschisæ westward. In summer they <lb/>
            leave their cattle on the coast, and go up to the region of <lb/>
            Augila, in order to gather the fruit of the palm-trees, which <lb/>
            grow in great numbers and of a large size, and are all pro­ <lb/>
            ductive. When they have caught locusts, they dry them in <lb/>
            the sun, reduce them to powder, and sprinkling them in milk, <lb/>
            drink them. Every man, by the custom of the country, has <lb/>
            several wives, and they have intercourse with them in common ; <lb/>
            and much the same as the Massagetæ, they have intercourse <lb/>
            when they have set up a staff before them. When a Nasa­ <lb/>
            monian first marries, it is the custom for the bride on the <lb/>
            first night to lie with all the guests in turn, and each, when <lb/>
            he has intercourse with her, gives her some present which he <lb/>
            has brought from home. In their oaths and divinations they <lb/>
            observe the following custom : they swear, laying their hands <lb/>
            on the sepulchres of those who are generally esteemed to <lb/>
            have been the most just and excellent persons among them : <lb/>
            and they divine, going to the tombs of their ancestors, and <lb/>
            after having prayed, they lie down to sleep, and whatever <lb/>
            dream they have, this they avail themselves of. In pledging <lb/>
            their faith they observe the following method: each party <lb/>
            gives the other to drink out of his hand, and drinks in turn <lb/>
            from the other's hand ; and if they have no liquid, they take <lb/>
            up some dust from the ground and lick it.</p>
          <p>173. The Psylli border on the Nasamonians ; these perished <lb/>
            in the following manner : the south wind blowing upon them <lb/>
            dried up all their water tanks, and the whole country within the <lb/>
            Syrtis was dry; they therefore, having consulted together, with <lb/>
            one consent determined to make war against that wind ; (I only <lb/>
            repeat what the Libyans say ;) and when they arrived at the <lb/>
            sands, the south wind blowing covered them over : and when <lb/>
            they had perished the Nasamonians took possession of their ter­ <lb/>
            ritory. 174. Above these to the north, in a country abounding <lb/>
            with wild beasts, live the Garamantes, who avoid all men ind <lb/>
            the society of any others : they do not possess any warlike wea­ <lb/>
            pon, nor do they know how to defend themselves. 175. These <lb/>
            then live above the Nasamonians ; and the Macæ adjoin them <lb/>
            en the sea-coast, westward; these shave their heads so as to <pb n="297"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="176-179.]"/> <lb/>
            leave a tuft, and allowing the middle hair to grow, they shave <lb/>
            both sides close to the skin ; in war they wear the skins cf <lb/>
            ostriches for defensive armour. The river Cinyps, flowing <lb/>
            through their country from a hill called the Graces, dis­ <lb/>
            charges itself into the sea. This hill of the Graces is thickly <lb/>
            covered with trees, though all the rest of Libya above men­ <lb/>
            tioned is bare. From the sea to this hill is a distance of two <lb/>
            hundred stades. 176. The Gindanes adjoin these Macæ ; <lb/>
            their women wear bands of leather round their ancles, each <lb/>
            several on the following account, as is said ; she binds round a <lb/>
            band for every man that has intercourse with her; and she who <lb/>
            has the most is most esteemed, as being loved by the greatest <lb/>
            number of men. 177. The Lotophagi occupy the coast that <lb/>
            projects to the sea in front of these Gindanes ; they subsist <lb/>
            only on the fruit of the lotus ; and the fruit of the lotus is <lb/>
            equal in size to the mastic berry, and in sweetness it resem­ <lb/>
            bles the fruit of the palm-tree. The Lotophagi make wine <lb/>
            also from this fruit.</p>
          <p>178. The Machlyes, who also use the lotus, but in a less <lb/>
            degree than those before mentioned, adjoin the Lotophagi on <lb/>
            the sea-coast. They extend as far as a large river called <lb/>
            Triton ; and this river discharges itself into the great lake <lb/>
            Tritonis ; and in it is an island named Phla. They say that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians were commanded by an oracle to colonize <lb/>
            this island. 179. The following story is also told ; that <lb/>
            Jason, when the Argo was finished building at the foot of <lb/>
            Mount Pelion, having put a hecatomb on board, and moreover <lb/>
            a brazen tripod, sailed round the Peloponnesus, purposing to go <lb/>
            to Delphi; and as he was sailing off Malea, a north wind caught <lb/>
            him and drove him to Libya ; and before he could discern the <lb/>
            land, he found himself in the shallows of the lake Tritonis: <lb/>
            and as he was in doubt how to extricate his ship, the story goes <lb/>
            that a Triton appeared to him, and bid Jason give him the <lb/>
            tripod, promising that he would both show them the passage, <lb/>
            and conduct them away in safety. When Jason consented, <lb/>
            the Triton thereupon showed them the passage out of the shal­ <lb/>
            lows, and placed the tripod in his own temple ; then pro­ <lb/>
            nouncing an oracle from the tripod, he declared to Jason and <lb/>
            his companions all that should happen, that "when one of the <lb/>
            descendants of those who sailed with him in the Argo should <lb/>
            carry away the tripod, then it was fated that a hundred Grecian <pb n="298"/>
             <note type="margin">[180, 181 </note> <lb/>
            cities should oe built about the lake Tritonis : the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring nations of the Libyans, when they heard this, concealed <lb/>
            the tripod. 180. The Auses adjoin these Machlyes ; they, as <lb/>
            well as the Machlyes, dwell round the lake Tritonis, and the Tri­ <lb/>
            ton forms the boundary between them. The Machlyes let the <lb/>
            hair grow on the back of the head, and the Auses on the front <lb/>
            At the annual festival of Minerva, their virgins, dividing them­ <lb/>
            selves into two companies, fight together with stones and staves, <lb/>
            affirming that they perform the ancient rites to their native <lb/>
            goddess, whom we call Minerva: and those of the virgins who <lb/>
            die from their wounds they call false virgins. But before they <lb/>
            leave off fighting, they do as follows ; with one consent they <lb/>
            on each occasion deck the virgin that excels in beauty, with a <lb/>
            Corinthian helmet, and a suit of Grecian armour, and having <lb/>
            placed her in a chariot, conduct her round the lake. In what <lb/>
            way they formerly decorated the virgins before the Grecians <lb/>
            settled in their neighbourhood, I am unable to say ; but I con­ <lb/>
            jecture that they were decked in Egyptian armour, for I am <lb/>
            of opinion, that the shield and helmet were brought from <lb/>
            Egypt into Greece. They say, that Minerva is the daughter <lb/>
            of Neptune and the lake Tritonis; and that she being for <lb/>
            some reason offended with her father, gave herself to Jupiter, <lb/>
            and that Jupiter adopted her as his own daughter: this they <lb/>
            say. They have promiscuous intercourse with the women, <lb/>
            and do not cohabit, and associate like beasts. The men meet <lb/>
            together every third month, and when a woman has a child <lb/>
            grown up, he is considered to be the son of that man whom he <lb/>
            most resembles.</p>
          <p>181. Those then of the Libyan nomades who live on the <lb/>
            sea-coast have been mentioned. Above these, inland, Libya <lb/>
            abounds in wild beasts; and beyond the wild beast tract is a <lb/>
            ridge of sand, stretching from the Egyptian Thebes to the <lb/>
            columns of Hercules. At intervals of a ten days' journey in <lb/>
            this ridge, there are pieces of salt in large lumps on.hills; and <lb/>
            at the top of each hill, from the midst of the salt, cold and <lb/>
            sweet water gushes up; and around it dwell people the far­ <lb/>
            thest towards the desert, and beyond the wild-beast tract. The <lb/>
            first after a ten days' journey from Thebes are the Ammoni­ <lb/>
            ans, who have a temple resembling that of Theban Jupiter. <lb/>
            For, as I said before, the image of Jupiter at Thebes has the <lb/>
            bead of a ram. They have also another kind of spring water <pb n="299"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="182-184.]"/> <lb/>
            which in the morning is tepid, becomes colder about the time <lb/>
            of full forum, and at mid-day is very cold; then they water <lb/>
            their gardens. As the day declines it gradually loses its <lb/>
            coldness, till the sun sets, then the water becomes tepid again, <lb/>
            and continuing to increase in heat till midnight, it then boils <lb/>
            and bubbles up; when midnight is passed, it gets cooler <lb/>
            until morning. This fountain is called after the sun. 182. <lb/>
            Next to the Ammonians, along the ridge of sand, at the end <lb/>
            of another ten days' journey, there is a hill of salt, like that of <lb/>
            the Ammonians, and water, and men live round it: the name <lb/>
            of this region is Augila; to this place the Nasamonians go to <lb/>
            gather the dates. 183. From the Augilæ at the end of another <lb/>
            ten days' journey is another hill of salt and water, and many <lb/>
            fruit-bearing palm-trees, as also in the other places ; and men <lb/>
            inhabit it who are called Garamantes, a very powerful nation ; <lb/>
            they lay earth upon the salt, and then sow their ground. <lb/>
            From these to the Lotophagi the shortest route is a journey of <lb/>
            thirty days: amongst them the kine that feed backwards are <lb/>
            met with ; they feed backwards for this reason: they have <lb/>
            horns that are bent forward, therefore they draw back as they <lb/>
            feed; for they are unable to go forward, because their horns <lb/>
            would stick in the ground. They differ from other kine in no <lb/>
            other respect than this, except that their hide is thicker and <lb/>
            harder. These Garamantes hunt the Ethiopian Troglodytes <lb/>
            in four-horse chariots ; for the Ethiopian Troglodytes are the <lb/>
            swiftest of foot of all men of whom we have heard any account <lb/>
            given. The Troglodytes feed upon serpents and lizards, and <lb/>
            such kind of reptiles: they speak a language like no other, <lb/>
            but screech like bats.</p>
          <p>184. At the distance of another ten days'journey from the <lb/>
            Garamantes, is another hill of salt, and water, and men live <lb/>
            round it who are called Atarantes ; they are the only people <lb/>
            we know of who have not personal names. For the name <lb/>
            Atarantes, belongs to them collectively, but to each one of them <lb/>
            no name is given. They curse the sun as he passes over <lb/>
            their heads, and moreover utter against him the foulest invec­ <lb/>
            tives, because he consumes them by his scorching heat, both <lb/>
            the men themselves and their country. Afterwards, at the <lb/>
            end of another ten days' journey, there is another hill of salt, <lb/>
            and water, and men live round it; and near this salt is <lb/>
            mountain, which is called Atlas; it is narrow and circular on <pb n="300"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[185-187."/> <lb/>
            all sides, and is said to be so lofty, that its top can never be <lb/>
            seen ; for it is never free from clouds, either in summer or <lb/>
            winter. The inhabitants say that it is the Pillar of Heaven. <lb/>
            From this mountain these men derive their appellation, for <lb/>
            they are called Atlantes. They are said neither to eat the <lb/>
            flesh of any animal, nor to see visions. 185. As far, then, as <lb/>
            these Atlantes I am able to mention the names of the nations <lb/>
            that inhabit this ridge, but not beyond them. This ridge, <lb/>
            however, extends as far as the pillars of. Hercules, and even <lb/>
            beyond them; and there is a mine of salt in it at intervals of <lb/>
            ten days' journey, and men dwelling there. The houses of <lb/>
            them all are built of blocks of salt, for in these parts of Libya <lb/>
            no rain falls; for walls being of salt could not stand long if <lb/>
            rain did fall. The salt dug out there is white and purple <lb/>
            in appearance. Above this ridge, to the south and interior of <lb/>
            Libya, the country is desert, without water, without animals, <lb/>
            without rain, and without wood; and there is no kind of <lb/>
            moisture in it.</p>
          <p>186. Thus, then, as far as the lake Tritonis from Egypt, the <lb/>
            Libyans are nomades, eat flesh, and drink milk, but they do <lb/>
            not taste the flesh of cows, for the same reason as the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians, nor do they breed swine. Indeed, not only do the women <lb/>
            of the Cyrenæans think it right to abstain from the flesh of <lb/>
            cows, out of respect to Isis in Egypt, but they also observe <lb/>
            the fasts and festivals in honour of her: and the women of <lb/>
            the Barcæans do not taste the flesh of swine in addition to <lb/>
            that of cows. These things, then, are so. 187. Westward of <lb/>
            the lake Tritonis, the Libyans are no longer nomades, nor do <lb/>
            they follow the same customs, nor do they do with respect to <lb/>
            their children what the nomades are accustomed to do : for <lb/>
            the nomadic Libyans, whether all I am unable to say with <lb/>
            certainty, but many of them do as follows : when their <lb/>
            children are four years old, they burn the veins on the <lb/>
            crown of their heads, with unclonned sheep's wool; and some <lb/>
            of them do it on the veins in the temples ; to the end that <lb/>
            humours flowing down from the head may not injure them as <lb/>
            long as they live : and, for this reason, they say they are so <lb/>
            very healthy, for the Libyans are in truth the most healthy of <lb/>
            all men with whom we are acquainted ; whether from this <lb/>
            cause, I am unable to say with certainty: however, they are <lb/>
            the most healthy. But if convulsions seize the children when <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="188—191.]"/> <lb/>
            they are burning them, they have a remedy discovered; by <lb/>
            sprinkling them with the urine of a he-goat, they restore <lb/>
            them. I repeat what the Libyans themselves say. 188. These <lb/>
            Libyan nomades have the following sacrificial rites. When <lb/>
            they have first cut off the ear of the victim, they throw it over <lb/>
            the house ; and having done this, .they twist its neck. They <lb/>
            sacrifice only to the sun and moon ; to them, indeed, all the <lb/>
            Libyans offer sacrifice : but those who live about the lake <lb/>
            Tritonis, sacrifice principally to Minerva, and next to Triton <lb/>
            and Neptune. 189. From the Libyan women the Grecians <lb/>
            derived the attire and ægis of Minerva's statues ; for, except <lb/>
            that the dress of the Libyan women is leather, and the fringes <lb/>
            that hang from the ægis are not serpents, but made of thongs, <lb/>
            in all other respects they are equipped in the same way: and, <lb/>
            moreover, the very name proves that the garb of the Palladia <lb/>
            comes from Libya ; for the Libyan women throw over their <lb/>
            dress, goats' skins without the hair, fringed and dyed with <lb/>
            red. From these goats' skins the Grecians have borrowed <lb/>
            the name of Ægis. And the bowlings in the temples were, <lb/>
            I think, first derived from thence ; for the Libyan women <lb/>
            practise the same custom, and do it well. The Grecians also <lb/>
            learnt from the Libyans to yoke four horses abreast. 190. All <lb/>
            the nomades, except the Nasamonians, inter their dead in the <lb/>
            same manner as the Grecians: these bury them in a sitting <lb/>
            posture, watching when one is about to expire, that they may <lb/>
            set him up, and he may not die supine. Their dwellings are <lb/>
            compacted of the asphodel shrub, interwoven with rushes, and <lb/>
            are portable. Such are the customs of these people.</p>
          <p>191. To the west of the river Triton, Libyans who are <lb/>
            husbandmen next adjoin the Auses ; they are accustomed to <lb/>
            live in houses, and are called Maxyes. They let the hair grow <lb/>
            on the right side of the head, and shave the left; and bedaub <lb/>
            the body with vermilion : they say that they are descended <lb/>
            from men who came from Troy. This region, and all the rest <lb/>
            of Libya westward, is much more infested by wild beasts and <lb/>
            more thickly wooded than the country of the nomades ; for <lb/>
            the eastern country of Libya, which the nomades inhabit, is <lb/>
            low and sandy, as far as the river Triton; but the country <lb/>
            westward of this, which is occupied by agriculturists, is very <lb/>
            mountainous, woody, and abounds with wild beasts. For <lb/>
            amongst them there are enormous serpents, and lions, cle­ <pb n="302"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[192—195"/> <lb/>
            phants, bears, asps, and asses with horns, and monsters with <lb/>
            doge heads and without heads, who have eyes in their breasts, <lb/>
            at least as the Libyans say, and wild men and wild women, <lb/>
            and many other wild beasts which are not fabulous. 192. None <lb/>
            of these things are found among the nomades, but others of <lb/>
            the following kind ; pygargi, antelopes, buffaloes, and asses, <lb/>
            not such as have horns, but others that do not drink ; for <lb/>
            they never drink; and oryes, from the horns of which are <lb/>
            made the elbows of the Phoenician citherns; in size this beast <lb/>
            is equal to an ox: and foxes, hyænas, porcupines, wild rams, <lb/>
            dictyes, thoes, panthers, boryes, and land crocodiles about <lb/>
            three cubits long, very much like lizards; ostriches, and <lb/>
            small serpents, each with one horn. These, then, are the <lb/>
            wild animals in that country, besides such as are met with <lb/>
            elsewhere, except the stag and the wild boar; but the stag <lb/>
            and the wild boar are never seen in Libya. They have three <lb/>
            sorts of mice there; some called dipodes, or two-footed; others, <lb/>
            zegeries, this name is Libyan, and means the same as the <lb/>
            word signifying hillocks in Greek ; and hedgehogs. There are <lb/>
            also weasels produced in the silphium, very like those at Tar­ <lb/>
            tessus. The land of the Libyan nomades produces wild ani­ <lb/>
            mals of the above description, as far as I by the most diligent <lb/>
            inquiry have been able to ascertain.</p>
          <p>193. The Zaveces adjoin the Maxyan Libyans; their <lb/>
            women drive their chariots in war. 194. The Gyzantes ad­ <lb/>
            join them; amongst them bees make a great quantity of honey, <lb/>
            and it is said that confectioners make much more. All these <lb/>
            paint themselves with vermilion, and eat monkeys, which <lb/>
            abound in their mountains. 195. Near them, the Carthagini­ <lb/>
            ans say, lies an island called Cyraunis, two hundred stades in <lb/>
            length, inconsiderable in breadth, easy of access from the con­ <lb/>
            tinent, and abounding in olive trees and vines. They add, <lb/>
            that in it is a lake, from the mud of which the virgins of the <lb/>
            country draw up gold dust by means of feathers daubed with <lb/>
            pitch. Whether this is true I know not, but I write what is <lb/>
            related ; it may be so however, for I have myself seen pitch <lb/>
            drawn up out of a lake and from water in Zacynthus; <lb/>
            and there are several lakes there, the largest of them is <lb/>
            seventy feet every way, and two orgyæ in depth : into this <lb/>
            they let down a pole with a myrtle branch fastened to the end, <lb/>
            and then draw up pitch adhering to the myrtle; it has tba <pb n="303"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="196—198.]"/> <lb/>
            smell of asphalt, but is in other respects better than the pitch <lb/>
            of Pieria. They pour it into a cistern dug near the lake, and <lb/>
            when they have collected a sufficient quantity, they pour it off <lb/>
            from the cistern into jars. All that falls into the lake passes <lb/>
            under ground, and appears again upon the surface of the <lb/>
            sea, which is about four stades distant from the lake. Thus, <lb/>
            then, the account given of the island that lies off Libya may <lb/>
            probably be true. 196. The Carthaginians further say, that <lb/>
            beyond the pillars of Hercules there is a region of Libya <lb/>
            and men who inhabit it: when they arrive among these peo­ <lb/>
            ple and have unloaded their merchandise, they set it in order <lb/>
            on the shore, go on board their ships, and make a great smoke : <lb/>
            that the inhabitants, seeing the smoke, come down to the sea, <lb/>
            and then deposit gold in exchange for the merchandise, and <lb/>
            withdraw to some distance from the merchandise ; that the <lb/>
            Carthaginians then, going ashore, examine the gold, and if the <lb/>
            quantity seems sufficient for the merchandise they take it up <lb/>
            and sail away; but if it is not sufficient, they go on board <lb/>
            their ships again and wait ; the natives then approach and <lb/>
            deposit more gold, until they have satisfied them : neither <lb/>
            party ever wrongs the other ; for they do not touch the gold <lb/>
            before it is made adequate to the value of the merchandise, <lb/>
            nor do the natives touch the merchandise before the other <lb/>
            party has taken the gold.</p>
          <p>197. Such are the Libyans, whose names I have been <lb/>
            able to mention; and most of these neither now nor at <lb/>
            that time paid any regard to the king of the Medes. But I <lb/>
            have still this much to say about this country, that four dis­ <lb/>
            tinct races inhabit it, and no more, as far as we know : two of <lb/>
            these races are indigenous, and two not. The Libyans <lb/>
            and Ethiopians are indigenous, the one inhabiting the north­ <lb/>
            ern, the other the southern parts of Libya ; but the Phoeni­ <lb/>
            cians and Greeks are foreigners. 198. No part of Libya <lb/>
            appears to me so good in fertility as to be compared with <lb/>
            Asia or Europe, except only the district of Cinyps ; for the <lb/>
            land bears the same name as the river, and is equal to the <lb/>
            best land in the production of corn : nor is it at all like the rest <lb/>
            of Libya ; for the soil is black, and well watered with springs, <lb/>
            and it is neither affected at all by drought, nor is it injured by <lb/>
            imbibing too much rain ; for rain falls in this part of Libya. <lb/>
            The proportion of the produce of this land equals that of <pb n="304"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[199—201."/> <lb/>
            Babylon. The land also which the Euesperides occupy is <lb/>
            good ; for when it yields its best, it produces a hundred-fold ; <lb/>
            but that in Cinyps three hundred-fold. 199. The district of <lb/>
            Cyrene, which is the highest of that part of Libya which the <lb/>
            nomades occupy, has three seasons, a circumstance worthy of ad­ <lb/>
            miration ; for the first fruits near the sea swell so as to be ready <lb/>
            for the harvest and vintage ; and when these are gathered in, <lb/>
            the fruits of the middle region, away from the sea, swell so as to <lb/>
            be gathered in, these they call uplands ; and when this middle <lb/>
            harvest has been gathered in, that in the highest part becomes <lb/>
            ripe and swells. So that when the first crop has been drunk <lb/>
            and eaten, the last comes in. Thus harvest occupies the Cyre­ <lb/>
            næans during eight months. This may be sufficient to say <lb/>
            concerning these things.</p>
          <p>200. The Persians sent to avenge Pheretime, when, having <lb/>
            been despatched from Egypt by Aryandes, they arrived at <lb/>
            Barce, laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of the <lb/>
            persons concerned in the death of Arcesilaus; but as the <lb/>
            whole people were implicated, they did not listen to the <lb/>
            proposal. Thereupon they besieged Barce for nine months, <lb/>
            digging passages underground that reached to the walls, and <lb/>
            making vigorous assaults. Now the excavations a worker of <lb/>
            brass discovered by means of a brazen shield, having recourse <lb/>
            to the following expedient; carrying it round within the wall, <lb/>
            he applied it to the ground within the city: in other places to <lb/>
            which he applied it, it made no noise, but at the parts that <lb/>
            were excavated, the brass of the shield sounded. The Bar- <lb/>
            Means, therefore, countermining them in that part, slew the <lb/>
            Persians who were employed in the excavation; thus then this <lb/>
            was discovered; but the assaults the Barcaans repulsed. <lb/>
            201. When much time had been spent, and many had fallen <lb/>
            on both sides, and not the fewest on the side of the Persians, <lb/>
            Amasis, general of the land forces, had recourse to the follow­ <lb/>
            in- stratagem : finding that the Barcæans could not be taken <lb/>
            by force, but might be by artifice, he did thus : having dug a <lb/>
            wide pit by night, he laid weak planks of wood over it, and on <lb/>
            the surface over the planks he spread a heap of earth, making <lb/>
            it level with the rest of the ground. At day-break he invited <lb/>
            the Barcæans to a conference, but they gladly assented, so <lb/>
            that at last they were pleased to come to terms: and they <lb/>
            male an agreement of the following nature, concluding the <pb n="305"/>
             <note type="margin">202, 203. </note> <lb/>
            treaty over the concealed pit: " That as long as this earth <lb/>
            shall remain as it is, the treaty should continue in force ; and <lb/>
            that the Barcæans should pay a reasonable tribute to the <lb/>
            king, and that the Persians should form no new designs <lb/>
            against the Barcæans." After the treaty the Barcæans, con <lb/>
            filling in the Persians, both themselves went out of the city <lb/>
            and allowed any one of the Persians who chose to pass within <lb/>
            the wall, having thrown open all the gates. But the Persians, <lb/>
            having broken down the concealed bridge, rushed within the <lb/>
            wall : and they broke down the bridge that they had made for <lb/>
            the following reason, that they might keep their oath, having <lb/>
            made a compact with the Barcæans, that the treaty should <lb/>
            continue so long as the earth should remain as it then was ; <lb/>
            but when they had broken down the bridge, the treaty no <lb/>
            longer remained in force.</p>
          <p>202. Those of the Barcæans who were most to blame, <lb/>
            Pheretime impaled round the walls, when they had been de­ <lb/>
            livered up to her by the Persians; and having cut off the <lb/>
            breasts of their wives, she also studded the wall with them. <lb/>
            The rest of the Barcæans she gave up as booty to the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, except such of them as were Battiadæ, and had not <lb/>
            participated in the murder; to these Pheretime intrusted the <lb/>
            city. 203. The Persians therefore, having reduced the rest <lb/>
            of the Barcæans to slavery, took their departure; and when <lb/>
            they halted at the city of the Cyrenæans, the Cyrenæans, to <lb/>
            absolve themselves from obedience to some oracle, permitted <lb/>
            them to pass through the city. But as the army was going <lb/>
            through, Bares, the commander of the naval forces, urged <lb/>
            them to take the city; but Amasis, the commander of the <lb/>
            land forces, would not allow it, " for that he was sent against <lb/>
            no other Grecian city than that of Barce." However, when <lb/>
            they had passed through, and encamped on the hill of the <lb/>
            Lycæan Jupiter, they began to repent that they had not pos­ <lb/>
            sessed themselves of Cyrene, and attempted to enter it a <lb/>
            second time. But the Cyrenaeans would not suffer them, and <lb/>
            a panic struck the Persians, although no one attacked them; <lb/>
            and having run away for a distance of sixty stades, they pitched <lb/>
            their camp. When the army was encamped here, a mes­ <lb/>
            senger came from Aryandes, to recal them. The Persians, <lb/>
            having requested the Cyrenæans to give them provisions for <lb/>
            their march, obtained their request, and having received <pb n="806"/>
             <note type="margin">[204, 205. </note> <lb/>
            them, marched away towards Egypt. And from thence the <lb/>
            Libyans, laying wait for them, put to death those that strayed <lb/>
            and loitered behind, for the sake of their dress and baggage, <lb/>
            until they reached Egypt. 204. The farthest point of Africa <lb/>
            to which this Persian army penetrated was the country of the <lb/>
            Eucaperides. The Barcæans, whom they had enslaved, they <lb/>
            transported from Egypt to the king; and king Darius gave <lb/>
            them a village in the district of Bactria, to dwell in. They <lb/>
            gave then the name of Barce to this village, which was still <lb/>
            inhabited in my time, in the Bactrian territory. 205. Phere­ <lb/>
            time, however, did not close her life happily; for immediately <lb/>
            after she returned from Libya to Egypt, having avenged her­ <lb/>
            self on the Barcæans, she died miserably; for even while <lb/>
            alive she swarmed with maggots. So odious to the gods are <lb/>
            the excesses of human vengeance. Such and so great was <lb/>
            the vengeance of Pheretime wife of Battus, on the Barcæans.</p>

          <p>THE Persians, left in Europe by Darius under the command <lb/>
            of Megabazus,1 subdued the Perinthians first of the Helles­ <lb/>
            pontines, who were unwilling to submit to Darius, and had been <lb/>
            before roughly handled by the Pæonians. For the Pæonians <lb/>
            from the Strymon, an oracle having admonished them to in­ <lb/>
            vade the Perinthians, and if the Perinthians, when encamped <lb/>
            over against them, should challenge them, shouting to them <lb/>
            by name, then to attack, but if they should not shout out to <lb/>
            them, not to attack; the Pæonians did accordingly. The <lb/>
            Perinthians having encamped opposite to them in the suburbs, <lb/>
            a threefold single combat there took place according to a <lb/>
            challenge ;*for they matched a man with a man, a horse with <lb/>
            a horse, and a dog with a dog. But the Perinthians being <lb/>
            victorious in two of these combats, when through excess of <lb/>
            joy they sang the Pæon, the Pæoniane conjectured that this <lb/>
            was the meaning of the oracle, and said among themselves : <lb/>
            " Now surely the oracle must be accomplished; now it is <lb/>
            our part to act." Thus the Pæonians attacked the Perinthians <lb/>
            as they were singing the Paeon, and gained a complete vic­ <lb/>
            tory, and left but few of them alive. 2. Such, then, had for­ <lb/>
            merly been the achievements of the Pæonians ; but at that <lb/>
            time, though the Perinthians proved themselves valiant in <lb/>
            defence of their liberty, the Persians and Megabazus over­ <lb/>
            came them by numbers. When Perinthus was subdued, <lb/>
            Megabazus marched his army through Thrace, subjecting to <lb/>
            the king every city and every nation of those dwelling in that <lb/>
            country ; for this command had been given him by Darius, to <lb/>
            subdue Thrace.</p>
          <p>3. The nation of the Thracians is the greatest of any among <note type="footnote"> I See B. IV. chap. 144. </note> <note type="footnote">v? </note> <pb n="308"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="4-7."/> <lb/>
            men, except at least the Indians ; and if they Were governed by <lb/>
            one man, or acted in concert, they would, in my opinion, be <lb/>
            invincible, and by far the most powerful of all nations. But <lb/>
            as this is impracticable, and it is impossible that they should <lb/>
            ever be united, they are therefore weak. They have various <lb/>
            names, according to their respective regions, but all observe <lb/>
            similar customs in every respect, except the Getæ, the Trausi, <lb/>
            and those who dwell above the Crestonæans. 4. Of these, <lb/>
            what are the customs of the Getæ, who pretend to be immor­ <lb/>
            tal, I have already described.2 The Trausi, in all other re­ <lb/>
            spects, observe the same usages as the rest of the Thracians; <lb/>
            but with regard to one born amongst them, or that dies, they <lb/>
            do as follows. The relations, seating themselves round one <lb/>
            that is newly born, bewail him, deploring the many evils he <lb/>
            must needs fulfil, since he has been born ; enumerating the <lb/>
            various sufferings incident to mankind: but one that dies <lb/>
            they bury in the earth, making merry and rejoicing, recount­ <lb/>
            ing the many evils from which being released, he is now <lb/>
            in perfect bliss. 5. Those above the Crestonæans do as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : each man has several wives ; when therefore any <lb/>
            of them dies, a great contest arises among the wives, and <lb/>
            violent disputes among their friends, on this point, which of <lb/>
            them was most loved by the husband. She who is adjudged <lb/>
            to have been so, and is so honoured, having been extolled <lb/>
            both by men and women, is slain on the tomb by her own <lb/>
            nearest relative, and when slain is buried with her husband ; <lb/>
            the others deem this a great misfortune, for this is the utmost <lb/>
            disgrace to them. 6. There is moreover this custom among <lb/>
            the rest of the Thracians, they sell their children for ex­ <lb/>
            portation. They keep no watch over their unmarried daugh­ <lb/>
            ters, but suffer them to have intercourse with what men they <lb/>
            choose. But they keep a strict watch over their wives, and <lb/>
            purchase them from their parents at high prices. To be <lb/>
            marked with punctures is accounted a sign of noble birth ; <lb/>
            to be without punctures, ignoble. To be idle is most honour­ <lb/>
            able ; but to be a tiller of the soil, most dishonourable; to <lb/>
            live by war and rapine is most glorious. These are the most <lb/>
            remarkable of their customs. 7. They worship the following <lb/>
            gods only, Mars, Bacchus, and Diana. But their kings, to <lb/>
            the exception of the other citizens, reverence Mercury most <note type="footnote"> 2 B IV. chap. 93 94 </note> <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="8—11]"/> <lb/>
            of all the gods ; they swear by him only, and say that they <lb/>
            are themselves sprung from Mercury. 8. The funerals of the <lb/>
            wealthy among them are celebrated in this manner. They <lb/>
            expose the corpse during three days ; and having slain all <lb/>
            kinds of victims, they feast, having first made lamentation. <lb/>
            Then they bury them, having first burnt them, or at all <lb/>
            events placing them under ground ; then having thrown up a <lb/>
            mound, they celebrate all kinds of games, in which the great­ <lb/>
            est rewards are adjudged to single combat, according to the <lb/>
            estimation in which they are held. Such are the funeral rites <lb/>
            of the Thracians.</p>
          <p>9. To the north of this region no one is able to say with <lb/>
            certainty who are the people that inhabit it. But beyond the <lb/>
            Ister appears to be a desert and interminable tract: the only <lb/>
            men that I am able to hear of as dwelling beyond the Ister are <lb/>
            those called Sigynnæ, who wear the Medic dress: their horses <lb/>
            are shaggy all over the body, to five fingers in depth of hair ; <lb/>
            they are small, flat-nosed, and unable to carry men ; but when <lb/>
            yoked to chariots they are very fleet, therefore the natives <lb/>
            drive chariots. Their confines extend as far as the Eneti on <lb/>
            the Adriatic: and they say that they are a colony of Medes. <lb/>
            How they can have been a colony of the Medes I cannot com­ <lb/>
            prehend ; but any thing may happen in course of time. Now, <lb/>
            the Ligyes, who live above Massilia, call traders Sigynnæ, <lb/>
            and the Cyprians give that name to spears. 10. The Thra­ <lb/>
            cians say, bees occupy the parts beyond the Ister, and by <lb/>
            reason of them it is impossible to penetrate farther; to me, <lb/>
            however, in saying this they appear to say what is impro­ <lb/>
            )able, for these creatures are known to be impatient of cold; <lb/>
            but the regions beneath the Bear seem to be uninhabited by <lb/>
            reason of the cold. Such is the account given of this country. <lb/>
            Megabazus, then, subjected its maritime parts to the Persians.</p>
          <p>11. Darius, as soon as he had crossed the Hellespont and <lb/>
            reached Sardis, remembered the good offices of Histiæus the Mi­ <lb/>
            lesian, and the advice of Coes the Mitylenian. Having therefore <lb/>
            sent for them to Sardis, he gave them their choice of a recom­ <lb/>
            pence. Histiæus, as being already tyrant of Miletus, desired no <lb/>
            other government in addition ; but asked for Myrcinus of Edo­ <lb/>
            nia, wishing to build a city there. But Coes, as not being a ty­ <lb/>
            rant, but a private citizen, asked for the government of Mitylene. <lb/>
            When their requests were granted to both of them, they betook <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[12-14."/> <lb/>
            themselves to the places they had chosen. 12. It happened <lb/>
            that Darius, having witnessed a circumstance of the following <lb/>
            kind, was desirous of commanding Megabazus to seize the <lb/>
            Pæonians and transplant them out of Europe into Asia. <lb/>
            Pigres and Mantyes were Pæonians, who, when Darius had <lb/>
            crossed over into Asia, being desirous to rule over the Pæoni­ <lb/>
            ans, came to Sardis, bringing with them their sister, who was <lb/>
            tall and beautiful: and having watched the opportunity when <lb/>
            Darius was seated in public in the suburb of the Lydians, they <lb/>
            did as follows. Having dressed their sister in the best manner <lb/>
            they could, they sent her for water, carrying a pitcher on her <lb/>
            head, leading a horse on her arm, and spinning flax. As the <lb/>
            woman passed by, it attracted the attention of Darius, for what <lb/>
            she was doing was neither according to the Persian or Lydian <lb/>
            customs, nor of any other people in Asia; when, therefore, it <lb/>
            attracted his attention, he sent some of his body-guard, bidding <lb/>
            them observe what the woman would do with the horse. The <lb/>
            guards accordingly followed her, and she, when she came to <lb/>
            the river, watered the horse; and having watered it, and filled <lb/>
            her pitcher, returned by the same way, carrying the water on <lb/>
            her head, leading the horse on her arm, and turning her <lb/>
            spindle. 13. Darius, surprised at what he heard from the <lb/>
            spies, and at what he himself had seen, commanded them to <lb/>
            bring her into his presence; and when she was brought, her <lb/>
            brothers also made their appearance, who were keeping a look- <lb/>
            out some where not far off: and when Darius asked of what <lb/>
            country she was, the young men said, that they were Pæoni­ <lb/>
            ans, and that she was their sister. He then inquired, " Who <lb/>
            are the Pæonians, in what part of the world do they live, and <lb/>
            for what purpose have they come to Sardis ?" They told him <lb/>
            that they had come to deliver themselves up to him, and <lb/>
            that Pæonia was situated on the river Strymon, and the <lb/>
            Strymon was not far from the Hellespont; and that they were <lb/>
            a colony of Teucrians, from Troy." They then mentioned <lb/>
            these several particulars; and he asked, "If all the women -of <lb/>
            that country were so industrious:" they readily answered, <lb/>
            that such was the case; for they had formed their plan for this <lb/>
            very purpose.</p>
          <p>14. Thereupon Darius writes letters to Megabazus, whom <lb/>
            he had left general in Thrace, commanding him to remove the <lb/>
            Pæonians from their abodes, and to bring to him themselves. <pb n="311"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="15,16.]"/> <lb/>
            their children, and their wives. A horseman immediately <lb/>
            hastened to the Hellespont with the message; and having <lb/>
            crossed over, delivered the letter to Megabazus; but he, <lb/>
            having read it, and taken guides from Thrace, marched against <lb/>
            Pæonia. 15. The Pæonians, having heard that the Persians <lb/>
            were coming against them, assembled, and drew out their <lb/>
            forces towards the sea, thinking that the Persians would at­ <lb/>
            tempt to enter and attack them in that direction: the Pæoni­ <lb/>
            ans, accordingly, were prepared to repel the army of Megaba­ <lb/>
            zus at its first onset. But the Persians, understanding that <lb/>
            the Pæonians had assembled and were guarding the approaches <lb/>
            on the coast, having guides, went the upper road; and having <lb/>
            escaped the notice of the Pæonians, came suddenly on their <lb/>
            towns, which were destitute of inhabitants, and as they fell <lb/>
            upon them when empty, they easily got possession of them. <lb/>
            But the Pæonians, as soon as they heard that their cities were <lb/>
            taken, immediately dispersed themselves, and repaired each to <lb/>
            his own home, and gave themselves up to the Persians. Thus <lb/>
            the Siropæonians and Pæoplæ, and those tribes of Pæonians as <lb/>
            far as the lake Prasias, were removed from their abodes, and <lb/>
            transported into Asia. 16. But those around Mount Pangæus <lb/>
            and near the Doberes, the Agrianae, Odomanti, and those who in­ <lb/>
            habit Lake Prasias itself, were not at all subdued by Megabazus. <lb/>
            Yet he attempted to conquer those who live upon the lake in <lb/>
            dwellings contrived after this manner: planks fitted on lofty <lb/>
            piles are placed in the middle of the lake, with a narrow en­ <lb/>
            trance from the main land by a single bridge. These piles <lb/>
            that support the planks all the citizens anciently placed there <lb/>
            at the common charge; but afterwards they established a law <lb/>
            to the following effect: whenever a man marries, for each <lb/>
            wife he sinks three piles, bringing wood from a mountain <lb/>
            called Orbelus but every man has several wives. They live <lb/>
            in the following manner; every man has a hut on the planks, <lb/>
            in which he dwells, with a trap-door closely fitted in the <lb/>
            planks, and leading down to the lake. They tie the young <lb/>
            children with a cord round the foot, fearing lest they should <lb/>
            fall into the lake beneath. To their horses and beasts of burden <lb/>
            they give fish for fodder; of which there is such an abund­ <lb/>
            ance, that when a man has opened his trap-door, he lets down <lb/>
            an empty basket by a cord into the lake, and, after waiting a <lb/>
            short time, draws it up full of fish They have two kinds of <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[17-19"/> <lb/>
            fish, which they call papraces and tilones. Those of the <lb/>
            Pæonians, then, who were subdued were taken to Asia.</p>
          <p>17. When Megabazus had subdued the Pæonians, he sent <lb/>
            into Macedonia seven Persians as ambassadors, who next to <lb/>
            himself were the most illustrious in the army. They were <lb/>
            sent to Amyntas to demand earth and water for king Darius. <lb/>
            From the lake Prasias the distance to Macedonia is very short. <lb/>
            For near adjoining the lake is a mine, from which in later <lb/>
            times a talent of silver came in daily to Alexander: beyond <lb/>
            the mine, when one has passed the mountain called Dysorum, <lb/>
            one is in Macedonia. 18. When therefore the Persians who <lb/>
            were sent arrived at the court of Amyntas, on going into the <lb/>
            presence of Amyntas, they demanded earth and water for king <lb/>
            Darius. He both promised to give these, and invited them to <lb/>
            partake of his hospitality; and having prepared a magnificent <lb/>
            feast, he entertained the Persians with great courtesy. But <lb/>
            after supper, the Persians, who were drinking freely, spoke as <lb/>
            follows: " Macedonian host, it is a custom with us Persians, <lb/>
            when we have given a great feast, to introduce our concubines <lb/>
            and lawful wives to sit by our side: since therefore you have <lb/>
            received us kindly, and have entertained us magnificently, and <lb/>
            promise to give earth and water to king Darius, do you follow <lb/>
            our custom." To this Amyntas answered, " 0 Persians, we <lb/>
            have no such custom, but that the men should be separated <lb/>
            from the women ; yet since you, who are our masters, require. <lb/>
            this also, this shall also be granted to you." Amyntas, hav­ <lb/>
            ing spoken thus, sent for the women; and they, when they <lb/>
            had come, being summoned, sat down in order opposite to the <lb/>
            Persians. Thereupon the Persians, seeing the women were <lb/>
            beautiful, spoke to Amyntas, saying, " that what had been <lb/>
            done was not at all wise, for that it were better that the women <lb/>
            should not have come at all, than that, when they had come, <lb/>
            they should not be placed beside them, but sit opposite to <lb/>
            them as a torment to their eyes." Upon this Amyntas, com­ <lb/>
            pelled by necessity, ordered them to sit down by the men ; <lb/>
            and when the women obeyed, the Persians, as being very full <lb/>
            of wine, began to feel their breasts; and some one even at­ <lb/>
            tempted to kiss them. 19. Amyntas, when he beheld this, <lb/>
            though very indignant, remained quiet, through excessive <lb/>
            fear of the Persians. But Alexander, son of Amyntas, who <lb/>
            was present, and witnessed this behaviour, being a young man <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="20, 21.]"/> <lb/>
            and inexperienced in misfortune, was no longer able to restrain <lb/>
            himself; so that, bearing it with difficulty, he addressed <lb/>
            Amyntas as follows: " Father, yield to your years ; and retire <lb/>
            to rest, nor persist in drinking. I will stay here, and furnish <lb/>
            the guests with all things necessary." Amyntas, perceiving <lb/>
            that Alexander was about to put some new design in execu­ <lb/>
            tion, said, " Son, I pretty well discern by your words, that <lb/>
            you are burning with rage, and that you wish to dismiss me <lb/>
            that you may attempt some new design. I charge you there­ <lb/>
            fore to plan nothing new against these men, lest you cause <lb/>
            our ruin, but endure to behold what is being done ; with re­ <lb/>
            spect to my retiring, I will comply with your wishes." 20. <lb/>
            When Amyntas, having made this request, had retired, Alex­ <lb/>
            ander said to the Persians : "Friends, these women are entirely <lb/>
            at your service ; and whether you desire to have intercourse <lb/>
            with them all, or with any of them, on this point make known <lb/>
            your own wishes: but now, as the time for retiring is fast <lb/>
            approaching, and I perceive that you have had abundance to <lb/>
            drink, let these women, if that is agreeable to you, go and <lb/>
            bathe, and when they have bathed, expect their return. <lb/>
            Having spoken thus, as the Persians approved his proposal, <lb/>
            he sent away the women, as they came out, to their own <lb/>
            apartment; and Alexander himself, having dressed a like <lb/>
            number of smoothfaced young men in the dress of the women, <lb/>
            and having furnished them with daggers, led them in; and <lb/>
            as he led them in, he addressed the Persians as follows: <lb/>
            'Persians, you appear to have been entertained with a sump­ <lb/>
            tuous feast; for we have given you not only all we had, but <lb/>
            whatever we could procure ; and, which is more than all the <lb/>
            rest, we now freely give up to you our mothers and sisters, <lb/>
            that you may perceive that you are thoroughly honoured by <lb/>
            us with whatever you deserve ; arid also that you may report <lb/>
            to the king who sent you, that a Greek, the prince of the <lb/>
            Macedonians, gave you a good reception both at table and <lb/>
            bed." Having thus spoken, Alexander placed by the side of <lb/>
            each Persian a Macedonian man, as if a woman ; but they, <lb/>
            when the Persians attempted to touch them, put them to <lb/>
            death. 21. By this death these perished, both they and their <lb/>
            attendants, for they were followed by carriages, and attend­ <lb/>
            ants, and all kinds of baggage ; but all these, with the <lb/>
            whole of the men disappeared. But after no long time, a <pb n="314"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[22—24"/> <lb/>
            great search was made by the Persians for these men ; but <lb/>
            Alexander by his prudence checked their inquiry, by giving a <lb/>
            considerable sum of money, and his own sister, whose name <lb/>
            was Gygæa, to Bubares a Persian, the chief of those sent to <lb/>
            search for those who were lost: thus the inquiry into the <lb/>
            death of these Persians being suppressed, was hushed up. <lb/>
            22. That these princes, who are sprung from Perdiccas, are <lb/>
            Greeks, as they themselves affirm, I myself happen to know ; <lb/>
            and in a future part of my history 3 I will prove that they are <lb/>
            Greeks. Moreover, the judges presiding at the games of <lb/>
            the Grecians in Olympia have determined that they are so j <lb/>
            for when Alexander wished to enter the lists, and went down <lb/>
            there for that very purpose, his Grecian competitors wished <lb/>
            to exclude him, alleging, that the games were not instituted <lb/>
            for barbarian combatants, but Grecians. But Alexander, <lb/>
            after he had proved himself to be an Argive, was pronounced <lb/>
            to be a Greek, and when he was to contend in the stadium, <lb/>
            his lot fell out with that of the first combatant. In this man­ <lb/>
            ner were these things transacted.</p>
          <p>23. Megabazus, leading with him the Pæonians, arrived at <lb/>
            the Hellespont; and having crossed over from thence, came <lb/>
            to Sardis. In the mean time, Histiæus the Milesian was <lb/>
            building a wall round the place, which, at his own request, <lb/>
            he had received from Darius as a reward for his services <lb/>
            in preserving the bridge: this place was near the river <lb/>
            Strymon, and its name was Myrcinus. But Megabazus, <lb/>
            having heard what was being done by Histiæus, as soon as he <lb/>
            reached Sardis, bringing the Pæonians with him, addressed <lb/>
            Darius as follows : "0 king, what have you done, in allowing <lb/>
            a crafty and subtle Greek to possess a city in Thrace, where <lb/>
            there is abundance of timber fit for building ships, and plenty <lb/>
            of wood for oars, and silver mines ? A great multitude of <lb/>
            Greeks and barbarians dwell around, who, when they have <lb/>
            obtained him as a leader, will do whatever he may command <lb/>
            both by day and by night. Put a stop therefore to the pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings of this man, that you may not be harassed by a do­ <lb/>
            mestic war ; but, having sent for him in a gentle manner, <lb/>
            stop him: and when you have got him in your power, take <lb/>
            care that he never returns to the Greeks." 24. Megabazus, <lb/>
            speaking thus, easily persuaded Darius, since he wisely fore- <note type="footnote">3See B. VIlI. chap. 137.</note> <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="25—27.]"/> <lb/>
            saw what was likely to happen. Thereupon, Darius, having <lb/>
            sent a messenger to Myrcinus, spoke as follows : " Histiæus, <lb/>
            king Darius says thus: I find on consideration that there is <lb/>
            no man 'better affected to me and my affairs than thyself; and <lb/>
            this I have learnt, not by words, but actions ; now therefore, <lb/>
            since I have great designs to put in execution, come to me by <lb/>
            all means, that I may communicate them to thee." Histiæus, <lb/>
            giving" credit to these words, and at the same time considering <lb/>
            it a great honour to become a counsellor of the king, went to <lb/>
            Sardis: when he arrived, Darius addressed him as follows: <lb/>
            " Histiæus, I have sent for you on this occasion. As soon as <lb/>
            I returned from Scythia, and you were out of my sight, I <lb/>
            have wished for nothing so much as to see you and converse <lb/>
            with you again ; being persuaded that a friend who is both <lb/>
            intelligent and well affected, is the most valuable of all pos­ <lb/>
            sessions ; both -of which T am able to testify from my own <lb/>
            knowledge concur in you, as regards my affairs. Now then, <lb/>
            for you have done well in coming, I make you this offer. <lb/>
            Think no more of Miletus, nor of the new-founded city in <lb/>
            Thrace; but follow me to Susa, have the same that I have, <lb/>
            and be the partner of my table and counsels." 25. Darius <lb/>
            having spoken thus, and having appointed Artaphernes, his <lb/>
            brother by the same father, to be governor of Sardis, departed <lb/>
            for Suse, taking Histiæus with him; and having nominated <lb/>
            Otanes to be general of the forces on the coast, whose father <lb/>
            Sisamnes, one of the royal judges, king Cambyses had put to <lb/>
            death and flayed,4 because he had given an unjust judgment <lb/>
            for a sum of money. And having had his skin torn off, he <lb/>
            had it cut into thongs, and extended it on the bench on <lb/>
            which he used to sit when he pronounced judgment: and <lb/>
            Cambyses, having so extended it, appointed as judge in the <lb/>
            room of Sisamnes, whom he had slain and flayed, the son of <lb/>
            Sisamnes, admonishing him to remember on what seat he sat <lb/>
            to administer justice. 26. This Otanes, then, who had been <lb/>
            placed on this seat, being now appointed successor to Megabazus <lb/>
            in the command of the army, subdued the Byzantians and <lb/>
            Chalcedonians, and took Antandros, which belongs to the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Troas, and Lamponium; and having obtained ships <lb/>
            from the Lesbians, he took Lemnos and Imbrus, both of <lb/>
            which were then inhabited by Pelasgians. 27. (Now the <lb/>
            Lemnians fought valiantly, and having defended themselves <note type="footnote"> 4 Literally " he cut off all his human akin." </note> <pb n="316"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[28-30 "/>for some time, were at length overcome; and over those who <lb/>
            survived, the Persians set up Lycaretus as governor, the brother <lb/>
            of Mæandrius who had reigned in Samos. This Lycaretus died <lb/>
            while governor of Lemnos.) Otanes enslaved and subdued <lb/>
            them all; his reasons for doing so were as follows : some he <lb/>
            charged of desertion to the Scythians ; others, of having <lb/>
            harassed Darius's army in their return home from the Scy­ <lb/>
            thians. Such was his conduct while general of the forces.</p>
          <p>28. Afterwards,for the intermission from misfortune was not <lb/>
            of long duration, evils arose a second time to the Ionians from <lb/>
            Naxos and Miletus. For, on the one hand, Naxos surpassed all <lb/>
            the islands in opulence ; and on the other hand, Miletus at the <lb/>
            same time had attained the summit of its prosperity, and was <lb/>
            accounted the ornament of Ionia; though before this period, <lb/>
            it had for two generations suffered excessively from seditions, <lb/>
            until the Parians reconciled them; for the Milesians had chosen <lb/>
            them out of all the Greeks to settle their differences. 29. The <lb/>
            Parians reconciled them in the following manner. When <lb/>
            their most eminent men arrived at Miletus, as they saw their <lb/>
            private affairs in a dreadful state, they said that they wished <lb/>
            to go through their whole country; and, in doing this and <lb/>
            going through all Milesia, wheresoever they saw in the de­ <lb/>
            vastated country any land well cultivated, they wrote down the <lb/>
            name of the proprietor. And having traversed the whole <lb/>
            country and found but few such, as soon as they came down <lb/>
            to the city, they called an assembly, and appointed to govern <lb/>
            the city those persons whose lands they had found well culti­ <lb/>
            vated ; for they said they thought they would administer the <lb/>
            public affairs as well as they had done their own. The rest <lb/>
            of the Milesians, who before had been split into factions, they <lb/>
            ordered to obey them. Thus the Parians reconciled the Mile­ <lb/>
            sians. 30. From these two cities at that time misfortunes <lb/>
            began to befal Ionia in the following manner. Some of the <lb/>
            opulent men were exiled from Naxos by the people, and being <lb/>
            exiled, went to Miletus : the governor of Miletus happened to <lb/>
            be Aristagoras, son of Molpagoras, son-in-law and cousin of <lb/>
            Histiæus, son of Lysagoras, whom Darius detained at Susa. <lb/>
            For Histiæus was tyrant of Miletus, and happened to be at <lb/>
            that time at Susa, when the Naxians came, who were before <lb/>
            on terms of friendship with Histiæus. The Naxians then, <lb/>
            having arrived at Miletus, entreated Aristagoras if he could <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="31, 32.]"/> <lb/>
            by any means give them some assistance, that so they might <lb/>
            return to their own country. But he, having considered that <lb/>
            if by his means they should return to their city, he would get <lb/>
            the dominion of Naxos, used the friendship of Histiæus as a <lb/>
            pretence, and addressed the following discourse to them : " I <lb/>
            am not able of myself to furnish you with a force sufficient to <lb/>
            reinstate you against the wishes of the Naxians who are in <lb/>
            possession of the city, for I hear that the Naxians have eight <lb/>
            thousand heavy armed men, and a considerable number of <lb/>
            ships of war. Yet I will contrive some way, and use my <lb/>
            best endeavours ; and I design it in this way : Artaphernes <lb/>
            happens to he my friend ; he is son of Hystaspes and brother <lb/>
            of king Darius, and commands all the maritime parts of Asia, <lb/>
            and has a large army and many ships. This man, I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded, will do whatever we desire." The Naxians, having <lb/>
            heard this, urged Aristagoras to bring it about in the best way <lb/>
            he could, and bade him promise presents, and their expenses <lb/>
            to the army, for that they would repay it, having great ex­ <lb/>
            pectation that when they should appear at Naxos the Naxians <lb/>
            would do whatever they should order, as also would the other <lb/>
            islanders ; for of these Cyclades islands not one was as yet <lb/>
            subject to Darius.</p>
          <p>31. Accordingly Aristagoras, having gone to Sardis, told <lb/>
            Artaphernes, that Naxos was an island of no great extent, <lb/>
            but otherwise beautiful and fertile, and near Ionia, and in it <lb/>
            was much wealth and many slaves. " Do you therefore send <lb/>
            an army against this country, to reinstate those who have <lb/>
            been banished from thence; and if you do this, I have, in the <lb/>
            first place, a large sum of money ready, in addition to the ex­ <lb/>
            penses of the expedition, for it is just that we who lead you on <lb/>
            should supply that; and in the next, you will acquire for the <lb/>
            king Naxos itself, and the islands dependent upon it, Pares, <lb/>
            Andros, and the rest that are called Cyclades. Setting out from <lb/>
            thence, you will easily attack Eubœa, a large and wealthy island, <lb/>
            not less than Cyprus, and very easy to betaken. A hundred <lb/>
            ships are sufficient to subdue them all." He answered him as <lb/>
            follows: " You propose things advantageous to the king's <lb/>
            house, and advise every thing well, except the number of <lb/>
            ships; instead of one hundred, two hundred shall be ready at <lb/>
            the commencement of the spring. But it is necessary that the <lb/>
            king himself should approve of the design." 32. Now Aria- <pb n="318"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[33.34 "/>tagoras, when he heard this, being exceedingly rejoiced, went <lb/>
            back to Miletus. But Artaphernes, when, on his sending to <lb/>
            Susa and communicating what was said by Aristagoras, Darius <lb/>
            himself also approved the plan, made ready two hundred <lb/>
            triremes, and a very numerous body of Persians and other <lb/>
            allies : and lie appointed Megabates general, a Persian of the <lb/>
            family of the Achemenidæ, his own and Darius's nephew, <lb/>
            whose daughter, if the report be true, was afterwards be­ <lb/>
            trothed to Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus the Lacedaemonian, <lb/>
            who aspired to become tyrant of Greece. Artaphernes, hav­ <lb/>
            in- appointed Megabates general, sent forward the army to <lb/>
            Aristagoras.</p>
          <p>33. Megabates, having taken with him from Miletus, Axis­ <lb/>
            tagoras, and the Ionian forces and the Naxians, sailed pro­ <lb/>
            fessedly for the Hellespont; but when he arrived at Chios, <lb/>
            anchored at Caucasa, that he might cross over from thence to <lb/>
            Naxos by a north wind. However, since it was fated that the <lb/>
            Naxians were not to perish by this armament, the following <lb/>
            event occurred. As Megabates was going round the watches <lb/>
            on board the ships, he found no one on guard on board a <lb/>
            Myndian ship ; thereupon, being indignant at this, he ordered <lb/>
            his body-guards to find the captain of this ship, whose name <lb/>
            was Scylax, and to bind him, having passed him half-way <lb/>
            through the lower rowlock of the vessel, so that his head should <lb/>
            be on the outside of the vessel, and his body within. When <lb/>
            Scylax was bound, some one told Aristagoras that Megabates <lb/>
            had bound and disgraced his Myndian friend. He went <lb/>
            therefore and interceded for him with the Persian, but when <lb/>
            he found he could obtain nothing, he went and released him. <lb/>
            Megabates, hearing of this, was very indignant, and enraged <lb/>
            with Aristagoras : but he said, " What have you to do with <lb/>
            these matters ? Did not Artaphernes send you to obey me, <lb/>
            and to sail wheresoever I should command ? Why do you busy <lb/>
            yourself?" Aristagoras spoke thus. But Megabates, ex­ <lb/>
            asperated at this, as soon as night arrived, despatched men in <lb/>
            a ship to Naxos, to inform the Naxians of the impending <lb/>
            danger. 34. Now the Naxians did not at all expect that this <lb/>
            armament was coming against them ; when therefore they <lb/>
            heard of it, they immediately carried every thing from the <lb/>
            fields into the town, and prepared to undergo a siege, and <lb/>
            brought food and drink within the walls. Thus they made <lb/>
            J <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="35, 36.]"/> <lb/>
            preparations, as if war was close at hand ; but the Persians, <lb/>
            when they crossed over from Chios to Naxos, had to attack <lb/>
            men well fortified, and besieged them during four months. <lb/>
            So that having consumed all the supplies they had brought <lb/>
            with them, together with large sums furnished by Aristagoras, <lb/>
            and wanting still more to carry on the siege, they therefore <lb/>
            built a fortress for the Naxian exiles, and.retired to the con­ <lb/>
            tinent, having been unsuccessful.</p>
          <p>35. Aristagoras was unable to fulfil his promise to Arta­ <lb/>
            phernes ; and at the same time the expense of the expedition, <lb/>
            which was demanded, pressed heavy. on him ; he was alarmed <lb/>
            too on account of the ill success of the army, and at having <lb/>
            incurred the ill will of Megabates, and thought that he should <lb/>
            be deprived of the government of Miletus ; dreading there­ <lb/>
            fore each of these things, he meditated a revolt: for it <lb/>
            happened at the same time that a messenger with his head <lb/>
            punctured came from Susa from Histiæus, urging Aristagoras <lb/>
            to revolt from the king. For Histiæus, being desirous to sig­ <lb/>
            nify to Aristagoras his wish for him to revolt, had no other <lb/>
            means of signifying it with safety, because the roads were <lb/>
            guarded; therefore, having shaved the head of the most <lb/>
            trustworthy of his slaves, he marked it, and waited till <lb/>
            the hair was grown again : as soon as it was grown again, <lb/>
            he sent him to Miletus without any other instructions, <lb/>
            than that when he arrived at Miletus he should desire Arista­ <lb/>
            goras to shave off his hair and look upon his head : the punc­ <lb/>
            tures, .as I said before, signified a wish'for him to revolt. <lb/>
            Histiæus did this because he looked upon his detention at Susa <lb/>
            as a great misfortune; if then a revolt should take place he <lb/>
            had great hopes that he should be sent down to the coast; <lb/>
            but if Miletus made no new attempt, he thought that he shoul <lb/>
            never go there again. 36. Histiæus accordingly under these <lb/>
            considerations sent off the messenger. All, these things concur­ <lb/>
            red together at the same time to Aristagoras ; he therefore con­ <lb/>
            sulted with his partisans, communicating to them his own <lb/>
            opinion and the message that had come from Histiæus: now <lb/>
            all the rest concurred in the same opinion, urging him to re­ <lb/>
            volt; but Hecatæus, the historian, at first endeavoured to dis­ <lb/>
            suade him"from undertaking a war against the king of the <lb/>
            Persians, enumerating all the nations whom Darius governed, <lb/>
            and his power ; but when he could not prevail, he in the next <pb n="320"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[37—39"/> <lb/>
            place advised, that they should so contrive as to make them­ <lb/>
            selves masters of the sea. " Now," he continued, " he saw no <lb/>
            other way of effecting this, for he was well aware that the <lb/>
            power of the Milesians was weak ; but if the treasures should <lb/>
            be seized from the temple of the Branchidæ, which Crœsus the <lb/>
            Lydian had dedicated, he had great hopes that they might ac­ <lb/>
            quire the dominion of the sea ; and thus they would have <lb/>
            money for their own use, and the enemy could not plunder <lb/>
            that treasure." But this treasure was very considerable, as I <lb/>
            have already related in the first part of my history.5 This <lb/>
            opinion however did not prevail. " Nevertheless it was re­ <lb/>
            solved to revolt, and that one of them, having sailed to Myus <lb/>
            to the force that had returned from Naxos, and which was <lb/>
            then there, should endeavour to seize the captains on board <lb/>
            the ships. 37. Iatragoras, having been despatched for this <lb/>
            very purpose, and having, by stratagem, seized Oliatus, son of <lb/>
            IIbanolis of Mylassa, Histiæus, son of Tymnes of Termera, Goes, <lb/>
            son of Erxandrus, to whom Darius had given Mitylene, Arista­ <lb/>
            goras, son of Heraclides, of Cyme, and many others ; Aristago­ <lb/>
            ras thus openly revolted, devising every thing he could against <lb/>
            Darius. And first, in pretence, having laid aside the sovereign­ <lb/>
            ty, he established an equality in Miletus, in order that the <lb/>
            Milesians might more readily join with him in the revolt. <lb/>
            And afterwards he effected the same throughout the rest of <lb/>
            Ionia, expelling some of the tyrants ; and he delivered up those <lb/>
            whom he had taken from on board the ships that had sailed <lb/>
            with him against Naxos, to the cities, in order to gratify the <lb/>
            people, giving them up generally to the respective cities, from <lb/>
            whence each came. 38. The Mityleneans, as soon as they re­ <lb/>
            ceived Goes, led him out, and stoned him to death; but the <lb/>
            Cymeans let their tyrant go ; and in like manner most of the <lb/>
            others let theirs go. Accordingly there was a suppression of <lb/>
            tyrants throughout the cities. But Aristagoras the Milesian, <lb/>
            when he had suppressed the tyrants, and enjoined them all to <lb/>
            appoint magistrates in each of the cities, in the next place <lb/>
            went himself in a trireme as ambassador to Sparta, for it was <lb/>
            necessary for him to procure some powerful alliance.</p>
          <p>39. Anaxandrides, son of Leon, no longer survived and <lb/>
            reigned over Sparta, but was already dead; Cleomenes, SOIl <lb/>
            of Anaxandrides, held the sovereignty, not having acquired it <note type="footnote"> 5 See B. I. chap. 50, 51, 92. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            by his virtues, but by his birth. Anaxandrides, who had <lb/>
            married his own sister's daughter, though she was very much <lb/>
            beloved by him, had no children: this being the case, the <lb/>
            Ephori, having sent for him, said, " If you do not provide for <lb/>
            your own interests, yet we must not overlook this, that the <lb/>
            race of Eurysthenes should become extinct. Do you there­ <lb/>
            fore put away the wife whom you have, since she bears no <lb/>
            children, and marry another; and by so doing you will gratify <lb/>
            the Spartans." He answered, saying, "that he would do <lb/>
            neither of these things; and that they did not advise him well <lb/>
            in urging him to dismiss .the wife he had, when she had com­ <lb/>
            mitted no error, and to take another in her place, and there­ <lb/>
            fore he would not obey them." 40. Upon this the Ephori <lb/>
            and senators, having consulted, made the following proposal to <lb/>
            Anaxandrides: " As we see you strongly attached to the wife <lb/>
            whom you have, act as follows, and do not oppose it, lest the <lb/>
            Spartans should come to some unusual resolution respecting <lb/>
            you. We do not require of you the dismissal of your present <lb/>
            wife; pay her the same attention as you have always done <lb/>
            and marry another besides her, who may bear you children." <lb/>
            When they spoke to this effect, Anaxandrides consented; and <lb/>
            afterwards having two wives he inhabited two houses, doing <lb/>
            what was not at all in accordance with Spartan usages. 41. <lb/>
            When no long time had elapsed, the wife last married bore <lb/>
            this Cleomenes, and presented to the Spartans an heir ap­ <lb/>
            parent to the throne: and the former wife, who had before <lb/>
            been barren, by some strange fortune then proved to be with <lb/>
            child; and though she was really so, yet the relations of the <lb/>
            second wife having heard of it raised a disturbance, saying <lb/>
            that she boasted vainly, purposing to bring forward a sup­ <lb/>
            positious child. As they made a great noise, when the time <lb/>
            approached, the Ephori from distrust sat around, and watched <lb/>
            the woman in her labour. She, however, when she had borne <lb/>
            Dorieus, shortly afterwards had Leonidas, and after him, in <lb/>
            due course, Cleombrotus; though some say that Cleombrotus <lb/>
            and Leonidas were twins. But she who bore Cleomenes, and <lb/>
            who was the second wife, and daughter to Prinetades, son of <lb/>
            Demarmenus, never bore a second time.</p>
          <p>42. Cleomenes, as it is said, was not of sound mind, but <lb/>
            almost mad; whereas, Dorieus was the first of the young men <lb/>
            of his age, and was fully convinced that by his virtues he <note type="footnote">Y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[43-45."/> <lb/>
            should obtain the sovereignty. So that, being of this persuasion, <lb/>
            when Anaxandrides died, and the Lacedæmonians. following the <lb/>
            usual custom, appointed the eldest, Cleomenes, to be king, Do­ <lb/>
            ricus, being very indignant, and disdaining to be reigned over <lb/>
            by Cleomenes, demanded a draught of men from the Spartans, <lb/>
            and led them out to found a colony, without having consulted <lb/>
            the oracle at Delphi to what land he should go and settle, nor <lb/>
            doing any of those things that are usual on such occasions. <lb/>
            But as he was very much grieved, he directed his ships to <lb/>
            Libya, and some Theraeans piloted him. Having arrived at <lb/>
            Cinyps, he-settled near the river, in the most beautiful spot of <lb/>
            the Libyans. But in the third year, being driven out from <lb/>
            thence by the Macæ, Libyans, and Carthaginians, he returned <lb/>
            to Peloponnesus. 43. There Antichares, a citizen of Elcon, <lb/>
            from the oracles delivered to Laius, advised him to found <lb/>
            Heraclea in Sicily, affirming that all the country of Eryx be­ <lb/>
            longed to the Heraclidæ, Hercules himself having possessed <lb/>
            himself of it. He, hearing this, went to Delphi to inquire of <lb/>
            the oracle, whether he should take the country to which he <lb/>
            was preparing to go. The Pythian answered, that he should <lb/>
            take it. Dorieus, therefore, taking with him the force which <lb/>
            he had led to Libya, sailed along the coast of Italy. 44. At <lb/>
            that time, as the Sybarites say, they and their king Telys were <lb/>
            preparing to make war against Crotona: and the Crotonians, <lb/>
            being much alarmed, implored of Dorieus to assist them, and <lb/>
            obtained their request; whereupon Dorieus marched with <lb/>
            them against Sybaris, and took Sybaris in concert with them. <lb/>
            Now, the Sybarites say that Dorieus, and those who were <lb/>
            with him, did this. But the Crotonians affirm that no foreigner <lb/>
            took part with them in the war against the Sybarites, ex­ <lb/>
            cept only Callias of Elis, a seer of the Iamidæ, and he did so <lb/>
            under the following circumstances: he had fled from Telys, <lb/>
            king of the Sybarites, and come over to them, when the vic­ <lb/>
            tims did not prove favourable as he was sacrificing against <lb/>
            Crotona. Such is the account they give. 45. Each party <lb/>
            produces the following proofs of what they assert. The <lb/>
            Sybarites allege a sacred enclosure and temple near the dry <lb/>
            Crastis,6 which they say Dorieus, when he had assisted in <lb/>
            taking the city, erected to Minerva, surnamed Crastian; and <lb/>
            in the next place they mention the death of Dorieus, as the <note type="footnote"> 6 Called " dry " because its stroam was dried up in summer. </note> <pb n="323"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="46-48.]"/> <lb/>
            greatest proof, for that he was killed for having acted contrary <lb/>
            to the warnings of the oracle. For if he had not at all trans <lb/>
            grossed, but had done that for which he was sent, he would <lb/>
            have taken and possessed the Erycinian country, and having <lb/>
            taken it would have retained it, nor would he and his army <lb/>
            have been destroyed. On the other hand, the Crotonians show <lb/>
            selected portions of land given to Callias the Elean, in the ter­ <lb/>
            ritories of Crotona, which the descendants of Callias continued <lb/>
            to occupy even in my time; but to Dorieus, and the posterity <lb/>
            of Dorieus, nothing was given: whereas, if Dorieus had assisted <lb/>
            them in the Sybaritic war, much more would have been given to <lb/>
            him than to Callias. These, then, are the proofs that each pro­ <lb/>
            duces, and every man has the liberty of adhering to that which <lb/>
            he judges most probable. 46. There sailed with Dorieus also <lb/>
            other Spartans, joint-founders of a colony, as Thessalus, Paræ­ <lb/>
            bates, Celeas, and Euryleon; who, on their arrival with the <lb/>
            whole armament in Sicily, were killed, being defeated in battle <lb/>
            by the Phœnicians and Egestæans. Euryleon alone of the <lb/>
            associates in founding the colony survived this disaster: he, <lb/>
            having collected the survivors of the army, possessed himself <lb/>
            of Minoa, a colony of the Selinuntians, and assisted in liber­ <lb/>
            ating the Selinuntians from their monarch Pythagoras. But <lb/>
            afterwards, when he had removed him, he himself seized the <lb/>
            tyranny of Selinus, and continued monarch for a short time; <lb/>
            for the Selinuntians, having risen up against him, put him to <lb/>
            death, though he had taken sanctuary at the altar of the <lb/>
            Forensian Jupiter. 47. Philippus, son of Butacides, a citizen <lb/>
            of Crotona, accompanied Dorieus, and perished with him. He <lb/>
            having entered into a contract of marriage with the daughter <lb/>
            of Telys the Sybarite, fled from Crotona, but disappointed of <lb/>
            his marriage, sailed to Cyrene; and setting out from thence, <lb/>
            he accompanied Dorieus in a trireme of his own, with a crew <lb/>
            maintained at his own expense ; for he had been victorious in <lb/>
            the Olympian games, and was the handsomest of the Greeks <lb/>
            of his day; and on account of his beauty he obtained from the <lb/>
            Egestæans what no other person ever did, for having erected <lb/>
            a shrine on his sepulchre, they propitiate him with sacrifices. <lb/>
            48. Dorieus, then, met with his death in the manner above <lb/>
            described; but if he had submitted to be governed by Cle­ <lb/>
            omenes, and had continued in Sparta, he would have become <lb/>
            king of Lacedæmen For Cleomenes did not reign for any <note type="footnote"> y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[49"/> <lb/>
            length of time, but died without a son, leaving a daughter <lb/>
            only, whose name was Gorge.</p>
          <p>49. Aristagoras then, tyrant of Miletus, arrived at Sparta, <lb/>
            when Cleomenes held the government; and he went to confer <lb/>
            with him, as the Lacedæmonians say, having a brazen tablet, <lb/>
            on which was engraved the circumference of the whole earth, <lb/>
            and the whole sea, and all rivers. And Aristagoras, having <lb/>
            come to a conference, addressed him as follows: " Wonder <lb/>
            not, Cleomenes, at my eagerness in coming here, for the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances that urge are such as I will describe. That the <lb/>
            children of Ionians should be slaves instead of free, is a great <lb/>
            disgrace and sorrow to us, and above all others to you, inas­ <lb/>
            much as you are at the head of Greece. Now, therefore, I <lb/>
            adjure you, by the Grecian gods, rescue the Ionians, who are <lb/>
            of your own blood, from servitude. It is easy for you to effect <lb/>
            this, for the barbarians are not valiant; whereas you, in mat­ <lb/>
            ters relating to war, have attained to the utmost height of <lb/>
            glory: their mode of fighting is this, with bows and a short <lb/>
            spear; and they engage in battle, wearing loose trowsers, and <lb/>
            turbans on their heads, so they are easy to be overcome. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, there are treasures belonging to those who inhabit that <lb/>
            continent, such as are not possessed by all other nations toge­ <lb/>
            ther ; beginning from gold, there is silver, brass, variegated <lb/>
            garments, beasts of burden, and slaves; all these you may have <lb/>
            if you will. They live adjoining one another, as I will show <lb/>
            you. Next these Ionians are the Lydians, who inhabit a <lb/>
            fertile country, and abound in silver." As he said this he <lb/>
            showed the circumference of the earth, which he brought <lb/>
            with him, engraved on a tablet. " Next the Lydians," pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded Aristagoras, "are these Phrygians to the eastward, <lb/>
            who are the richest in cattle and in corn of all with whom I <lb/>
            am acquainted. Next to the Phrygians are the Cappadocians, <lb/>
            whom we call Syrians; and bordering on them, the Cilicians, <lb/>
            extending to this sea in which the island of Cyprus is situate; <lb/>
            they pay an annual tribute of five hundred talents to the king. <lb/>
            Next to the Cilicians are these Armenians, who also abound <lb/>
            in cattle; and next the Armenians are the Matienians, who <lb/>
            occupy this country; and next them this territory of Cissia, <lb/>
            in which Susa is situated on this river Choaspes, here the <lb/>
            great king resides, and there are his treasures of wealth. It <lb/>
            you take this city, you may boldly contend with Jupiter in <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="50-52.]"/> <lb/>
            wealth. But now you must carry on war for a country of <lb/>
            small extent, and not very fertile, and of narrow limits, with <lb/>
            the Messenians, who are your equals in valour, and with the Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians and Argives, who have nothing akin to gold or silver, <lb/>
            the desire of which induces men to hazard their lives in battle. <lb/>
            But when an opportunity is offered to conquer all Asia with <lb/>
            ease, will you prefer any thing else?" Aristagoras spoke <lb/>
            thus, and Cleomenes answered him as follows : " Milesian <lb/>
            friend, I defer to give you an answer until the third day." <lb/>
            50. On that day they got so far. When the day appointed <lb/>
            for the answer was come, and they had met at the appointed <lb/>
            place, Cleomenes asked Aristagoras, how many days' journey <lb/>
            it was from the sea of the Ionians to the king. But Aris­ <lb/>
            tagoras, though he was cunning in other things, and had de­ <lb/>
            ceived him with much address, made a slip in this; for he <lb/>
            should not have told the real fact, if he wished to draw <lb/>
            the Spartans into Asia ; whereas he told him plainly, that it <lb/>
            was a three months'journey up there. But he, cutting short <lb/>
            the rest of the description which Aristagoras was proceeding <lb/>
            to give of the journey, said : " Milesian friend, depart from <lb/>
            Sparta before sun-set; for you speak no agreeable language <lb/>
            to the Lacedæmonians, in wishing to lead them a three months' <lb/>
            journey from the sea." Cleomenes, having spoken thus, went <lb/>
            home. 51. But Aristagoras, taking an olive-branch in his <lb/>
            hand, went to the house of Cleomenes, and having entered in, <lb/>
            as a suppliant, besought Cleomenes to listen to him, having <lb/>
            first sent away his little child ; for his daughter, whose name <lb/>
            was Gorge, stood by him ; she happened to be his only child, <lb/>
            and was about eight or nine years of age. But Cleomenes <lb/>
            bid him say what he would, and not refrain for the sake of the <lb/>
            child. Thereupon Aristagoras began promising ten talents, <lb/>
            if he would do as he desired ; and when Cleomenes refused, <lb/>
            Aristagoras went on increasing in his offers, until he promised <lb/>
            fifty talents ; then the girl cried out, " Father, this stranger <lb/>
            will corrupt you, unless you quickly depart." Cleomenes, <lb/>
            pleased with the advice of the child, retired to another apart­ <lb/>
            ment ; and Aristagoras left Sparta altogether, nor could he <lb/>
            get an opportunity to give further particulars of the route to <lb/>
            the king's residence.</p>
          <p>52. With respect to this road, the case is as follows. There <lb/>
            re royal stations all along, and excellent inns, and the whole <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="63, 54"/> <lb/>
            road is through an inhabited and safe country. There are. <lb/>
            twenty stations extending through Lydia and Phrygia, and <lb/>
            the distance is ninety-four parasangs and a half. After <lb/>
            Phrygia, the river Halys is met with, at which there are <lb/>
            gates, which it is absolutely necessary to pass through, and <lb/>
            thus to cross the river: there is also a considerable fort on <lb/>
            it. When you cross over into Cappadocia, and traverse that <lb/>
            country, to the borders of Cilicia, there are eight and twenty <lb/>
            stations, and one hundred and four parasangs ; and on the <lb/>
            borders of these people, you go through two gates, and pass <lb/>
            by two forts. When you have gone through these and made <lb/>
            the journey through Cilicia, there are three stations, and fif­ <lb/>
            teen parasangs and a half. The boundary of Cilicia and <lb/>
            Armenia is a river that is crossed in boats, it is called the <lb/>
            Euphrates. In Armenia there are fifteen stations for resting- <lb/>
            places, and fifty-six parasangs and a half; there is also a fort <lb/>
            in the stations. Four rivers that are crossed in boats flow <lb/>
            through this country, which it is absolutely necessary to ferry <lb/>
            over. First, the Tigris ; then, the second and third have the <lb/>
            same name, though they are not the same river, nor flow <lb/>
            from the same source. For the first mentioned of these flows <lb/>
            from the Armenians, and the latter from the Matienians. The <lb/>
            fourth river is called the Gyndes, which Cyrus once distributed <lb/>
            into three hundred and sixty channels. As you enter from <lb/>
            Armenia into the country of Matiene, there are four stations ; <lb/>
            and from thence as you proceed to the Cissian territory there <lb/>
            are eleven stations, and forty-two parasangs and a half, to the <lb/>
            river Choaspes, which also must be crossed in boats : on this <lb/>
            Susa is built. All these stations amount to one hundred and <lb/>
            eleven :7 accordingly the resting-places at the stations are so <lb/>
            many as you go up from Sardis to Susa. 53. Now if the royal <lb/>
            road has been correctly measured in parasangs, and if the <lb/>
            parasang is equal to thirty stades, as indeed it is, from Sardis <lb/>
            to the royal palace, called Memnonia, is a distance of thirteen <lb/>
            thousand five hundred stades, the parasangs being four hun­ <lb/>
            dred and fifty; and by those who travel one hundred and <lb/>
            fifty stades every day, just ninety days are spent on the jour­ <lb/>
            ney. 54. Thus Aristagoras the Milesian spoke correctly, <note type="footnote"> 7 The detail of stations above-mentioned gives only eighty-one instead <lb/>
            of one hundred and eleven. The discrepancy can only be accounted foi <lb/>
            by a supposed defect in the manuscripts. </note> <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="55-58.]"/> <lb/>
            when lie told Cleomenes the Lacedæmonian, that it was a three <lb/>
            months' journey up to the king's residence.. But if any one <lb/>
            should require a more accurate account than this, I will also <lb/>
            point this out to him ; for it is necessary to reckon with the <lb/>
            above the journey from Ephesus to Sardis: I therefore say <lb/>
            that the whole number of stades from the Grecian see to <lb/>
            Susa, (for such is the name of the Memnonian city,) amounts <lb/>
            to fourteen thousand and forty ; for from Ephesus to Sardis <lb/>
            is a distance of five hundred and forty stades. And thus the <lb/>
            three months'journey is lengthened by three days.</p>
          <p>55. Aristagoras, being driven from Sparta, went to Athens, <lb/>
            which had been delivered from tyrants in the following man­ <lb/>
            ner. When Aristogiton and Harmodius, who were originally <lb/>
            Gephyræans by extraction, had slain Hipparchus, son of Pi­ <lb/>
            sistratus, and brother to the tyrant Hippias, and who had <lb/>
            seen a vision in a dream manifestly showing his own fate, <lb/>
            after this the Athenians during the space of four years were <lb/>
            no less, but even more, oppressed by tyranny than before. <lb/>
            56. Now the vision in Hipparchus's dream was as follows <lb/>
            On the night preceding the Panathenaic festival, Hipparchus <lb/>
            fancied that a tall and handsome man stood by him, and ut­ <lb/>
            tered these enigmatical words : "Lion, endure with enduring <lb/>
            mind to bear unendurable ills ; no one among unjust men shall <lb/>
            escape retribution." As soon as it was day he laid these <lb/>
            things before the interpreters of dreams ; and afterwards, hav­ <lb/>
            ing attempted to avert the vision, he conducted the procession <lb/>
            in which he perished.</p>
          <p>57. The Gephyræans, of whom were the murderers of <lb/>
            Hipparchus, were, as they themselves say, originally sprung <lb/>
            from Eretria ; but, as I find by diligent inquiry, they were <lb/>
            Phœnicians, of the number of those Phœnicians who came <lb/>
            with Cadmus to the country now called Bœotia, and they in­ <lb/>
            habited the district of Tanagra, in this country, which fell to <lb/>
            their share. The Cadmeans having been first expelled from <lb/>
            thence by the Argives, these Gephyræans being afterwards <lb/>
            expelled by the Bœotians, betook themselves to Athens ; and <lb/>
            the Athenians admitted them into the number of their citi­ <lb/>
            zens, on certain conditions, enacting that they should be ex­ <lb/>
            eluded from several privileges, not worth mentioning.. 58. <lb/>
            These Phœnicians who came with Cadmus, and of whom the <lb/>
            Gephyræans were, when they settled in this country, intro- <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[59—62."/> <lb/>
            duced among the Greeks many other kinds of useful know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and more particularly letters ; which, in my opinion, <lb/>
            were not before known to the Grecians. At first they used <lb/>
            the characters which all the Phœnicians make use of ; but af­ <lb/>
            terwards, in process of time, together with the sound, they <lb/>
            also changed the shape of the letters. At that time Ionian <lb/>
            Greeks inhabited the greatest part of the country round about <lb/>
            them ; they having learnt these letters from the Phœnicians, <lb/>
            changed them in a slight degree, and made use of them ; and <lb/>
            in making use of them, they designated them Phoenician, as <lb/>
            justice required they should be called, since the Phoenicians <lb/>
            had introduced them into Greece. Moreover, the lonians, <lb/>
            from ancient time, call books made of papyrus, parchments, <lb/>
            because formerly, from the scarcity of papyrus, they used <lb/>
            the skins of goats and sheep ; and even at the present day <lb/>
            many of the barbarians write on such skins. 59. And I my­ <lb/>
            self have seen in the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Thebes in <lb/>
            Bceotia, Cadmean letters engraved on certain tripods, for the <lb/>
            most part resembling the Ionian. One of the tripods has <lb/>
            this inscription: "Amphitryon dedicated me on his return <lb/>
            from the Teleboans." These must be about the age of Laius, <lb/>
            son of Labdacus, son of Polydorus, son of Cadmus. 60. <lb/>
            Another tripod has these words in hexameter verse : " Scæus, <lb/>
            a boxer, having been victorious, dedicated me, a very beauti­ <lb/>
            ful offering, to thee, far-darting Apollo." Scæus must have <lb/>
            been son of Hippocoon, if indeed it was he who made the <lb/>
            offering, and not another person bearing the same name as <lb/>
            the son of Hippocoon ; and must have been about the time of <lb/>
            CEdipus, son of Laius. 61. A third tripod has these words <lb/>
            also in hexameters : "Laodamas, being a monarch, dedicated <lb/>
            this tripod, a very beautiful offering, to thee, far-seeing 8 <lb/>
            Apollo." During the reign of this Laodamas, son of Eteocles, <lb/>
            the Cadmeans were expelled by the Arrives, and betook <lb/>
            themselves to the Encheleæ. But the Gephyræans, who <lb/>
            were then left, were afterwards compelled by the Bœotians to <lb/>
            retire to Attica ; and they built temples in Athens, in which <lb/>
            the rest of the Athenians do not participate, but they are dis­ <lb/>
            tinct from the other temples ; more particularly the temple <lb/>
            and mysteries of the Achæan Ceres.</p>
          <p>62. Thus I have related the vision of Hipparchus's dream, <note type="footnote">6Or " well-aiming It </note> <pb n="329"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="63.] "/>and whence were sprung the Gephyræans, of whom were <lb/>
            the murderers of Hipparchus ; and it is now proper to re­ <lb/>
            sume the account I originally set out to relate, and show how <lb/>
            the Athenians were delivered from tyrants. While Hippias <lb/>
            was tyrant, and embittered against the Athenians on account <lb/>
            of the death of Hipparchus, the Alcmæonidæ, who were Athe­ <lb/>
            nians by extraction, and were then banished by the Pisistra­ <lb/>
            tidæ, when they with other Athenian exiles did not succeed <lb/>
            in their attempt to effect their return by force, but were sig­ <lb/>
            nally defeated in their endeavours to reinstate themselves and <lb/>
            liberate Athens, having fortified Lipsydrium, which is above <lb/>
            Pæonia;—thereupon the Alcmæonidæ, practising every scheme <lb/>
            against the Pisistratidæ, contracted with the Amphictyons, to <lb/>
            build the temple which is now at Delphi, but then did not <lb/>
            exist ; and as they were wealthy, and originally men of dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, they constructed the temple in a more beautiful man­ <lb/>
            ner than the plan required, both in other respects, and also, <lb/>
            though it was agreed they should make it of porine stone, <lb/>
            they built its front of Parian marble. 63. Accordingly, as <lb/>
            the Athenians state, these men, while staying at Delphi, pre­ <lb/>
            vailed on the Pythian by money, when any Spartans should <lb/>
            come thither to consult the oracle, either on their own ac­ <lb/>
            count or that of the public, to propose to them to liberate <lb/>
            Athens from servitude. The Lacedæmonians, when the same <lb/>
            warning was always given them, sent Anchimolius, son or <lb/>
            Aster, a citizen of distinction, with an army, to expel the <lb/>
            Pisistratidæ from Athens, though they were particularly <lb/>
            united to them by the ties of friendship, for they considered <lb/>
            their duty to the god more obligatory than their duty to men. <lb/>
            These forces they sent by sea in ships, and he having touched <lb/>
            at Phalerum, disembarked his army: but the Pisistratidæ, <lb/>
            having had notice of this beforehand, called in assistance from <lb/>
            Thessaly, for they had entered into an alliance with them. In <lb/>
            accordance with their request, the Thessalians with one con­ <lb/>
            sent despatched a thousand horse to their assistance, and <lb/>
            their king Cineas, a native of Conium. When the Pisistra­ <lb/>
            tidæ had these auxiliaries, they had recourse to the following <lb/>
            plan : having cleared the plains of the Phalereans, and made <lb/>
            the country practicable for cavalry, they sent the cavalry <lb/>
            against the enemy's camp ; and it having fallen on, killed <lb/>
            many of the Lacedœmonians, and among them Anchimolius, <pb n="330"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[64–66 "/>and the survivors they drove to their ships. The first expe­ <lb/>
            dition from Lacedæmon thus got off; and the tomb of An­ <lb/>
            chimolius is at Alopecæ of Attica, near the temple of Hercules <lb/>
            in Cynosarges. 64. Afterwards, the Lacedæmonians, having <lb/>
            fitted out a larger armament, sent it from Athens, having ap­ <lb/>
            pointed king Cleomenes, son of Anaxandrides, commander-in­ <lb/>
            chief; they did not however send it again by sea, but by <lb/>
            land. On their entrance into the Athenian territory, the <lb/>
            Thessalian cavalry first engaged with them, and was soon de­ <lb/>
            feated, and more than forty of their number fell: the survivors <lb/>
            immediately departed straight for Thessaly. Cleomenes hav­ <lb/>
            in- reached the city, accompanied by those Athenians who <lb/>
            wished to be free, besieged the tyrants who were shut up in <lb/>
            the Pelasgian fort. 65. However, the Lacedæmonians would <lb/>
            not by any means have been able to expel the Pisistratidæ ; <lb/>
            for they had no intention of forming a blockade, and the Pisis­ <lb/>
            tratidæ were well provided with meat and drink ; and after <lb/>
            they had besieged them for a few days, they would have re­ <lb/>
            turned to Sparta ; but now an accident happened, unfortunate <lb/>
            for one party, and at the same time advantageous to the other ; <lb/>
            for the children of the Pisistratidæ were taken as they were <lb/>
            being secretly removed from the country ; when this occurred <lb/>
            all their plans were thrown into confusion ; and, to redeem <lb/>
            their children, they submitted to such terms as the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians prescribed, so as to quit Attica within five days. They <lb/>
            afterwards retired to Sigeum, on the Scamander, having <lb/>
            governed the Athenians for thirty-six years. They were by <lb/>
            extraction Pylians, and Neleïdæ, being sprung from the same <lb/>
            ancestors as Codrus and Melanthus, who, though formerly <lb/>
            foreigners, became kings of Athens. For this reason Hip­ <lb/>
            pocrates gave the same name to his son, in token of remem­ <lb/>
            brance, calling him Pisistratus after Nestor's son Pisistratus. <lb/>
            Thus the Athenians were delivered from tyrants ; and what <lb/>
            things worthy of recital they either did or suffered, before <lb/>
            Ionia revolted from Darius, and Aristagoras the Milesian <lb/>
            came to Athens to desire their assistance, I shall now relate.</p>
          <p>66. Athens, although it was before powerful, being now <lb/>
            delivered from tyrants, became still more so. Two men in it <lb/>
            had great influence, Clisthenes, one of the Alcmæonidæ, who <lb/>
            is reported to have prevailed with the Pythian, and Isagoras, <lb/>
            son of Tisander, who was of an illustrious family, though I <pb n="331"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="67.] "/>am not able to mention his extraction ; his kinsmen, however, <lb/>
            sacrifice to Carian Jupiter. These men disputed for power ; <lb/>
            and Clisthenes, being worsted, gained over the people to his <lb/>
            side, and afterwards he divided the Athenians, who consisted <lb/>
            of four tribes, into ten ; changing the names, derived from the <lb/>
            sons of Ion, Geleon, Ægicores, Argades, and Hoples, and in­ <lb/>
            venting names from other heroes who were all natives, except <lb/>
            Ajax ; him, though a stranger, he added as a near neighbour <lb/>
            and ally. 67. Herein, I think, this Clisthenes imitated his <lb/>
            maternal grandfather, Clisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon. For Clis­ <lb/>
            thenes, when he made war on the Argives, in the first place <lb/>
            put a stop to the rhapsodists in Sicyon contending for prizes <lb/>
            in reciting the verses of Homer, because the Argives and <lb/>
            Argos are celebrated in almost every part ; and in the next <lb/>
            place, as there was, and still is, a shrine dedicated to Adras­ <lb/>
            tus, son of Talaus, in the very forum of the Sicyonians, he <lb/>
            was desirous of expelling him from the country, because he <lb/>
            was an Argive. Going, therefore, to Delphi, he consulted the <lb/>
            oracle, whether he should expel Adrastus ; and the Pythian an­ <lb/>
            swered him, saying, " That Adrastus indeed was king of the <lb/>
            Sicyonians, but Clisthenes deserved to be stoned." Finding <lb/>
            the god would not permit this, Clisthenes returned home and <lb/>
            considered of a concri vance by which Adrastus might depart <lb/>
            of himself. When he thought he had found out a way, he <lb/>
            sent to Thebes of Bceotia, and said that he wished to in­ <lb/>
            troduce Melanippus, son of Astacus ; and the Thebans as­ <lb/>
            sented. Clisthenes, therefore, having introduced Melanippus, <lb/>
            appointed him a precinct in the very prytaneum, and placed it <lb/>
            there in the strongest position. But Clisthenes introduced <lb/>
            Melanippus, for it is necessary to mention this motive, because <lb/>
            he was the greatest enemy of Adrastus, having killed his <lb/>
            brother Mecistes, and his son-in-law Tydeus. When he had <lb/>
            appointed him this precinct, he took away the sacrifices and <lb/>
            festivals of Adrastus, and gave them to Melanippus. But the <lb/>
            Sicyonians had been accustomed to honour Adrastus very <lb/>
            highly ; for the country itself belonged to Poly bus, and Poly­ <lb/>
            bus dying without a son, gave the sovereignty to Adrastus, <lb/>
            the son of his daughter. The Sicyonians paid other honours <lb/>
            to Adrastus, and, moreover, celebrated his misfortune by tragic <lb/>
            choruses ; not honouring Bacchus, but Adrastus, to that time. <lb/>
            Bat Clisthenes transferred these dances to the worship of <pb n="332"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[68-71"/> <lb/>
            Bacchus, and the rest of the ceremonies to Melanippus. This <lb/>
            he did with reference to Adrastus. 68. He also changed the <lb/>
            names of the Dorian tribes, in order that the Sicyonians and <lb/>
            Argives might not have the same. And in this he very much <lb/>
            ridiculed the Sicyonians. For, changing their names into <lb/>
            names derived from a swine and an ass, he added only the <lb/>
            terminations, except in the case of his own tribe ; to this he <lb/>
            gave a name significant of his own sovereignty, for they were <lb/>
            called Archelai; but others Hyatæ, some Oneatæ, and others <lb/>
            Chœreatæ.9 The Sicyonians adopted these names for their <lb/>
            tribes, both during the reign of Clisthenes. and after his death, <lb/>
            during sixty years ; after that, however, by common consent <lb/>
            they changed them into Hylleans, Pamphylians, and Dyma­ <lb/>
            natæ ; and they added a fourth, after Ægialeus, son of Adras­ <lb/>
            tus, giving them the name of Ægialeans.</p>
          <p>69. Now the Sicyonian Clisthenes had done these things : <lb/>
            and the Athenian Clisthenes, who was son to the daughter of <lb/>
            this Sicyonian, and had his name from him, from contempt <lb/>
            for the Ionians, as appears to me, that the Athenians might not <lb/>
            have the same tribes as the Ionians, imitated his namesake <lb/>
            Clisthenes. For when he had brought over to his own side <lb/>
            the whole of the Athenian people, who had been before alien­ <lb/>
            ated from him, he changed the names of the tribes, and aug­ <lb/>
            mented their number ; and established ten phylarchs instead <lb/>
            of four, and distributed the people into ten tribes ; and having <lb/>
            gained over the people, he became much more powerful than <lb/>
            his opponents. 70. Isagoras, being overcome in his turn, had <lb/>
            recourse to the following counter-plot: he called in Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes the Lacedæmonian, who had been on terms of friend­ <lb/>
            ship with him from the time of the siege of the Pisistratidæ; <lb/>
            and besides, Cleomenes was suspected of having had inter­ <lb/>
            course with the wife of Isagoras. First of all, therefore, Cle­ <lb/>
            omenes, sending a herald to Athens, required the expulsion <lb/>
            of Clisthenes, and with him of many other Athenians, as being <lb/>
            " under a curse." He sent this message under the instruction <lb/>
            of Isagoras : for the Alcmæonidas, and those of their party, <lb/>
            were accused of the following murder ; but neither he himself <lb/>
            had any share in it, nor had his friends. 71. Those of the <lb/>
            Athenians who were " accursed," obtained the name on the <note type="footnote"> 9 Hyatæ, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϋς</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοιο</foreign>;Oncatæ, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅνος</foreign>, an ass; Chœreatæ, from <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="72, 73.]"/> <lb/>
            following occasion. Cylon, an Athenian, had been victorious <lb/>
            in the Olympic games ; he, through pride, aspired to the <lb/>
            tyranny ; and having associated with himself a band of young <lb/>
            men about his own age, attempted to seize the Acropolis, and, <lb/>
            not being able to make himself master of it, he seated himself <lb/>
            as a suppliant at the statue of the goddess. The prytanes of <lb/>
            the Naucrari, who then had the administration of affairs in <lb/>
            Athens, removed them, under promise that they should not <lb/>
            be punished with death. But the Alcmæonidæ are accused <lb/>
            of having put them to death. These things were done before <lb/>
            the time of Pisistratus.</p>
          <p>72. When Cleomenes sent a herald to require the expul­ <lb/>
            sion of Clisthenes and the accursed, Clisthenes himself with­ <lb/>
            drew. But, nevertheless, Cleomenes came afterwards to <lb/>
            Athens with a small force, and, on his arrival, banished seven <lb/>
            hundred Athenian families, whom Isagoras pointed out to him. <lb/>
            Having done this, he next attempted to dissolve the senate, <lb/>
            and placed the magistracy in the hands of three hundred par­ <lb/>
            tisans of Isagoras. But when the senate resisted and refused <lb/>
            to obey, Cleomenes and Isagoras, with his partisans, seized <lb/>
            the Acropolis ; and the rest of the Athenians, who sided with <lb/>
            the senate, besieged them two days : on the third day, as <lb/>
            many of them as were Lacedæmonians left the country, under <lb/>
            a truce. And thus an omen, addressed to Cleomenes, was <lb/>
            accomplished ; for when he went up to the Acropolis, purpos­ <lb/>
            in- to take possession of it, he approached the sanctuary of <lb/>
            the goddess to consult her ; but the priestess, rising from her <lb/>
            seat before he had passed the door, said: " Lacedaemonian <lb/>
            stranger ! retire, nor enter within this precinct; for it is not <lb/>
            lawful for Dorians to enter here." He answered, " Woman, <lb/>
            I am not a Dorian, but an Achæan." He, however, paying <lb/>
            no attention to the omen, made the attempt, and was again <lb/>
            compelled to withdraw with the Lacedæmonians. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians put the rest in bonds for execution ; and amongst them <lb/>
            Timesitheus of Delphi, of whose deeds both of prowess and <lb/>
            courage I could say much. These, then, died in bonds. 73. <lb/>
            After this the Athenians, having recalled Clisthenes, and the <lb/>
            seven hundred families that had been banished by Cleomenes, <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Sardis, wishing to form an alliance with <lb/>
            the Persians ; for they were assured that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and Cleomenes would make, war upon them. When the ambassa- <pb n="334"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[74, 75 "/>dore arrived at Sardis, and had spoken according to their <lb/>
            instructions, Artaphernes son of Hystaspes, governoi of Sar­ <lb/>
            dis, asked who they were, and what part of the world they <lb/>
            inhabited, that they should desire to become allies of the <lb/>
            Persians ? And having been informed on these points by the <lb/>
            ambassadors, he answered in few words, that if the Athenians <lb/>
            would give earth and water to king Darius, he would enter <lb/>
            into an alliance with them ; but if they would not give them, <lb/>
            lie commanded them to depart. The ambassadors, having <lb/>
            conferred together, said that they would give them, being anx­ <lb/>
            ious to conclude the alliance : they, however, on their return <lb/>
            home were greatly blamed.</p>
          <p>74. Cleomenes, conceiving that he had been highly insulted <lb/>
            in words and deeds by the Athenians, assembled an army <lb/>
            from all parts of the Peloponnesus, without mentioning for <lb/>
            what purpose lie assembled it ; but he both purposed to re­ <lb/>
            venge himself upon the Athenians, and desired to establish <lb/>
            Isagoras as tyrant, for he had gone with him out of the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis. Cleomenes accordingly invaded the territory of Eleusis <lb/>
            with a large force, and the Bœotians, by agreement, took Ænoe <lb/>
            and Hysiæ, the extreme divisions of Attica, and the Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians attacked and ravaged the lands of Attica on the other <lb/>
            side. The Athenians, though in a state of doubt, resolved to <lb/>
            remember the Bœotians and Chalcidians on a future occasion, <lb/>
            and took up their position against the Peloponnesians, who <lb/>
            were at Eleusis. To. When the two armies were about to <lb/>
            engage, the Corinthians first, considering that they were not <lb/>
            acting justly, changed their purpose and withdrew : and after­ <lb/>
            wards, Demaratus, son of Ariston, who was also king of the <lb/>
            Spartans, and joined in leading out the army from Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, and who had never before had any difference with Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes, did the same. In consequence of this division, a law <lb/>
            was made in Sparta, that the two kings should not accompany <lb/>
            the army when it went out on foreign service; for until that <lb/>
            time both used to accompany it; and that when one of them <lb/>
            was released from military service, one of the Tyndaridæ1 <lb/>
            likewise should be left at home ; for before that time both <lb/>
            these also used to accompany the army, as auxiliaries. At that <lb/>
            time the rest of the allies, perceiving that the kings of the La- <note type="footnote">1 Castor and Pollux, the guardian deities of Sparta. </note> <pb n="335"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="76-78.]"/> <lb/>
            cedæmonians did not agree, and that the Corinthians had <lb/>
            quitted their post, likewise took their departure. 76. This, <lb/>
            then, was the fourth time that the Dorians had come to Atti­ <lb/>
            ca ; having twice entered to make war, and twice for the <lb/>
            good of the Athenian people. First, when they settled a <lb/>
            colony in Megara, when Codrus was king of Athens, that <lb/>
            may properly be called an expedition ; a second and third, <lb/>
            when they were sent from Sparta for the expulsion of the <lb/>
            Pisistratidæ ; and a fourth time, when Cleomenes, at the <lb/>
            head of the Peloponnesians, invaded Eleusis. Thus the Do­ <lb/>
            rians then invaded Athens for the fourth time.</p>
          <p>77. When this army was ingloriously dispersed, the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, desirous to avenge themselves, marched first against <lb/>
            the Chalcidians. The Bœotians came out to assist the <lb/>
            Chalcidians at the Euripus ; and the Athenians, seeing the <lb/>
            auxiliaries, resolved to attack the Boeotians before the Chalci­ <lb/>
            dians. Accordingly the Athenians came to an engagement <lb/>
            with the Bœotians, and gained a complete victory ; and having <lb/>
            killed a great number, took seven hundred of them prisoners. <lb/>
            On the same day, the Athenians, having crossed over to <lb/>
            Eubœa, came to an engagement also with the Chalcidians ; <lb/>
            and having conquered them also, left four thousand men, set­ <lb/>
            tlers, in possession of the lands of the Hippobotæ ;2 for the <lb/>
            most opulent of the Chalcidians were called Hippobotæ. As <lb/>
            many of them as they took prisoners, they kept in prison <lb/>
            with the Bœotians that were taken, having bound them in <lb/>
            fetters ; but in time they set them at liberty, having fixed <lb/>
            their ransom at two minæ. The fetters in which they had <lb/>
            been bound they hung up in the Acropolis, where they re <lb/>
            mained to my time hanging on a wall that had been much <lb/>
            scorched by fire by the Mede, opposite the temple that faces <lb/>
            the west. And they dedicated a tithe of the ransoms, having <lb/>
            made a brazen chariot with four horses, and this stands on <lb/>
            the left hand as you first enter the portico in the Acropolis ; <lb/>
            and it bears the following inscription : "The sons of the <lb/>
            Athenians, having overcome the nations of the Bœotians and <lb/>
            Chalcidians in feats of war, quelled their insolence in a dark <lb/>
            iron dungeon: they have dedicated these mares, a tithe of <lb/>
            the spoil, to Pallas." 78. The Athenians accordingly in­ <lb/>
            creased in power. And equality of rights shows, not in'one <note type="footnote"> 2 " Feeders of horses." </note> <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[79-81."/> <lb/>
            instance only, but in every way, what an excellent thing it is. <lb/>
            For the Athenians, when governed by tyrants, were superior <lb/>
            in war to none of their neighbours ; but when freed from ty­ <lb/>
            rants, became by far the first; this, then, shows that as long <lb/>
            as they were oppressed they purposely acted as cowards, as <lb/>
            labouring for a master ; but when they were free every man <lb/>
            was zealous to labour for himself. They accordingly did this.</p>
          <p>79. After this the Thebans sent to the god, wishing to re­ <lb/>
            venge themselves on the Athenians ; but the Pythian said, <lb/>
            " that they would not obtain vengeance by their own power, <lb/>
            but bade them refer the matter to the many-voiced people, <lb/>
            and ask the assistance of their nearest friends." Those who <lb/>
            were sent to consult the oracle having returned, called a ge­ <lb/>
            neral assembly, and referred the oracle to them. But when <lb/>
            they heard them say that they were to ask the assistance of <lb/>
            their nearest friends, the Thebans, on hearing this, said, " Do <lb/>
            not the Tanagræans, Coronæans, and Thespians live nearest <lb/>
            to us, and do not they always fight on our side, and heartily <lb/>
            share with us in the toils of war ? What need have we then <lb/>
            to ask their assistance ? But probably this is not the meaning <lb/>
            of the oracle." 80. While they were discussing the matter, <lb/>
            one, having at length comprehended it, said, " I think I un­ <lb/>
            derstand what the oracle means. Thebe and Ægina are said <lb/>
            to be daughters of Asopus. Now because these were sisters, <lb/>
            I think the god has admonished us to entreat the Æginetæ <lb/>
            to become our avengers." As no better opinion than this <lb/>
            was brought forward, they immediately sent and entreated the <lb/>
            Æginetæ, calling upon them to assist them according to the <lb/>
            idmonition of the oracle, as being their nearest friends. But <lb/>
            .hey, on their petition, promised to send the Æacidæ 3 to their <lb/>
            assistance. 81. The Thebans, relying on the assistance of <lb/>
            the Æacidæ, having tried the fortune of war, and being <lb/>
            roughly handled by the Athenians, sent again, and restored <lb/>
            the Æacidæ, and requested a supply of men. Whereupon the <lb/>
            Æginetæ, elated with their present prosperity, and calling to <lb/>
            mind the ancient enmity they had towards the Athenians, at <lb/>
            the request of the Thebans, levied war upon the Athenians <lb/>
            without proclamation. For while they were pursuing the <lb/>
            Bœotians, having sailed in long ships to Attica, they ravaged <lb/>
            Phalerum and many villages on the rest of the coast; and <note type="footnote"> 3Meaning " the statues of the Æacidæ." </note> <pb n="337"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="82-84.]"/> <lb/>
            In doing this, they did considerable damage to the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians.</p>
          <p>82. The enmity that was due of old from the Æginetæ to <lb/>
            the Athenians proceeded from this origin. The land of the <lb/>
            Epidaurians yielded no fruit: the Epidaurians therefore sent <lb/>
            to consult the oracle at Delphi concerning this calamity. The <lb/>
            Pythian bade them erect statues of Damia and Auxesia, and <lb/>
            when they had erected them it would fare better with them. <lb/>
            The Epidaurians then asked whether the statues should be <lb/>
            made of brass or stone ; but the Pythian did not allow it to be <lb/>
            of either, but of the wood of a cultivated olive. The Epi­ <lb/>
            daurians thereupon requested the Athenians to permit them <lb/>
            to cut down an olive tree, thinking that they were the most <lb/>
            sacred: and it is said that there were olive trees in no other <lb/>
            part of the world at that time. The Athenians said that they <lb/>
            would permit them, on condition that they should annually <lb/>
            bring victims to Minerva Polias, and Erectheus. The Epi­ <lb/>
            daurians, having agreed to these terms, obtained what they <lb/>
            asked for, and having made statues from these olive trees, <lb/>
            erected them ; and their land became fruitful, and they ful­ <lb/>
            filled their engagements to the Athenians. 83. At that time <lb/>
            and before, the Æginetæ obeyed the Epidaurians, both in other <lb/>
            respects, and crossing over to Epidaurus, the Æginetæ gave <lb/>
            and received4 justice from one another. But afterwards <lb/>
            having built ships, and having recourse to foolish confidence, <lb/>
            they revolted from the Epidaurians, and being at variance, <lb/>
            they did them much damage, as they were masters of the sea ; <lb/>
            and moreover they took away from them these statues of <lb/>
            Damia and Auxesia, and carried them off, and erected them <lb/>
            in the interior of their own territory, the name of which is <lb/>
            Œa, and about twenty stades distant from the city. Having <lb/>
            erected them in this spot, they propitiated them with sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and derisive dances of women, ten men being assigned <lb/>
            to each deity as leaders of the chorus ; and the choruses re­ <lb/>
            viled, not any men, but the women of the country. The Epi­ <lb/>
            daurians also had such religious ceremonies, but their religious <lb/>
            ceremonies are kept secret. 84. When these statues had been <lb/>
            stolen, the Epidaurians ceased to fulfil their engagements to <lb/>
            the Athenians. The Athenians sent to expostulate with the <lb/>
            Epidaurians, but they demonstrated that they were not in <note type="footnote"> 4 That is, " brought and defended actions there." </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[85,86."/> <lb/>
            reality guilty of injustice ; for as long as they had the sta­ <lb/>
            tues in their country, they fulfilled their engagements, but <lb/>
            when they had been deprived of them it was not just that <lb/>
            they should still pay the tribute, but they bid them demand <lb/>
            it of the Æginetæ who possessed them. Upon this the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, having sent to Ægina, demanded back the statues ; but <lb/>
            the Æginetæ made answer, that they had nothing to do with <lb/>
            the Athenians. 85. The Athenians say, that after this de­ <lb/>
            mand, some of their citizens were sent in a single trireme, <lb/>
            who being sent by the commonwealth, and arriving at Ægina, <lb/>
            attempted to drag these statues from off the pedestals, as <lb/>
            made from their wood, in order that they might carry them <lb/>
            away; but not being able to get possession of them in that way, <lb/>
            they threw cords about the statues, and hauled them along, <lb/>
            and as they were hauling them, thunder, and with the thun­ <lb/>
            der an earthquake, came on ; and the crew of the trireme who <lb/>
            were hauling them, were in consequence deprived of their <lb/>
            senses, and in this condition slew one another as enemies, <lb/>
            till only one of the whole number was left and escaped <lb/>
            to Phalerum. 86. Thus the Athenians say that it happened ; <lb/>
            but the Æginetæ say that the Athenians did not come with a <lb/>
            single ship ; for that they could easily have repulsed one, or a <lb/>
            few more than one, even though they had no ships of their <lb/>
            own. But they say that they sailed against their territory <lb/>
            with many ships, and that they yielded and did not hazard a <lb/>
            sea-fight. They are however unable to explain this clearly, <lb/>
            whether they yielded because they were conscious that they <lb/>
            would be inferior in a sea-fight, or with the purpose of doing <lb/>
            what they did. They say however that the Athenians, when <lb/>
            no one prepared to give them battle, disembarked from the <lb/>
            ships and proceeded towards the statues ; and that not being <lb/>
            able to wrench them from their pedestals, they then threw- <lb/>
            cords round them, and hauled them until the statues being <lb/>
            hauled did the same thing ; herein relating what is not cre­ <lb/>
            dible to me, but may be so to some one else; for they say, <lb/>
            that they fell on their knees, and have ever since continued <lb/>
            in that posture. The Æginetæ say that the Athenians did <lb/>
            this; but concerning themselves, that being informed that the <lb/>
            Athenians were about to make war upon them, they prepared <lb/>
            the Argives to assist them; and accordingly, that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians landed on the territory of Ægina, and that the Argives <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="87-89.]"/> <lb/>
            came to their assistance; and that they crossed over tc the <lb/>
            island from Epidaurus unperceived, and fell upon the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians unexpectedly, cutting off their retreat to the ships ; and <lb/>
            at this moment the thunder and earthquake happened. 87. <lb/>
            Such is the account given by the Argives and Æginetæ: and <lb/>
            it is admitted by the Athenians, that only one of their number <lb/>
            was saved, and escaped to Attica : but the Argives affirm, <lb/>
            that this one man survived, when they destroyed the Attic <lb/>
            army; the Athenians, on the contrary, say, when the deity <lb/>
            destroyed it; and that this one did not survive, but perished <lb/>
            in the following manner : on his return to Athens, he gave <lb/>
            an account of the disaster, and the wives of the men who <lb/>
            had gone on the expedition against Ægina, when they heard <lb/>
            it, being enraged that he alone of the whole number should <lb/>
            be saved, crowded round this man, and piercing him with the <lb/>
            clasps of their garments, each asked him where her own bus­ <lb/>
            band was ; thus he. died. This action of the women seemed <lb/>
            to the Athenians more dreadful than the disaster itself; how­ <lb/>
            ever they had no other way of punishing the women, they <lb/>
            therefore compelled them to change their dress for the Ionian. <lb/>
            For before that time, the wives of the Athenians wore the <lb/>
            Dorian dress, which nearly resembles the Corinthian ; they <lb/>
            changed it therefore for a linen tunic, that they might not use <lb/>
            clasps. Yet if we follow the truth, this garment is not ori­ <lb/>
            ginally Ionian, but Carian ; for the whole ancient Grecian <lb/>
            dress of the women was the same as that which we now call <lb/>
            Dorian. 88. In consequence of this event it became a cus­ <lb/>
            tom with both the Argives and the Æginetæ to do this; to <lb/>
            make their clasps one half larger than the measure before <lb/>
            established, and that the women should chiefly dedicate clasps <lb/>
            in the temple of these deities; and to bring no other Attic <lb/>
            article within the temple, not even a pitcher; but a law was <lb/>
            n ade, that they should drink there in future from vessels of <lb/>
            tneir own country. Accordingly, from that time the wives of <lb/>
            the Argives and Æginetæ, on account of their quarrel with <lb/>
            the Athenians, continued even to my time to wear clasps <lb/>
            larger than formerly.</p>
          <p>89. The origin of the enmity entertained by the Athenians <lb/>
            against the Æginetæ was such as has been described. At that <lb/>
            time, therefore, wheh the Thebans called upon them, the <lb/>
            Æginetæ, recalling to mind what had taken place respecting <note type="footnote"> z a </note> <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[90, 91."/> <lb/>
            the statues, readily assisted the Bœotians. The Æginetæ <lb/>
            therefore laid waste the maritime places of Attica, and when <lb/>
            the Athenians were preparing to march against the Æginetæ, <lb/>
            an oracle came from Delphi, enjoining them " to wait for thirty <lb/>
            years from the period of the injury committed by the 'Egi <lb/>
            netæ; and in the thirty-first year, after building a temple to <lb/>
            Æacus, to begin the war against the Æginetæ: and then they <lb/>
            would succeed according to their wishes. But if they should <lb/>
            march against them immediately, they should in the mean <lb/>
            while endure much and also inflict much; but in the end <lb/>
            would subdue them." When the Athenians heard this an­ <lb/>
            swer reported, they erected that temple to Æacus, which now <lb/>
            stands in the forum ; yet they could not bear to wait thirty <lb/>
            years, when they heard that they ought to wait, though <lb/>
            they had suffered such indignities from the Æginetæ. 90. <lb/>
            But as they were preparing to take their revenge, an affair, <lb/>
            set on foot by the Laceædmonians, became an impediment. <lb/>
            For the Lacedæmonians, being informed of the practices of <lb/>
            the Alcmæonidæ towards the Pythia, and those of the Pythia <lb/>
            against themselves and the Pisistratidæ, considered it a double <lb/>
            misfortune, because they had expelled men who were their <lb/>
            own friends out of their country, and because, when they <lb/>
            had done this, no gratitude was shown to them by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. In addition to this, the oracles urged them on, telling <lb/>
            them that they would suffer many and grievous indignities <lb/>
            from the Athenians, of which oracles they knew nothing be­ <lb/>
            fore, but then became acquainted with them, on the return of <lb/>
            Cleomenes to Sparta. Cleomenes got the oracles from the <lb/>
            Acropolis of the Athenians; the Pisistratidæ had had them <lb/>
            before, and left them in the temple when they were expelled; <lb/>
            and as they were left behind, Cleomenes took them away <lb/>
            91. When the Lacedæmonians obtained the oracles, and saw <lb/>
            the Athenians increasing in power, and not at all disposed to <lb/>
            submit to them, taking into consideration, that if the people <lb/>
            of Attica should continue free they would become of equal <lb/>
            weight with themselves, but if depressed by a tyranny would <lb/>
            be weak and ready to obey; having considered each of these <lb/>
            things, they sent for Hippias, son of Pisistratus, from Sigeum <lb/>
            on the Hellespont, to which place the Pisistratidæ had retired. <lb/>
            And when Hippias came, in compliance with their invitation, <lb/>
            the Spartans, having summoned also the ambassadors of the <pb n="341"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="92.]"/> <lb/>
            rest of their confederates, addressed them as follows: " Con­ <lb/>
            federates, we are conscious that we have not acted rightly; <lb/>
            for, being induced by lying oracles, the men who were our <lb/>
            best friends, and who had promised to keep Athens subject <lb/>
            to us,—them we expelled from their country, and then, having <lb/>
            done this, we delivered the city to an ungrateful people, who, <lb/>
            after they had been set at liberty, and had lifted up their heads <lb/>
            through our means, have insultingly ejected us and our king; <lb/>
            and having obtained renown, are growing in power, as their <lb/>
            neighbours the Bœotians and Chalcidians have already learnt <lb/>
            full well, and as others will soon learn to their cost.5 Since, <lb/>
            then, in doing these things we have committed an error, we <lb/>
            will now endeavour, with your assistance, to remedy the mis­ <lb/>
            chief and punish them. For- on this very account we sent <lb/>
            for Hippias, who is here present, and summoned you from <lb/>
            your cities, that by common consent, and combined forces, we <lb/>
            may take him back to Athens, and restore to him what we <lb/>
            took away."</p>
          <p>92. Thus these spoke; but the majority of the confederates <lb/>
            did not approve of their proposition. The rest kept silence, <lb/>
            but Sosicles the Corinthian spoke as follows: " Surely the <lb/>
            heavens will sink beneath the earth, and the earth ascend <lb/>
            aloft above the heavens; men will live in the sea, and the <lb/>
            fishes where men did before, now that you, 0 Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            abolish equality, dissolve a commonwealth, and prepare tc <lb/>
            restore tyrannies in the cities, than which there is nothing <lb/>
            more unjust, nor more cruel among men. If, in truth, this <lb/>
            appears to you a good thing, that cities should be ruled by <lb/>
            tyrants, do you first set up a tyrant over yourselves, and then <lb/>
            attempt to set them up over others. But now, while ye your­ <lb/>
            selves are altogether unacquainted with tyrannical power, and <lb/>
            watch with jealousy that such a thing should not happen in <lb/>
            Sparta, ye behave contemptuously towards your allies. But it <lb/>
            ye had been taught by experience, as we have, ye would have <lb/>
            a better proposal to make to us than you now do. (2.) The <note type="footnote"> 3<foreign xml:lang="grc">τάχα δέ τις</foreign> Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλοςέκμαθήσεται άμαρτών</foreign>.—I have ventured on a <lb/>

            and literal, renders it," and perhaps some one else will learn that he has <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[92."/> <lb/>
            constitution of the Corinthians was formerly of this kind: <lb/>
            it was an oligarchy, and those who were called Bacchiadæ <lb/>
            governed the city ; they intermarried only within their own <lb/>
            family. Amphion, one of these men, had a lame daughter, <lb/>
            her name was Labda: as no one of the Bacchiadæ would <lb/>
            marry her, Eetion, son of Echecrates, who was of the district <lb/>
            of Petra, though originally one of the Lapithæ, and a de­ <lb/>
            scendant of Cæneus, had her. He had no children by this <lb/>
            wife, nor by any other, he therefore went to Delphi to inquire <lb/>
            about having offspring; and immediately as he entered, the <lb/>
            Pythian saluted him in the following lines: ' Eetion, no one <lb/>
            honours thee, though worthy of much honour. Labda is <lb/>
            pregnant, and will bring forth a round stone; it will fall on <lb/>
            monarchs, and will vindicate Corinth.' This oracle, pro­ <lb/>
            nounced to Eetion, was by chance reported to the Bacchiadæ, <lb/>
            to whom a former oracle concerning Corinth was unintelligi­ <lb/>
            ble, and which tended to the same end as that of Eetion, and <lb/>
            was in these terms: 'An eagle broods on rocks;6 and shall <lb/>
            bring forth a lion, strong and carnivorous ; and it shall loosen <lb/>
            the knees of many. Now ponder this well, ye Corinthians, <lb/>
            who dwell around beauteous Pirene and frowning Corinth.' <lb/>
            (3.) Now this, which had been given before, was unintelligible <lb/>
            to the Bacchiadæ; but now, when they heard that which was <lb/>
            delivered to Eetion, they presently understood the former one, <lb/>
            since it agreed with that given to Eetion. And though they <lb/>
            comprehended, they kept it secret, purposing to destroy the <lb/>
            offspring that should be born to Eetion. As soon as the woman <lb/>
            brought forth, they sent ten of their own number to the dis­ <lb/>
            trict where Eetion lived, to put the child to death; and when <lb/>
            they arrived at Petra, and entered the court of Eetion, they <lb/>
            asked for the child; but Labda, knowing nothing of the pur­ <lb/>
            pose for which they had come, and supposing that they asked <lb/>
            for it out of affection for the father, brought the child, and <lb/>
            put it into the hands of one of them. Now, it had been de­ <lb/>
            termined by them in the way, that whichever of them should <lb/>
            first receive the child, should dash it on the ground. When, <lb/>
            however, Labda brought and gave it to one of them, the child, <lb/>
            by a divine providence, smiled on the man who received it; <note type="footnote"> 6 The words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αίετὸς</foreign>, " an eagle," and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέτρησι</foreign>, " rocks," bear an enig­ <lb/>
            matical meaning; the former intimating " Ection," and the latter his <lb/>
            birth-place, " Petra." </note> <pb n="343"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="92.]"/> <lb/>
            and when he perceived this, a feeling of pity restrained him <lb/>
            from killing it; and, moved by compassion, he gave it to the <lb/>
            second, and he to the third; thus the infant, being handed <lb/>
            from one to another, passed through the hands of all the <lb/>
            ten, and not one of them was willing to destroy it. Having <lb/>
            therefore delivered the child again to its mother, and gone out, <lb/>
            they stood at the door, and attacked each other with mutual <lb/>
            recriminations; and especially the first who took the child, <lb/>
            because he had not done as had been determined: at last, <lb/>
            when some time had elapsed, they determined to go in again, <lb/>
            and that every one should share in the murder. (4.) But it <lb/>
            was fated that misfortunes should spring up to Corinth from <lb/>
            the progeny of Eetion. For Labda, standing at the very door, <lb/>
            heard all that had passed; and fearing that they might change <lb/>
            their resolution, and having obtained the child a second time <lb/>
            might kill it, she took and hid it, in a place which appeared <lb/>
            least likely to be thought of, in a chest ; being very certain, <lb/>
            that if they should return and come back to search, they would <lb/>
            pry every where ; which in fact did happen : but when, having <lb/>
            come and made a strict search, they could not find the child, <lb/>
            they resolved to depart, and tell those who sent them that <lb/>
            they had done all that they had commanded. (5.) After this, <lb/>
            Eetion's son grew up, and having escaped this danger, the <lb/>
            name of Cypselus was given him, from the chest. When Cyp­ <lb/>
            selus reached man's estate, and consulted the oracle, an am­ <lb/>
            biguous answer was given him at Delphi; relying on which, <lb/>
            he attacked and got possession of Corinth. The oracle was <lb/>
            this: ' Happy this man, who is come down to my dwelling; <lb/>
            Cypselus, son of Eetion, king of renowned Corinth ; he and <lb/>
            his children, but not his children's children.' Such was the <lb/>
            oracle. And Cypselus, having obtained the tyranny, behaved <lb/>
            himself thus: he banished many of the Corinthians, deprived <lb/>
            many of their property, and many more of their life. (6.) When <lb/>
            he had reigned thirty years, and ended his life happily, his <lb/>
            son Periander became his successor in the tyranny. Now <lb/>
            Periander at first was more mild than his father; but when <lb/>
            he had communicated by ambassadors with Thrasybulus, tyrant <lb/>
            of Miletus, he became far more cruel than Cypselus. For <lb/>
            having sent a nuncio to Thrasybulus, he asked in what way, <lb/>
            having ordered affairs most securely, he might best govern <lb/>
            the city. Thrasybulus conducted the person who came from <pb n="344"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[92."/> <lb/>
            Periander out of the city, and going into a field of corn, and <lb/>
            as be went through the standing corn, questioning him about, <lb/>
            and making him repeat over again, the account of his coming <lb/>
            from Corinth, he cut off any ear that he saw taller than the <lb/>
            rest, and having cut it off, he threw it away, till in this man­ <lb/>
            ner he had destroyed the best and deepest of the corn. Having <lb/>
            gone through the piece of ground, and given no message at <lb/>
            all, he dismissed the nuncio. When the nuncio returned to <lb/>
            Corinth, Periander was anxious to know the answer of Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus; but he said that Thrasybulus had given him no answer, <lb/>
            and wondered he should have sent him to such a man, for that <lb/>
            he was crazy, and destroyed his own, property, relating what <lb/>
            he had seen done by Thrasybulus. (7.) But Periander, com­ <lb/>
            prehending the meaning of the action, and understanding that <lb/>
            Thrasybulus advised him to put to death the most eminent of <lb/>
            the citizens, thereupon exercised all manner of cruelties to­ <lb/>
            wards his subjects; for whatever Cypselus had left undone, <lb/>
            by killing and banishing, Periander completed. One day he <lb/>
            stripped all the Corinthian women, on account of his own wife <lb/>
            Melissa: 7 for when he sent messengers to the Thesprotians <lb/>
            on the river Acheron, to consult the oracle of the dead respect­ <lb/>
            ing a deposit made by a stranger, Melissa having appeared, <lb/>
            said that she would neither make it known, nor tell in what <lb/>
            place the deposit lay, because she was cold and naked ; for that <lb/>
            there was no use in the garments in which he had buried her, <lb/>
            since they had not been burnt: and as a proof that she spoke <lb/>
            truth, she added, that Periander had put his bread into a cold <lb/>
            oven. When this answer was brought back to Periander, for <lb/>
            the token was convincing to him, since he had lain with Me­ <lb/>
            lissa after her death, he immediately, on receiving the mes­ <lb/>
            sage, made proclamation that all the women of Corinth should <lb/>
            repair to the temple of Juno. They accordingly went, as to <lb/>
            a festival, dressed in their best attire ; but he having privately <lb/>
            introduced his guards, stripped them all alike, both the free <lb/>
            women and attendants ; and having collected them together <lb/>
            in a pit, he invoked Melissa, and burnt them. When he had <lb/>
            done this, and sent a second time, the phantom of Melissa told <lb/>
            in what place she had laid the stranger's deposit. Such, 0 <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, is a tyranny, and such are its deeds. Great <lb/>
            astonishment, therefore, immediately seized us Corinthians. <note type="footnote">* See B. III. chap. 50, </note> <pb n="345"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="93-95 ]"/>when we understood you had sent for Hippias ; but now we <lb/>
            are still more astonished at hearing you say what you do ; <lb/>
            and we entreat you, adjuring you by the Grecian gods, not to <lb/>
            establish tyrannies in the cities. Nevertheless, if you will <lb/>
            not desist, but against all right will endeavour to restore <lb/>
            Hippias, know that the Corinthians, at least, do not approve <lb/>
            of your design."</p>
          <p>93. Sosicles, who was ambassador from Corinth, spoke thus. <lb/>
            But Hippias answered him, having invoked the same gods as <lb/>
            lie had, that the Corinthians would most of all regret the <lb/>
            Pisistratidæ, when the fated days should come for them to <lb/>
            be harassed by the Athenians. Hippias answered thus, as <lb/>
            being more accurately acquainted with the oracles than any <lb/>
            other man. The rest of the confederates, until then, had kept <lb/>
            silence ; but when they heard Sosicles speak freely, every one <lb/>
            of them, with acclamation, embraced the opinion of the Co­ <lb/>
            rinthian ; and they adjured the Lacedæmonians not to intro­ <lb/>
            duce any innovation into a Grecian city. And thus that <lb/>
            design was defeated. 94. When Hippias departed thence, <lb/>
            Amyntas the Macedonian offered him Anthemus, and the <lb/>
            Thessalians offered him Iolcus ; he, however, accepted neither <lb/>
            of them, but returned back to Sigeum, which Pisistratus had <lb/>
            taken by force from the Mityleneans, and having got posses­ <lb/>
            sion of it, he appointed his natural son Hegesistratus, born ot <lb/>
            an Argive woman, to be tyrant ; he, however, did not retain <lb/>
            without a struggle, what he had received from Pisistratus. <lb/>
            For the Mityleneans and the Athenians, setting out from the <lb/>
            city of Achilleium and Sygeum, respectively carried on war <lb/>
            for a long time ; the former demanding restitution of the <lb/>
            place, and the Athenians not only not conceding it, but show­ <lb/>
            ing by argument that the Æolians had no more right to the <lb/>
            territories of Ilium than they, or any other of the Greeks, who <lb/>
            had assisted Menelaus in avenging the rape of Helen. 95. <lb/>
            While they were at war, various other events occurred in the <lb/>
            different battles; and among them, Alcæus the poet, when <lb/>
            an engagement took place, and the Athenians were victorious, <lb/>
            saved himself by flight; but the Athenians got possession of his <lb/>
            arms, and hung them up in the temple of Minerva at Sigeum. <lb/>
            Alcaeus having described this in an ode, sent it to Mitylene to <lb/>
            inform his friend Melanippus of his misfortune. Periander, <lb/>
            son of Cypselus, reconciled the Mityleneans and Athenians. <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[96— 98"/> <lb/>
            for they referred to him as arbitrator ; and he reconciled them <lb/>
            on these terms, that each should retain what they had. Thus <lb/>
            then Sigeum became subject to the Athenians. 96. When <lb/>
            Hippias returned from Lacedæmon to Asia, he set everything <lb/>
            in motion, accusing the Athenians falsely to Artaphernes, <lb/>
            and contriving every means, by which Athens might be sub­ <lb/>
            jected to himself and Darius. Hippias accordingly busied <lb/>
            himself about this, and the Athenians, having heard of it, sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to Sardis, warning the Persians not to give ear <lb/>
            to the Athenian exiles. But Artaphernes bade them, if they <lb/>
            wished to continue safe, receive Hippias back again. The <lb/>
            Athenians, however, would not consent to the proposed con­ <lb/>
            dition ; and when they did not consent, it was determined <lb/>
            openly to declare themselves enemies to the Persians.</p>
          <p>97. When they were taking this resolution, and were being <lb/>
            falsely accused to the Persians, at that very time Aristagoras <lb/>
            the Milesian, having been expelled from Sparta by Cleomenes <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian, arrived at Athens ; for this city was much <lb/>
            more powerful than the rest. Aristagoras, presenting him­ <lb/>
            self before the people, said the same he had done at Sparta, <lb/>
            respecting the wealth of Asia and the Persian mode of warfare, <lb/>
            how they used neither shield nor spear, and would be easily <lb/>
            conquered. He said this, and, in addition, that the Milesians <lb/>
            were a colony of the Athenians, and it was but reasonable that <lb/>
            they, having such great power, should rescue them. And <lb/>
            there was nothing he did not promise, as being very much in <lb/>
            earnest, until at length he persuaded them. For it appears to <lb/>
            be more easy to impose upon a multitude than one man ; since <lb/>
            he was not able to impose upon Cleomenes the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            singly, but did so to thirty thousand Athenians. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians accordingly, being persuaded, decreed to send twenty <lb/>
            ships to succour the Ionians, having appointed Melanthius <lb/>
            commander over them, a citizen who was universally esteemed. <lb/>
            These ships were the source of calamities both to Greeks and <lb/>
            barbarians. 98. Aristagoras having sailed first, and arrived <lb/>
            at Miletus, had recourse to a project from which no advan­ <lb/>
            tage could result to the Ionians ; nor did he employ it for <lb/>
            that purpose, but that he might vex king Darius. He sent a <lb/>
            man into Phrygia, to the Pæonians, who had been carried <lb/>
            away captive by Megabazus from the river Strymon, and oc­ <lb/>
            cupied a tract in Phrygia, and a village by themselves. When <pb n="347"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="99-101.]"/> <lb/>
            he reached the Pæonians, he spoke as follows : ' Men of Pæ­ <lb/>
            onia, Aristagoras, tyrant of Miletus, has sent me to suggest to <lb/>
            you a mode of deliverance, if you will take his advice. For all <lb/>
            Ionia has revolted from the king, and offers you an opportu­ <lb/>
            nity of returning safe to your oWn country ; as far as the <lb/>
            coast take care of yourselves, and we will provide for the rest." <lb/>
            The Pæonians, when they heard these words, considered it a <lb/>
            very joyful event, and having taken with them their children <lb/>
            and wives, fled to the coast; but some of them, through fear, <lb/>
            remained where they were. When the Pæonians reached the <lb/>
            coast, they thence crossed over to Chios ; and just as they had <lb/>
            reached Chios, a large body of Persian cavalry came on their <lb/>
            heels, pursuing the Paeonians ; and when they did not over­ <lb/>
            take them, sent orders to Chios to the Pæonians, commanding <lb/>
            them to return. But the Pæonians did not listen to the pro­ <lb/>
            posal ; but the Chians conveyed them to Lesbos, and the <lb/>
            Lesbians forwarded them to Doriscus ; thence proceeding on <lb/>
            foot they reached Pæonia.</p>
          <p>99. But Aristagoras, when the Athenians arrived with <lb/>
            twenty ships, bringing with them five triremes of the Eretrians, <lb/>
            who engaged in this expedition, not out of good-will to the <lb/>
            Athenians, but of the Milesians themselves, in order to repay <lb/>
            a former obligation ; for the Milesians had formerly joined <lb/>
            the Eretrians in the war against the Chalcidians, at the time <lb/>
            when the Samians assisted the Chalcidians against the Ere­ <lb/>
            trians and Milesians.. When these, then, had arrived, and the <lb/>
            rest of the allies had come up, Aristagoras resolved to make <lb/>
            an expedition to Sardis. He himself did not march with the <lb/>
            army, but remained at Miletus, and appointed others as ge­ <lb/>
            nerals of the Milesians, his own brother Charopinus, and of <lb/>
            the other citizens Hermophantus. 100. The Ionians, having <lb/>
            arrived at Ephesus with this force, left their ships at Cores- <lb/>
            BUS, in the Ephesian territory, and they advanced with a <lb/>
            numerous army, taking Ephesians for their guides; and <lb/>
            marching by the side of the river Cayster, from thence they <lb/>
            crossed Mount Tmolus, and reached and took Sardis without <lb/>
            opposition ; and they took all except the citadel, but Arta­ <lb/>
            phernes with a strong garrison defended the citadel. 101. <lb/>
            The following accident prevented them, after they had taken <lb/>
            the city, from plundering it. Most of the houses in Sardis <lb/>
            were built with reeds ; and such of them as were built with <pb n="348"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[102, 103"/> <lb/>
            brick, had roofs of reeds. A soldier happened to set fire to <lb/>
            one of these, and immediately the flame spread from house to <lb/>
            house, and consumed the whole city. While the city was <lb/>
            being burnt, the Lydians, and as many of the Persians as were <lb/>
            in the city, being enclosed on every side, since the fire had <lb/>
            got possession of the extreme parts, and had no means of <lb/>
            escaping from the city, rushed together to the market-place, <lb/>
            and to the river Pactolus, which, bringing down grains of <lb/>
            gold from Mount Tmolus, flows through the middle of the <lb/>
            market-place, and then discharges itself into the river Hermus, <lb/>
            and that into the sea. The Lydians and Persians, therefore, <lb/>
            being assembled on this Pactolus and at the market-place, <lb/>
            were constrained to defend themselves: and the Ionians, seeing <lb/>
            some of the enemy standing on their defence, and others com­ <lb/>
            in- up in great numbers, retired through fear to the mountain <lb/>
            called Tmolus, and thence under favour of the night retreated <lb/>
            to their ships. 102. Thus Sardis was burnt, and in it the <lb/>
            temple of the native goddess Cybebe; the Persians, making a <lb/>
            pretext of this, afterwards burnt in retaliation the temples of <lb/>
            Greece. As soon as the Persians who had settlements on this <lb/>
            side the river Halys were informed of these things, they drew <lb/>
            together, and marched to assist the Lydians ; and they hap­ <lb/>
            pened to find that the Ionians were no longer at Sardis ; but <lb/>
            following on their track they overtook them at Ephesus ; and <lb/>
            the Ionians drew out in battle-array against them, and com­ <lb/>
            ing to an engagement, were sorely beaten ; and the Persians <lb/>
            slew many of them, and among other persons of distinction, <lb/>
            Eualcis, general of the Eretrians, who had gained the prize in <lb/>
            the contests for the crown, and had been much celebrated by <lb/>
            Simonides the Cean. Those who escaped from the battle, were <lb/>
            dispersed throughout the cities.</p>
          <p>103. At that time such was the result of the encounter. <lb/>
            Afterwards, the Athenians, totally abandoning the Ionians, <lb/>
            though Aristagoras urgently solicited them by ambassadors, <lb/>
            refused to send them any assistance. The Ionians, being <lb/>
            deprived of the alliance of the Athenians, (for they had con­ <lb/>
            ducted themselves in such a manner towards Darius from the <lb/>
            first,) nevertheless prepared for war with the king. And <lb/>
            having sailed to the Hellespont, they reduced Byzantium and <lb/>
            all the other cities in that quarter tc their obedience. Then <lb/>
            having sailed out of the Hellespont, they gained over to their <pb n="349"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="104-106."/> <lb/>
            alliance the greater part of Caria; for the city of Caunus, <lb/>
            which before would not join their alliance, when they had <lb/>
            burnt Sardis, came over to their side. 104. And all the <lb/>
            Cyprians, except the Amathusians, came over to them of their <lb/>
            own accord ; for they too had revolted from the Mede on the <lb/>
            following occasion. Onesilus was younger brother of Gorgus <lb/>
            king of the Salaminians, and son of Chersis, son of Siromus, <lb/>
            son of Euelthon ; this man had frequently before exhorted his <lb/>
            brother to revolt from the king ; but when he heard that the <lb/>
            lonians had revolted, he pressed him very urgently, but find­ <lb/>
            ing he could not persuade Gorgus, Onesilus with his partisans, <lb/>
            thereupon having watched an opportunity when he had <lb/>
            gone out of the city of the Salaminians, shut the gates against <lb/>
            him. Gorgus being thus deprived of his city, fled to the <lb/>
            Modes; and Onesilus ruled over Salamis, and endeavoured to <lb/>
            persuade all the Cyprians to join in the revolt. The rest he <lb/>
            persuaded ; but the Amathusians, who would not listen to <lb/>
            him, he sat down and besieged.</p>
          <p>105. Onesilus accordingly besieged Amathus. But when <lb/>
            it was told king Darius, that Sardis had been taken and burnt by <lb/>
            the Athenians and Ionians, and that Aristagoras the Milesian <lb/>
            was the chief of the confederacy, and the contriver of that <lb/>
            enterprise ; it is related that he, when he heard this, took no <lb/>
            account of the Ionians, well knowing that they would not <lb/>
            escape unpunished for their rebellion, but inquired where the <lb/>
            Athenians were : then having been informed, lie called for a <lb/>
            bow, and having received one, and put an arrow into it, he <lb/>
            let it fly towards heaven, and as he shot it into the air, he <lb/>
            said, "0 Jupiter, grant that I may revenge myself on the <lb/>
            Athenians !" Having thus spoken, he commanded one of his <lb/>
            attendants, every time dinner was set before him, to say thrice, <lb/>
            "Sire, remember the Athenians." 106. Having given this <lb/>
            order; and summoned to his presence Histiæus the Milesian, <lb/>
            whom he had already detained a long time, Darius said : " I am <lb/>
            informed, Histiæus, that your lieutenant, to whom you intrust­ <lb/>
            ed Miletus, has attempted innovations against me ; for having <lb/>
            brought men from the other continent, and with them lonians, <lb/>
            who shall give me satisfaction for what they have done ; having <lb/>
            persuaded these to accompany them, he has deprived me of Sar­ <lb/>
            dis. Now, can it appear to you that this is right ? Could such <lb/>
            a thing have been done without your advice ? Beware lest <pb n="350"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[107, 108."/> <lb/>
            hereafter you expose yourself to blame." To this Histiæus <lb/>
            answered: " 0 king, what have you said ? That I should <lb/>
            advise a thing from which any grief, great or little. should <lb/>
            ensue to you ! with what object should I do so ? What am I <lb/>
            in want of ? I, who have all things the same as you, and am <lb/>
            deemed worthy to share all your counsels ? But if my lieutenant <lb/>
            has done any such thing as you mention, be assured lie has <lb/>
            done it of his own contrivance. But in the outset I do not <lb/>
            believe the account, that the Milesians and my lieutenant <lb/>
            have attempted any innovations against your authority. Yet <lb/>
            if they have done any thing of the kind, and yuu have heard <lb/>
            the truth, consider, 0 king, what mischief you have done in <lb/>
            withdrawing me from the coast. For the Ionians seem, when <lb/>
            I was out of their sight, to have done what they long ago de­ <lb/>
            sired to do ; and had I been in Ionia not one city would have <lb/>
            stirred. Suffer me therefore to go with all speed to Ionia, that <lb/>
            I may restore all things there to their former condition, and <lb/>
            deliver into your hands this lieutenant of Miletus, who has <lb/>
            plotted the whole. When I have done this according to your <lb/>
            mind, I swear by the royal gods, not to put off the garments <lb/>
            which I shall wear when I go downto Ionia, before I have, <lb/>
            made the great island Sardinia tributary to you." 107. His­ <lb/>
            tiæus, speaking thus, deceived the king. But Darius was <lb/>
            persuaded, and let him go ; having charged him to return to <lb/>
            him at-Susa, so soon as he should have accomplished what he <lb/>
            had promised.</p>
          <p>108. While the news concerning Sardis was going up to <lb/>
            the king, and Darius, having done what has been describi d <lb/>
            relating to the bow, held a conference with Histiæus, and <lb/>
            while Histiæus, having been dismissed by Darius, was on his <lb/>
            journey to the sea ; during all this time the following events <lb/>
            took place. Tidings were brought to Onesilus the Salaminian, <lb/>
            as he was besieging the Amathusians, that Artybius, a Per­ <lb/>
            sian, leading a large Persian force on ship-board, was to be <lb/>
            expected in Cyprus. Onesilus, having been informed of this, <lb/>
            sent heralds to the different parts of Ionia, inviting them to <lb/>
            assist him ; and the Ionians, without any protracted deliber­ <lb/>
            ation, came with a large armament. The Ionians accordingly <lb/>
            arrived at Cyprus, and the Persians, having crossed over in <lb/>
            ships from Cilicia, marched by land against Salamis; but the <lb/>
            Phœnicians in their chips doubled the promontory, which is <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="09—111.]"/> <lb/>
            called the key 01 Cyprus. 109. This having taken place, the <lb/>
            tyrants of Cyprus, having called together the general of the <lb/>
            Ionians, said, "Men of Ionia, we Cyprians give you the <lb/>
            choice, to engage with whichever you wish, the Persians or <lb/>
            Phœnicians. If you choose to try your strength with the <lb/>
            Persians drawn up on land, it is time for you to disembark <lb/>
            from your ships, and to draw up on land, and for us to go on <lb/>
            board your ships, in order to oppose the Phoenicians : but if <lb/>
            you would rather try your strength with the Phoenicians, which­ <lb/>
            ever of these you choose, it behoves you so to behave your­ <lb/>
            selves, that as far as depends on you both Ionia and Cyprus <lb/>
            may be free." To this the Ionians answered : " The general <lb/>
            council of the Ionians has sent us to guard the sea, and not <lb/>
            that, having delivered our ships to the Cyprians, we ourselves <lb/>
            should engage with the Persians by land. We therefore shall <lb/>
            endeavour to do our duty in that post to which we have been <lb/>
            appointed; and it behoves you, bearing in mind what you <lb/>
            have suffered under the yoke of the Modes, to prove your­ <lb/>
            selves to be brave men." The Ionians made answer in these <lb/>
            words. 110. Afterwards, when the Persians had reached the <lb/>
            plain of the Salaminians, the kings of the Cyprians drew up <lb/>
            their forces in line, stationing the other Cyprians against the <lb/>
            other soldiery of the enemy, but having selected the best of <lb/>
            the Salaminians and Solians, they stationed them against the <lb/>
            Persians. Onesilus voluntarily took up his position directly <lb/>
            against Artybius, the general of the Persians. 111. Artybius <lb/>
            used to ride on a horse, that had been taught to rear up against <lb/>
            an armed enemy. Onesilus, therefore, having heard of this, <lb/>
            and having as a shield-bearer a Carian well skilled in matters <lb/>
            of war, and otherwise full of courage, said to this man, "I am <lb/>
            informed that the horse of Artybius rears up, and with his feet <lb/>
            and mouth attacks whomsoever he is made to engage with ; do <lb/>
            you therefore determine at once, and tell me, which you will <lb/>
            watch and strike, whether the horse or Artybius himself." <lb/>
            His attendant answered, " I am ready to do both, or either <lb/>
            of them, and indeed whatever you may command. But I will <lb/>
            declare how it appears to me to be most conducive to your in­ <lb/>
            terest. A king and a general ought, I think, to engage with <lb/>
            a king and a general. For if you vanquish one who is a ge­ <lb/>
            neral, your glory is great; and in the next place, if he should <lb/>
            vanquish you, which may the gods avert, to fall by a noble <pb n="352"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[112—115"/> <lb/>
            hand is but half the calamity ; but we servants should engage <lb/>
            with other servants, and also against a horse, whose tricks do <lb/>
            not you fear at all; for I promise you he shall never here­ <lb/>
            after rear up against any man." 112. Thus he spoke, and <lb/>
            forthwith the forces joined battle by land and sea. Now the <lb/>
            Ionians, fighting valiantly on that day, defeated the Phoeni­ <lb/>
            cians at sea; and of these the Samians most distinguished <lb/>
            themselves ; but on land, when the armies met, they engaged <lb/>
            in close combat; and the following happened with respect to <lb/>
            the two generals : when Artybius, seated on his horse, bore <lb/>
            down upon Onesilus, Onesilus, as he had concerted with his <lb/>
            shield-bearer, struck Artybius himself as he was bearing down <lb/>
            upon him ; and as the horse was throwing his feet against the <lb/>
            shield of Onesilus, the Carian thereupon struck him with a <lb/>
            scythe, and cut off the horses feet. So that Artybius the ge­ <lb/>
            neral of the Persians fell together with his horse on the spot. <lb/>
            113. While the rest were fighting, Stesenor, who was of Cu­ <lb/>
            rium, deserted with no inconsiderable body of men ; these <lb/>
            Curians are said to be a colony of Argives ; and when the <lb/>
            Curians had deserted, the chariots of war belonging to the <lb/>
            Salaminians did the same as the Curians : in consequence of <lb/>
            this the Persians became superior to the Cyprians ; and the <lb/>
            army being put to flight, many others fell, and amongst them <lb/>
            Onesilus, son of Chersis, who had contrived the revolt of the <lb/>
            Cyprians, and the king of the Solians, Aristocyprus, son of <lb/>
            Philocyprus ; of that Philocyprus, whom Solon the Athenian, <lb/>
            when he visited Cyprus, celebrated in his verses above all <lb/>
            tyrants. 114. Now the Amathusians, having cut off the head <lb/>
            of Onesilus, because he had besieged them, took it to Ama­ <lb/>
            thus, and suspended it over the gates; and when the head was <lb/>
            suspended, and had become hollow, a swarm of bees entered <lb/>
            it, and filled it with honey-comb. When this happened, the <lb/>
            Amathusians consulted the oracle respecting it, and an answer <lb/>
            was given them, "that they should take down the head and <lb/>
            bury it, and sacrifice annually to Onesilus, as to a hero ; and <lb/>
            if they did so, it would turn out better for them." 115. The <lb/>
            Amathusians did accordingly, and continued to do so until my <lb/>
            time. The lonians, who had fought by sea at Cyprus, when <lb/>
            they heard that the affairs of Onesilus were ruined, and that <lb/>
            the rest of the Cyprian cities were besieged, except Salamis, <lb/>
            but this the Salaminians had restored to their former king <pb n="353"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="116—119.]"/> <lb/>
            Gorgus ; the Ionians, as soon as they learnt this, sailed away <lb/>
            to Ionia. Of the cities in Cyprus, Soli held out against the <lb/>
            siege for the longest time; but the Persians, having under <lb/>
            mined the wall all round, took it in the fifth month.</p>
          <p>116. Thus the Cyprians, having been free for one year, <lb/>
            were again reduced to servitude. But Daurises, who had <lb/>
            married a daughter of Darius, and Hymees, and Otanes, and <lb/>
            other Persian generals who also had married daughters of Da­ <lb/>
            rius, having pursued those of the Ionians who had attacked <lb/>
            Sardis, and having driven them to their ships, when they had <lb/>
            conquered them in battle, next divided the cities among them­ <lb/>
            selves and proceeded to plunder them. 117. Daurises, di­ <lb/>
            recting his march towards the cities on the Hellespont, took <lb/>
            Dardanus ; he also took Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus, and <lb/>
            Paesus ; these he took each in one day. But as he was ad­ <lb/>
            vancing from Pæsus against Parium, news was brought him <lb/>
            that the Carians, having conspired with the Ionians, had re­ <lb/>
            volted from the Persians. Therefore turning back from the- <lb/>
            Hellespont, he led his army against Caria. 118. Somehow <lb/>
            news of this was brought to the Carians before Daurises arrived. <lb/>
            The Carians, having heard of it, assembled at what are called <lb/>
            the White Columns, on the river Marsyas, which flowing from <lb/>
            the territory of Idrias, falls into the Maeander. When the <lb/>
            Carians were assembled on this spot, several other propositions <lb/>
            were made, of which the best appeared to be that of Pix­ <lb/>
            odarus, son of Mausolus, a Cyndian, who had married the <lb/>
            daughter of Syennesis king of the Cilicians. His opinion was <lb/>
            that the Carians, having crossed the Mæander, and having <lb/>
            the river in their rear, should so engage; in order that the <lb/>
            Carians, not being able to retreat, and being compelled to <lb/>
            remain on their ground, might be made even braver than they <lb/>
            naturally were. This opinion, however, did not prevail, but <lb/>
            that the Mæander should rather be in the rear of the Persians <lb/>
            than of themselves ; to the end that if the Persians should be <lb/>
            put to flight, and worsted in the engagement, they might have <lb/>
            no retreat, and fall into the river. 119. Afterwards, the <lb/>
            Persians having come up and crossed the Maeander, the Ca­ <lb/>
            rians, thereupon, came to an engagement with the Persians on <lb/>
            the banks of the river Marsyas, and they fought an obstinate <lb/>
            battle, and for a long time, but at last were overpowered by <lb/>
            numbers. Of the Persians there fell about two thousand, and <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[120-124."/> <lb/>
            of the Carians, ten thousand. Such of them as escaped from <lb/>
            thence were shut up in Labranda, in a large precinct and <lb/>
            sacred grove of plane-trees, dedicated to Jupiter Stratius. <lb/>
            The Carians are the only people we know, who offer sacrifices <lb/>
            to Jupiter Stratius. They, then, being shut up in this place, <lb/>
            consulted on the means of safety, whether they would fare bet­ <lb/>
            ter by surrendering themselves to the Persians, or by abandon­ <lb/>
            ing Asia altogether. 120. While they were deliberating about <lb/>
            this, the Milesians and their allies came to their assistance ; <lb/>
            upon this the Carians gave up what they were before deliber­ <lb/>
            ating about, and prepared to renew the war; and they en-­ <lb/>
            gaged with the Persians whan they came up, and having <lb/>
            fought, were more signally beaten than before ; though in the <lb/>
            whole many fell, the Milesians suffered most. 121. The Ca­ <lb/>
            rians, however, afterwards recovered this wound, and renewed <lb/>
            the contest. For hearing that the Persians designed to invade <lb/>
            their cities, they placed an ambuscade on the way to Pedasus, <lb/>
            into which the Persians falling by night, were cut in pieces, <lb/>
            both they and their generals Daurises, Amorges, and Sisa­ <lb/>
            maces ; and with them perished Myrses, son of Gyges. The <lb/>
            leader of this ambuscade was Heraclides, son of Ibanolis, a <lb/>
            Mylassian. Thus these Persians were destroyed.</p>
          <p>122. Hymees, who was also one of those who pursued the <lb/>
            Ionians that had attacked Sardis, bending his march towards <lb/>
            the Propontis, took Cius of Mysia. But having taken it, when <lb/>
            he heard that Daurises had quitted the Hellespont, and was <lb/>
            marching against Caria, he abandoned the Propontis, and led <lb/>
            his army on the Hellespont; and he subdued all the Æolians <lb/>
            who inhabited the territory of Ilium, and subdued the Gergi­ <lb/>
            thæ, the remaining descendants of the ancient Teucrians ; <lb/>
            but Hymees himself, having subdued these nations, died of <lb/>
            disease in the Troad. 123. Thus then he died : but Arta­ <lb/>
            phernes, governor of Sardis, and Otanes, one of the three ge­ <lb/>
            nerals,8 were appointed to invade Ionia, and the neighbouring <lb/>
            territory of Æolia. Of Ionia, accordingly, they took Clazo­ <lb/>
            menae; and of the Æolians, Cyme.</p>
          <p>124. When these cities were taken, Aristagoras the9 Mile­ <lb/>
            elan, for he was not, as it proved, a man of strong courage, who <note type="footnote"> 8 The two others were Daurises and Hymees; see ch. 116. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 The reader will observe that the sentence is broken and imperfect ; <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="125 126.]"/> <lb/>
            having thrown Ionia into confusion, and raised great disturb- <lb/>
            ances, thought of flight, when he saw these results ; and, <lb/>
            besides, it appeared to him impossible to overcome king Da­ <lb/>
            rius : therefore, having called his partisans together, he con­ <lb/>
            ferred with them, saying, " that it would be better for them <lb/>
            to have some sure place of refuge, in case they should be <lb/>
            expelled from Miletus." He asked, therefore, whether he <lb/>
            should lead them to Sardinia, to found a colony, or to Myr­ <lb/>
            cinus of the Edonians, which Histiæus had begun to fortify, <lb/>
            having received it as a gift from Darius. 125. However, the <lb/>
            opinion of Hecatæus the historian, son of Hegesander, was, <lb/>
            that they should set out for neither of these places, but that, <lb/>
            having built a fortress in the island of Leros, they should remain <lb/>
            quiet, if they were compelled to quit Miletus ; and that at <lb/>
            some future time, proceeding from thence, they might return <lb/>
            to Miletus. This was the advice of Hecatæus. 126. But <lb/>
            Aristagoras himself was decidedly in favour of proceeding to <lb/>
            Myreinus ; he therefore intrusted Miletus to Pythagoras, a <lb/>
            citizen of distinction, and he himself, taking with him all who <lb/>
            were willing, sailed to Thrace, and took possession of the re­ <lb/>
            gion to which he was bound. But setting out from thence, <lb/>
            both Aristagoras himself and all his army perished by the <lb/>
            hands of Thracians, as he was laying siege to a city, and the <lb/>
            Thracians were willing to depart on terms of capitulation. <note type="footnote"> 2A2</note> <pb n="356"/>

          <p>ARISTAGORAS, having induced the Ionians to revolt, thus died: <lb/>
            and Histiæus, tyrant of Miletus, having been dismissed by <lb/>
            Darius, repaired to Sardis. When he arrived from Susa, <lb/>
            Artaphernes, governor of Sardis, asked him for what reason <lb/>
            he supposed the Ionians had revolted. Histiæus said, he did <lb/>
            not know, and seemed surprised at what had happened, as if <lb/>
            he in truth knew nothing of the present state of affairs. But <lb/>
            Artaphernes, perceiving that he was dissembling, and being <lb/>
            aware of the exact truth as to the revolt, said, " Histiæus, the <lb/>
            state of the case is this ; you made the shoe and Aristagoras <lb/>
            has put it on." 2. Artaphernes spoke thus concerning the re­ <lb/>
            volt : but Histiæus, fearing Artaphernes, as being privy to the <lb/>
            truth, as soon as night came on, fled to the coast, having de­ <lb/>
            ceived king Darius ; for having promised to reduce the great <lb/>
            island of Sardinia, he insinuated himself into the command of <lb/>
            the Ionians in the war against Darius. Having crossed over <lb/>
            to Chios he was put in chains by the Chians, being suspected <lb/>
            by them of planning some new design against them in favour <lb/>
            of Darius. However, the Chians, having learnt the whole <lb/>
            truth, and that he was an enemy to the king, released him. <lb/>
            3. At that time Histiæus being questioned by the Ionians why <lb/>
            he had so earnestly pressed Aristagoras to revolt from the <lb/>
            king, and had wrought so much mischief to the Ionians, he <lb/>
            by no means made known to them the true reason ; but told <lb/>
            them, that " king Darius had resolved to remove the Phœni­ <lb/>
            cians and settle them in Ionia, and the Ionians in Phoenicia ; <lb/>
            and for this reason he had pressed him." Although the king <lb/>
            had formed no resolution of the kind, he terrified the lonians. <lb/>
            4. After this, Histiæus, corresponding by means of a messen­ <lb/>
            ger, Hermippus an Atarnian, sent letters to certain Persians <lb/>
            in Sardis, as if they had before conferred with turn on the <pb n="357"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="5—7.]"/>subject of a revolt But Hermippus did not deliver the let. <lb/>
            ters to the persons to whom he had been sent, but put them <lb/>
            into the hands of Artaphernes ; he, having discovered all- that <lb/>
            was going on, commanded Hermippus to deliver the letters of <lb/>
            Histiæus to the persons for whom he brought them, and to <lb/>
            deliver to him the answers that should be sent back to His­ <lb/>
            tiæus from the Persians. Thus they being discovered, <lb/>
            Artaphernes thereupon put many of the Persians to death ; <lb/>
            and in consequence there was a great commotion in Sardis <lb/>
            5. Histiæus being disappointed of these hopes, the Chians <lb/>
            conveyed him to Miletus, at his own request; but the Mi­ <lb/>
            lesians, delighted at being rid of Aristagoras, were by no <lb/>
            means desirous to receive another tyrant into their country, <lb/>
            as they had tasted of freedom. Thereupon Histiæus, going <lb/>
            down to Miletus by night, endeavoured to enter it by force, <lb/>
            but was wounded in the thigh by one of the Milesians. When <lb/>
            he was repulsed from his own country, he went back to Chios, <lb/>
            and from thence, since he could not persuade the Chians to <lb/>
            furnish him with ships, he crossed over to Mitylene, and pre­ <lb/>
            vailed with the Lesbians to furnish him with ships ; and they, <lb/>
            having manned eight triremes, sailed with Histiæus to Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium. There taking up their station, they took all the ships <lb/>
            that sailed out of the Pontus, except such of them as said <lb/>
            they were ready to submit to Histiæus.</p>
          <p>6. Histiæus, then, and the Mitylenians, acted as above <lb/>
            described. But a large naval .and land force was expected <lb/>
            against Miletus itself. For the Persian generals, having <lb/>
            united their forces and formed one camp, marched against <lb/>
            Miletus, deeming the other cities of less consequence. Of the <lb/>
            maritime forces, the Phœnicians were the most zealous, and <lb/>
            the Cyprians, who had been lately subdued, served with them, <lb/>
            and the Cilicians, and Egyptians. 7. They then advanced <lb/>
            against Miletus, and the rest of Ionia ; but the Ionians, <lb/>
            having heard of this, sent their respective deputies to the <lb/>
            Panionium,1 and when they arrived at that place and consult­ <lb/>
            ed together, it was determined not to assemble any land forces <lb/>
            to oppose the Persians; but that the Milesians themselves <lb/>
            should detend the walls ; and that they should man their <lb/>
            navy, without leaving a single ship behind; and after they <lb/>
            had manned them, to assemble as soon as possible at Lade, to <note type="footnote"> I See B. I. chi. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            fight in defence of Miletus. Lade is a small island lying off <lb/>
            the city of the Milesians. 8. After this the Ionians came up <lb/>
            with their ships manned, and with them the Æolians who <lb/>
            inhabit Lesbos ; and they formed their line in the following <lb/>
            order. The Milesians themselves, who furnished eighty ships, <lb/>
            occupied the east wing ; and next to these the Prienians with <lb/>
            twelve ships, and the Myusians with three ; the Teians were <lb/>
            next to the Myusians, with seventeen ships ; the Chians were <lb/>
            next the Teians, with a hundred ships; next to these, the <lb/>
            Erythræans and the Phocæans were drawn up, the Ery­ <lb/>
            thræans furnishing eight ships, and the Phocæans three ; <lb/>
            next the Phocæans were the Lesbians with seventy ships ; <lb/>
            last of all the Samians were drawn up, occupying the western <lb/>
            wing with sixty ships. Of all these, the whole number <lb/>
            amounted to three hundred and fifty-three triremes. Such <lb/>
            was the fleet of the Ionians. 9. On the side of the barba­ <lb/>
            rians the number of ships amounted to six hundred : but <lb/>
            when they arrived on the Milesian coast, and all their land <lb/>
            forces were come up, the Persian generals, hearing the <lb/>
            number of the Ionian fleet, began to fear they should not <lb/>
            be strong enough to overcome it, and so should be also <lb/>
            unable to take Miletus, since they were not masters at sea, <lb/>
            and then might be in danger of receiving punishment at the <lb/>
            hands of Darius. Taking these things into consideration, <lb/>
            they summoned the tyrants of the Ionians, who, having been <lb/>
            deprived of their governments by Aristagoras, had fled to the <lb/>
            Medes, and happened at that time to be serving in the <lb/>
            army against Miletus ; having called together such of these <lb/>
            men as were at hand, they addressed them as follows : " Men <lb/>
            of Ionia, let each of you now show his zeal for the king's <lb/>
            house. For let each of ycu endeavour to detach his own <lb/>
            countrymen from the rest of the confederacy, and hold out to <lb/>
            them and proclaim this, that they shall suffer no hurt on ac­ <lb/>
            count of their rebellion, nor shall their buildings, whether <lb/>
            sacred or profane, be burnt, nor shall they be treated with <lb/>
            more severity than they were before. But if they will not do <lb/>
            this, and will at all events come to the hazard of a battle, <lb/>
            threaten them with this which will surely befal them ; that <lb/>
            when conquered in battle, they shall be enslaved; that we <lb/>
            will make eunuchs of their sons, and transport their virgins to <lb/>
            Bactra, and then give their country to others." 10. Thus they <pb n="359"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="11, 12.]"/> <lb/>
            spoke ; but the tyrants of the lonians sent each by night to <lb/>
            his own countrymen, to make known the warning. But the <lb/>
            lonians to whom these messages came, continued firm to their <lb/>
            purpose and would not listen to treachery ; for each thought <lb/>
            that the Persians had sent this message to themselves only. <lb/>
            This, then, took place immediately after the arrival of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians before Miletus.</p>
          <p>11. Afterwards, when the lonians had assembled at Lade, <lb/>
            councils were held, and on occasion others addressed them, <lb/>
            and amongst the rest, the Phocæan general Dionysius, who <lb/>
            spoke as follows : "Our affairs are in a critical2 state, 0 <lb/>
            lonians, whether we shall be freemen or slaves, and that too <lb/>
            as run-away slaves : now then, if you are willing to un­ <lb/>
            dergo hardships, for the present you will have toil, but will <lb/>
            be enabled, by overcoming your enemies, to be free ; on the <lb/>
            other hand, if you abandon yourselves to ease and disorder, I <lb/>
            have no hope of you, that you will escape punishment at <lb/>
            the hands of the king for your revolt. But be persuaded by <lb/>
            me, and intrust yourselves to my guidance, and I promise <lb/>
            you, if the gods are impartial, either that our enemies will <lb/>
            not fight us at all, or if they do fight with us, they shall be <lb/>
            completely beaten." 12. The Ionians having heard this, in­ <lb/>
            trusted themselves to the guidance of Dionysius ; and he, <lb/>
            daily leading out the ships into a line, when he had exercised <lb/>
            the rowers, by practising the manoeuvre of cutting through <lb/>
            one another's line, and had put the marines under arms, <lb/>
            kept the ships at anchor for the rest of the day: thus he sub­ <lb/>
            jected the lonians to toil throughout the day. Accordingly <lb/>
            for seven days they continued to obey, and did what was or­ <lb/>
            dered ; but on the following day, the Ionians, unaccustomed <lb/>
            to such toil, and worn down by hardships and the heat of <lb/>
            the sun, spoke one to another as follows : " What deity having <lb/>
            offended, do we fill up this measure of affliction ? we who <lb/>
            being beside ourselves, and having lost our senses, have in­ <lb/>
            trusted ourselves to the guidance of a presumptuous Phocaean, <lb/>
            who has contributed three ships ; but he, having got us under <lb/>
            his control, afflicts us with intolerable hardships. Many of <lb/>
            us have already fallen into distempers, and many must expect <lb/>
            to meet with the same fate. Instead of these evils, it were better <lb/>
            for us to suffer any thing else, and to endure the impending <note type="footnote"> 2 Literally, " on a razor's edge." </note> <pb n="360"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[13-15."/> <lb/>
            servitude, be it what it may, than be oppressed by the present. <lb/>
            Come, then, let us no longer obey him." Thus they spoke, <lb/>
            and from that moment no one would obey ; but having pitch­ <lb/>
            ed tents on the island, they continued under the shade, and <lb/>
            would not go on board the ships, or perform their exercise. <lb/>
            13. The generals of the Samians observing what was passing <lb/>
            among the Ionians, and at the same time seeing great disorder <lb/>
            among them, thereupon accepted the proposal of Æaces, son <lb/>
            of Syloson, which he had before sent them at the desire of <lb/>
            the Persians, exhorting them to abandon the confederacy of <lb/>
            the lonians ; and moreover it was clearly impossible for them <lb/>
            to overcome the power of the king, because they were con­ <lb/>
            vinced, that if they should overcome Darius with his present <lb/>
            fleet, another five times as large would come against them. <lb/>
            Therefore laying hold of this pretext, as soon as they saw the <lb/>
            Ionians refusing to behave well, they deemed it for their ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to preserve their own buildings, sacred and profane. <lb/>
            This Æaces, from whom the Samians received the proposal, <lb/>
            was son of Syloson, son of Æaces ; and being tyrant of <lb/>
            Samos, had been deprived of his government by Aristagoras <lb/>
            the Milesian, as the other tyrants of Ionia.</p>
          <p>14. When therefore the Phœnicians sailed against them, the <lb/>
            Ionians also drew out their ships in line to oppose them ; but <lb/>
            when they came near and engaged each other, after that I am <lb/>
            unable to affirm with certainty who of the Ionians proved <lb/>
            themselves cowards, or brave men, in this sea-fight; for they <lb/>
            mutually accuse each other. The Samians however are said <lb/>
            at that moment to have hoisted sail, in pursuance of their <lb/>
            agreement with Æaces, and steered out of the line to Samos, <lb/>
            with the exception of eleven ships ; the captains of these <lb/>
            staid and fought, refusing to obey their commanders ; and for <lb/>
            this action the commonwealth of the Samians conferred upon <lb/>
            them the honour of having their names and ancestry engraved <lb/>
            on a column, as having proved themselves valiant men ; and <lb/>
            this column now stands in the forum. The Lesbians also, <lb/>
            seeing those stationed next them flee, did the same as the <lb/>
            Samians; and in like manner most of the Ionians followed <lb/>
            their example. 15. Of those that persisted in the battle, the <lb/>
            Chians were most roughly handled, as they displayed signal <lb/>
            proofs of valour, and would not act as cowards. They con­ <lb/>
            tributed, as has been before mentioned, one hundred ships, <pb n="361"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="18—19.] "/>and on board each of them, forty chosen citizens serving as <lb/>
            marines; and though they saw most of the confederates aban­ <lb/>
            doning the common cause, they disdained to follow the exam­ <lb/>
            ple of their treachery; but choosing rather to remain with the <lb/>
            few allies, they continued the fight, cutting through the ene­ <lb/>
            mies' line, until, after they had taken many of the enemies' <lb/>
            ships, they lost most of their own. The Chians then fled to <lb/>
            their own country with the remainder of their fleet. <lb/>
            16. Those Chians whose ships were disabled in the fight, <lb/>
            when they were pursued, took refuge in Mycale ; and having <lb/>
            run their ships aground, left them there, and marched over­ <lb/>
            land through the continent; but when the Chians on their <lb/>
            return entered the territory of Ephesus, and arrived near the <lb/>
            city by night, at a time when the women there were cele­ <lb/>
            brating the Thesmophoria; the Ephesians thereupon, not <lb/>
            having before heard how it had fared with the Chians, and <lb/>
            seeing an army enter their territory, thinking they were cer­ <lb/>
            tainly robbers, and were come to seize their women, rushed <lb/>
            out in a body, and slew the Chians. Such was the fate they <lb/>
            met with. 17. Dionysius the Phocæan, when he perceived <lb/>
            that the affairs of the Ionians were utterly ruined, having <lb/>
            taken three of the enemies' ships, sailed away, not indeed to <lb/>
            Phocæa, well knowing that it would be enslaved with the rest <lb/>
            of Ionia, but sailed directly, as he was, to Phoenicia ; and <lb/>
            there having disabled some merchant-men, and obtained great <lb/>
            wealth, he sailed to Sicily ; and sallying out from thence, he <lb/>
            established himself as a pirate, attaching none of the Grecians, <lb/>
            but only the Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians.</p>
          <p>18. The Persians, when they had conquered the Ionians in <lb/>
            the sea-fight, besieging Miletus both by land and sea, and un­ <lb/>
            dermining the walls, and bringing up all kinds of military en- - <lb/>
            gines against it, took it completely, in the sixth year after the <lb/>
            revolt of Aristagoras; and they reduced the city to slavery, so <lb/>
            that the event coincided with the oracle delivered concerning <lb/>
            Miletus. 19. For when the Argives consulted the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi respecting the preservation of their city, a double an­ <lb/>
            swer was given ; part concerning themselves, and the addition <lb/>
            the Pythian uttered concerning the Milesians. The part re­ <lb/>
            lating to the Argives I will mention when I come to that part <lb/>
            of the history ;3 the words she uttered relative to the Mile­ <lb/>
            sians, who were not present, were as follows: " Then Miletus. <note type="footnote"> 3 See chap. 77 </note> <pb n="362"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[20-22."/> <lb/>
            contriver of wicked deeds, thou shalt become a feast and a <lb/>
            rich gift to many: thy wives shall wash the feet of many <lb/>
            long-haired masters, and our temple at Didymi shall be tend­ <lb/>
            ed by others." These things befel the Milesians at that time ; <lb/>
            for most of the men were killed by the Persians, who wear <lb/>
            long hair; and their women and children were treated as <lb/>
            slaves; and the sacred enclosure at Didymi, both the temple <lb/>
            and the shrine, were pillaged and burnt. Of the riches in this <lb/>
            temple I have frequently made mention in other parts of my <lb/>
            history.4 20. Such of the Milesians as were taken alive, were <lb/>
            afterwards conveyed to Susa ; and king Darius, without hav­ <lb/>
            ing done them any other harm, settled them on that which is <lb/>
            called the Red Sea, in the city of Ampe, near which the Ti­ <lb/>
            gris, flowing by, falls into the sea. Of the Milesian territory, <lb/>
            the Persians themselves retained the parts round the city, and <lb/>
            the plain ; the mountainous parts they gave to the Carians <lb/>
            of Pedasus to occupy. 21. When the Milesians suffered <lb/>
            thus at the hands of the Persians, the Sybarites, who inhabit­ <lb/>
            ed Laos and Scydrus, having been deprived of their country, <lb/>
            did not show equal sympathy. For when Sybaris5 was taken <lb/>
            by the Crotonians, all the Milesians of every age shaved their <lb/>
            heads, and displayed marks of deep mourning ; for these two <lb/>
            cities had been more strictly united in friendship than any <lb/>
            others we are acquainted with. The Athenians behaved in a <lb/>
            very different manner ; for the Athenians made it evident that <lb/>
            they were excessively grieved at the capture of Miletus, both <lb/>
            in many other ways, and more particularly when Phrynichus <lb/>
            had composed a drama of the capture of Miletus, and repre­ <lb/>
            sented it, the whole theatre burst into tears, and fined him a <lb/>
            thousand drachms for renewing the memory of their domestic <lb/>
            .misfortunes ; and they gave order that thenceforth no one <lb/>
            should act this drama.</p>
          <p>22. Miletus therefore was stripped of its Milesian population <lb/>
            But the Samians who had property were by no means pleased <lb/>
            with what had been done by their generals in favour of the <lb/>
            Medes, and determined, on a consultation immediately after <lb/>
            the sea-fight, to sail away to a colony, before the tyrant Æaces <lb/>
            should arrive in their country, and not by remaining become <lb/>
            slaves to the Medes and Æaces. For the Zanclæans of Sicily, <lb/>
            at this very time, sending messengers to Ionia, invited the <lb/>
            Ionians to Cale Acte, wishing them to found a city of <note type="footnote"> 4 See B 1. 92, II. 159, and V. 30. </note><note type="footnote">5 See Book V chap 44 </note> <pb n="363"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="23-25.]"/> <lb/>
            Ionians there. This Cale Actc, as it is called, belongs to the <lb/>
            Sicilians, and is in that part of Sicily that faces the Tyr­ <lb/>
            rhenians. Accordingly, when they invited them, the Samians <lb/>
            alone of all the Ionians set out, and with them such Milesians <lb/>
            as had escaped by flight. 23. During this time, the following <lb/>
            incident occurred. The Samians, on their way to Sicily, <lb/>
            touched on the country of the Epizephyrian Locrians, and the <lb/>
            Zunclæans, both they and their king, whose name was Scythes, <lb/>
            were employed in the besieging of a Sicilian city, desiring to <lb/>
            take it: and Anaxilaus, tyrant of Rhegium, who was then at <lb/>
            variance with the Zanclæans, understanding this, held corre­ <lb/>
            spondence with the Samians, and persuaded them that it <lb/>
            would be well not to trouble themselves about Cale Acte, to <lb/>
            which they were sailing, but to seize the city of Zancle, which <lb/>
            was destitute of inhabitants. The Samians were persuaded, <lb/>
            and possessed themselves of Zancle, whereupon the Zanclaeans, <lb/>
            hearing that their city was occupied, went to recover it, and <lb/>
            called to their assistance Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, for he <lb/>
            was their ally. But when Hippocrates came with his army, <lb/>
            as if to assist them, he having thrown into chains Scythes, <lb/>
            king of the Zanclæans, who had already lost his city, and his <lb/>
            brother Pythogenes, sent them away to the city of Inycum : <lb/>
            after having conferred with the Samians, and given and re­ <lb/>
            ceived oaths, he betrayed the rest of the Zanclæans; and this <lb/>
            was the reward agreed upon by the Samians, that he should <lb/>
            have one half of the moveables and slaves in the city, and that <lb/>
            Hippocrates should have for his share all that was in the <lb/>
            country. Accordingly, having put in chains the greater part <lb/>
            of the Zanclaeans, he treated them as slaves ; and three hun­ <lb/>
            dred of the principal citizens he delivered to the Samians to <lb/>
            be put to death ; the Samians, however, would not do this. <lb/>
            24. Scythes, king of the Zanclaeans, made his escape from <lb/>
            Inycum to Himera, and from thence passed over into Asia, and <lb/>
            went up to king Darius. Darius considered him the most <lb/>
            just of all the men who had come up to him from Greece. <lb/>
            For having asked permission of the king, he went to Sicily, <lb/>
            and returned back from Sicily to the king, and at last, being <lb/>
            very rich, died among the Persians of old age. Thus the <lb/>
            Samians, being freed from the Medes, gained without toil the <lb/>
            very beautiful city of Zancle. 25. After the sea-fight which <lb/>
            took place off Miletus, the Phoenicians, by order of the Per- <pb n="364"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="126—28 "/>sians, conveyed Æaces, son of Syloson, to Samos, as one who <lb/>
            had deserved much at their hands and had performed great <lb/>
            services. The Samians were the only people of those that re­ <lb/>
            volted from Darius whose city and sacred buildings were not <lb/>
            burnt, on account of the defection of their ships in the sea- <lb/>
            fight. Miletus being taken, the Persians immediately got <lb/>
            possession of Caria ; some of the cities having submitted of <lb/>
            their own accord, and others they reduced by force. Now <lb/>
            these things happened thus.</p>
          <p>26. While Histiæus the Milesian was near Byzantium, in­ <lb/>
            tercepting the trading ships of the Ionians that sailed out of <lb/>
            the Pontus, news was brought him of what had taken place at <lb/>
            Miletus; he therefore intrusted his affairs on the Hellespont <lb/>
            to Bisaltes, son of Apollophanes, of Abydos ; and he himself, <lb/>
            having taken the Lesbians with him, sailed to Chios, and en­ <lb/>
            gaged with a garrison of Chians, that would not admit him, at <lb/>
            a place called Cceli in the Chian territory: and he killed great <lb/>
            numbers of them ; and the rest of the Chians, as they had been <lb/>
            much shattered by the sea-fight, Histiæus, with the Lesbians, <lb/>
            got the mastery of, setting out from Polichne of the Chians. <lb/>
            27. The deity is wont to give some previous warning when <lb/>
            any great calamities are about to befal any city or nation, and <lb/>
            before these misfortunes great warnings happened to the <lb/>
            Chians. For in the first place, when they sent to Delphi a <lb/>
            band of one hundred youths, two of them only returned home, <lb/>
            but the remaining ninety-eight a pestilence seized and carried <lb/>
            off: in the next place, about the same time, a little before the <lb/>
            sea-fight, a house in the city fell In upon some boys, as they <lb/>
            were learning to read, so that of one hundred and twenty boys <lb/>
            one only escaped. These warnings the deity showed them be­ <lb/>
            forehand. After this, the sea-fight following, threw the city <lb/>
            prostrate; and after the sea-fight Histiæus with the Lesbians <lb/>
            came upon them; and as the Chians had been much shattered, <lb/>
            he easily reduced them to subjection. 28. From thence His­ <lb/>
            tiæus proceeded to attack Thasus with a large body of Ionians <lb/>
            and Æolians ; and while he was besieging Thasus, news came <lb/>
            that the Phoenicians were sailing from Miletus against the rest <lb/>
            of Ionia. When he heard this, he left Thasus untaken, and <lb/>
            himself hastened to Lesbos with all his forces; and from Les­ <lb/>
            bos, because his army was suffering from want, he crossed tc <lb/>
            the opposite shore for the purpose of reaping the corn of <pb n="365"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="29—32.]"/> <lb/>
            Atarneus, and the plain of Caicus which belonged to the <lb/>
            Mysians. But Harpagus, a Persian, general of a considerable <lb/>
            army, happened to be in those parts ; he engaged with him <lb/>
            after his landing, took Histiæus himself prisoner, and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed the greater part of his army.</p>
          <p>29. Histiæus was thus taken prisoner. When the Greeks <lb/>
            were fighting with the Persians at Malen e in the district of <lb/>
            Atarneus, they maintained their ground for a long time, but <lb/>
            the cavalry at length coming up, fell upon the Greeks ; then <lb/>
            it was the work of the cavalry ; and when the Greeks had be­ <lb/>
            taken themselves to flight, Histiæus, hoping that he should <lb/>
            not be put to death by the king for his present offence, con­ <lb/>
            ceived such a desire of preserving his life, that when in his flight <lb/>
            he was overtaken by a Persian, and being overtaken was on <lb/>
            the point of being stabbed by him, he, speaking in the Persian <lb/>
            language, discovered himself to be Histiæus the Milesian. <lb/>
            30. Now if, when he was taken prisoner, he had been con­ <lb/>
            ducted to king Darius, in my opinion, he would have suffered <lb/>
            no punishment, and the king would have forgiven him his <lb/>
            fault. But now, for this very reason, and lest by escaping <lb/>
            he should again regain his influence with the king, Artapher­ <lb/>
            nes, governor of Sardis, and Harpagus, who received him as soon <lb/>
            as he was conducted to Sardis, impaled his body on the spot, <lb/>
            and having embalmed the head, sent it to Darius at Susa. Darius <lb/>
            having heard of this, and having blamed those that had done <lb/>
            it, because they had not brought him alive into his presence, <lb/>
            gave orders that, having washed and adorned the head of <lb/>
            Histiæus, they should inter it honourably, as the remains of a <lb/>
            man who had been a great benefactor to himself and the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. Such was the fate of Histiæus.</p>
          <p>31. The naval force of the Persians having wintered near <lb/>
            Miletus, when it set sail in the second year, easily subdued the <lb/>
            islands lying near the continent, Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos: <lb/>
            and when they took any one of these islands, the barbarians, <lb/>
            as they possessed themselves of each, netted the inhabitants. <lb/>
            They net them in this manner. Taking one another by the <lb/>
            hand, they extend from the northern to the southern sea, and <lb/>
            so march over the island, hunting out the inhabitants. They <lb/>
            also took the Ionian cities on the continent with the same ease; <lb/>
            but they did not net the inhabitants. for was impossible. <lb/>
            32. Then the Persian generals did not belie the threats which <pb n="366"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[33—35"/> <lb/>
            they had uttered against the Ionians, when arrayed against <lb/>
            them. For when they had made themselves masters of the <lb/>
            cities, they selected the handsomest youths, and castrated <lb/>
            them, and made them eunuchs instead of men, and the most <lb/>
            beautiful virgins they carried away to the king ; this they did, <lb/>
            and burnt the cities with the very temples. Thus the lonians <lb/>
            were for the third time reduced to slavery; first by the Lydi­ <lb/>
            ans, then twice successively by the Persians. 33. The naval <lb/>
            force departing from Ionia, reduced all the places on the left of <lb/>
            the Hellespont as one sails in; for the places on the right. <lb/>
            being on the continent, had already been subdued by the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. The following places on the Hellespont are in Europe ; <lb/>
            the Chersonese, in which are many cities, Perinthus, and the <lb/>
            fortified towns towards Thrace, and Selybrie, and Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium. The Byzantians, however, and the Chalcedonians on <lb/>
            the opposite side, did not wait the coming of the Phœnician <lb/>
            fleet; but having abandoned their country, went inwards to <lb/>
            the Euxine, and there founded the city of Mesambria. But <lb/>
            the Phoenicians, having burnt down the places above men­ <lb/>
            tioned, bent their course to Proconnesus, and Artace, and <lb/>
            having devoted these also to flames, sailed back again to the <lb/>
            Chersonese, for the purpose of destroying the rest of the cities, <lb/>
            which, when they passed near them before, they had not laid <lb/>
            waste. Against Cyzicus they did not sail at all, for the Cyzi­ <lb/>
            cenians had of their own accord submitted to the king before <lb/>
            the arrival of the Phœnicians, having capitulated with CEbares, <lb/>
            son of Megabazus, governor of Dascylium. All the other cities <lb/>
            of the Chersonese, except Cardia, the Phœnicians subdued.</p>
          <p>34. Till that time Miltiades, son of Cimon, son of Stesa­ <lb/>
            goras, was tyrant of these cities, Miltiades, son of Cypselus, <lb/>
            having formerly acquired this government in the following <lb/>
            manner. The Thracian Dolonci possessed this Chersonese; <lb/>
            these Dolonci then, being pressed in war by the Apsynthians, <lb/>
            sent their kings to Delphi to consult the oracle concerning the <lb/>
            war; the Pythian answered them, " that they should take that <lb/>
            man with them to their country to found a colony, who after <lb/>
            their departure from the temple should first offer them hospi­ <lb/>
            tality." Accordingly the Dolonci, going by the sacred way, went <lb/>
            through the territories of the Phocians and Bœotians, and when <lb/>
            no one invited them, turned out of the road towards Athens. 35. <lb/>
            At that time Pisistratus had the supreme power at Athens; but <pb n="367"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="36,37.]"/> <lb/>
            Miltiades, son of Cypselus, had considerable influence; he <lb/>
            was of a family that maintained horses for the chariot-races, <lb/>
            and was originally descended from Æacus and Ægina, but in <lb/>
            later times was an Athenian, Philæus, son of Ajax, having <lb/>
            been the first Athenian of that family. This Miltiades, being <lb/>
            seated in his own portico, and seeing the Dolonci passing by, <lb/>
            wearing a dress not belonging to the country, and carrying <lb/>
            iavelins, called out to them ; and upon their coming to him, <lb/>
            he offered them shelter and hospitality. They having ac­ <lb/>
            cepted his invitation, and having been entertained by him, <lb/>
            made known to him the whole oracle, and entreated him to <lb/>
            obey the deity. Their words persuaded Miltiades as soon as <lb/>
            he heard them, for he was troubled with the government of <lb/>
            Pisistratus, and desired to get out of his way. He therefore <lb/>
            immediately set out to Delphi to consult the oracle, whether <lb/>
            he should do that which the Dolonei requested of him. 36. <lb/>
            The Pythian having bid him do so, thereupon Miltiades, son <lb/>
            of Cypselus, who had formerly won the Olympic prize in the <lb/>
            chariot-race, taking with him all such Athenians as were will­ <lb/>
            ing to join in the expedition, set sail with the Dolonci, and <lb/>
            took possession of the country; and they who introduced him <lb/>
            appointed him tyrant. He, first of all, built a wall on the <lb/>
            isthmus of the Chersonese, from the city of Cardia to Pactya, <lb/>
            in order that the Apsynthians might not be able to injure <lb/>
            them by making incursions into their country. The width of <lb/>
            this isthmus is thirty-six stades; and from this isthmus the <lb/>
            whole Chersonese inwards, is four hundred and twenty stades <lb/>
            in length. 37. Miltiades, then, having built a wall across the <lb/>
            neck of the Chersonese, and by that means repelled the Ap­ <lb/>
            synthians, next made war upon the Lampsacenians; and the <lb/>
            Lampsacenians, having laid an ambush, took him prisoner. <lb/>
            But Miltiades was well known to Crœsus; Crœsus therefore, <lb/>
            having heard of this event, sent and commanded the Lampsa­ <lb/>
            cenians to release Miltiades; if not, he threatened that he <lb/>
            would destroy them like a pine-tree. The Lampsacenians <lb/>
            being in uncertainty in their interpretations, as to what was <lb/>
            the meaning of the saying with which Crœsus threatened <lb/>
            them, that he would destroy them like a pine-tree, at length, <lb/>
            with some difficulty, one of the elders, having discovered it, <lb/>
            told the real truth, that the pine alone of all trees, when cut <lb/>
            down, does not send forth any more shoots, but perishes en- <pb n="368"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[38—41."/> <lb/>
            tirely: whereupon the Lampsacenians, dreading the power of <lb/>
            Croesus, set Miltiades at liberty. 38. He accordingly escaped <lb/>
            by means of Crœsus, and afterwards died childless, having be­ <lb/>
            queathed the government and his property to Stesagoras, son <lb/>
            of Cimon, his brother by the same mother. And when he <lb/>
            was dead the Chersonesians sacrificed to him, as is usual to a <lb/>
            founder, and instituted equestrian and gymnastic exercises, in <lb/>
            which no Lampsacenian is permitted to contend. The war <lb/>
            with the Lampsacenians still continuing, it also betel Stesa­ <lb/>
            goras to die childless; being stricken on the head with an axe <lb/>
            in the prytaneum, by a man who in pretence was a deserter, <lb/>
            but was in fact an enemy, and that a very vehement one.</p>
          <p>39. Stesagoras having died in that manner, the Pisistra­ <lb/>
            tidæ thereupon sent Miltiades, son of Cimon, and brother of <lb/>
            Stesagoras who had died, with one ship to the Chersonese, to <lb/>
            assume the government; they had also treated him with kind­ <lb/>
            ness at Athens, as if they had not been parties to the death of <lb/>
            his father Cimon; the particulars of which I will relate in <lb/>
            another place.6 Miltiades having arrived in the Chersonese, <lb/>
            kept himself at home under colour of honouring the memory <lb/>
            of his brother Stesagoras; but the Chersonesians having heard <lb/>
            of this, the principal persons of all the cities assembled together <lb/>
            from every quarter, and having come in a body with the <lb/>
            intention of condoling with him, were all thrown into <lb/>
            chains by him. Thus Miltiades got possession of the Cher­ <lb/>
            sonese, maintaining five hundred auxiliaries, and married <lb/>
            Hegesipyle, daughter of Olorus, king of the Thracians. <lb/>
            40. This Miltiades, son of Cimon, had lately arrived in -the <lb/>
            Chersonese; and, after his arrival, other difficulties, greater <lb/>
            than the present,7 betel him. For in the third year before <lb/>
            these things, he fled from the Scythians; for the Scythian no­ <lb/>
            mades, having been provoked by king Darius, had assembled <lb/>
            their forces, and marched as far as this Chersonese: Miltiades, <lb/>
            not daring to wait their approach, fled from the Chersonese, <lb/>
            until the Scythians departed, and the Dolonci brought him <lb/>
            back again. These things happened in the third year before <lb/>
            the present affairs. 41. Miltiades, having heard that the <lb/>
            Phœnicians were at Tenedos, loaded five triremes with the <note type="footnote">6 See chap. 103. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 By the present difficulties are meant those which Herodotus had be­ <lb/>
            gun to relate in chapter 33 of this Book. </note> <pb n="369"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="42, 43.]"/> <lb/>
            property he had at hand, and sailed away for Athens ; and <lb/>
            when he had set out from the city of Cardia, he sailed through <lb/>
            the gulf of Melas, and as he was passing by the Chersonese, <lb/>
            the Phœnicians fell in with his ships. Now Miltiades himself <lb/>
            escaped with four of the ships to Imbrus, but the fifth the <lb/>
            Phoenicians pursued and took: of this ship, Metiochus the <lb/>
            eldest of the sons of Miltiades, not by the daughter of Olorus <lb/>
            the Thracian, but by another woman, happened to be com­ <lb/>
            mander, and him the Phœnicians took together with the ship. <lb/>
            When they heard that he was son of Miltiades, they took him <lb/>
            up to the king, thinking that they should obtain great favour <lb/>
            for themselves, because Miltiades had given an opinion to the <lb/>
            Ionians advising them to comply with the Scythians, when <lb/>
            the Scythians requested them to loose the bridge and return <lb/>
            to their own country. But Darius, when the Phoenicians had <lb/>
            taken Metiochus son of Miltiades up to him, did him no in­ <lb/>
            jury, but many favours ; for he gave him a house and estate <lb/>
            and a Persian wife, by whom he had children, who were <lb/>
            reckoned among the Persians. But Miltiades arrived at <lb/>
            Athens from Imbros.</p>
          <p>42. During this year nothing more was done by the Per­ <lb/>
            sians relative to the war with the Ionians: on the contrary, the <lb/>
            following things were done in this year which were advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to the Ionians. Artaphernes, governor of Sardis, <lb/>
            having sent for deputies from the cities, compelled the Ionians <lb/>
            to enter into engagements among themselves, that they would <lb/>
            submit to legal decisions, and not commit depredations one <lb/>
            upon another. This he compelled them to do, and having mea­ <lb/>
            sured their lands by parasangs, which name the Persians give <lb/>
            to thirty stades ; having measured them into these, he im­ <lb/>
            posed tributes on each, which have continued the same from <lb/>
            that time to the present, as they were imposed by Artapher­ <lb/>
            nes ; and they were imposed nearly at the same amount as <lb/>
            they had been before. These things then tended to peace. <lb/>
            43. In the beginning of the spring, the other generals having <lb/>
            been dismissed by the king, Mardonius, son of Gobryas, went <lb/>
            down to the coast, taking with him a very large land army, <lb/>
            and a numerous naval force : he was young in years, and had <lb/>
            lately married king Darius's daughter, Artazostra. Mardo­ <lb/>
            nius, leading this army, when he arrived in Cilicia, having <lb/>
            g ne in person on board ship, proceeded with the rest of the <note type="footnote">2 R </note> <pb n="370"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[44, 45."/> <lb/>
            fleet, but the other generals led the land army to the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont. When Mardonius, sailing by Asia, reached Ionia, <lb/>
            there he did a thing, which, when J mention it, will be <lb/>
            a matter of very great astonishment to those Grecians, who <lb/>
            cannot believe that Otanes, one of the seven Persians, <lb/>
            gave an opinion that it was right for the Persians to be <lb/>
            governed by a democracy; for Mardonius, having deposed the <lb/>
            tyrants of the Ionians, established democracies in the cities. <lb/>
            Having done this, he hastened to the Hellespont. And when <lb/>
            a vast body of ships and a numerous land army was assem­ <lb/>
            bled, having crossed the Hellespont in ships, they marched <lb/>
            through Europe, and directed their march against Eretria and <lb/>
            Athens. 44. These cities indeed were the pretext of the <lb/>
            expedition ; but purposing to subdue as many Grecian cities as <lb/>
            they could, in the first place they reduced the Thasians with <lb/>
            their fleet, who did not even raise a hand to resist them ; and <lb/>
            in the next place with their land forces they enslaved the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, in addition to those that were before subject to them ; <lb/>
            for all the nations on this side the Macedonians were already <lb/>
            under their power. Then crossing over from Thasus, they <lb/>
            coasted along the continent as far as Acanthus; and proceed­ <lb/>
            ing from Acanthus they endeavoured to double Mount Athos. <lb/>
            but a violent and irresistible north wind falling upon them <lb/>
            as they were sailing round, very roughly dealt with a great <lb/>
            number of the ships by driving them against Athos : for it is <lb/>
            said, that as many as three hundred ships were destroyed, and <lb/>
            upwards of twenty thousand men ; for, as this sea around <lb/>
            Athos abounds in monsters, some of them were seized and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by these monsters ; and others were dashed against <lb/>
            the rocks, others knew not how to swim and so perished, and <lb/>
            others from cold. Such, then, was the fate of the naval force. <lb/>
            45. Mardonius and the land forces, while encamped in Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, the Thracian Brygi attacked in the night; and the <lb/>
            Brygi slew many of them, and wounded Mardonius himself. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, even they did not escape slavery at the hands <lb/>
            of the Persians ; for Mardonius did not quit those parts be­ <lb/>
            fore he had reduced them to subjection. However, having <lb/>
            subdued them, he led his army back again, having suffered a <lb/>
            disaster with his land forces from the Brygi, and with his <lb/>
            navy a greater one near Athos. Accordingly this armament, <lb/>
            having met with such disgraceful reverses, retreated into Asis­ <pb n="371"/>
             </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="48—]"/>
          <p>46. In the second year after these events, the Thasians hav­ <lb/>
            ing been accused by their neighbours of designing a revolt, <lb/>
            Darius sent a messenger and commanded them to demolish <lb/>
            their walls, and to transport their ships to Abdera. For the <lb/>
            Thasians, having been besieged by Histiæus the Milesian, <lb/>
            and having large revenues, applied their wealth in building <lb/>
            ships of war, and fortifying their city with a stronger wall. <lb/>
            Their revenues arose both from the continent, and from their <lb/>
            mines : from the gold mines of Scapte-Hyle proceeded in all <lb/>
            eighty talents yearly, and from those in Thasus less indeed <lb/>
            than that amount, yet so much that, as they were exempt <lb/>
            from taxes on the produce of the soil, there came in to the <lb/>
            Thasians in all, from the continent and the mines, a revenue <lb/>
            of two hundred talents yearly ; and when the greatest quan­ <lb/>
            tity came in, three hundred talents. 47. I myself have seen <lb/>
            these mines ; and by far the most wonderful of them are those <lb/>
            which the Phoenicians discovered, who with Thasus colonized <lb/>
            this island, which on that occasion took its name from this <lb/>
            Thasus the Phoenician. These Phœnician mines are in that <lb/>
            part of Thasus between a place called Ænyra, and Cœnyra, <lb/>
            opposite Samothrace : a large mountain has been thrown up­ <lb/>
            side down in the search. This, then, is of such a description. <lb/>
            The Thasians, in obedience to the king, both demolished their <lb/>
            walls, and transported all their ships to Abdera.</p>
          <p>48. After this, Darius made trial of what were the intentions <lb/>
            of the Greeks, whether to make war with him or to deliver <lb/>
            themselves up. He therefore despatched heralds, appointing <lb/>
            different persons to go to different parts throughout Greece, with <lb/>
            orders to demand earth and water for the king. These accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he sent to Greece ; and despatched other heralds to the <lb/>
            tributary cities on the coast, with orders to build ships of war <lb/>
            and transports for horses. 49. They then set about prepar­ <lb/>
            ing these things; and to the heralds who came to Greece many <lb/>
            of the inhabitants of the continent gave what the Persian <lb/>
            demanded, as did all the islanders to whom they came and <lb/>
            made the demand. Indeed the other islanders gave earth and <lb/>
            water to Darius, and moreover the Æginetæ : but when they <lb/>
            had done so, the Athenians forthwith threatened them, think­ <lb/>
            ing that the Æginetæ had given earth and water out of ill <lb/>
            will towards themselves, in order that they might make war <lb/>
            on them in conjunction with the Persian *they therefore <note type="footnote">2B2</note> <pb n="372"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[50 -52."/> <lb/>
            gladly laid hold of the pretext, and going to Sparta, 'accused <lb/>
            the Æginetæ of what they had done, as betraying Greece. <lb/>
            50. On this accusation Cleomenes, son of Anaxandrides, who <lb/>
            was then king of the Spartans, crossed over to Ægina, <lb/>
            intending to seize the most culpable of the Æginetæ ; but <lb/>
            when he attempted to seize them, others of the Æginetæ <lb/>
            opposed him, and amongst them especially Crius, son of Poly­ <lb/>
            critus, who said, " that he should not carry off any one of the <lb/>
            Æginetæ with impunity ; for that he was acting as he did <lb/>
            without the consent of the commonwealth of the Spartans, <lb/>
            being persuaded by bribes from the Athenians ; and that if <lb/>
            it had not been so, he would have come with the other king <lb/>
            to seize them." He said this in consequence of a message from <lb/>
            Demaratus. But Cleomenes, being driven from Ægina, ask­ <lb/>
            ed Crius what his name was ; and he told him the truth ; <lb/>
            whereupon Cleomenes said to him, "Now then tip your <lb/>
            horns with brass, 0 Crius,8 as you will have to contend with <lb/>
            great misfortunes." 51. Meanwhile Demaratus, son of Aris­ <lb/>
            ton, who was likewise king of the Spartans, but of an inferior <lb/>
            family, remaining in Sparta, aspersed the conduct of Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes : he was in no other respect inferior, for they were <lb/>
            sprung from the same origin, but somehow the family of <lb/>
            Eurysthenes was more honoured, on account of seniority.</p>
          <p>52. For the Lacedæmonians, agreeing with none of the <lb/>
            poets, affirm, that Aristodemus himself, son of Aristomachus, <lb/>
            son of Cleodæus, son of Hyllus, being king, brought them to <lb/>
            the country which they now inhabit, and not the sons of <lb/>
            Aristodemus. And that after no long time Aristodemus's <lb/>
            wife, whose name was Argia, brought forth: they say that <lb/>
            she was daughter of Autesion, son of Tisamenes, son of Ther­ <lb/>
            sander, son of Polynices ; and that she brought twins ; and <lb/>
            that Aristodemus, having looked on the children, died of <lb/>
            disease : that the Lacedæmonians of that day resolved, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to custom, to make the eldest of the children king ; but <lb/>
            they knew not which to choose, since they were alike, and of <lb/>
            equal size. Being unable to determine, they then, or perhaps <lb/>
            before, asked the mother; she replied, " that she herself was <lb/>
            unable to distinguish:" she said this, although she knew very <lb/>
            well, but was desirous, if it were possible, that both should be <lb/>
            made kings That the Lacedæmonians were consequently in <note type="footnote">8Oritis siginfies " a <unclear>ram</unclear>." </note> <pb n="373"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="53, 54.] "/>doubt, and being in doubt, sent to Delphi, to inquire of the <lb/>
            oracle what they should do in the matter. They add, that the <lb/>
            Pythian bade them consider both the children as kings ; but to <lb/>
            honour the eldest most: this answer the Pythian gave them ; <lb/>
            but the Lacedæmonians, being still in doubt how they should <lb/>
            discover the eldest of them, a Messenian, whose name was <lb/>
            Panites, made a suggestion to them : this Panites made the <lb/>
            following suggestion to the Lacedæmonians, to observe which <lb/>
            of the two children the mother would wash and feed first; and <lb/>
            if she should be found constantly doing the same, they would <lb/>
            then have all they were seeking for and desired to know; but <lb/>
            if she should vary, attending to them interchangeably, it would <lb/>
            be evident to them that she knew no more than they did; and <lb/>
            then they must have recourse to some other expedient. There­ <lb/>
            upon the Spartans, in pursuance of the suggestion of the Mes­ <lb/>
            senian, having watched the mother of Aristodemus's children, <lb/>
            discovered that she constantly gave one the preference both in <lb/>
            feeding and washing, she not knowing why she was watched. <lb/>
            Therefore considering that the child which was honoured by <lb/>
            its mother was the eldest, they educated it in the palace; <lb/>
            and to him the name of Eurysthenes was given, and to the <lb/>
            younger, Procles. They say that both these, though brothers, <lb/>
            when they had reached manhood, were at variance with each <lb/>
            other throughout the whole course of their lives ; and that <lb/>
            their descendants continued to be so. 53. The Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            alone of the Grecians give this account: but I now describe <lb/>
            these things in the way they are told by the rest of the <lb/>
            Grecians. For they say that these kings of the Dorians up <lb/>
            to Perseus, son of Danae, the deity being omitted, are rightly <lb/>
            enumerated by the Greeks, and are proved to have been <lb/>
            Greeks; for even at that time they were ranked among the <lb/>
            Greeks : I have said, up to Perseus, for this reason, and have <lb/>
            not carried it any higher, because no surname of any mortal <lb/>
            father is attributed to Perseus, as Amphitryon to Hercules. <lb/>
            I have therefore with good reason, and correctly, said up to <lb/>
            Perseus ; but if we reckon their progenitors upwards from <lb/>
            Danae, daughter of Acrisius, the leaders of the Dorians will <lb/>
            prove to have been originally Egyptians. Such is the genea­ <lb/>
            logy according to the account of the Greeks. 54. But as the <lb/>
            account of the Persians is given, Perseus himself, being an <lb/>
            Assyrian, became a Greek, though the ancestors of Perseus <pb n="374"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[55-57."/> <lb/>
            had not been so ; but that the progenitors of Acrisius, being <lb/>
            in no way related to Perseus, were Egyptians, as the Greeks <lb/>
            also say. 55. Let this then suffice for this subject. But why, <lb/>
            being Egyptians, and by what exploits, they obtained the <lb/>
            sovereignty of the Dorians, I will omit to mention, as others <lb/>
            have spoken of these matters. But such particulars as others <lb/>
            have not taken in hand, of these I will make mention.</p>
          <p>56. The Spartans have given the following privileges to <lb/>
            their kings: two priesthoods, that of the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            Jupiter, and that of the Celestial Jupiter; and to levy war <lb/>
            against whatever country they please; and no one of the <lb/>
            Spartans may impede this, otherwise he falls under a curse: <lb/>
            when they march out to war, the kings go first, and retire <lb/>
            last; and a hundred chosen men guard them in the field: <lb/>
            during the expeditions, they sacrifice as many cattle as they <lb/>
            please, and take as their own share the skins and chines of all <lb/>
            the victims. These are their privileges in time of war. 57. <lb/>
            The others, those during peace, have been given them as <lb/>
            follows. If any one make a public sacrifice the kings sit first <lb/>
            at the feast, and are first served, each receiving double of <lb/>
            whatever is given to the other guests. They have the right <lb/>
            of beginning the libations, and are entitled to the skins of the <lb/>
            cattle that are sacrificed. At every new moon, and on the <lb/>
            seventh day of the current month, a perfect victim is presented <lb/>
            to each of them, at the public charge, for the temple of <lb/>
            Apollo; and a medimnus of meal, and a Laconian quart of <lb/>
            wine. At all public games they have seats appointed by way <lb/>
            of distinction; and it is their prerogative to appoint such <lb/>
            citizens as they please to be Proxeni;9 and also to choose <lb/>
            each two Pythii. The Pythii are persons who are sent to <lb/>
            consult the oracle at Delphi, and are maintained with the <lb/>
            kings at the public charge. When the kings do not come to <lb/>
            the banquet, two chœnices of flour and a cotyle of wine are <lb/>
            sent home to each of them; but when they are present, a <lb/>
            double portion of every thing is given them; and when in­ <lb/>
            vited to a banquet by private persons, they are honoured in <lb/>
            the same manner. They have the keeping of the oracles that <lb/>
            are pronounced, but the Pythii are also privy to them. The <lb/>
            kings alone have to determine the following matters only: <lb/>
            with respect to a virgin heiress, who is to marry her, if her <note type="footnote"> 9 Officers appointed to receive and entertain foreign ambassadors </note> <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="58—00.]"/> <lb/>
            father has not betrothed her; and with respect to the public <lb/>
            highways; and if any one desires to adopt a son, it must be <lb/>
            done in presence of the kings. They assist at the deliberations <lb/>
            of the senators, who are twenty-eight in number; and if they <lb/>
            do not attend, those of the senators who are most nearly con­ <lb/>
            nected with them enjoy the privileges of the kings, giving <lb/>
            two votes, and a third, their own. 58. These privileges are <lb/>
            given to the kings by the commonwealth of the Spartans dur <lb/>
            ing life ; and when they die, the following. Horsemen an­ <lb/>
            nounce through all Laconia what has happened; and women, <lb/>
            going through the city, beat a cauldron ; when this accord­ <lb/>
            ingly is done, it is necessary for two free people of each <lb/>
            house, a man and a woman, to make themselves squalid in <lb/>
            token of grief; and if they neglect to do so, heavy fines are <lb/>
            imposed on them. The Lacedæmonians have the same custom <lb/>
            with regard to the deaths of their kings, as the barbarians in <lb/>
            Asia ; for most of the barbarians observe the same custom <lb/>
            with respect to the deaths of their kings. For when a king of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians dies, it is required that from the whole <lb/>
            territory of Lacedæmon, besides the Spartans, a certain <lb/>
            number of the neighbouring inhabitants should of necessity <lb/>
            attend the funeral: when accordingly many thousands of <lb/>
            these, and of the Helots and of the Spartans themselves, have <lb/>
            assembled together in one place, they promiscuously with the <lb/>
            women strike their foreheads vehemently, and give themselves <lb/>
            up to unbounded lamentation, affirming that the king who <lb/>
            died last was the best they ever had. Should one of their <lb/>
            kings die in war, having prepared his effigy, they expose it to <lb/>
            public view on a couch richly ornamented; and when they <lb/>
            have buried him, no assembly takes place for ten days, nor is <lb/>
            a meeting held for the election of magistrates, but they mourn <lb/>
            during those days. 59. They also resemble the Persians <lb/>
            in this other respect: when on the death of a king another <lb/>
            king is appointed, he, on his accession, releases whatever debts <lb/>
            may be due from any Spartan to the king or the public ; and so <lb/>
            among the Persians, a newly-appointed king remits to all the <lb/>
            cities the arrears of tribute then due. 60. In this respect also <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians resemble the Egyptians: their heralds, mu­ <lb/>
            sicians, and cooks, succeed to their fathers' professions; so that <lb/>
            a musician is son of a musician, a cook of a cook, and a herald <lb/>
            of a herald; nor do others on account of the clearness of their <pb n="376"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[61, 62."/> <lb/>
            voice apply themselves to this profession and exclude others; <lb/>
            but they continue to practise it after their fathers. These <lb/>
            things, then, are so.</p>
          <p>61. At that time, <unclear>therefore</unclear>. while Cleomenes was at Ægina, <lb/>
            and cc -operating for the common good of Greece, Demaratus <lb/>
            accused him; not so much caring for the Æginetæ, as moved <lb/>
            by envy and hatred. But Cleomenes, having returned from <lb/>
            Ægina, formed a plan to deprive Demaratus of the sovereignty, <lb/>
            getting a handle against him by means of the following cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance. When Ariston reigned in Sparta, and had married <lb/>
            two wives, he had no children ; and as he did not acknowledge <lb/>
            himself to be the cause of this, he married a third wife; and <lb/>
            he married her in this manner. He had a friend, who was a <lb/>
            Spartan, to whom he was more attached than to any other of <lb/>
            the citizens. The wife of this man happened to be by far the <lb/>
            most beautiful of all the women in Sparta, and this moreover, <lb/>
            having become the most beautiful from being the most ugly. <lb/>
            For her nurse perceiving that she was misshapen, and know <lb/>
            ing her to be the daughter of opulent persons, and deformed, <lb/>
            and seeing moreover that her parents considered her form a <lb/>
            great misfortune, considering these several circumstances, de­ <lb/>
            vised the following plan. She carried her every day to the <lb/>
            temple of Helen, which is in the place called Therapne, above <lb/>
            the temple of Phœbus. When the nurse brought the child <lb/>
            there, she stood before the image, and entreated the goddess <lb/>
            to free the child from its deformity. And it is related, that <lb/>
            one day as the nurse was going out of the temple, a woman <lb/>
            appeared to her, and having appeared, asked what she was <lb/>
            carrying in her arms; and she answered, that she was carry­ <lb/>
            ing an infant; whereupon she bid her show it to her, but the <lb/>
            nurse refused, for she had been forbidden by the parents to <lb/>
            show the child to any one; the woman however urged her by <lb/>
            all means to show it to her, and the nurse, seeing that the <lb/>
            woman was so very anxious to see the child, at length showed <lb/>
            it; upon which she, stroking the head of the child with her <lb/>
            hands, said that she would surpass all the women of Sparta in <lb/>
            beauty; and from that day her appearance began to change. <lb/>
            When she reached the age for marriage, Agetus, son of Alci­ <lb/>
            des, married her; this, then, was the friend of Ariston. <lb/>
            62. Now love for this woman excited Ariston ; he therefore <lb/>
            bad recourse to the following stratagem. He promised he <pb n="377"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="63—65.]"/> <lb/>
            would give his friend, whose wife this woman was, a present <lb/>
            of any one thing he should choose out of all his possessions, <lb/>
            and required his friend in return to do the like to him. He, <lb/>
            having no apprehension on account of his wife, seeing that <lb/>
            Ariston already had a wife, assented to the proposal; and <lb/>
            they imposed oaths on each other on these terms. According­ <lb/>
            ly Ariston himself gave the thing, whatever it was, which <lb/>
            Agetus chose out of all his treasures ; and himself claiming to <lb/>
            obtain the same compliance from him, thereupon attempted to <lb/>
            carry off his wife with him. Agetus said that he had assent­ <lb/>
            ed to any thing but this only ; nevertheless, being compelled <lb/>
            by his oatn, and circumvented by deceit, he suffered him to <lb/>
            take her away with him. 63. Thus, then, Ariston took to <lb/>
            himself a third wife, having put away the second. But <lb/>
            in too short a time, and before she had completed her ten <lb/>
            months, this woman bore Demaratus ; and as he was sitting <lb/>
            on the bench with the Ephori, one of his servants announced <lb/>
            to him that a son was born to him ; but he, knowing the time <lb/>
            at which he married the woman, and reckoning the months on <lb/>
            his fingers, said with an oath, "It cannot be mine." This <lb/>
            the Ephori heard. However, at the time, they took no no­ <lb/>
            tice. The child grew up, and Ariston repented of what he <unclear>ha</unclear> <lb/>
            said, for he was fully persuaded that Demaratus was his son <lb/>
            He gave him the name of Demaratus for this reason ; before <lb/>
            this the Spartans had made public supplications, that Ariston, <lb/>
            whom they esteemed the most illustrious of all the kings that <lb/>
            had ever reigned in Sparta, might have a son. For this rea­ <lb/>
            son the name of Demaratus1 was given to him. 64. In pro­ <lb/>
            cess of time Ariston died, and Demaratus obtained the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty. But it was fated, as it appears, that these things, <lb/>
            when made known, should occasion the deposition of Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus from the sovereignty, for Demaratus had incurred the <lb/>
            hatred of Cleomenes, because he had before led away the army <lb/>
            from Eleusis,2 and now more particularly when Cleomenes had <lb/>
            crossed over against those Æginetæ, who were inclined to <lb/>
            Medism. 65. Cleomenes then, being eager to avenge himself <lb/>
            made a compact with Leutychides, son of Menares, son of <lb/>
            Agis, who was of the same family with Demaratus, on con­ <lb/>
            dition, that if he should make him king instead of Demaratua, <note type="footnote"> I Demaratus means " granted to the prayers of the people." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See B. V. chap 75. </note> <pb n="378"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[66. 67"/> <lb/>
            he should accompany him against the Æginetæ. Leutychides <lb/>
            had become an enemy to Demaratus, chiefly for this reason. <lb/>
            When Leutychides was affianced to Percalus, daughter of <lb/>
            Chilon, son of Demarmenes, Demaratus, having plotted <lb/>
            against him, disappointed Leutychides of his marriage ; hav­ <lb/>
            ing himself anticipated him by seizing Percalus and retaining <lb/>
            her as his wife. In this manner the enmity of Leutychides to <lb/>
            Demaratus originated, and now, at the instigation of Cleomenes, <lb/>
            Leutychides made oath against Demaratus, affirming that he <lb/>
            did not legitimately reign over the Spartans, not being the son <lb/>
            of Ariston ;" and after making oath against him, he prosecuted <lb/>
            him, recalling the words which Ariston spoke, when the serv­ <lb/>
            ant announced that a son was born to him, whereupon, he, <lb/>
            reckoning the months, denied with an oath, saying, " that it <lb/>
            was not his." Leutychides, insisting on this declaration, main­ <lb/>
            tained that Demaratus was neither the son of Ariston, nor <lb/>
            rightful king of Sparta; and he adduced as witnesses those <lb/>
            Ephori, who were then sitting by the king, and heard these <lb/>
            words of Ariston. 66. At length, the matter coming to a <lb/>
            trial,3 the Spartans determined to inquire of the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi, "whether Demaratus was the son of Ariston." But <lb/>
            the matter being referred to the Pythian at the instance of <lb/>
            Cleomenes, Cleomenes thereupon gained over one Cobon, son <lb/>
            of Aristophantus, a man of very great influence at Delphi: <lb/>
            and Cobon prevailed with Perialla the prophetess to say what <lb/>
            Cleomenes wished to be said. The Pythian accordingly, when <lb/>
            the persons sent to consult the oracle made the inquiry, de­ <lb/>
            cided that Demaratus was not the son of Ariston. In after <lb/>
            time this came to be known, and Cobon fled from Delphi, and <lb/>
            Perialla the prophetess was deposed from her office.</p>
          <p>67. Thus, then, it happened with respect to the deposition of <lb/>
            Demaratus from the sovereignty. But Demaratus fled from <lb/>
            Sparta to the Modes on account of the following insult. After <lb/>
            his deposition from the sovereignty, he was chosen to and held <lb/>
            the office of magistrate. The Gymnopædiæ4 were being cele­ <lb/>
            brated ; and, when Demaratus was looking on, Leutychides, <lb/>
            who had been appointed king in his room, sent a servant and <note type="footnote"> 3 Baehr has pointed out the proper meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεῖκος</foreign> in this <lb/>
            passage. </note><note type="footnote"> * An annual festival at Sparta, at which boys danced naked, and per­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="68, 69.]"/> <lb/>
            asked him, by way of ridicule and mockery, " what kind of <lb/>
            thing it was to be a magistrate after having been a king ?*" <lb/>
            But he, being vexed with the question, answered, "that he <lb/>
            indeed had tried both, but Leutychides had not; however, <lb/>
            that this question would be the commencement either of infi­ <lb/>
            nite calamity or infinite prosperity to the Lacedæmonians." <lb/>
            Having spoken thus and covered his face, he went out of the <lb/>
            theatre to his own house ; and having immediately made pre­ <lb/>
            paration, he sacrificed an ox to Jupiter, and having sacrificed,. <lb/>
            called for his mother. 68. When his mother came, he placed <lb/>
            part of the entrails in her hands, and supplicated her, speak­ <lb/>
            ing as follows : " Mother, I beseech you, calling to witness <lb/>
            both the rest of the gods, and this Hercæan Jupiter, to tell me <lb/>
            the truth, who is in reality my father. For Leutychides af­ <lb/>
            firmed on the trial, that you being pregnant by your former <lb/>
            husband, so came to Ariston ; others tell even a more idle <lb/>
            story, and say, you kept company with one of the servants, a <lb/>
            feeder of asses, and that I am his son. I adjure you therefore <lb/>
            by the gods to speak the truth: for even if you have done any <lb/>
            thing of what is said, you have not done it alone, but with many <lb/>
            others; moreover, the report is common in Sparta, that Ariston <lb/>
            was incapable of begetting children, for that otherwise his form • <lb/>
            er wives would have had offspring." Thus he spoke. 69. She <lb/>
            answered as follows : " Son, since you implore me with sup­ <lb/>
            plications to speak the truth, the whole truth shall be told you. <lb/>
            When Ariston had taken me to his own house, on the third <lb/>
            night from the first, a spectre resembling Ariston came to me ; <lb/>
            and having lain with me, put on me a crown that it had: it de­ <lb/>
            parted, and afterwards Ariston came; but when he saw me <lb/>
            with the crown, he asked who it was that gave it me. I said, <lb/>
            he did; but he would not admit it; whereupon I took an oath. <lb/>
            and said that he did not well to deny it, for that having come <lb/>
            shortly before and lain with me, he had given me the crown. <lb/>
            Ariston, seeing that I affirmed with an oath, discovered that <lb/>
            the event was superhuman : and in the first place, the crown <lb/>
            proved to have come from the shrine situate near the palace <lb/>
            gates, which they call Astrabacus's ; and in the next place, <lb/>
            the seers pronounced that it was the hero himself. Thus, <lb/>
            then, my son, you have all that you wish to know : for you <lb/>
            are sprung either from that hero, and the hero Astrabacus is <lb/>
            your father, or Ariston ; for I conceived you in that night. <pb n="380"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="70-72."/> <lb/>
            As to that with which your enemies most violently attack you, <lb/>
            affirming that Ariston himself, when your birth was an­ <lb/>
            nounced to him, in the presence of many persons, denied you <lb/>
            were his, for that the time, ten months, had not yet elapsed ; <lb/>
            he threw out those words through ignorance of such matters , <lb/>
            for women bring forth at nine months and seven, and all do <lb/>
            not complete ten months. But I bore you, my son, at seven <lb/>
            months: and Ariston himself knew, not long after, that he had <lb/>
            uttered those words thoughtlessly. Do not listen to any other <lb/>
            stories respecting your birth ; for you have heard the whole <lb/>
            truth. And from feeders of asses may their wives bring forth <lb/>
            children to Leutychides, and such as spread such reports." <lb/>
            Thus she spoke. 70. But he, having learnt what he wished, <lb/>
            and having taken provisions for his journey, proceeded to <lb/>
            Elis ; pretending that he was going to Delphi, to consult the <lb/>
            oracle. But the Lacedæmonians, suspecting that he was at­ <lb/>
            tempting to make his escape, pursued him: and by some means <lb/>
            Demaratus got the start of them, crossing over from Elis to Za­ <lb/>
            cynthus: but the Lacedæmonians, having crossed over after him, <lb/>
            laid hands on him, and took away his attendants. But after­ <lb/>
            wards, for the Zacynthians would not give him up, he crossed <lb/>
            over from thence to Asia, to king Darius ; and he received <lb/>
            him honourably, and gave him land and cities. Thus Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus arrived in Asia, having met with such fortune; being <lb/>
            renowned in many other respects among the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            both by his deeds and counsels, and, moreover, having obtain­ <lb/>
            ed an Olympic victory with a four-horse chariot, he procured <lb/>
            this honour for his native city, being the only one of all the <lb/>
            kings of Sparta who had done this.</p>
          <p>71. Leutychides, son of Menares, when Demaratus was de­ <lb/>
            posed, succeeded to the kingdom. A son was born to him <lb/>
            named Zeuxidemus, whom some of the Spartans called Cynis­ <lb/>
            cus. This Zeuxidemus was never king of Sparta; for he <lb/>
            died before Leutychides, leaving a son, Archidamus. Leuty­ <lb/>
            chides being bereaved of Zeuxidemus, married a second wife, <lb/>
            Eurydame, who was sister of Menius, and daughter of <lb/>
            Diactorides ; by her he had no male offspring, but a daughter, <lb/>
            Lampito; her, Archidamus son of Zeuxidemus married, <lb/>
            Leutychides having bestowed her upon him. 72. However, <lb/>
            Leutychides did not grow old in Sparta, but made the follow­ <lb/>
            ing reparation a.-. it were to Demaratus. He commanded the <lb/>
            j <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="73—75.]"/> <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian army in Thessaly, and when it was in <unclear>his</unclear> <lb/>
            power to have reduced the whole country to subjection, he ac­ <lb/>
            cepted a large sum of money as a bribe ; and being caught in <lb/>
            the very act, sitting there in the camp on a sleeve full of sil­ <lb/>
            ver, he was banished from Sparta, having been brought be­ <lb/>
            fore a court of justice. His house was rased, and he fled to <lb/>
            Tegea, where he died. These events happened some time <lb/>
            after.</p>
          <p>73. When Cleomenes had succeeded in his design against <lb/>
            Demaratus, he immediately took Leutychides with him, and <lb/>
            went'against the Æginetæ, bearing a deep grudge against <lb/>
            them on account of the insult he had received. The Æginetæ <lb/>
            accordingly thought proper to make no further resistance ; as <lb/>
            both kings were coming against them, they therefore, having <lb/>
            selected ten of the Æginetæ, the most eminent both in wealth <lb/>
            and birth, and amongst them Crius, son of Polycritus, and <lb/>
            Casambus, son of Aristocrates, who had the chief authority, <lb/>
            and having carried them away to Attica, they delivered them <lb/>
            as a pledge to the Athenians, the greatest enemies of the <lb/>
            Æginetæ. 74. After this, fear of the Spartans seized upon <lb/>
            Cleomenes, when discovered to have employed wicked arti­ <lb/>
            fices against Demaratus, and he withdrew secretly to Thessaly; <lb/>
            and from thence passing into Arcadia, he began to form new <lb/>
            designs, rousing the Arcadians against Sparta, and engaging <lb/>
            them both by other oaths to follow him wherever he should <lb/>
            lead them; and, moreover, he was desirous of leading the <lb/>
            chief men of the Arcadians to the city of Nonacris, to make <lb/>
            them swear by the water of the Styx, for in that city the <lb/>
            water of the Styx is by the Arcadians said to be. And it is <lb/>
            of the following description: a small quantity of water is seen <lb/>
            and drops from a rock into a hollow, and a fence of masonry <lb/>
            surrounds the hollow. Nonacris, in which this fountain <lb/>
            happens to be, is a city of Arcadia near Pheneum. 75. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, being informed that Cleomenes was <lb/>
            acting thus, through fear, restored him to Sparta on the <lb/>
            same terms as those on which he had reigned before. But <lb/>
            as soon as he had returned, madness seized him, though <lb/>
            he was before somewhat crazed ; for whenever he met any <lb/>
            one of the Spartans, he used to thrust the sceptre into his <lb/>
            face. When he was found to do this, and to be clearly out of <lb/>
            his mind, his relations confined him in wooden fetters: but he <pb n="382"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[76, 77,"/> <lb/>
            being so confined; and seeing a single guard left alone by the <lb/>
            rest, asked for a knife; and when the guard at first refused to <lb/>
            give it, he threatened what he would do to him hereafter; till at <lb/>
            last the guard, fearing his threats, for he was one of his Helots, <lb/>
            gave him a knife. Then Cleomenes, having got hold of the <lb/>
            blade, began to mutilate himself from the legs, for having cut the <lb/>
            flesh lengthwise, he proceeded from the legs to the thighs ; and <lb/>
            from the thighs to the hips and loins ; at last he came to the <lb/>
            belly, and having gashed this, in that manner he died: as <lb/>
            most of the Grecians say, because he persuaded the Pythian <lb/>
            to say what she did concerning Demaratus ; but as the <lb/>
            Athenians alone say, because when he invaded Eleusis he cut <lb/>
            down the grove of the goddesses ;5 but as the Argives say, <lb/>
            because he, having called out those Argives who had fled from <lb/>
            battle, from their sacred precinct of Argus, he massacred <lb/>
            them, and holding the grove itself in contempt, set it on fire.</p>
          <p>76. For when Cleomenes consulted the oracle at Delphi, an <lb/>
            answer was given him that he should take Argos. When <lb/>
            therefore, leading the Spartans, he arrived at the liver Era­ <lb/>
            sinus, which is said to flow from the Stymphalian lake, for <lb/>
            that this lake, discharging itself into an unseen chasm, re­ <lb/>
            appears in Argos, and from that place this water is, by the <lb/>
            Argives, called Erasinus : Cleomenes therefore, having ar­ <lb/>
            rived at this river, offered sacrifice to it; but as the victims by <lb/>
            no means gave a favourable omen for his passing over, he said, <lb/>
            that he admired the Erasinus for not betraying its people, yet <lb/>
            the Argives should not even thus escape with impunity. After <lb/>
            this, having retired, he marched his forces to Thyrea; and hav­ <lb/>
            ing sacrificed a bull to the sea, he conveyed them in ships to the <lb/>
            Tirynthian territory and Nauplia. 77. The Argives, being in­ <lb/>
            formed of this, went out to meet them on the coast: and when <lb/>
            they were near Tiryns, at that place to which the name of Sepia <lb/>
            is given, they encamped opposite the Lacedæmonians, leaving <lb/>
            no great space between the two armies. There, then, they were <lb/>
            not afraid of coming to a pitched battle, but lest they should <lb/>
            be taken by stratagem; for it was to this event the ora­ <lb/>
            cle had reference, which the Pythian pronounced in common <lb/>
            to them and the Milesians,6 running thus: " When the female, <lb/>
            having conquered the male, shall drive him out, and obtain <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Ceres and Proserpine. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> For the part of the oracle relating to the Milesians. see chap. 19 </note> <pb n="383"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="78-81.]"/> <lb/>
            glory among the Argives, then shall she make many of the <lb/>
            Argive women rend their garments; so that one of future <lb/>
            generations shall say, a terrible triple-coiled serpent has <lb/>
            perished, overcome by the spear." All these things con­ <lb/>
            curring, spread alarm among the Argives, therefore they re­ <lb/>
            solved to avail themselves of the herald of the enemy; and <lb/>
            having so resolved, they did as follows: when the Spartan <lb/>
            herald gave any signal to the Lacedæmonians, the Argives <lb/>
            did the same. 78. Cleomenes, having observed that the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives did whatever his herald gave the signal for, ordered his <lb/>
            troops, when the herald should give the signal for going to <lb/>
            dinner, then to seize their arms, and advance against the <lb/>
            Argives. This, accordingly, was accomplished by the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, for they fell upon the Argives as they were taking <lb/>
            their dinner, according to the herald's signal; and they killed <lb/>
            many of them, and a far greater number, who had taken <lb/>
            refuge in the grove of Argus, they surrounded and kept watch <lb/>
            over. 79. Cleomenes then adopted the following course: <lb/>
            having some deserters with him, and having received inform­ <lb/>
            ation from them, he sent a herald and called them out, sum­ <lb/>
            moning by name those Argives who were shut up in the sacred <lb/>
            precinct; and he called them out, saying that he had received <lb/>
            their ransom; but the ransom among the Peloponnesians is a <lb/>
            fixed sum of two minæ to be paid for each prisoner. Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes therefore, having called them out severally, put to death <lb/>
            about fifty of the Argives; and somehow this went on un­ <lb/>
            known to the rest who were within the precinct; for as the <lb/>
            grove was thick, those within did not see those without, or <lb/>
            what they were doing, until at last one of them getting up <lb/>
            into a tree, saw what was being done. They therefore no <lb/>
            more went out when called for. 80. Thereupon Cleomenes <lb/>
            ordered all the Helots to heap up wood around the grove, and <lb/>
            when they had executed his orders, he set fire to the grove. <lb/>
            When all was in a flame, he asked one of the deserters to <lb/>
            which of the gods the grove belonged; he said that it be­ <lb/>
            longed to Argus. Cleomenes, when he heard this, uttering a <lb/>
            deep groan, said, " 0 prophetic Apollo! thou hast indeed <lb/>
            greatly deceived me, in saying that I should take Argos. I <lb/>
            conjecture thy prophecy is accomplished." 81. After this, <lb/>
            Cleomenes sent away the greater part of his army to Sparta; <lb/>
            and he himself, taking a thousand chosen men with him, went <pb n="384"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[82-84,"/> <lb/>
            to offer sacrifice at the temple of Juno. But when he wished <lb/>
            himself to offer sacrifice on the altar, the priest forbad him, <lb/>
            saying that it was not lawful for a stranger to offer sacrifice <lb/>
            there; upon which Cleomenes commanded the Helots to drag <lb/>
            the priest from the altar and scourge him, while he himself <lb/>
            sacrificed; and having done this, he went away to Sparta. <lb/>
            82. On his return, his enemies accused him before the Ephori, <lb/>
            alleging that he had been bribed not to take Argos, when he <lb/>
            might easily have taken it. He said to them, whether speak­ <lb/>
            ing falsely or truly I am unable to say for certain ; he affirmed, <lb/>
            however, "that when he had taken the sacred precinct cf <lb/>
            Argus, he thought that the oracle of the god was accomplished, <lb/>
            and therefore he did not think it right to attempt the city, <lb/>
            before he had had recourse to victims, and ascertained whether <lb/>
            the god would favour or obstruct him; and that whilst he was <lb/>
            sacrificing favourably in the temple of Juno, a flame of fire <lb/>
            shone forth from the breast of the image; and thus he learnt <lb/>
            for certain that he should not take Argos: for if it had shone <lb/>
            forth from the head of the image, lie should have taken the <lb/>
            city completely; but as it shone forth from the breast, he <lb/>
            thought that every thing had been done by him which the <lb/>
            deity wished to happen." In saying this, he appeared to the <lb/>
            Spartans to say what was credible and reasonable, and was <lb/>
            acquitted by a large majority. 83. Argos however was left <lb/>
            so destitute of men, that their slaves had the management of <lb/>
            affairs, ruling and administering them, until the sons of those <lb/>
            who had been killed grew up. Then they, having recovered <lb/>
            Argos, expelled the slaves; and the slaves, being driven out, <lb/>
            took Tiryns by assault. For a time concord subsisted between <lb/>
            them, but then there came to the slaves one Oleander, a pro­ <lb/>
            phet, who was by birth a Phigalean of Arcadia ; he persuaded <lb/>
            the slaves to attack their masters. From this circumstance <lb/>
            there was war between them for a long time, till at last the <lb/>
            Argives with difficulty got the upper hand.</p>
          <p>84. Now the Argives say, that on this account Cleomenes <lb/>
            became mad and perished miserably. But the Spartans them­ <lb/>
            selves say, that Cleomenes became mad from no divine influ­ <lb/>
            ence, but that by associating with the Scythians he became <lb/>
            a drinker of unmixed wine, and from that cause became <lb/>
            mad. For that the Scythian nomades, since Darius had in­ <lb/>
            vaded their country, were afterwards desirous to take venge- <pb n="385"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="85, 86.1 "/>ance on him, and having sent to Sparta to make an alliance, <lb/>
            and agree that the Scythians themselves should endeavour to <lb/>
            make an irruption into Media near the river Phasis, and to <lb/>
            urge the Spartans to set out from Ephesus, and march up­ <lb/>
            wards ; and then for both armies to meet at the same place. <lb/>
            They say, that Cleomenes, when the Scythians came for this <lb/>
            purpose, associated with them too intimately; and being more <lb/>
            intimate with them than was proper, contracted from them a <lb/>
            habit of drinking unmixed wine; and the Spartans think <lb/>
            that he became mad from this cause. And from that time, <lb/>
            as they themselves say, when they wish to drink stronger <lb/>
            drink, they say, " Pour out like a Scythian." Thus, then, the <lb/>
            Spartans speak concerning Cleomenes. But Cleomenes ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me to have suffered this retribution on account of <lb/>
            Demaratus.</p>
          <p>85. When the Æginetæ were informed of the death of <lb/>
            Cleomenes, they sent ambassadors to Sparta to complain loudly <lb/>
            against Leutychides, on account of the hostages detained at <lb/>
            Athens: and the Lacedæmonians, having assembled a court <lb/>
            of judicature, determined that the Æginetæ had been very <lb/>
            much injured by Leutychides, and condemned him to be <lb/>
            delivered up and taken to Ægina, in the place of the men <lb/>
            who were detained at Athens. But when the Æginetæ were <lb/>
            about to take Leutychides away, Theasides, son of Leoprepes, <lb/>
            an eminent man in Sparta, said to them, " Men of Ægina, <lb/>
            what are you going to do, to take away the king of the <lb/>
            Spartans, who has been delivered into your hands by the <lb/>
            citizens ? If the Spartans, yielding to anger, have so de­ <lb/>
            cided, take care lest, if you do these things, they hereafter <lb/>
            pour into your country a calamity which will utterly destroy <lb/>
            you." The Æginetæ having heard this, refrained from taking <lb/>
            him away; and came to this agreement, that Leutychides <lb/>
            should accompany them to Athens, and restore the men to <lb/>
            the Æginetæ. 86. When Leutychides, on his arrival at <lb/>
            Athens, demanded back the pledges, the Athenians had re­ <lb/>
            course to evasions, not wishing to give them up; and said, <lb/>
            that two kings had deposited them, and it would not be right <lb/>
            to deliver them up to one without the other. When the <lb/>
            Athenians refused to give them up, Leutychides addressed <lb/>
            them as follows: " 0 Athenians, do whichever you yourselves <lb/>
            wish ; for if you deliver them up, you will do what is just, <note type="footnote"> 2 o </note> <pb n="386"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[86 "/>and if you do not deliver them up, the contrary. I will, <lb/>
            however, tell you what once happened in Sparta respecting <lb/>
            a deposit. We Spartans say, that about three generations <lb/>
            before my time, there lived in Lacedæmon one Glaucus, son <lb/>
            of Epicydes: we relate that this man both attained to the <lb/>
            first rank in all other respects, and also bore the highest cha­ <lb/>
            racter for justice of all who at that time dwelt at Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            We say that in due time the following events betel him. A <lb/>
            certain Milesian, having come to Sparta, wished to have a <lb/>
            conference with him, and made the following statement: ' I <lb/>
            am a Milesian, and am come, Glaucus, with the desire of <lb/>
            profiting by your justice. For since throughout all the rest <lb/>
            of Greece, and particularly in Ionia, there was great talk of <lb/>
            your justice, I considered with myself that Ionia is continually <lb/>
            exposed to great dangers, and that on the contrary Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus is securely situated, and consequently that with us one <lb/>
            can never see the same persons retaining property. Having, <lb/>
            therefore, reflected and deliberated on these things, I have <lb/>
            determined to change half of my whole substance into silver <lb/>
            and deposit it with you, being well assured that, being placed <lb/>
            with you, it will be safe. Do you, then, take this money, <lb/>
            and preserve these tokens; and whosoever possessing these <lb/>
            shall demand it back again, restore it to him.' (2.) The <lb/>
            stranger who came from Miletus spoke thus. But Glaucus <lb/>
            received the deposit, on the condition mentioned. After a <lb/>
            long time had elapsed, the sons of this man who had deposited <lb/>
            the money, came to Sparta, and having addressed themselves <lb/>
            to Glaucus, and shown the tokens, demanded back the money. <lb/>
            Glaucus repulsed them, answering as follows: I neither re­ <lb/>
            member the matter, nor does it occur to me that I know any <lb/>
            of the circumstances you mention; but if I can recall it to <lb/>
            my mind, I am willing to do every thing that is just; and if <lb/>
            indeed I have received it, I wish to restore it correctly; but <lb/>
            if I have not received it at all, I shall have recourse to the <lb/>
            laws of the Greeks against you. I therefore defer settling <lb/>
            this matter with you for four months from the present time. <lb/>
            (3.) The Milesians, accordingly, considering it a great ca­ <lb/>
            lamity, departed, as being deprived of their money. But <lb/>
            Glaucus went to Delphi to consult the oracle ; and when <lb/>
            he asked the oracle whether he should make a booty of the <lb/>
            money by an oath. the Pythian assailed him in the following <pb n="387"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="87,88.)"/> <lb/>
            Words : ‘Glaucus, son of Epicydes, thus to prevail by an <lb/>
            oath, and to make a booty of the money, will be a present <lb/>
            gain: swear, then ; for death even awaits the man who keeps <lb/>
            his oath. But there is a nameless son of Perjury, who has <lb/>
            neither hands nor feet; he pursues swiftly, until, having <lb/>
            seized, he destroys the whole race, and all the house. But <lb/>
            the race of a man who keeps his oath is afterwards more <lb/>
            blessed.' Glaucus, having heard this, entreated the god to <lb/>
            pardon the words he had spoken. But the Pythian said, that <lb/>
            to tempt the god, and to commit the crime, were the same <lb/>
            thing. Glaucus, therefore, having sent for the Milesian <lb/>
            strangers, restored them the money. With what design this <lb/>
            story has been told you, 0 Athenians, shall now be men­ <lb/>
            tioned. There is at present not a single descendant of Glau­ <lb/>
            cus, nor any house which is supposed to have belonged to <lb/>
            Glaucus; but he is utterly extirpated from Sparta. Thus it <lb/>
            is right to have no other thought concerning a deposit, than <lb/>
            to restore it when it is demanded." Leutychides having said <lb/>
            this, but finding the Athenians did not even then listen to <lb/>
            him, departed.</p>
          <p>87. But the Æginetæ, before they received punishment <lb/>
            for the injuries they had done to the Athenians, to gratify <lb/>
            the Thebans,7 acted as follows. Being .offended with the <lb/>
            Athenians, and thinking themselves injured, they prepared <lb/>
            to revenge themselves on the Athenians : and as the Athenians <lb/>
            happened to have a five-benched galley at Sunium, they formed <lb/>
            an ambuscade and took the ship Theorist filled with the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal Athenians; and having taken the men, they put them <lb/>
            in chains. 88. The Athenians, having been treated thus by <lb/>
            the Æginetæ, no longer delayed to devise all sorts of plans <lb/>
            against tnem. Now there was in Ægina an eminent man <lb/>
            named Nicodromus, son of Cnoethus ; he being incensed <lb/>
            against the Æginetæ on account of his former banishment <lb/>
            from the island, and now hearing that the Athenians were <lb/>
            preparing to do a mischief to the Æginetæ, entered into an <lb/>
            agreement with the Athenians for the betrayal of Ægina, <lb/>
            mentioning on what day he would make the attempt, and on <lb/>
            what it would be necessary for them to come to his assistance. <note type="footnote"> 7 See B. V. ch. 80, 81. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 The Theoris was a vessel which was sent every year to Delos to <lb/>
            offer sacrifice to Apollo. </note> <note type="footnote">2c2</note> <pb n="388"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[89—92"/> <lb/>
            After this Nicodromus, according to his agreement with the <lb/>
            Athenians, seized that which is called the old town. 89. The <lb/>
            Athenians, however, did not arrive at the proper time, for <lb/>
            they happened not to have a sufficient number of ships to <lb/>
            engage with the Æginetæ ; and while they were entreating <lb/>
            the Corinthians to furnish them with ships, their plan was <lb/>
            ruined. The Corinthians, for they were then on very friendly <lb/>
            terms with them, at their request supplied the Athenians with <lb/>
            twenty ships; and they furnished them, letting them to hire <lb/>
            for five drachmae for each ; because by their laws they were <lb/>
            forbidden to give them for nothing. The Athenians, there­ <lb/>
            fore, having taken these and their own, manned seventy ships <lb/>
            in all, and sailed to Ægina, and arrived one day after that <lb/>
            agreed upon. 90. Nicodromus, when the Athenians did not <lb/>
            arrive at the proper time, embarked on ship-board and made <lb/>
            his escape from Ægina; and others of the Æginetæ accom <lb/>
            panied him, to whom the Athenians gave Sunium for a <lb/>
            habitation ; and they, sallying from thence, plundered the <lb/>
            Æginetæ in the island. This, however, happened subse­ <lb/>
            quently. 91. In the mean time the most wealthy of the <lb/>
            Æginetæ overpowered the common people, who, together <lb/>
            with Nicodromus, had revolted against them, and afterwards, <lb/>
            having subdued them, they led them out to execution. And <lb/>
            on this occasion they incurred a guilt, which they were un­ <lb/>
            able to expiate by any contrivance; but they were ejected out <lb/>
            of the island, before the goddess became propitious to them. <lb/>
            For having taken seven hundred of the common people pri­ <lb/>
            soners, they led them out to execution; and one of them, <lb/>
            having escaped from his bonds, fled to the porch of Ceres the <lb/>
            lawgiver, and seizing the door-handle, held it fast: but they, <lb/>
            when they were unable by dragging to tear him away, cut off <lb/>
            his hands, and so took him away; and the hands were left <lb/>
            sticking on the door-handles. 92. Thus, then, the Æginetæ <lb/>
            treated their own people. But when the Athenians arrived <lb/>
            with their seventy ships, they came to an engagement, and <lb/>
            being conquered in the sea-fight, they called on the same per­ <lb/>
            sons as before for assistance, that is, on the Argives. They, <lb/>
            however, would not any longer succour them, but complained <lb/>
            that the ships of the Æginetæ, having been forcibly seized <lb/>
            by Cleomenes, had touched on the territory of Argos, and <lb/>
            the crews bad disembarked with the Lacedæmonians. Some <pb n="389"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="93—95.]"/> <lb/>
            men had also disembarked from Sicyoman ships in the same <lb/>
            invasion ; and a penalty was imposed upon them by the <lb/>
            Argives, to pay a thousand talents, five hundred each. The <lb/>
            Sicyonians, accordingly, acknowledging that they had acted <lb/>
            unjustly, made an agreement to pay one hundred talents, and <lb/>
            be free from the rest; but the Æginetæ would not own them­ <lb/>
            selves in the wrong, and were very obstinate. On this account, <lb/>
            therefore, none of the Argives were sent by the common­ <lb/>
            wealth to assist them; but, on their request, volunteers went <lb/>
            to the number of a thousand: a general, whose name was <lb/>
            Eurybates, and who had practised for the pentathlon, led <lb/>
            them: the greater number of these never returned home, but <lb/>
            were slain by the Athenians in Ægina. The general, Eury­ <lb/>
            bates, engaging in single combat, killed three several anta­ <lb/>
            gonists in that manner, but was slain by the fourth, Sophanes <lb/>
            of Decelea. 93. The Æginetæ, however, having attacked <lb/>
            the fleet of the Athenians, when they were in disorder, ob­ <lb/>
            tained a victory, and took four of their ships with the men <lb/>
            on board.</p>
          <p>94. War was accordingly kindled between the Athenians <lb/>
            and Æginetæ. But the Persian pursued his own design, for <lb/>
            the servant continually reminded him to remember the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, and the Pisistratidæ constantly importuned him and <lb/>
            accused the Athenians; and at the same time Darius, laying <lb/>
            hold of this pretext, was desirous of subduing those people <lb/>
            of Greece who had refused to give him earth and water. He <lb/>
            therefore dismissed Mardonius from his command, because he <lb/>
            had succeeded ill in his expedition ; and having appointed <lb/>
            other generals, he sent them against Eretria and Athens, <lb/>
            namely, Datis, who was a Mede by birth, and Artaph ernes, <lb/>
            son of Artaphernes, his own nephew; and he despatched them <lb/>
            with strict orders, having enslaved Athens and Eretria, to <lb/>
            bring the bondsmen into his presence. 95. When these <lb/>
            generals who were appointed left the king, and reached the <lb/>
            Aleian plain of Cilicia, bringing with them a numerous and <lb/>
            well-equipped army, while they were there encamped the <lb/>
            whole naval force required from each people came up: the <lb/>
            horse-transports were also present, which Darius in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding year had commanded his tributaries to prepare. Having <lb/>
            put the horses on board of these, and having embarked the <lb/>
            land-forces in the ships, they sailed for Ionia with six hundred <pb n="390"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[96—98"/> <lb/>
            triremes. From thence they did not steer their ships along <lb/>
            the continent direct towards the Hellespont and Thrace; but <lb/>
            parting from Samos they directed their course across the <lb/>
            Icarian sea, and through the islands ; as appears to me, chiefly, <lb/>
            dreading the circumnavigation of Athos, because in the pre­ <lb/>
            ceding year, in attempting a passage that way, they had sus­ <lb/>
            tained great loss; and besides, Naxos compelled them, not <lb/>
            having been before captured. 96. When, being carried out <lb/>
            of the Icarian sea, they arrived off Naxos, (for the Persians, <lb/>
            bearing in mind what had formerly happened,9 purposed to <lb/>
            attack this place first,) the Naxians fled to the mountains, <lb/>
            and did not await their approach: the Persians, therefore, <lb/>
            having seized as many of them as they could lay hold of, <lb/>
            as slaves, set fire to both the sacred buildings and the city; <lb/>
            and having done this, they proceeded against the rest of the <lb/>
            islands.</p>
          <p>97. While they were doing this, the Delians also, abandon­ <lb/>
            ing Delos, fled to Tenos; but as the fleet was sailing down <lb/>
            towards it, Datis, having sailed forward, would not permit the <lb/>
            ships to anchor near the island, but further on, off Rhenea; <lb/>
            and he, having ascertained where the Delians were, sent a <lb/>
            herald and addressed them as follows: " Sacred men, why <lb/>
            have you fled, forming an unfavourable opinion of me ? For <lb/>
            both I myself have so much wisdom, and am so ordered by <lb/>
            the king, that in the region where the two deities1 were born, <lb/>
            no harm should be done either to the country itself or its <lb/>
            inhabitants. Return, therefore, to your houses, and resume <lb/>
            possession of the island." This message he sent to the Delians <lb/>
            by means of a herald; and afterwards having heaped up three <lb/>
            hundred talents of frankincense upon the altar, he burnt it. <lb/>
            98. Datis, accordingly, having done this, sailed with the army <lb/>
            first against Eretria, taking with him both Ionians and Æo­ <lb/>
            lians. But after he had put out to sea from thence, Delos <lb/>
            was shaken by an earthquake, as the Delians say, the first <lb/>
            and last time that it was so affected to my time. And the <lb/>
            deity assuredly by this portent intimated to men the evils <lb/>
            that were about to befal them. For during the reigns of <lb/>
            Darius, son of Hystaspes, of Xerxes, son of Darius, and of <lb/>
            Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes ; during these three successive <note type="footnote">9 See B. V. ch. 34. </note><note type="footnote">1 Apollo and Diana. </note> <pb n="391"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="99 -101.]"/> <lb/>
            generations, more disasters befel Greece than during the <lb/>
            twenty generations that preceded the time of Darius; partly <lb/>
            brought upon it by the Persians, and partly by the chief men <lb/>
            amongst them contending for power. So that it is nothing <lb/>
            improbable that Delos should be moved at that time, having <lb/>
            been until then unmoved: and in an oracle respecting it, it <lb/>
            had been thus written: " I will move even Delos, although <lb/>
            hitherto unmoved." And in the Grecian language these <lb/>
            names mean,—Darius, "one who restrains;" Xerxes, "a <lb/>
            warrior and Artaxerxes, " a mighty warrior." Thus, <lb/>
            then; the Greeks may rightly designate these kings in their <lb/>
            language.</p>
          <p>99. The barbarians, after they had parted from Delos, <lb/>
            touched at the islands; and from thence they took with them <lb/>
            men to serve in the army, and carried away the sons of the <lb/>
            islanders for hostages. And when, having sailed round the <lb/>
            islands, they touched at Carystus, as the Carystians would <lb/>
            not give. hostages, and refused to bear arms against their <lb/>
            neighbouring cities, meaning Eretria and Athens, they there­ <lb/>
            upon besieged them, and ravaged their country, until at last <lb/>
            the Carystians also submitted to the will of the Persians. 100. <lb/>
            The Eretrians, being informed that the Persian armament was <lb/>
            sailing against them, entreated the Athenians to assist them; <lb/>
            and the Athenians did not refuse their aid, but gave them as <lb/>
            auxiliaries those four thousand men to whom had been allotted <lb/>
            the territory of the horse-feeding Chalcidians.2 But the coun­ <lb/>
            cils of the Eretrians were not at all sound: they sent for the <lb/>
            Athenians indeed, but held divided opinions; for some of <lb/>
            them proposed to abandon the city, and to retire to the fast­ <lb/>
            nesses of Eubœa; but others of them, hoping that they should <lb/>
            derive gain to themselves from the Persians, were planning <lb/>
            to betray their country. But Æschines, son of Nothon, a <lb/>
            man of rank among the Eretrians, being informed of the views <lb/>
            of both parties, communicated to the Athenians, who had come, <lb/>
            the whole state of their affairs; and entreated them to return <lb/>
            to their own country, lest they too should perish. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians followed this advice of Æschines, and having crossed <lb/>
            over to Oropus, saved themselves. 101. In the mean time the <lb/>
            Persians, sailing on, directed their ships' course to Tamynæ, <lb/>
            Chœrea, and Ægilia, of the Eretrian territory; and having <note type="footnote"> 2 See B. V. ch 77, </note> <pb n="392"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[102, 103."/> <lb/>
            taken possession of these places, they immediately disembarked <lb/>
            the horses, and made preparations to attack the enemy. But <lb/>
            the Eretrians had no thoughts of going out against them and <lb/>
            fighting, but since that opinion had prevailed, that they should <lb/>
            not abandon the city, their only care now was, if by any means <lb/>
            they could defend the walls. A violent attack on the walls <lb/>
            ensuing, for six days many fell on both sides; but on the <lb/>
            seventh, Euphorbus, son of Alcimachus, and Philargus, son <lb/>
            of Cyneus, men of rank among the citizens, betrayed the <lb/>
            city to the Persians. But they, having gained entrance into <lb/>
            the city, in the first place pillaged and set fire to the temples, <lb/>
            in revenge for those that had been burnt at Sardis; and in <lb/>
            the next, they enslaved the inhabitants, in obedience to the <lb/>
            commands of Darius.</p>
          <p>102. Having subdued Eretria, and rested a few days, they <lb/>
            sailed to Attica, pressing them very close, and expecting to <lb/>
            treat the Athenians in the same way as they had the Ere­ <lb/>
            trians. Now as Marathon was the spot in Attica best adapted <lb/>
            for cavalry, and nearest to Eretria, Hippias, son of Pisistratus, <lb/>
            conducted them there. 103. But the Athenians, when they <lb/>
            heard of this, also sent their forces to Marathon: and ten <lb/>
            generals led them, of whom the tenth was Miltiades, whose <lb/>
            father, Cimon,3 son of Stesagoras, had been banished from <lb/>
            Athens by Pisistratus, son of Hippocrates. During his exile, <lb/>
            it was his good fortune to obtain the Olympic prize in the <lb/>
            four-horse chariot race, and having gained this victory, he <lb/>
            transferred the honour to Miltiades, his brother by the same <lb/>
            mother; and afterwards, in the next Olympiad, being victori­ <lb/>
            ous with the same mares, he permitted Pisistratus to be pro­ <lb/>
            claimed victor; and having conceded the victory to him, he <lb/>
            returned home under terms. And after he had gained another <lb/>
            Olympic prize with these same mares, it happened that he died <lb/>
            by the hands of the sons of Pisistratus, when Pisistratus him­ <lb/>
            self was no longer alive: they slew him near the Prytaneum, <lb/>
            having placed men to waylay him by night. Cimon was <lb/>
            buried in front of the city, beyond that which is called the <lb/>
            road through Cœla, and opposite him these same mares were <lb/>
            buried, which won the three Olympic prizes. Other mares <lb/>
            also had already done the same thing, belonging to Evagoras <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian ; but besides these, none others. Stesagoras. <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> See ch. 39—41. </note> <pb n="393"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="104—106.]"/> <lb/>
            the elder of the sons of Cimon, was at that time being edu­ <lb/>
            cated by his paternal uncle Miltiades, in the Chersonese, but <lb/>
            the younger by Cimon himself at Athens, and he had the <lb/>
            name of Miltiades, from Miltiades, the founder of the Cher? <lb/>
            sonese. 104. At that time, then, this Miltiades, coming from <lb/>
            the Chersonese, and having escaped a two-fold death, became <lb/>
            general of the Athenians: for in the first place, the Phœni­ <lb/>
            cians, having pursued him as far as Imbros, were exceedingly <lb/>
            desirous of seizing him, and carrying him up to the king; <lb/>
            and in the next, when he had escaped them, and had returned <lb/>
            to his own country, and thought himself in safety, his enemies <lb/>
            thereupon, having attacked him, and brought him before a <lb/>
            court of justice, prosecuted him for tyranny in the Chersonese. <lb/>
            But having escaped these also, he was at length appointed <lb/>
            general of the Athenians, being chosen by the people.</p>
          <p>105. And first, while the generals were yet in the city, <lb/>
            they despatched a herald to Sparta, one Phidippides, an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, who was a courier by profession, one who attended to <lb/>
            this very business. This man, then, as Phidippides himself <lb/>
            said and reported to the Athenians, Pan met near Mount <lb/>
            Parthenion, above Tegea; and Pan, calling out the name of <lb/>
            Phidippides, bade him ask the Athenians why they paid no <lb/>
            attention to him, who was well inclined to the Athenians, <lb/>
            and had often been useful to them, and would be so hereafter. <lb/>
            The Athenians, therefore, as their affairs were then in a <lb/>
            prosperous condition, believed that this was true, and erected <lb/>
            a temple to Pan beneath the Acropolis, and in consequence <lb/>
            of that message they propitiate Pan with yearly sacrifices and <lb/>
            the torch race. 106. This Phidippides, being sent by the <lb/>
            generals at that time when he said Pan appeared to turn, ar­ <lb/>
            rived in Sparta on the following day after his departure from <lb/>
            the city of the Athenians, and on coming in presence of the <lb/>
            magistrates, he said, " Lacedasmonians, the Athenians entreat <lb/>
            you to assist them, and not to suffer the most ancient city <lb/>
            among the Greeks to fall into bondage to barbarians: for <lb/>
            Eretria is already reduced to slavery, and Greece has become <lb/>
            weaker by the loss of a renowned city." He accordingly de­ <lb/>
            livered the message according to his instructions, and they <lb/>
            resolved indeed to assist the Athenians; but it was out of <lb/>
            their power to do so immediately, as they were unwilling to <lb/>
            violate the law: for it was the ninth day of the current <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[107, 108"/> <lb/>
            month; and they said they could not march out on the ninth <lb/>
            day, the moon's circle not being full. They, therefore, waited <lb/>
            for the full moon.</p>
          <p>107. Meanwhile Hippias, son of Pisistratus, had led the <lb/>
            barbarians to Marathon, having the preceding night seen the <lb/>
            following vision in his sleep. Hippias fancied that he lay <lb/>
            with his own mother; he inferred, therefore, from the dream, <lb/>
            that having returned to Athens and recovered the sovereignty, <lb/>
            he should die an old man in his own country. He drew this <lb/>
            inference from the vision. At that time, as he was leading <lb/>
            the way, he first of all landed the slaves from Eretria on the <lb/>
            island of the Styreans, called iEgilia; and next he moored <lb/>
            the ships as they came to Marathon, and drew up the bar­ <lb/>
            barians as they disembarked on land: and as he was busied <lb/>
            in doing this, it happened that he sneezed and coughed more <lb/>
            violently than he was accustomed; and as he was far advanced <lb/>
            in years, several of his teeth were loose, so that through the <lb/>
            violence of his cough he threw out one of these teeth; and <lb/>
            as it fell on the sand, he used every endeavour to find it, but <lb/>
            when the tooth could no where be found, he drew a deep sigh, <lb/>
            and said to the by-standers, " This country is not ours, nor <lb/>
            shall we be able to subdue it; whatever share belongeth to <lb/>
            me, my tooth possesses." Hippias accordingly inferred that <lb/>
            his vision had been thus fulfilled.</p>
          <p>108. When the Athenians were drawn up in a place sacred <lb/>
            to Hercules, the Platæans came to their assistance with all <lb/>
            their forces. For the Platæans had given themselves up to <lb/>
            the Athenians, and the Athenians had already undergone many <lb/>
            toils on their account: and they gave themselves up on the <lb/>
            following occasion. The Platæans, being hard pressed by <lb/>
            the Thebans, first offered themselves to Cleomenes, son of <lb/>
            Anaxandrides, and to the Lacedæmonians who happened to <lb/>
            be present. They would not receive them, but addressed <lb/>
            them as follows: " We live at too great a distance, and such <lb/>
            assistance would be of little value to you; for you would often <lb/>
            be enslaved before any of us could be informed of it. We <lb/>
            advise you, therefore, to give yourselves up to the Athenians, <lb/>
            who are your neighbours, and are not backward in assisting.- <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians gave this advice, not so much from any <lb/>
            good-will to the Platæans, as from a desire that the Athenians <lb/>
            might be subject to toil, by being set at variance with the <pb n="395"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="100.]"/> <lb/>
            Bœotians. The Lacedæmonians, accordingly, gave this ad­ <lb/>
            vice to the Platæans, and they did not disregard it, but when <lb/>
            the Athenians were performing the sacred rites to the twelve <lb/>
            gods, they s'at down at the altar as suppliants, and delivered <lb/>
            themselves up. But the Thebans, having heard of this, <lb/>
            marched against the Platæans, and the Athenians went to <lb/>
            assist; and as they were about to engage in battle, the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians interfered; for happening to be present, and medi­ <lb/>
            ating between them, at the request of both parties, they pre­ <lb/>
            scribed the limits to the country in the following manner: <lb/>
            that the Thebans should leave alone those of the- Bœotians <lb/>
            who did not wish to be ranked among the Boeotians. The <lb/>
            Corinthians, having made this decision, returned home; but <lb/>
            the Bœotians attacked the Athenians as they were departing, <lb/>
            but having attacked them were worsted in the battle. The <lb/>
            Athenians, therefore, passing beyond the limits which the <lb/>
            Corinthians had fixed for the Plataeans,—passing beyond these, <lb/>
            they made the Asopus and Hysiæ to be the boundary between <lb/>
            the Thebans and Platæans. The Platæans, therefore, gave <lb/>
            themselves up to the Athenians in the manner above described ; <lb/>
            and at that time came to assist them at Marathon.</p>
          <p>109. The opinions of the Athenian generals were divided , <lb/>
            one party not consenting to engage, " because they were too <lb/>
            few to engage with the army of the Modes and the others, <lb/>
            among whom was Miltiades, urging them to give battle. When, <lb/>
            therefore, they were divided, and the worst opinion was likely <lb/>
            to prevail, thereupon, for there was an eleventh voter who <lb/>
            was appointed minister of war among the Athenians, for the <lb/>
            Athenians in ancient times gave the minister of war an equal <lb/>
            Tote with the generals, and at that time Callimachus or <lb/>
            Aphidnæ was minister of war; to him, therefore, Miltiades <lb/>
            came and spoke as follows: " It now depends on you, Cal­ <lb/>
            timachus, either to enslave Athens; or, by preserving its <lb/>
            liberty, to leave a memorial of yourself to every age, such as <lb/>
            not even Harmodius and Aristogiton have left. For. the <lb/>
            Athenians were never in so great danger from the time they <lb/>
            were first a people. And if they succumb to the Medes, it <lb/>
            has been determined what they are to suffer, when delivered <lb/>
            up to Hippias; but if the city survives, it will become the <lb/>
            first of the Grecian cities. How, then, this can be brought <lb/>
            to pass, and how the power of deciding this matter depends <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[110—112"/> <lb/>
            on you, I will now proceed to explain. The opinions of us <lb/>
            generals, who are ten, are divided; the one party urging that <lb/>
            we should engage; the other, that we should not engage. <lb/>
            Now if we do not engage, I expect that some great dissen­ <lb/>
            sion arising amongst us will shake the minds of the Athenians, <lb/>
            so as to induce them to a compliance with the Medes. But <lb/>
            if we engage before any dastardly thought arises in the minds <lb/>
            of some of the Athenians, if the gods are impartial, we shall <lb/>
            be able to get the better in the engagement. All these things, <lb/>
            therefore, are now in your power, and entirely depend on you. <lb/>
            For if you will support my opinion, your country will be free, <lb/>
            and the city the first in Greece; but if you join with those <lb/>
            who would dissuade us from an engagement, the contrary <lb/>
            of the advantages I have enumerated will fall to your lot." <lb/>
            110. Miltiades, by these words, gained over Callimachus, and <lb/>
            the opinion of the minister of war being added, it was deter­ <lb/>
            mined to engage. Afterwards the generals whose opinions <lb/>
            had been given to engage, as the command for the day de. <lb/>
            volved upon each of them, gave it up to Miltiades; but he, <lb/>
            having accepted it, would not come to an engagement, before <lb/>
            his own turn to command came.</p>
          <p>111. When it came round to his turn, then the Athenians <lb/>
            were drawn out in the following order for the purpose of en­ <lb/>
            gaging. The war-minister, Callimachus, commanded the right <lb/>
            wing, for the law at that time was so settled among the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, that the war-minister should have the right wing. He <lb/>
            having this command, the tribes succeeded as they were usually <lb/>
            reckoned, adjoining one another ; but the Platæans were drawn <lb/>
            out last of all, occupying the left wing. Now, ever since that <lb/>
            battle, when the Athenians offer sacrifices and celebrate the <lb/>
            public festivals which take place every five years, the Athenian <lb/>
            herald prays, saying, " May blessings attend both the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and the Platæans." At that time, when the Athenians <lb/>
            were drawn out at Marathon, the following was the case; <lb/>
            their line was equal in extent to the Medic line, but the <lb/>
            middle of it was but few deep, and there the line was weakest; <lb/>
            but each wing was strong in numbers. 112. When they were <lb/>
            thus drawn out, and the victims were favourable, thereupon the <lb/>
            Athenians, as soon as they were ordered to charge, advanced <lb/>
            against the barbarians in double-quick time ; and the space <lb/>
            between them was not less than eight stades. But the Persians, <pb n="397"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="113—116.]"/> <lb/>
            seeing them charging at full speed, prepared to receive them; <lb/>
            and they imputed madness to them, and that utterly destruc­ <lb/>
            tive, when they saw that they were few in number, and that <lb/>
            they rushed on at full speed, though they had no cavalry, nor <lb/>
            archers. So the barbarians surmised. The Athenians, how­ <lb/>
            ever, when they engaged in close ranks with the barbarians, <lb/>
            fought in a manner worthy of record. For they, the first of <lb/>
            all the Greeks whom we know of, charged the enemy at full <lb/>
            speed, and they first endured the sight of the Medic garb, and <lb/>
            the, men that wore it ; but until that time the very name of <lb/>
            the Medes was a terror to the Greeks. 113. The battle at <lb/>
            Marathon lasted a long time : and in the middle of the line, <lb/>
            where the Persians themselves and the Sacæ were arrayed, the <lb/>
            barbarians were victorious ; in this part, then, the barbarians <lb/>
            conquered, and having broken the line, pursued to the inte­ <lb/>
            rior ; but in both wings the Athenians and the Platæans were <lb/>
            victorious; and having gained the victory, they allowed the <lb/>
            defeated portion of the barbarians to flee; and having united <lb/>
            both wings, they fought with those that had broken their centre, <lb/>
            and the Athenians were victorious. They followed the Per­ <lb/>
            sians in their flight, cutting them to pieces, till, reaching the <lb/>
            shore, they called for fire and attacked the ships.</p>
          <p>114. And in the first place, in this battle the war-minister, <lb/>
            Callimachus, was killed, having proved himself a brave man ; <lb/>
            and among the generals, Stesilaus, son of Thrasylas, perished; <lb/>
            and in the next place Cynægeirus, son of Euphorion, having <lb/>
            laid hold of a ship's poop, had his hand severed by an axe <lb/>
            and fell; and besides, many other distinguished Athenians <lb/>
            were slain. 115. In this manner the Athenians made them­ <lb/>
            selves masters of seven ships: but with the rest the barbarians <lb/>
            rowing rapidly back, and after taking off the Eretrian slaves <lb/>
            from the island in which they had left them, sailed round Su­ <lb/>
            nium, wishing to anticipate the Athenians in reaching the <lb/>
            city. The charge prevailed among the Athenians, that they <lb/>
            formed this design by the contrivance of the Alcmæonidæ ; for <lb/>
            that they, having agreed with the Persians, held up a shield to <lb/>
            them when they were on board their ships. 116. They then <lb/>
            sailed round Sunium. But the Athenians marched with all <lb/>
            speed to the assistance of the city, and were beforehand in <lb/>
            reaching it before the barbarians arrived ; and having come <lb/>
            from the precinct of Hercules at Marathon, they took up their <pb n="398"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[117—119"/> <lb/>
            station in another precinct of Hercules at Cynosarges: but the <lb/>
            barbarians, having laid to with their fleet off Phalerum, for this <lb/>
            was at that time the port of the Athenians, having anchored <lb/>
            their ships there for a time, they sailed away for Asia. 117. <lb/>
            In this battle at Marathon there died of the barbarians about <lb/>
            six thousand four hundred men ; and of the Athenians, one <lb/>
            hundred and ninety-two: so many fell on both sides. The <lb/>
            following prodigy occurred there: an Athenian, Epizelus, SOIl <lb/>
            of Cuphagoras, while fighting in the medley, and behaving <lb/>
            valiantly, was deprived of sight, though wounded in no part <lb/>
            of his body, nor struck from a distance ; and he continued to <lb/>
            be blind from that time for the remainder of his life. I have <lb/>
            heard that he used to give the following account of his loss. <lb/>
            He thought that a large heavy-armed man stood before him, <lb/>
            whose beard shaded the whole of his shield; that this spectre <lb/>
            passed by him, and killed the man that stood by his side. Such <lb/>
            is the account, I have been informed, Epizelus used to give.</p>
          <p>118. Datis, on his way back with the armament to Asia, when <lb/>
            lie came to Myconus, saw a vision in his sleep : what the vision <lb/>
            was, is not related; but he, as soon as day appeared, caused a <lb/>
            search to be made through the ships ; and having found in a <lb/>
            Phœnician ship a gilded image of Apollo, he inquired whence <lb/>
            it had been robbed;• and having learnt from what temple <lb/>
            it was, he sailed in his own ship to Delos, and, as at that <lb/>
            time the Delians had come back to the island, he deposit­ <lb/>
            ed the image in the temple, and charged the Delians to <lb/>
            convey the image to Delium of the Thebans; that place is <lb/>
            on the coast, opposite Chalcis: Datis, accordingly, having <lb/>
            given this charge, <unclear>sailed</unclear> away. The Delians, however, <lb/>
            did not convey back this statue, but the Thebans themselves, <lb/>
            twenty years afterwards, carried it to Delium, in obedience to <lb/>
            an oracle. 119. Those of the Eretrians who had been en­ <lb/>
            slaved, Datis and Artaphernes, as soon as they reached Asia, <lb/>
            took up to Susa. But king Darius, before the Eretrians <lb/>
            were made captive, harboured deep resentment against them, <lb/>
            as the Eretrians had been the first to begin acts of injustice: <lb/>
            but when he saw them brought into his presence, and subject <lb/>
            to his power, he did them no other harm, but settled them in <lb/>
            the Cissian territory at a station of his own, the name of <lb/>
            which is Ardericca ; it is two hundred and ten stades distant <lb/>
            from Susa, and forty from the well which Droduces three <pb n="399"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="120-122.]"/> <lb/>
            different substances; for asphalt, salt, and oil are drawn up <lb/>
            from it, in the following manner. It is pumped up by means <lb/>
            of a swipe, and instead of a bucket half of a wine-skin is at­ <lb/>
            tached to it; having dipped down with this, a man draws it <lb/>
            up and then pours the contents into a receiver; and being <lb/>
            poured from this into another, it assumes three different forms : <lb/>
            the asphalt and the salt immediately become solid, but the oil <lb/>
            they collect, and the Persians call it rhadinace ; it is black and <lb/>
            emits a strong odour. Here king Darius settled the Eretrians; <lb/>
            who, even to my time, occupied this territory, retaining their <lb/>
            ancient language. Such things took place with regard to the <lb/>
            Eretrians. 120, Two thousand of the Lacedæmonians came to <lb/>
            Athens after the full moon, making such haste to be in time, <lb/>
            that they arrived in Attica on the third day after leaving <lb/>
            Sparta. But having come too late for the battle, they, never­ <lb/>
            theless, desired to see the Medes; and having proceeded to <lb/>
            Marathon, they saw the slain; and afterwards, having com­ <lb/>
            mended the Athenians and their achievement, they returned <lb/>
            home,</p>
          <p>121. It is a marvel to me, and I cannot credit the report, <lb/>
            that the Alcmæonidæ ever held up a shield tQ the Persians by <lb/>
            agreement, wishing that the Athenians should be subject to <lb/>
            the barbarians and to Hippias ; for they were evidently haters <lb/>
            of tyrants more than, or equally with, Callias, son of Phoenip­ <lb/>
            pus, and father of Hipponicus. For Callias was the only one <lb/>
            of all the Athenians who, when Pisistratus was driven from <lb/>
            Athens, dared to purchase his goods when put up to sale by <lb/>
            the public crier; and he devised every thing else that was <lb/>
            most hostile to him. 122. This Callias deserves to have fre­ <lb/>
            quent mention made of him by every one: first of all, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of what has been already mentioned, as being a man <lb/>
            ardent in asserting the freedom of his country; and in the <lb/>
            next place, on account of what he did at Olympia, having been <lb/>
            victorious in the horse-race, and second in the chariot-race, <lb/>
            and having before won the prize in the Pythian games, he was <lb/>
            distinguished among all the Greeks for the greatest munifi­ <lb/>
            cence: moreover, with regard to his daughters, who were <lb/>
            three in number, he behaved in the following manner: when <lb/>
            they were of fit age for marriage he gave them a most magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent present, and gratified their wishes; for he gave each to that <lb/>
            man of all the Athenians whom she wished to select for her own <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[123-125."/> <lb/>
            husband, 123. And the Alcmæonidæ were haters of tyrants, <lb/>
            equally with, or not at all less than him. It is therefore a <lb/>
            marvel to me, and I cannot admit the charge, that they held <lb/>
            up a shield, who at all times shunned the tyrants, and by <lb/>
            whose contrivance the Pisistratidæ abandoned the tyranny.4 <lb/>
            Thus, in my judgment, these were the persons who liberated <lb/>
            Athens much more than Harmodius and Aristogiton, for <lb/>
            they, by slaying Hipparchus, exasperated the survivors of the <lb/>
            Pisistratidæ, but did not any the more put an end to the ty­ <lb/>
            ranny of the rest; whereas the Alcmæonidæ manifestly liberated <lb/>
            their country, if indeed they were the persons who persuaded the <lb/>
            Pythian to enjoin the Lacedæmonians to liberate Athens, as I <lb/>
            have already shown.6 124. But perhaps, having some grudge <lb/>
            against the Athenian people, they betrayed their country ? <lb/>
            There were not, however, any other men who were more highly <lb/>
            esteemed among the Athenians than them, or who were more <lb/>
            honoured : so that it is not consistent with reason, that a shield <lb/>
            was held up by them from such a motive. Still a shield was <lb/>
            held up ; and this cannot be denied, for so it was ; but who it <lb/>
            was that held it up I am not able to say further than this.</p>
          <p>125. The Alemæonidas were even from a very early period <lb/>
            distinguished at Athens ; for through Alcmæon, and again <lb/>
            through Megacles, they became very distinguished. For, in <lb/>
            the first place, Alcmæon, son of Megacles, was coadjutor to <lb/>
            the Lydians from Sardis, who came on the part of Crœsus to <lb/>
            consult the oracle at Delphi,6 and he assisted them zealously: <lb/>
            and Crœsus being informed by the Lydians, who had gone to <lb/>
            consult the oracle, that he had done him good service, sent for <lb/>
            him to Sardis; and when he arrived, presented him with so <lb/>
            much gold as he could carry away at once on his own person. <lb/>
            Alcmæon, for the purpose of such a present, had recourse to <lb/>
            the following expedient: having put on a large cloak, and <lb/>
            having left a deep fold in the cloak, and having drawn on the <lb/>
            widest boots he could find, he went into the treasury to which <lb/>
            they conducted him; and meeting with a heap of gold-dust, he <lb/>
            first stuffed around his legs as much gold as the boots would <lb/>
            contain; and then, having filled the whole fold with gold, and <lb/>
            having sprinkled the gold-dust over the hair of his head, and <lb/>
            put more into his mouth, he went out of the treasury, dragging <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> B. V. chap. 62—65. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> B. V. chap. 63.</note><note type="footnote"> <unclear/> B. I. chap. 47, 53,55. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            his boots with difficulty, and resembling any thing rather then <lb/>
            a man; for his mouth was stuffed, and he was all over swollen. <lb/>
            Crœsus, when he saw him, burst into laughter; and he gave <lb/>
            him all that, and besides, presented him with other things not <lb/>
            of less value than it. Thus this family became extremely <lb/>
            rich; and this Alcmæon, having by these means bred horses, <lb/>
            won the prize in the Olympic games. 126. In the second <lb/>
            generation after, Clisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, raised the <lb/>
            family, so that it became far more celebrated among the <lb/>
            Greeks than it had been before. For Clisthenes, son of <lb/>
            Aristonymus, son of Myron, son of Andreas, had a daughter <lb/>
            whose name was Agarista: her he resolved to give in mar­ <lb/>
            riage to the man whom he should find the most accomplished <lb/>
            of all the Greeks. When therefore the Olympian games were <lb/>
            being celebrated, Clisthenes, being victorious in them in the <lb/>
            chariot race, made a proclamation ; " that whoever of the <lb/>
            Greeks deemed himself worthy to become the son-in-law of <lb/>
            Clisthenes, should come to Sicyon on the sixtieth day, or even <lb/>
            before; since Clisthenes had determined on the marriage in a <lb/>
            year, reckoning from the sixtieth day." Thereupon such of <lb/>
            the Greeks as were puffed up with themselves and their coun­ <lb/>
            try, came as suitors; and Clisthenes, having made a 'race­ <lb/>
            course and palæstra for them, kept it for this very purpose. <lb/>
            127. From Italy, accordingly, came Smindyrides, son of Hip­ <lb/>
            pocrates, a Sybarite, who more than any other man reached <lb/>
            the highest pitch of luxury; (and Sybaris was at that time in <lb/>
            a most flourishing condition;) and Damasus of Siris, son of <lb/>
            Amyris called the Wise: these came from Italy. From the <lb/>
            Ionian gulf, Amphimnestus, son of Epistrophus, an Epidam­ <lb/>
            nian; he came from the Ionian gulf. An Ætolian came, <lb/>
            Males, brother of that Titormus who surpassed the Greeks in <lb/>
            strength, and fled from the society of men to the extremity of <lb/>
            the Ætolian territory. And from Peloponnesus, Leocedes, son <lb/>
            of Pheidon tyrant of the Argives, a descendant of that Phei­ <lb/>
            don who introduced measures among the Peloponnesians, and <lb/>
            was the most insolent of all the Greeks, who having removed <lb/>
            the Elean umpires, himself regulated the games at Olympia; <lb/>
            his son accordingly came. And Amiantus, son of Lycurgus, <lb/>
            an Arcadian from Trapezus ; and an Azenian from the city <lb/>
            of Pæos, Laphanes, son of Euphorion, who, as the story is told <lb/>
            in Arcadia. received the Dioscuri in his house, and after that <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <pb n="402"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[128,129."/> <lb/>
            entertained all men; and an Elean, Onomastus, son of Agræ­ <lb/>
            us: these accordingly came from the Peloponnesus itself. From <lb/>
            Athens there came Megacles, son of Alcmæon, the same who <lb/>
            had visited Croesus, and another, Hippoclides, son of Tisan­ <lb/>
            der, who surpassed the Athenians in wealth and beauty. From <lb/>
            Eretria, which was flourishing at that time, came Lysanias ; <lb/>
            he was the only one from Euboea. And from Thessaly there <lb/>
            came, of the Scopades, Diactorides a Cranonlan; and from the <lb/>
            Molossi, Alcon. 128. So many were the suitors. When <lb/>
            they had arrived on the appointed day, Clisthenes made in­ <lb/>
            quiries of their country, and the family of each ; then detain­ <lb/>
            ing them for a year he made trial of their manly qualities, <lb/>
            their dispositions, learning, and morals ; holding familiar inter­ <lb/>
            course with each separately, and with all together, and leading <lb/>
            out to the gymnasia such of them as were younger; but most <lb/>
            of all he made trial of them at the banquet: for as long as he <lb/>
            detained them, he did this throughout, and at the same time <lb/>
            entertained them magnificently. And somehow of all the <lb/>
            suitors those that had come from Athens pleased him most, and <lb/>
            of these Hippoclides, son of Tisander, was preferred both on <lb/>
            account of his manly qualities, and because he was distantly <lb/>
            related to the Cypselidæ in Corinth. -129. When the day <lb/>
            appointed for the consummation of the marriage arrived, and <lb/>
            for the declaration of Clisthenes himself, whom he would <lb/>
            choose of them all, Clisthenes, having sacrificed a hundred <lb/>
            oxen, entertained both the suitors then selves and all the Sicyo­ <lb/>
            nians ; and when they had concluded the feast, the suitors had <lb/>
            it contest about music, and any subject proposed for convers­ <lb/>
            anon. As the drinking went on, Hippoclides, who much <lb/>
            attracted the attention of the rest, ordered the flute-player to <lb/>
            play a dance; and when the flute-player obeyed, he began to <lb/>
            dance: and he danced, probably, so as to please himself; but <lb/>
            Clisthenes, seeing it, beheld the whole matter with suspicion. <lb/>
            Afterwards, Hippoclides, having rested awhile, ordered some <lb/>
            one to bring in a table ; and when the table came in, he first <lb/>
            danced Laconian figures on it, and .then Attic ones; and in <lb/>
            the third place, having leant his head on the table he gesticu­ <lb/>
            lated with his legs. But Clisthenes, when he danced the first <lb/>
            and second time, revolted from the thought of having Hippo­ <lb/>
            clides for his son-in-law,<unclear>fon</unclear> account ofhis dancing and want <lb/>
            of decorum, yet restrained himself, not wishing to burst out <pb n="403"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="130-133.]"/> <lb/>
            against him; but when he saw him gesticulating with his <lb/>
            legs, he was no longer able to restrain himself, and said: <lb/>
            " Son of Tisander, you have danced away your marriage." <lb/>
            But Hippoclides answered: " No matter to Hippoclides." <lb/>
            Hence this answer became a proverb. 130. Clisthenes, hav­ <lb/>
            ing commanded silence, thus addressed the assembled company: <lb/>
            " Gentlemen, suitors of my daughter, I commend you all, and, <lb/>
            if it were possible, would gratify you all, not selecting one of <lb/>
            you above the others, nor rejecting the rest. But as it is not <lb/>
            possible, since I have to determine about a single damsel, to <lb/>
            indulge the wishes of all; to such of you as are rejected from <lb/>
            the marriage I present a talent of silver to each, on account <lb/>
            of your condescending to take a wife from my family, and of <lb/>
            your absence from home; but to Megacles, son of Alcmæon, <lb/>
            I betroth my daughter Agarista, according to the laws of the <lb/>
            Athenians." When Megacles said that he accepted the be­ <lb/>
            trothal, the marriage was celebrated by Clisthenes. 131. <lb/>
            This happened respecting the decision between the suitors. <lb/>
            and thus the Alcmæonidæ became celebrated throughout <lb/>
            Greece. From this marriage sprung Clisthenes, who estab­ <lb/>
            lished the tribes and a democracy among the Athenians, tak­ <lb/>
            ing his name from his maternal grandfather the Sicyonian ; he <lb/>
            was born to Megacles, as was also Hippocrates: and from <lb/>
            Hippocrates, another Megacles, and another Agarista, who <lb/>
            took her name from Agarista, daughter of Clisthenes, she <lb/>
            having married Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, and being with <lb/>
            child, saw a vision in her sleep, and fancied that she brought <lb/>
            forth a lion ; and after a few days she bore Pericles to Xan­ <lb/>
            thippus.</p>
          <p>. 132. After the defeat of the Persians at Marathon, Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades, who was before highly esteemed among the Athenians, <lb/>
            then still more increased his reputation. Having therefore <lb/>
            asked of the Athenians seventy ships, and troops and money, <lb/>
            without telling them what country he purposed to invade, but <lb/>
            saying that he would make them rich if they would follow <lb/>
            him, for that he would take them to such a country, from <lb/>
            whence they would easily bring abundance of gold; speaking <lb/>
            thus he asked for the ships; and the Athenians, elated by <lb/>
            these hopes, granted them. 133. Miltiades, accordingly, <lb/>
            having taken with him the troops, sailed against Paros, at­ <lb/>
            leging as a pretext, that the Parians had first begun hostilities <note type="footnote"> 2D2</note> <pb n="404"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[134, 13&amp;"/> <lb/>
            by sending a trireme with the Persian to Marathon. Thi? <lb/>
            was his pretended reason; but, in fact, he had a grudge <lb/>
            against the Parians on account of Lysagoras, son of Tisias, <lb/>
            who was a Parian by birth, and had calumniated him to Hy­ <lb/>
            darnes the Persian. Miltiades, having arrived with his forces <lb/>
            at the place to which he was sailing, besieged the Parians, <lb/>
            who were driven within their walls; and sending a herald to <lb/>
            them, he demanded a hundred talents, saying, that if they did <lb/>
            not give him that sum, he would not draw off his army until <lb/>
            he had destroyed them. The Parians never entertained <lb/>
            the thought, whether they should give Miltiades any money ; <lb/>
            but devised means by which they might defend the city; and <lb/>
            in addition to other plans, they also in the several parts where <lb/>
            the wall was most exposed to attack, there raised it, during <lb/>
            the night, to double its former height. 134. Up to this point <lb/>
            of the story all the Greeks agree; but after this the Parians <lb/>
            themselves say that it happened as follows. That when Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades was in a state of perplexity, a captive woman, who was <lb/>
            by birth a Parian, and her name was Timo, conferred with <lb/>
            him; she was an inferior priestess of the infernal goddesses. <lb/>
            When she came into the presence of Miltiades, she advised <lb/>
            him, if he deemed it of great consequence to take Pares, to act <lb/>
            as she should suggest. She then made some suggestion; and <lb/>
            he, coming to the mound that is before the city, leaped over <lb/>
            the fence of Ceres Thesmophora, as he was unable to open the <lb/>
            door; and having leaped over, he went to the temple, for the <lb/>
            purpose of doing something within, either to move some of the <lb/>
            things that may not be moved, or to do something or other, <lb/>
            And he was just at the door, when suddenly a thrill of horror <lb/>
            came over him, and he went back by the same way; and in <lb/>
            leaping over the fence his thigh was dislocated; others say <lb/>
            that he hurt his knee. 135. Miltiades accordingly, being in <lb/>
            a bad plight, sailed back home, neither bringing money to the <lb/>
            Athenians, nor having reduced Pares, but having besieged it <lb/>
            for six and twenty days, and ravaged the island. The Parians, <lb/>
            being informed that Timo, the priestess of the goddesses, had <lb/>
            directed Miltiades, and desiring to punish her for so doing, <lb/>
            sent deputies to the oracle at Delphi, as soon as they were <lb/>
            relieved from the siege: they sent to inquire whether they <lb/>
            should put to death the priestess of the goddesses, for having <lb/>
            made known to the enemy the means of capturing her country, <pb n="405"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="136, 137.]"/> <lb/>
            and for having discovered to Miltiades sacred things, which <lb/>
            ought not to be revealed to the male sex. But the Pythian <lb/>
            did not allow them, saying, " that Timo was not to blame for <lb/>
            this, but that it was fated Miltiades should come to a miserable <lb/>
            end, and she had appeared to him as a guide to misfortunes.” <lb/>
            The Pythian gave this answer to the Parians. 136. When <lb/>
            Miltiades returned from Pares, the Athenians were loud in <lb/>
            their complaints against him, both all others, and especially <lb/>
            Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, who, bringing a capital charge <lb/>
            against Miltiades before the people, prosecuted him on a charge <lb/>
            of deceiving the Athenians. Miltiades, though present in <lb/>
            person, made no defence; for he was unable, as his thigh had <lb/>
            begun to mortify. But while he lay on a couch, his friends <lb/>
            made a defence for him, dwelling much on the battle that had <lb/>
            been fought at Marathon, and on the capture of Lemnos; <lb/>
            since, having taken Lemnos, and inflicted vengeance on the <lb/>
            Pelasgians, he had given it up to the Athenians. The people <lb/>
            so far favouring him as to acquit him of the capital offence, <lb/>
            and having fined him fifty talents for the injury he had done, <lb/>
            Miltiades soon after ended his life by the putrefaction and <lb/>
            mortification of his thigh. His son Cimon paid the fifty <lb/>
            talents.</p>
          <p>137. Miltiades, son of Cimon, had possessed himself of <lb/>
            Lemnos in the following manner. The Pelasgians, when <lb/>
            they had been driven out of Attica by the Athenians, whe­ <lb/>
            ther justly or unjustly,—(for this I am unable to determine, <lb/>
            except so far as is related,) Hecataeus, however, son of Hege­ <lb/>
            sander, says in his history, that it was " unjustly, for that, <lb/>
            when the Athenians saw the lands under Hymettus, which <lb/>
            they had given to the Pelasgians in payment for the wall <lb/>
            they had formerly built about the Acropolis; when the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians saw this well cultivated, which was before barren and <lb/>
            of no value, jealousy and a desire of the land took possession <lb/>
            of them, and so the Athenians drove them out, withou <lb/>
            alleging any other pretence whatever." But as the Athenians <lb/>
            say, "they justly expelled them; for that the Pelasgians, <lb/>
            while settled under Mount Hymettus, made incursions from <lb/>
            thence, and committed the following injuries. For that their <lb/>
            daughters and sons used constantly to go for water to the <lb/>
            Nine Springs, because at that time neither they nor the other <lb/>
            Greeks had domestic servants: and whenever the young wo- <pb n="406"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[138, 139"/> <lb/>
            men went there, the Pelasgians used, out of insolence and <lb/>
            contempt, to offer violence to them; nor were they satisfied <lb/>
            with doing this, but at last they were discovered in the very <lb/>
            act of plotting to attack the city. They add, that they them­ <lb/>
            selves showed themselves so much better men than them, in <lb/>
            that, when it was in their power to put the Pelasgians to death, <lb/>
            since they had found them plotting against them, they would <lb/>
            not do so, but warned them to depart the country; and that <lb/>
            they; accordingly, withdrawing, possessed themselves of other <lb/>
            places, and amongst them, of Lemnos." Hecatæus has given <lb/>
            the former account, and the Athenians give the latter. 138. <lb/>
            But these Pelasgians, who then inhabited Lemnos, and de­ <lb/>
            sired to be revenged on the Athenians, being well acquainted <lb/>
            with the festivals of the Athenians, stationed fifty-oared gal­ <lb/>
            leys and laid an ambuscade for the Athenian women, as they <lb/>
            celebrated the festival of Diana in Brauron, and having car­ <lb/>
            ried many of them away from thence, they sailed off, and <lb/>
            taking them to Lemnos, kept them as concubines. But when <lb/>
            these women were fully supplied with children, they instructed <lb/>
            their sons in the Attic language and the manners of the <lb/>
            Athenians; they, therefore, would not hold any intercourse <lb/>
            with the sons of the Pelasgian women, but if any one of their <lb/>
            number was beaten by one of them, they all immediately <lb/>
            assisted, and revenged one another; moreover, these boys <lb/>
            thought they had a right to govern the other boys, and proved <lb/>
            far superior to them. But the Pelasgians, observing this, <lb/>
            consulted together, and, on consideration, considerable alarm <lb/>
            came over them, as to what these boys would do when they <lb/>
            were grown up, if they already determined to assist each other <lb/>
            against the sons of their lawful wives, and even now endea­ <lb/>
            voured to rule over them. Thereupon, they resolved to murder <lb/>
            the children they had by the Attic women; and, accordingly, <lb/>
            they did so, and moreover put their mothers to death. From <lb/>
            this crime, and that which the women perpetrated before this, <lb/>
            who, with the assistance of Thoas, killed their own husbands, <lb/>
            all enormous actions are wont to be called Lemnian through­ <lb/>
            out Greece. 139. But when the Pelasgians had murdered <lb/>
            their own children and women, neither did their land yield <lb/>
            fruit, nor were their wives and flocks equally prolific as be­ <lb/>
            fore; being, therefore, afflicted by famine and childlessness, <lb/>
            they sent to Delphi, to seek for some deliverance from their <pb n="407"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="140.]"/> <lb/>
            present distresses. But the Pythian bade them give such <lb/>
            satisfaction to the Athenians as the Athenians themselves <lb/>
            should impose. The Pelasgians, therefore, went to Athens. <lb/>
            and professed themselves ready to give satisfaction for the <lb/>
            whole injury. But the Athenians, having spread a couch in <lb/>
            the Prytaneum in the handsomest way they were able, and <lb/>
            having placed by it a table full of all sorts of good things, <lb/>
            commanded the Pelasgians to surrender their country to them, <lb/>
            In such a condition. But the Pelasgians said, in answer, <lb/>
            “When a ship shall perform the voyage in one day by the <lb/>
            north wind from your country to ours, we will then deliver it <lb/>
            up." This they said, supposing that it was impossible the <lb/>
            thing should happen, because Attica lies far to the south of <lb/>
            Lemnos. 140. This took place at that time. But very many <lb/>
            years after this, when the Chersonese in the Hellespont became <lb/>
            subject to the Athenians, Miltiades, son of Cimon, at a time <lb/>
            when the Etesian winds prevailed, having performed the voy­ <lb/>
            age in a ship from Elæus, on the Hellespont, to Lemnos, re­ <lb/>
            quired the Pelasgians to quit the island, reminding them of <lb/>
            the oracle, which the Pelasgians expected could never be ac­ <lb/>
            complished. The Hephæstians accordingly obeyed; but the <lb/>
            Myrinæans, not acknowledging the Chersonese to be Attica, <lb/>
            were besieged until they also surrendered. Thus the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and Miltiades got possession of Lemnos.</p>

          <p>WHEN the news of the battle fought at Marathon reached Da­ <lb/>
            rius, son of Hystaspes, who was before much exasperated with <lb/>
            the Athenians on account of the attack upon Sardis, he then <lb/>
            became much more incensed, and was still more eager to pro­ <lb/>
            secute the war against Greece. Having therefore immediately <lb/>
            sent messengers to the several cities, he enjoined them to pre­ <lb/>
            pare an army, imposing on each a much greater number than <pb n="408"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[2, 3"/> <lb/>
            they had furnished before, and ships, horses, corn, and trans­ <lb/>
            ports. When these orders were proclaimed round about, <lb/>
            Asia was thrown into agitation during the space of three <lb/>
            years, the bravest men being enrolled and prepared for the <lb/>
            purpose of invading Greece. But in the fourth year the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians, who had been subdued by Cambyses, revolted from the <lb/>
            Persians; whereupon Darius only became more eager to <lb/>
            march against both. 2. When Darius was preparing for his <lb/>
            expeditions against Egypt and Athens, a violent dissension <lb/>
            arose between his sons concerning the sovereignty; for <lb/>
            by the customs of the Persians he was obliged to nominate <lb/>
            his successor, before he marched out on any expedition. Now <lb/>
            Darius, even before he became king, had three sons born to <lb/>
            him by his former wife, the daughter of Gobryas; and after <lb/>
            his accession to the throne, four others by Atossa, daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of Cyrus. Of the former, Artabazanes was the eldest; <lb/>
            of those after born, Xerxes: and these two not being of the <lb/>
            same mother, were at variance. Artabazanes urged that he <lb/>
            was the eldest of all the sons, and that it was the established <lb/>
            usage among all men that the eldest son should succeed to the <lb/>
            sovereignty: on the other hand, Xerxes alleged that he was <lb/>
            son of Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who <lb/>
            had acquired freedom for the Persians. 3. When Darius had <lb/>
            not yet declared his opinion, at this very conjuncture, Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus, son of Ariston, happened to come up to Susa, having <lb/>
            been deprived of the kingly office at Sparta,' and having im­ <lb/>
            posed on himself a voluntary exile from Lacedæmon. This <lb/>
            man, having heard of the difference between the sons of Da­ <lb/>
            rius, went to Xerxes, as report says, and advised him to say <lb/>
            in addition to what he had already said ; that "he was born to <lb/>
            Darius after he had become king, and was possessed of the <lb/>
            empire of the Persians; whereas Artabazanes was born to <lb/>
            Darius while he was yet a private person; wherefore it was <lb/>
            not reasonable or just that any other should possess that dig­ <lb/>
            nity in preference to himself, since in Sparta also," Demaratus <lb/>
            continued to suggest, "this custom prevailed, that if soma <lb/>
            children were born before their father became king, and one <lb/>
            was born subsequently when he had now come to the throne, <lb/>
            this last born son should succeed to the kingdom." Xerxes <lb/>
            having availed himself of the suggestion of Demaratus, Da- <note type="footnote"> See B. VI. chap. 70 </note> <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="4—5.]"/> <lb/>
            rius, acknowledging that he said what was just, declared him <lb/>
            king. But it appears to me that even without this suggestion <lb/>
            Xerxes would have been made king; for Atossa had un­ <lb/>
            bounded influence. 4. Darius, having appointed Xerxes to <lb/>
            be king over the Persians, prepared to march. However <lb/>
            after these things, and in the year after the revolt of Egypt, <lb/>
            it happened that Darius himself, while he was making pre­ <lb/>
            parations, died, having reigned thirty-six years in all; nor <lb/>
            was he able to avenge himself either on the Egyptians, who <lb/>
            had revolted, or on the Athenians. When Darius was dead, <lb/>
            the kingdom devolved on his son Xerxes.</p>
          <p>5. Xerxes, however, was at first by no means inclined to <lb/>
            make war against Greece, but he levied forces for the reduc­ <lb/>
            tion of Egypt. But Mardonius, son of Gobryas, who was <lb/>
            cousin to Xerxes, and son of Darius's sister, being present, <lb/>
            and having the greatest influence with him of all the Persians, <lb/>
            constantly held the following language, saying, " Sir, it is not <lb/>
            right that the Athenians, having already done much mischief <lb/>
            to the Persians, should go unpunished for what they have <lb/>
            done. However, for the present, finish the enterprise you <lb/>
            have in hand; and when you have quelled the insolence of <lb/>
            Egypt, lead your army against Athens; that you may acquire <lb/>
            a good reputation among men, and any one for the future may <lb/>
            be cautious of marching against your territory." This lan­ <lb/>
            guage was used by him for the purposes of revenge, but he <lb/>
            frequently made the following addition to it, that Europe <lb/>
            was a very beautiful country, and produced all kinds of culti­ <lb/>
            vated trees, and was very fertile, and worthy to be possessed <lb/>
            by the king alone of all mortals." 6. He spake thus, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was desirous of new enterprises, and wished to be <lb/>
            himself governor of Greece: in time he effected his purpose, <lb/>
            and persuaded Xerxes to do as he advised ; for other things <lb/>
            happening favourably assisted him in persuading Xerxes. In <lb/>
            the first place messengers coming from Thessaly on the part <lb/>
            of the Aleuadæ, invited the king, with earnest importunity, to <lb/>
            invade Greece : these Aleuadæ were kings of Thessaly. And <lb/>
            in the next place, those of the Pisistratidæ, who had gone up <lb/>
            to Susa, holding the same language as the Aleuadæ, still more <lb/>
            eagerly pressed him, having with them Onomacritus, an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, a soothsayer and dispenser of the oracles of Musæus. <lb/>
            For they went up to Susa, having first reconciled their former <pb n="410"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[7, 8."/> <lb/>
            enmity with him. For Onomacritus had been banished from <lb/>
            Athens by Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus, having been de­ <lb/>
            tected by Lasus the Hermionian, in the very act of interpo­ <lb/>
            lating among the oracles of Musæus, one importing, that the <lb/>
            islands lying off Lemnos would disappear beneath the sea: <lb/>
            wherefore Hipparchus banished him, although he had before <lb/>
            been very familiar with him. But at that time having gone <lb/>
            up with them, whenever he came into the presence of the king, <lb/>
            as the Pisistratidæ spoke of him in very high terms, he recited <lb/>
            some of the oracles; if, however, there was amongst them any <lb/>
            that portended misfortune to the barbarians, of these he made <lb/>
            no mention ; but selecting such as were most favourable, lie <lb/>
            said it was fated that the Hellespont should be bridged over <lb/>
            by a Persian, describing the march. Thus he continually <lb/>
            assailed2 the king, rehearsing oracles, as did the Pisistratidæ <lb/>
            and Aleuadæ, by declaring their opinions. 7. When Xerxes <lb/>
            was persuaded to make war against Greece, he then, in the <lb/>
            second year after the death of Darius, first made an expedition <lb/>
            against those who had revolted; and, having subdued them and <lb/>
            reduced all Egypt to a worse state of servitude than it was <lb/>
            under Darius, he committed the government to Achæmenes, his <lb/>
            own brother, and son of Darius. Some time after, Inarus,3 son <lb/>
            of Psammitichus, a Libyan, slew Achæmenes, to whom the <lb/>
            government of Egypt was committed.</p>
          <p>8. Xerxes, after the reduction of Egypt, when he was about <lb/>
            to take in hand the expedition against Athens, convoked an as­ <lb/>
            sembly of the principal Persians, that he might both hear their <lb/>
            opinions, and himself make known his intentions before them all. <lb/>
            When they were assembled Xerxes addressed them as follows : <lb/>
            (1.) “Men of Persia, I shall not be the first to introduce this <lb/>
            custom among you, but shall adopt it, having received it from <lb/>
            my forefathers. For, as I learn from older men, we have never <lb/>
            remained inactive since we wrested the sovereign power from <lb/>
            the Medes, and Cyrus overthrew Astyages: but the deity thus <lb/>
            leads the way, and to us who follow his guidance many things <lb/>
            result to our advantage. What deeds Cyrus, and Cambyses, <lb/>
            and my father Darius have achieved, and what nations they <lb/>
            have added to our empire, no one need mention to you who <lb/>
            know them well. But I, since I have succeeded to the throne, <note type="footnote">2 Or conducted himself.” </note><note type="footnote">3 See B. III. chap. 12. </note> <pb n="411"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="8.] "/>have carefully considered this, in what way I may not fall <lb/>
            short of my predecessors in this honour, nor acquire less addi­ <lb/>
            tional power to the Persians. And on mature consideration, <lb/>
            I find that we may at once acquire an increase of glory, and a <lb/>
            country not inferior nor poorer, but even more productive than <lb/>
            that we now possess; and at the same time that satisfaction <lb/>
            and vengeance will accrue to us. Wherefore I have now <lb/>
            called you together, that I may communicate to you what I <lb/>
            purpose to do. (2.) I intend to throw a bridge over the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont, and to march an army through Europe against Greece, <lb/>
            that I may punish the Athenians for the injuries they have <lb/>
            done to the Persians and to my father. You have already <lb/>
            seen Darius preparing to make war against those people ; but <lb/>
            he died, and had it not in his power to avenge himself. But <lb/>
            I, in his cause and that of the other Persians, will not rest till <lb/>
            I have taken and burnt Athens; for they first began by doing <lb/>
            acts of injustice against my father and me. First of all having <lb/>
            come to Sardis, with Aristagoras the Milesian, our servant, <lb/>
            on their arrival they burnt down both the groves and the <lb/>
            temples. And, secondly, how they treated us on our making <lb/>
            a descent on their territory, when Datis and Artaphernes led <lb/>
            our forces, you all know well enough. (3.) For these reasons, <lb/>
            therefore, I have resolved to make war upon them. And on <lb/>
            reflection, I'find the following advantages in this course: if <lb/>
            we'shall subdue them, and their neighbours, who inhabit the <lb/>
            country of Pelops the Phrygian, we shall make the Persian <lb/>
            territory co-extensive with the air of heaven; nor will the <lb/>
            sun look down upon any land that borders on ours; but I, <lb/>
            with your assistance, will make them all one territory, march­ <lb/>
            ing through the whole of Europe. For I am informed that <lb/>
            such is the case; and that no city or nation of the world will <lb/>
            • remain, which will be able to come to a battle with us, when <lb/>
            chose whom I have mentioned have been brought into subjec­ <lb/>
            tion. Thus, both those who are guilty, and those who are not <lb/>
            guilty, must equally submit to the yoke of servitude. (4.) But <lb/>
            you, by doing what I require, will gratify me exceedingly; <lb/>
            when I shall have informed you of the time, it will be the <lb/>
            duty of each of you to come promptly. And whosoever shall <lb/>
            appear with the best-appointed troops, to him I will give such <lb/>
            presents as are accounted most honourable in our country. <lb/>
            -But that I may not appear to follow my own counsel only. <pb n="412"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[9."/> <lb/>
            I lay the matter before you, bidding any one of you who <lb/>
            wishes, to declare his opinion." Having said this, he ceased.</p>
          <p>9. After him Mardonius spoke: " Sir, not only are you the <lb/>
            most. excellent-of all the Persians that have yet been, but even <lb/>
            of all that ever shall be; you also, in other respects, have in <lb/>
            speaking touched upon the most important topics and the most <lb/>
            exact truth, and especially will not suffer the Ionians, who <lb/>
            dwell in Europe, to mock us, worthless as they are. For it <lb/>
            would indeed be a great indignity, if, having subdued the <lb/>
            Sacae, Indians, Ethiopians, and Assyrians, and other nations, <lb/>
            many and powerful, which never did the Persians any wrong, <lb/>
            but, in order only to enlarge our dominions, we hold them in <lb/>
            servitude; and yet shall not avenge ourselves on the Greeks, <lb/>
            who were the first to commit injustice. Having what to fear ? <lb/>
            what confluence of numbers? what power of wealth? (1.) <lb/>
            We are acquainted with their manner of fighting; and we <lb/>
            are acquainted with their power, that it is weak. We hold <lb/>
            their children in subjection, those who dwell within our terri­ <lb/>
            tories, and are called Ionians, Æolians, and Dorians. I my­ <lb/>
            self have made trial of these men already, marching against <lb/>
            them at the command of your father; and when I advanced <lb/>
            as far as Macedonia, and was within a short distance of reach­ <lb/>
            ing Athens itself, no one opposed me in battle. (2.) And yet <lb/>
            the Greeks are accustomed, as I am informed, to undertake <lb/>
            wars without deliberation, from obstinacy and folly. For <lb/>
            when they have declared war against one another, having <lb/>
            found out the fairest and most level spot, they go down to it <lb/>
            and fight; so that the conquerors depart with great loss, and <lb/>
            of the conquered I say nothing at all, for they are utterly <lb/>
            destroyed. Whereas, being of the same language, they ought, <lb/>
            by the intervention of heralds and ambassadors, to adjust their <lb/>
            differences, and in any way rather than by fighting. But if <lb/>
            they must needs go to war with each other, they ought to find <lb/>
            out where they are each least likely to be conquered, and there <lb/>
            try the issue of a battle. The Greeks, accordingly, adopting a <lb/>
            disadvantageous method, when I marched as far as Macedonia, <lb/>
            never ventured so far as to come to a battle. (3.) Will any <lb/>
            one, then, 0 king, have recourse to war, and oppose you, when <lb/>
            you lead the multitudes of Asia, and all her ships ? In my <lb/>
            opinion, indeed, the Grecians will never proceed to such a <lb/>
            degree of audacity. But if I should happen to be deceived <pb n="413"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="10.] "/>in my opinion, and they, elated by folly, should come to battle <lb/>
            with us, they will learn, that of all men we are the most <lb/>
            skilled in war. Let nothing then be untried; for nothing is <lb/>
            accomplished of its own self, but all things are usually achieved <lb/>
            by men through endeavours." Mardonius, having thus smoothed <lb/>
            over the opinion of Xerxes, ceased to speak.</p>
          <p>10. The rest of the Persians continuing silent, and not <lb/>
            daring to declare an opinion to the one proposed, Artabanus, <lb/>
            son of Hystaspes, being uncle to Xerxes, and relying on this, <lb/>
            spoke as follows: (1.) " 0 king, unless opinions opposite to <lb/>
            each other are spoken, it is impossible to choose the better, <lb/>
            but it becomes necessary to adopt that which has been ad­ <lb/>
            vanced ; whereas, when various opinions have been given, it <lb/>
            is possible: just as with unalloyed gold, we cannot distinguish <lb/>
            it by itself, but when we have rubbed it by the side of other <lb/>
            gold, we do distinguish the better. I warned your father and <lb/>
            my brother not to make war upon the Scythians,4 a people <lb/>
            who have no city in any part of their territory; but he, <lb/>
            hoping to subdue the Scythian nomades, heeded not my ad­ <lb/>
            vice, and having led an army against them, returned with the <lb/>
            loss of many brave men of his army. But you, 0 king, are <lb/>
            about to make war on men far superior to the Scythians; <lb/>
            who are said to be most valiant both by sea and .land; it is, <lb/>
            therefore, right that I should inform you of the danger we <lb/>
            have to fear. (2.) You say, that having thrown a bridge <lb/>
            over the Hellespont, you will march an army through Europe <lb/>
            into Greece; now, it may happen that we shall be worsted <lb/>
            either by land or by sea, or even by both ; for the people are <lb/>
            said to be valiant; and this we may infer, since the Athenians <lb/>
            alone destroyed so great an army that invaded the Attic ter­ <lb/>
            ritory, under Datis and Artaphernes. They were not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, successful in both; but if they should attack us with <lb/>
            their fleet, and having obtained a naval victory, should sail <lb/>
            to the Hellespont, and destroy the bridge, this surely, 0 king, <lb/>
            were a great danger. (3.) Nor do I found this conjecture on <lb/>
            any wisdom of my own, but from the calamity that once all <lb/>
            but befel us, when your father, having joined the shores of <lb/>
            the Thracian Bosphorus, and thrown a bridge over the Ister, <lb/>
            crossed over to attack the Scythians ; then the Scythians used <lb/>
            every means to induce the lonians, to whom the guard of the <note type="footnote"> 4 See B IV rb 83. </note> <pb n="414"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[10."/> <lb/>
            passage over the Ister had been intrusted, to break up the <lb/>
            bridge: and if, at that time, Histiæus, tyrant of Miletus, had <lb/>
            assented to the opinion of the other tyrants, and had not op­ <lb/>
            posed it, the power of the Persians would have been utterly <lb/>
            ruined. It is dreadful even to hear it said, that the whole <lb/>
            power of the king depended on a single man. (4.) Do not,, <lb/>
            therefore, willingly expose yourself to any such danger, when <lb/>
            there is no necessity; but be persuaded by me; dismiss this <lb/>
            assembly; and hereafter, whenever it shall seem fit to you, <lb/>
            having considered with yourself, proclaim what appears to <lb/>
            you to be most advantageous. For to deliberate well, I find <lb/>
            is the greatest gain. For if the result prove unfortunate, the <lb/>
            matter has, nevertheless, been well deliberated on, but our <lb/>
            deliberation is defeated by fortune ; but he who has deliberated <lb/>
            badly, if fortune attend him, has met with a success he had no <lb/>
            right to expect, but has, nevertheless, formed bad plans. (5.) <lb/>
            Do you see how the deity strikes with his thunder the tallest <lb/>
            animals, and suffers them not to be ostentatious, but the smaller <lb/>
            ones do not at all offend him ? Do you see how he ever hurls <lb/>
            his bolts against the loftiest buildings, and trees of the like <lb/>
            kind ? For the deity is wont to cut off every thing that is <lb/>
            too highly exalted. Thus, even a large army is often defeated <lb/>
            by a small one, in such manner as this: when the deity, <lb/>
            through jealousy, strikes them with terror or lightning, <lb/>
            whereby they perish in a manner unworthy of themselves; <lb/>
            for the deity will not suffer any one but himself to have high <lb/>
            thoughts. (6.) Again, to hasten any matter produces failures, <lb/>
            from whence great losses are wont to follow; but in delay <lb/>
            there are advantages, which, though not immediately apparent, <lb/>
            yet one may discover after a time. This, then, 0 king, is <lb/>
            the advice I give you. (7.) But do you, Mardonius, son of <lb/>
            Gobryas, cease to speak vain words of the Grecians, who do <lb/>
            not deserve to be spoken lightly of. For by calumniating the <lb/>
            Greeks, you urge the king himself to lead an army against <lb/>
            them; and to this end you appear to me to exert all your <lb/>
            efforts. But may it not so be. For calumny is the worst of <lb/>
            evils; in it there are two who commit injustice, and one whc <lb/>
            is injured: for he who calumniates another, acts unjustly by <lb/>
            accusing one that is not present : and he acts unjustly, whe <lb/>
            is persuaded before he has learnt the exact truth; and he that <lb/>
            is absent when the charge is made, is thus doubly injure l. <pb n="415"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="22.1"/> <lb/>
            being calumniated by the one, and by the other deemed to be <lb/>
            base. (8.) But if, at all events, it must needs be, that war <lb/>
            must be made on these people, come, let the king himself re­ <lb/>
            main in the abodes of the Persians ; let both of us risk our <lb/>
            children, and do you lead the expedition, having selected what <lb/>
            men you choose, and taken with you as large a force as you <lb/>
            think fit; and if matters succeed to the king in the manner <lb/>
            you say, let my children be put to death, and me also with <lb/>
            them. But if the event prove such as I foretel, then let your <lb/>
            children suffer the same, and -you also with them, if ever you <lb/>
            return. If, however, you are unwilling to submit to these <lb/>
            terms, and will at all events lead an army against Greece, I <lb/>
            affirm, that some of those who are left in this country, will <lb/>
            hearthat Mardonius, having brought some great disaster upon <lb/>
            the Persians, and being torn in pieces by dogs and birds, <lb/>
            either in the territory of the Athenians, or in that of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, if not sooner on his march, has discovered5 against <lb/>
            what sort of men you now persuade the king to make war."</p>
          <p>11. Artabanus thus spoke, but Xerxes, inflamed with anger, <lb/>
            answered as follows : " Artabanus, you are my father's bro­ <lb/>
            ther ; this will protect you from receiving the just recompence <lb/>
            bf your foolish words. However I inflict this disgrace upon <lb/>
            rou, base and cowardly as you are, not to accompany me in my <lb/>
            expedition against Greece, but to remain here with the women; <lb/>
            ind I, without your assistance, will accomplish all that I have <lb/>
            said. For I should not be sprung from Darius, son of Hys­ <lb/>
            taspes, son of Arsames, son of Ariaramnes, son of Teispes, son <lb/>
            )f Cyrus, son of Cambyses, son of Achæmenes, if I did not <lb/>
            avenge myself on the Athenians, knowing full well that if we <lb/>
            continue quiet, yet they will not, but will even invade our <lb/>
            territories, if we may conjecture from what has been already <lb/>
            lone by them, who have both burnt Sardis, and advanced into <lb/>
            Asia. Wherefore it is not possible for either party to retreat, <lb/>
            but the alternative lies before us to do or suffer: so that all these <lb/>
            lominions must fall under the power of the Grecians, or all <lb/>
            heirs under that of the Persians; for there is no medium in <lb/>
            his enmity. It is therefore honourable for us, who have first <note type="footnote"> * Larcher, with whom Baehr appears to agree, refers <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνόντα</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινα</foreign>: <unclear/><lb/>
            n that case the meaning of the passage being, that " those who remain <lb/>
            t homewill, when they hear of the disasters that have befallen Mardoni us <lb/>
            and the learn what an enemy they have had to contend with.” </note> <pb n="416"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[12-14."/> <lb/>
            suffered, to take revenge, that I may also be informed of the <lb/>
            danger to which I shall expose myself, by marching against <lb/>
            those men, whom Pelops the Phrygian, who was a slave of <lb/>
            my ancestors, so completely subdued, that even to this day the <lb/>
            people themselves and their country are called after the name <lb/>
            of the conqueror."</p>
          <p>12. These things were said so far: but afterwards night <lb/>
            came on, and the opinion of Artabanus occasioned uneasiness <lb/>
            to Xerxes, and deliberating with himself during the night, he <lb/>
            clearly discovered that it would not be to his interest to make <lb/>
            war on Greece: having thus altered his resolution, he fell <lb/>
            asleep; and some time in the night, he saw the following <lb/>
            vision, as is related by the Persians. Xerxes imagined that a <lb/>
            tall and handsome man stood by him, and said : " Do you then <lb/>
            change your mind, 0 Persian, and resolve not to lead an army <lb/>
            against Greece, after having ordered the Persians to assemble <lb/>
            their forces? You do not well to change your resolution, nor <lb/>
            is there any man who will agree with you. Therefore pursue <lb/>
            that course which you resolved upon in the day." Xerxes <lb/>
            thought that the man, having pronounced these words, flew <lb/>
            away. 13. When day dawned, he paid no attention to this <lb/>
            dream, but having assembled those Persians whom he had be­ <lb/>
            fore convened, he addressed them as follows: " Pardon me, <lb/>
            O Persians, that I suddenly change my plans; for I have not <lb/>
            yet attained to the highest perfection of judgment, and they <lb/>
            who persuade me to this enterprise, are never absent from me. <lb/>
            When therefore I heard the opinion of Artabanus, my youth <lb/>
            immediately boiled with rage against him, so that I threw out <lb/>
            words more unbecoming than I ought to a person of his years. <lb/>
            But now, conscious of my error, I will follow his advice: since <lb/>
            therefore I have changed my resolution, and determined not <lb/>
            to make war against Greece, do you remain quiet." The Per­ <lb/>
            sians, when they heard this, being transported with joy, did him <lb/>
            homage. 14. When night came, the same dream, again stand­ <lb/>
            ing by Xerxes as he slept, said: " Son of Darius, you have then <lb/>
            openly renounced, in the presence of the Persians, the intended <lb/>
            expedition ; and make no account of my words, as if you had <lb/>
            not heard them from any one. Be well assured, however, of <lb/>
            this, that unless you immediately undertake this expedition, <lb/>
            this will be the consequence to you; as you have become <lb/>
            great and powerful in a short time, so you shall become low <pb n="417"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="15,16.]"/> <lb/>
            again in an equally short space." 15. Xerxes, being alarmed <lb/>
            by this vision, rushed from his bed, and sent a messenger to <lb/>
            call Artabanus; and when he came, Xerxes spoke to him as <lb/>
            follows: "Artabanus, I on the moment was not in my senses, <lb/>
            when I used hasty words to you in return for your good advice ; <lb/>
            however, after no long time I repented, and acknowledged that <lb/>
            those measures which you suggested ought to be adopted by <lb/>
            me. I am not, however, able to perform them, though desirous <lb/>
            of doing so; for after I had altered my resolution, and acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged my error, a dream frequently presents itself to me, by <lb/>
            no means approving of my so doing; and it has just now <lb/>
            vanished, after threatening me. If, then, it is a deity who <lb/>
            sends this dream, and it is his pleasure that an expedition <lb/>
            against Greece should at all events take place, this same dream <lb/>
            will also flit before you, and give the same injunction as to <lb/>
            me. This I think will happen, if you should take all my ap­ <lb/>
            parel, and having put it on, should afterwards sit on my throne, <lb/>
            and then go to sleep in my bed." 16. Xerxes thus addressed <lb/>
            him; but Artabanus not obeying the first order, as he did not <lb/>
            think himself worthy to sit on the royal throne, when he was <lb/>
            at last compelled, did as he was desired, after he had spoken <lb/>
            as follows. (1.) ”I deem it an equal merit, 0 king, to form <lb/>
            good plans, and to be willing to yield to one who gives good <lb/>
            advice : and though both of these qualities attach to you, the <lb/>
            converse of wicked men leads you astray; just as blasts of <lb/>
            wind falling on the sea, which of all things is the most useful <lb/>
            to mankind, do not suffer it to follow its proper nature. As <lb/>
            for me, grief did not so much vex me at hearing your re­ <lb/>
            proaches, as that when two opinions were proposed by the <lb/>
            Persians, one tending to increase their arrogance, the other to <lb/>
            check it, and to show how hurtful it is to teach the mind to be <lb/>
            constantly seeking for more than we already possess; that, when <lb/>
            these two opinions were proposed, you should choose that which <lb/>
            is more dangerous both to yourself and the Persians. (2.) <lb/>
            Now, however, after you have changed to the better resolu <lb/>
            tion, you say, that since you have given up the expedition <lb/>
            against the Greeks, a dream has come to you, sent by some <lb/>
            god, which forbids you to abandon the enterprise. But these <lb/>
            things, my son, are not divine, for dreams which wander <lb/>
            among men, are such as I will explain to you, being many <lb/>
            years older than you are. Those visions of dreams most com- <note type="footnote"> 2 E </note> <pb n="418"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[17, If,"/> <lb/>
            monly hover around men, respecting things which one has <lb/>
            thought of during the day; and we, during the preceding <lb/>
            days, have been very much busied about this expedition. (3.) <lb/>
            If, however, this is not such as I judge, but has something <lb/>
            divine in it, you have correctly summed up the whole in few <lb/>
            words ; then let it appear and give the same injunction to me <lb/>
            as to you: and it ought not to appear to me any the more for <lb/>
            my having your apparel than my own; nor the more because <lb/>
            I go to sleep on your bed than on my own; if indeed it will <lb/>
            appear at all. For that which has appeared to you in your <lb/>
            sleep, whatever it be, can never arrive to such a degree of <lb/>
            simplicity as to suppose that when it sees me, it is you, conjec­ <lb/>
            turing from your apparel. But if it shall hold me in contempt, <lb/>
            and not deign to appear to me, whether I be clothed in your <lb/>
            robes or in my own; and if it shall visit you again, this in­ <lb/>
            deed would deserve consideration: for if it should repeatedly <lb/>
            visit you, I should myself confess it to be divine. If, however, <lb/>
            you have resolved that so it should be, and it is not possible <lb/>
            to avert this, but I must needs sleep in your bed, well, when <lb/>
            this has been done, let it appear also to me. But till that <lb/>
            time I shall persist in my present opinion." 17. Artabanus, <lb/>
            having spoken thus, and hoping to show that Xerxes had said <lb/>
            nothing of any moment, did what was ordered : and having <lb/>
            put on the apparel of Xerxes and sat in the royal throne, <lb/>
            when he afterwards went to bed, the same dream which had <lb/>
            appeared to Xerxes, came to him when he was asleep, and <lb/>
            standing over Artabanus, spoke as follows: " Art thou, then, the <lb/>
            man who dissuadeth Xerxes from invading Greece, as if thou <lb/>
            wert very anxious for him ? But neitner hereafter nor at pre­ <lb/>
            sent shalt thou escape unpunished for endeavouring to avert <lb/>
            what is fated to be. What Xerxes must suffer if he continues <lb/>
            disobedient, has been declared to him himself." 18. Artabanus <lb/>
            imagined that the dream uttered these threats, and was about <lb/>
            to burn out his eyes with hot irons. He therefore, having <lb/>
            uttered a loud shriek, leapt up, and seating himself by Xerxes, <lb/>
            when he had related all the particulars of the vision in the <lb/>
            dream, spoke to him in this manner: " I, 0 king, being a man <lb/>
            who have seen already many and greet powers overthrown by <lb/>
            inferior ones, would not suffer you to yield entirely to youth ; <lb/>
            knowing how mischievous it is to desire much, calling to mind <lb/>
            the expedition of Cyrus against the Massagetæ, how it fared, <pb n="419"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="19, 20.]"/> <lb/>
            and calling to mind also that of Cambyses against the Ethio­ <lb/>
            pians, and having accompanied Darius in the invasion of Scy­ <lb/>
            thia, knowing all these things, I was of opinion, that if you <lb/>
            remained quiet, you must be pronounced happy by all men. <lb/>
            But since some divine impulse has sprung up, and, as it seems, <lb/>
            some heaven-sent destruction impends over the Greeks, I <lb/>
            myself am converted, and change my opinion. Do you, then, <lb/>
            make known to the Persians the intimation sent by the deity, <lb/>
            and command them to follow the orders first given by you for <lb/>
            the preparations; and act so, that, since the deity permits, <lb/>
            nothing on your part may be wanting." When he had thus <lb/>
            spoken, both being carried away by the vision, as soon as <lb/>
            it was day Xerxes acquainted the Persians with what had <lb/>
            happened; and Artabanus, who before was the only man who <lb/>
            greatly opposed the expedition, now as openly promoted it.</p>
          <p>19. After this, when Xerxes was resolved to undertake, <lb/>
            the expedition, another vision appeared to him in his sleep, <lb/>
            which the magi, when they heard it, interpreted to relate to <lb/>
            the whole world, and to signify that all mankind should serve <lb/>
            him. The vision was as follows: Xerxes imagined that he <lb/>
            was crowned with the sprig of an olive-tree, and that branches <lb/>
            from this olive covered the whole earth ; and that afterwards <lb/>
            the crown that was placed on his head disappeared. The magi <lb/>
            having given this interpretation, every one of the Persians, <lb/>
            who were then assembled, departed immediately to his own <lb/>
            government, and used all diligence to execute what had been <lb/>
            ordered; every man hoping to obtain the proposed reward: <lb/>
            Xerxes thus levied his army, searching out every region of <lb/>
            the continent. 20. For from the reduction of Egypt, he <lb/>
            was employed four whole years in assembling his forces, and <lb/>
            providing things necessary for the expedition. In the course <lb/>
            of the fifth year he began his march with a vast multitude ot <lb/>
            men. For of the expeditions with which we are acquaint <lb/>
            ed, this was by far the greatest, so that that of Darius against <lb/>
            the Scythians appears nothing in comparison with this, <lb/>
            nor the Scythian, when the Scythians, pursuing the Cimme­ <lb/>
            rians, and invading the Medic territory, subdued almost the <lb/>
            whole of the upper part of Asia, on account of which Darius <lb/>
            afterwards attempted to inflict vengeance on them; nor, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to what is related, that of the Atrides against Ilium ; <lb/>
            nor that of the Mvsians and Teucrians, which took place be- <note type="footnote"> 2E2</note> <pb n="420"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[21—23."/> <lb/>
            fore the Trojan war, who having passed over into Europe by <lb/>
            the Bosphorus, subdued all the Thracians; and went down to <lb/>
            the Ionian Sea, and marched southward as far as the river <lb/>
            Peneus. 21. All these expeditions, and any others, if there <lb/>
            have been any besides them, are not to be compared with this <lb/>
            one. For what nation did not Xerxes lead out of Asia against <lb/>
            Greece ? what stream, being drunk, did not fail him, except <lb/>
            that of great rivers? Some supplied ships; others were <lb/>
            ordered to furnish men for the infantry, from others cavalry <lb/>
            wore required, from others transports for horses, together with <lb/>
            men to serve in the army; others had to furnish long ships for <lb/>
            the bridges, and others provisions and vessels.</p>
          <p>22. And first of all, as those who had first attempted to <lb/>
            double Mount Athos had met with disasters, preparations <lb/>
            were being made for nearly three years about Athos. For <lb/>
            triremes were stationed at Eleus in the Chersonese, and pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from thence, men of every nation from the army duty <lb/>
            under the lash; and they went in succession ; and the people <lb/>
            who dwelt round Athos dug also. Bubares, son of Megabazus, <lb/>
            and Artachæus, son of Artæus, both Persians, presided over <lb/>
            the work. Athos is a vast and celebrated mountain, stretch­ <lb/>
            ing into the sea, and inhabited by men. Where the mountain <lb/>
            terminates towards the continent, it is in the form of a penin­ <lb/>
            sula, and is an isthmus of about twelve stades: this is a plain <lb/>
            with hills of no great height from the sea of the Acanthians <lb/>
            to the sea which is opposite Torone. On this isthmus, in <lb/>
            which Mount Athos terminates, stands Sana, a Grecian city; <lb/>
            but those within Sana and situate on Athos itself, which the <lb/>
            Persian then was proceeding to make insular instead of conti­ <lb/>
            nental, are the following, Dion, Olophyxus, Acrothoon, Thys­ <lb/>
            sus, and Cleonæ. These are the cities which occupy Mount <lb/>
            Athos. 23. They made the excavation as follows: the bar­ <lb/>
            barians divided the ground among the several nations, having <lb/>
            drawn a straight line near the city of Sana; and when the <lb/>
            trench was deep, some standing at the bottom continued to dig, <lb/>
            and others handed the soil that was dug out to men who stood <lb/>
            above on ladders; they again in turn handed it to others, until <lb/>
            they reached those that were at the top ; these last carried it <lb/>
            off and threw it away. To all the rest, except the Phœni­ <lb/>
            cians, the brink of the excavation falling in gave double la­ <lb/>
            bour for as they made the upper opening and the lower of <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="24—26.]"/> <lb/>
            equal dimensions, this must necessarily happen. But the <lb/>
            Phœnicians show their skill in other works, and especially <lb/>
            did so in this; for having received the portion that fell to <lb/>
            their share, they dug it, making the upper opening of the <lb/>
            trench twice as large as it was necessary for the trench itself <lb/>
            to be; and as the work proceeded they contracted it gradually, <lb/>
            so that when they came to the bottom the work was equal in <lb/>
            width to the rest: near adjoining is a meadow, where they <lb/>
            had a market and bazaar, and great abundance of meal was <lb/>
            brought to them from Asia. 24. According to my deliberate <lb/>
            opinion,6 Xerxes ordered this excavation to be made from mo­ <lb/>
            tives of ostentation, wishing to display his power, and to leave <lb/>
            a memorial of himself. For though it was possible, without <lb/>
            any great labour, to have drawn the ships over the isthmus, he <lb/>
            commanded them to dig a channel for the sea of such a width <lb/>
            that two triremes might pass through rowed abreast. And <lb/>
            the same persons, to whom the excavation was committed, <lb/>
            were ordered also to throw a bridge over the river Strymon. <lb/>
            25. These things, then, he thus contrived: he also caused <lb/>
            cables of papyrus and of white flax to be prepared for the <lb/>
            bridges, having ordered the Phoenicians and Egyptians also to <lb/>
            lay up provisions for the army, that neither the men nor the <lb/>
            beasts of burden might suffer from famine on their march to­ <lb/>
            wards Greece ; and having informed himself of the situations of <lb/>
            the places, he ordered them to lay up the provisions where it <lb/>
            was most convenient, conveying them to various quarters in <lb/>
            merchant-ships and transports from all parts of Asia. Of <lb/>
            these provisions the largest quantity they conveyed to a place <lb/>
            called Leuce-Acte, in Thrace'; some were ordered to Tyrodiza <lb/>
            of the Perinthians, others to Doriscus, others to Eion on the <lb/>
            Strymon, and others to Macedonia.</p>
          <p>26. While these men were employed in their appointed <lb/>
            task, the whole land forces, having been assembled, marched <lb/>
            with Xerxes to Sardis, having set out from Critalla in Cap­ <lb/>
            padocia, for it was ordered that all the troops throughout the <lb/>
            continent, that were to march with Xerxes himself, should be <lb/>
            assembled at that place. Now which of the generals, bring­ <lb/>
            in- the best appointed troops, received the gifts promised by <lb/>
            the king, I am unable to mention; for I am not at all aware <note type="footnote">6 Literally, " as I conjecturing discover." </note> <pb n="422"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[27— y "/>that they came to any decision on this point. They then, whe <lb/>
            having crossed the river Halys they entered Phrygia, march <lb/>
            ing through that country, arrived at Celænæ, where rise the <lb/>
            springs of the Maeander, and of another river not less than the <lb/>
            Mæander, which is called the Catarractes, which, springing <lb/>
            up in the very forum of the Celænians, discharges itself into <lb/>
            the Mæander; in this city also the skin of Silenus Marsyas <lb/>
            is suspended, which, as the Phrygians report, was stripped off <lb/>
            and suspended by Apollo. 27. In this city Pythius, son of <lb/>
            Atys, a Lydian, being in waiting, entertained the whole army <lb/>
            of the king and Xerxes himself, with most sumptuous feasts; <lb/>
            and he offered money, wishing to contribute towards the ex­ <lb/>
            pense of the war. When Pythius offered money, Xerxes <lb/>
            asked the Persians near him who this Pythius was, and what <lb/>
            riches he possessed, that he made such an offer ? They answer­ <lb/>
            ed, " 0 king, this is the person who presented your father <lb/>
            Darius with the golden plane-tree and the vine; and he is <lb/>
            now the richest man we know of in the world, next to your­ <lb/>
            self." 28. Xerxes, surprised with these last words, next <lb/>
            asked Pythius what might be the amount of his wealth. He <lb/>
            said, " 0 king, I will not conceal it from you, nor will I pretend <lb/>
            to be ignorant of my own substance, but as I know it perfectly <lb/>
            I will tell you the exact truth. As soon as I heard you were <lb/>
            coming down to the Grecian sea, wishing to present you with <lb/>
            money for the war, I made inquiry, and found by computa­ <lb/>
            tion that I had two thousand talents of silver, and of gold four <lb/>
            millions of Dane staters, all but seven thousand. These I <lb/>
            freely give you ; for myself I have sufficient subsistence from <lb/>
            my slaves and lands." 29. Thus he spoke; but Xerxes, de­ <lb/>
            lighted with his offer, replied: " My Lydian friend, since I left <lb/>
            the Persian country I have met with no man to the present <lb/>
            moment who was willing to entertain my army, or who, hav­ <lb/>
            ing come into my presence, has voluntarily offered to con­ <lb/>
            tribute money towards the war. But you have entertained <lb/>
            my army magnificently, and have offered me vast sums; <lb/>
            therefore, in return for this, I confer on you the following re­ <lb/>
            wards : I make you my friend, and will make up the sum of four <lb/>
            millions of staters from my own treasures, by adding the seven <lb/>
            thousand; so that the four millions may not be short of seven <lb/>
            thousand, but the full sum may be completed by me. Do you <lb/>
            retain what you have acquired, and be careful always to con- <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="30—33. ] "/>tinue sach as yot Are; for if you do this, you shall never re <lb/>
            pent, either now, or hereafter."</p>
          <p>30. Having said this, and performed his promise, he con­ <lb/>
            tinued his march: and passing by a city of the Phrygians, <lb/>
            called Anaua, and a lake from which salt is obtained, he arrived <lb/>
            at Colossæ, a considerable city of Phrygia, in which the river <lb/>
            Lycus, falling into a chasm of the earth, disappears ; then reap­ <lb/>
            pearing after a distance of about five stades, it also discharges <lb/>
            itself into the Mæander. From Colossæ the army, advancing <lb/>
            towards the boundaries of the Phrygians and Lydians, arrived <lb/>
            at the city of Cydrara, where a pillar, planted in the ground, <lb/>
            and erected by Crœsus, indicates the boundaries by an inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion. 31. When from Phrygia he entered Lydia, the way di- <lb/>
            Tiding into two, that on the left leading to Caria, the other <lb/>
            on the right to Sardis, by which latter a traveller is com­ <lb/>
            pelled to cross the river Maeander, and to pass by the city of <lb/>
            Callatebus, in which confectioners make honey with tamarisk <lb/>
            and wheat; Xerxes, going by this way, met with a plane-tree, <lb/>
            which, on account of its beauty, he presented with golden or­ <lb/>
            naments, and having committed it to the care of one of the <lb/>
            immortals,7 on the next day he arrived at Sardis, the capital <lb/>
            of the Lydians. 32. On his arrival at Sardis, he first of all sent <lb/>
            heralds to Greece to demand earth and water, and to require <lb/>
            them to provide entertainment for the king; except that he <lb/>
            did not send either to Athens or Lacedæmon,8 but he did to <lb/>
            every other place. And he sent the se cond time for earth and <lb/>
            water, for the following reason : such as had not given them <lb/>
            before when Darius sent, he thought would then certainly do <lb/>
            so through fear; wishing therefore to know this for certain, he <lb/>
            sent. And after this he prepared to march to Abydos.</p>
          <p>33. In the mean while those who were appointed had joined <lb/>
            the Hellespont from Asia to Europe. There is in the Chersonese <lb/>
            on the Hellespont, between the city of Sestos and Madytus, a <lb/>
            craggy shore extending into the sea, directly opposite Abydos: <lb/>
            there, not long after these events, under Xanthippus, son of <lb/>
            Ariphron, a general of the Athenians, having taken Ar­ <lb/>
            tayctes, a Persian, governor of Sestos, they impaled him alive <lb/>
            against a plank; for he, having brought women into the temple <note type="footnote">7 One of the ten thousand chosen men called immortals, of whom we <lb/>
            shall hear more hereafter. See chap. 83. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 See chap. 133. </note> <pb n="424"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[31—36"/> <lb/>
            of Protesilaus at Elæus, committed atrocious crimes.9 34. <lb/>
            To this shore, then, beginning at Abydos, they, on whom this <lb/>
            task was imposed, constructed bridges, the Phœnicians one <lb/>
            with white flax, and the Egyptians the other with papyrus. <lb/>
            The distance from Abydos to the opposite shore is seven <lb/>
            stades. When the strait was thus united, a violent storm <lb/>
            arising, broke in pieces and scattered the whole work. 35. <lb/>
            When Xerxes heard of this, being exceedingly indignant, he <lb/>
            commanded that the Hellespont should be stricken with three <lb/>
            hundred lashes with a scourge, and that a pair of fetters should <lb/>
            be let down into the sea. I have moreover heard that with <lb/>
            them he likewise sent branding instruments to brand the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont. He certainly charged those who flogged the waters <lb/>
            to utter these barbarous and impious words: " Thou bitter <lb/>
            water ! thy master inflicts this punishment upon thee, because <lb/>
            thou hast injured him, although thou hadst not suffered any <lb/>
            barm from him. And king Xerxes will cross over thee, <lb/>
            whether thou wilt or not; it is with justice that no man sacri­ <lb/>
            fices to thee, because thou art both a deceitful and briny <lb/>
            river !" He accordingly commanded them to chastise the sea <lb/>
            in this manner, and to cut off the heads of those who had <lb/>
            to superintend the joining of the Hellespont. 36. They on <lb/>
            whom this thankless office was imposed, carried it into exe­ <lb/>
            cution ; and other engineers constructed bridges; and they <lb/>
            constructed them in the following manner. They connected <lb/>
            together penteconters and triremes, under that towards the <lb/>
            Euxine sea, three hundred and sixty; and under the other, <lb/>
            three hundred and fourteen, obliquely in respect of the Pontus, <lb/>
            but in the direction of the current in respect of the Hellespont, <lb/>
            that it might keep up the tension of the cables. Having con­ <lb/>
            nected them together, they let down very long anchors, some <lb/>
            on the one bridge towards the Pontus, on account of the winds <lb/>
            that blew from it within ; others on the other bridge towards <lb/>
            the west and the Ægean, on account of the south and south­ <lb/>
            east winds.. They left an opening as a passage through be­ <lb/>
            tween the penteconters, and that in three places, that any one <lb/>
            who wished might be able to sail into the Pontus in light ves­ <lb/>
            sels, and from the Pontus outwards. Having done this, they <lb/>
            stretched the cables from the shore, twisting them with woodeu <lb/>
            capstans, not as before using the two kinds separately, but as <note type="footnote"> 9 See B. IX. chap. 116. </note> <pb n="425"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="57, 38.]"/> <lb/>
            signing to each two of white flax and four of papyrus. The <lb/>
            thickness and quality was the same, but those of flax were <lb/>
            stronger in proportion, every cubit weighing a full talent. <lb/>
            When the passage was bridged over, having sawn up trunks <lb/>
            of trees, and having made them equal to the width of the <lb/>
            bridge, they laid them regularly upon the extended cables; <lb/>
            and having laid them in regular order, they then fastened <lb/>
            them together. And having done this, they put brush-wood <lb/>
            on the top ; and having laid the brush-wood in regular order <lb/>
            they put earth over the whole ; and having pressed down the <lb/>
            earth, they drew a fence on each side, that the beasts of <lb/>
            burden and horses might not be frightened by looking down <lb/>
            upon the sea.</p>
          <p>37. When the works at the bridges were completed, and <lb/>
            those at Mount Athos, as well as the mounds at the mouths <lb/>
            of the canal, which had been made on account of the tide, <lb/>
            in order that the mouths of the trench might not be choked <lb/>
            ap, and news was brought that the canal was entirely com­ <lb/>
            pleted ; thereupon the army, having wintered at Sardis, and <lb/>
            being fully prepared, set out, at the beginning of the spring, <lb/>
            from thence towards Abydos. But as it was on the point of <lb/>
            setting out, the sun, quitting his seat in the heavens, disap­ <lb/>
            peared. though there were no clouds, and the air was perfectly <lb/>
            serene, and night ensued in the place of day. When Xerxes <lb/>
            saw and perceived this, it occasioned him much uneasiness; <lb/>
            he, therefore, inquired of the magi what the prodigy might <lb/>
            portend. They answered, that " the deity foreshows to the <lb/>
            Greeks the extinction of their cities;" adding, " that the sun <lb/>
            is the portender of the future to the Greeks, and the moon to <lb/>
            the Persians." Xerxes, having heard this, was much delighted, <lb/>
            and set out upon his march. 38. As lie was leading his army <lb/>
            away, Pythius the Lydian, terrified by the prodigy in the <lb/>
            heavens, and emboldened by the gifts, went to Xerxes the <lb/>
            king, and spoke thus: " Sire, would you indulge me by grant­ <lb/>
            in- a boon I should wish to obtain, which is easy for you to <lb/>
            grant, and of great importance to me." Xerxes, expecting <lb/>
            that he would wish for any thing rather than what lie did ask, <lb/>
            said that he would grant his request, and bade him declare <lb/>
            what he wanted ; whereupon he, when he heard this, spoke <lb/>
            confidently as follows : " Sire, I have five sons ; and it hap­ <lb/>
            pens that they are all attending you in the expedition against <pb n="426"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=":39, 40,"/> <lb/>
            Greece. But do you, 0 king, pity me, who am thus advanced <lb/>
            in years, and release one of my sons from the service, that hE <lb/>
            may take care of me and my property. Take the other foUl <lb/>
            with you, and, having accomplished your designs, may you <lb/>
            return home." 39. Xerxes was highly incensed, and answered <lb/>
            as follows: " Base man ! hast thou dared, when I am march­ <lb/>
            in,, in person against Greece, and taking with me my children <lb/>
            and brothers, and kinsmen, and friends, to make mention of <lb/>
            thy son ? thou, who art my slave, and who wert bound in duty <lb/>
            to follow me with all thy family, even with thy wife. Now <lb/>
            learn this well, that the spirit of man dwells in his ears; which <lb/>
            when it hears pleasing things, fills the whole body with de­ <lb/>
            light, but when it hears the contrary, swells with indignation <lb/>
            When, therefore, you did well, and gave promise of the like, <lb/>
            you cannot boast of having surpassed the king in generosity <lb/>
            But now that you have adopted a more shameless conduct <lb/>
            you shall not receive your deserts, but less than your deserts <lb/>
            for your hospitality preserves four of your children, but you <lb/>
            shall be punished with the loss of the one whom you cherish <lb/>
            most." When he had given this answer, he immediately com­ <lb/>
            manded those whose office it was to execute such orders, to <lb/>
            find out the eldest of the sons of Pythius, and to cut his body <lb/>
            in two; and having so done, to deposit the halves, one on thE <lb/>
            right of the road, the other on the left; and that the arm) <lb/>
            should pass between them.</p>
          <p>40. When they had done this, the army afterwards passed <lb/>
            between. The baggage-bearers and beasts of burden first led <lb/>
            the way; after them came a host of all nations promiscuously, <lb/>
            not distinguished: after more than one half of the army had <lb/>
            passed, an interval was left, that they might not mix with thE <lb/>
            king's troops. Before him a thousand horsemen led the van, <lb/>
            chosen from among all the Persians; and next to them f <lb/>
            thousand spearmen, these also chosen from among all, carrying <lb/>
            their lances turned downwards to the earth. After these cam <lb/>
            ten sacred horses called Nisæan, gorgeously caparisoned <lb/>
            These horses are called Nisæan on the following account <lb/>
            there is a large plain in the Medic territory, which is called <lb/>
            the Nisæan; now this plain produces these large horses. Be­ <lb/>
            hind these ten horses was placed the sacred chariot of Jupiter, <lb/>
            drawn by eight white horses; behind the horses followed a <lb/>
            charioteer on foot, holding the reins: because no mortal even <pb n="427"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="41—43.]"/> <lb/>
            ascends this seat. Behind this came Xerxes himself on a <lb/>
            chariot drawn by Nisæan horses; and a charioteer walked <lb/>
            at his side, whose name was Patiramphes, son of Otanes, a <lb/>
            Persian. 41. In this manner, then, Xerxes marched out of <lb/>
            Sardis, and whenever he thought right, he used to pass <lb/>
            rom the chariot to a covered carriage. Behind him marched <lb/>
            athousand spearmen, the bravest and most noble of the <lb/>
            Persians, carrying their spears in the usual manner; and <lb/>
            after them another body of a thousand horse, chosen from <lb/>
            among the Persians: after the cavalry came ten thousand <lb/>
            men chosen from the rest of the Persians; these were in­ <lb/>
            antry; and of these, one thousand had golden pomegranates <lb/>
            on their spears instead of ferules, and they enclosed the <lb/>
            others all round; but the nine thousand, being within them, <lb/>
            tad silver pomegranates. Those also that carried their spears <lb/>
            urned to the earth, had golden pomegranates, and those <lb/>
            hat followed nearest to Xerxes had golden apples. Behind <lb/>
            he ten thousand foot were placed ten thousand Persian <lb/>
            avalry; and after the cavalry was left an interval of two <lb/>
            itades; and then the rest of the throng followed promiscu­ <lb/>
            pusly. 42. The army directed its march from Lydia to the <lb/>
            river Caicus and the Mysian territory; and proceeding from <lb/>
            he Caicus, leaving Mount Canæ on the left, passed through <lb/>
            tarneus to the city Carina. From thence it marched through <lb/>
            the plain of Thebes, and passing by the city of Adramyttium <lb/>
            and the Pelasgian Antrandus, and keeping Mount Ida on the <lb/>
            eft, it entered the territory of Ilium. But before this, as the <lb/>
            army halted during the night under Mount Ida, thunder and <lb/>
            ightning fell upon them, and destroyed a considerable number <lb/>
            )f the troops on the spot. 43. When the army arrived at <lb/>
            the Scamander, which was the first river since they had set <lb/>
            outon their march from Sardis, whose stream failed and did <lb/>
            notafford sufficient drink for the army and beasts of burden ; <lb/>
            when, accordingly, Xerxes arrived at this river, he went up <lb/>
            tothe Pergamus1 of Priam, being desirous of seeing it; and <lb/>
            having seen it, and inquired into every particular, he sacrificed <lb/>
            athousand oxen to the Ilian Minerva, and the magi poured <lb/>
            outlibations in honour of the heroes. After they had done <lb/>
            his, a panic fell on the camp during the night, and at the <lb/>
            dawnof day they marched from thence, on the left skirting <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, “ the citadel ” </note> <pb n="428"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[44—47."/> <lb/>
            the city of Rhoetium, and Ophrynium, and Dardanus, which <lb/>
            borders on Abydos ; and on the right the Gergithae Teucrians.</p>
          <p>44. When they were at Abydos, Xerxes wished to behold <lb/>
            the whole army. And there had been previously erected on <lb/>
            a hill at this place, for his express use, a lofty throne of white <lb/>
            marble; the people of Abydos had made it, in obedience to a <lb/>
            previous order of the king. When he was seated there, look­ <lb/>
            ing down towards the shore, he beheld both the land army <lb/>
            and the fleet; and when he beheld them, he desired to see a <lb/>
            contest take place between the ships ; and when it had taker <lb/>
            place, and the Sidonian Phœnicians were victorious, he showed <lb/>
            himself exceedingly gratified both with the contest and the <lb/>
            army. 45. And when he saw the whole Hellespont covered <lb/>
            by the ships, and all the shores and the plains of Abydos full <lb/>
            of men, Xerxes thereupon pronounced himself happy; but <lb/>
            afterwards shed tears. 46. Artabanus, his paternal uncle, <lb/>
            having observed him, the same who had before freely declared <lb/>
            his opinion and advised Xerxes not to invade Greece; this <lb/>
            man, having perceived Xerxes shedding tears, addressed him <lb/>
            thus: " 0 king, how very different from each other are what <lb/>
            you are now doing, and what you did a little while ago ! foi <lb/>
            having pronounced yourself happy, now you weep." HE <lb/>
            answered, " Commiseration seized me, when I considered how <lb/>
            brief all human life is, since of these, numerous as they are <lb/>
            not one shall survive to the hundredth year." But Artabanus <lb/>
            replied, saying, " We suffer during life other things more <lb/>
            pitiable than this; for in this so brief life, there is not one <lb/>
            either of these or of others, born so happy, that it will no <lb/>
            occur to him, not only once but oftentimes, to wish rather t( <lb/>
            die than to live. For calamities befalling him, and dis <lb/>
            eases disturbing him, make life, though really short, appeal <lb/>
            to be long; so that death, life being burdensome, becomes <lb/>
            the most desirable refuge for man: and the deity, havin <lb/>
            given us to taste of sweet existence, is found to be jealou! <lb/>
            of his gift." 47. Xerxes answered, saying, " Artabanus, o <lb/>
            human life, which is such as you have described it, let ui <lb/>
            say no more, nor let us call evils to mind, now that we havi <lb/>
            good things before us. But tell me this. If the vision o <lb/>
            the dream had not appeared so clearly, would you have re <lb/>
            tamed your former opinion, and dissuaded me from <unclear>makir</unclear>.s <lb/>
            war against Greece. or would you have changed your opinion <pb n="429"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="8—50.]"/> <lb/>
            me, tell me this explicitly." He answered, saying, " 0 <lb/>
            ng, may the vision of the dream that appeared terminate as <unclear/> <lb/>
            e both desire: but I am still full of alarm and not master <lb/>
            myself, when I consider many other circumstances, and <lb/>
            oreover perceive two things of the greatest importance, <lb/>
            ost hostile to you." 48. To this Xerxes answered as fol­ <lb/>
            ws: " Strange man! what are these two things which you <lb/>
            y are most hostile to me? whether do you find fault with <lb/>
            land army on account of numbers, and do you think that <unclear/> <lb/>
            e Grecian army will be much more numerous than ours? <lb/>
            that our navy will fall short of theirs? or both these to­ <lb/>
            ether ? For if you think our forces deficient in this respect, <lb/>
            e can quickly assemble another army." 49. He answered, <lb/>
            tying, “ O king, no man of common understanding can find <unclear/> <lb/>
            lean eitherwith this army or the number of the ships. (I.) <lb/>
            ut even if you should muster more, the two things which I <lb/>
            ean would become still more hostile. These two things are <lb/>
            and and sea. For, as I conjecture, there is no where any <lb/>
            arbour of the sea so large as to be capable, in case a storm <unclear/> <lb/>
            ould arise, of receiving this your navy, and sheltering the <lb/>
            lips. And yet there is need, not only that there be one such <lb/>
            arbour, but others along the whole continent, by which you <lb/>
            are about to coast. Since there are not harbours sufficiently <lb/>
            spacious, remember, that accidents rulemen, not men acci­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            — (2.) One of the two things having thus been men­ <lb/>
            oiled, I now proceed to mention the other. The land will <lb/>
            hostile to you in this way: if nothing else should stand in <unclear/> <lb/>
            ur way, it will become more hostile to you the farther you <unclear/> <lb/>
            vance, as you are continually drawn on unawares; for men <unclear/> <lb/>
            e never satiated with success. And even if I should grant, <lb/>
            at no one will oppose you, I say, that the country, becoming <unclear/> <lb/>
            ore extensive in process of time, will produce a famine. <lb/>
            man would therefore thus prove himself most wise, if in <lb/>
            deliberation he should be apprehensive and consider himself <lb/>
            kely to suffer every misfortune, but in action should be bold." <lb/>
            0. Xerxes answered in these words: " Artabanus, you have <lb/>
            iscussed each of these particulars plausibly; but do not fear <lb/>
            very thing, nor weigh every circumstance with equal strict­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            less.(1.) For if in every matter that is proposed, you should <lb/>
            feighevery thing with equal care, youwouldnever-doany <unclear/> <lb/>
            ning at all; it is better, being confident on all occasions, to <pb n="430"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[61, 52"/> <lb/>
            suffer half the evils, than fearing everything beforehand <lb/>
            neversuffer any thing at all. But if you oppose every thing <lb/>
            that is proposed, and do not advance something certain, you <lb/>
            must fail in your plans equally with the person who has giver <lb/>
            a contrary opinion. This, therefore, comes to the same. (2. <lb/>
            Can any one who is a man know for a certainty what ough <lb/>
            to be done?2 I think, certainly not. To those, however <lb/>
            who are ready to act, gain for the most part is wont to accrue <lb/>
            but to those that weigh every thing and are timid, it seldom <lb/>
            does. You see to what a degree of power the empire of the <lb/>
            Persians has advanced; if, then, they who were kings before <lb/>
            me had entertained such opinions as you do, or not entertain. <lb/>
            ing such opinions, had such counsellors, you would never have <lb/>
            seen their power advanced to this pitch. But now, by hazard <lb/>
            ing dangers, they carried it to this height. For great under <lb/>
            takings are wont to be accomplished at great hazards. We <lb/>
            therefore, emulating them, set out at the most favourable sea <lb/>
            son of the year, and having subdued all Europe, will returr <lb/>
            home, without having met with famine any where, or sufferc( <lb/>
            any other reverse. For in the first place we march, carrying <lb/>
            with us abundant provisions, and in the next place, whateve] <lb/>
            land and nation we invade, we shall have their corn ; and w&lt; <lb/>
            are making war on men who are husbandmen, and not feeders <lb/>
            of cattle." 51. After this Artabanus said, "0 king, since <lb/>
            you will not allow us to fear any thing, yet hearken to my <lb/>
            advice; for it is necessary, when speaking on many topics, to <lb/>
            extend one's discourse. Cyrus, son of Cambyses, subdued al <lb/>
            Ionia except the Athenians, so as to be tributary to the Per <lb/>
            sians. I advise you, therefore, on no account to lead thes&lt; <lb/>
            men against their fathers; for even without them we are able <lb/>
            to get the better of our enemies. For if they accompany you <lb/>
            they must either be most unjust, in assisting to enslave their <lb/>
            mother-city, or most just in endeavouring to maintain its free. <lb/>
            dom. Now if they should be most unjust, they will not ad. <lb/>
            nny great gain to us ; but if just, they are able to damage youi <lb/>
            army to a great degree. Consider therefore on this ancien <lb/>
            saying, since it has been well said, that the termination is no­ <lb/>
            always evident at the beginning. 52. To this Xerxes an <note type="footnote"> 2 I have followed the reading and punctuation of Matthiæ and Baehr <lb/>
            The latter, though he approves the mark of interrogation, omits it in hi <lb/>
            version of this passage. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="431"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="3–55.]"/><lb/>
            wered: “Artabanus, of all the opinions you have given, you <unclear/> <lb/>
            re deceived most in this, in fearing lest the Ionians should <lb/>
            esert us ; of whom we have the strongest proofs, and of whom <lb/>
            you are a witness, as well as all the rest who accompanied <lb/>
            Darius in his expedition against the Scythians, that the whole <lb/>
            Persian army was in their power to destroy or to save, yet they <lb/>
            ivinced justice and fidelity, and committed nothing ungrateful. <lb/>
            Besides this, since they have left their children, and wives, <lb/>
            nd possessions in our territories, we must not expect that <lb/>
            hey will form any new design. Do not therefore fear this, <lb/>
            but be of good courage, and preserve my house and my go­ <lb/>
            vernment; for to you alone, of all men, I intrust my sceptre."</p>
          <p>53. Having spoken thus, and despatched Artabanus to <lb/>
            Susa, Xerxes again summoned the most distinguished of the <lb/>
            Persians, and when they were assembled he addressed them <lb/>
            is follows: " 0 Persians, I have called you together to desire <lb/>
            his of you, that you would acquit yourselves like brave men, <lb/>
            and not disgrace the former exploits of the Persians, which are <lb/>
            great and memorable. But let each and all of us together show <lb/>
            sur zeal; for this which we are endeavouring to accomplish is <lb/>
            good common to all. On this account, then, I call on you to <lb/>
            apply yourselves earnestly to the war; for, as I am informed, <lb/>
            ve are marching against brave men; and if we conquer them, <lb/>
            to other army in the world will dare to oppose us. Now, then, <lb/>
            et us cross over, having first offered up prayers to the gods <lb/>
            vho protect the Persian territory." 54. That day they made <lb/>
            reparations for the passage over ; and on the following they <lb/>
            malted for the sun, as they wished to see it rising, in the mean <lb/>
            ime burning all sorts of perfumes on the bridges, and strew­ <lb/>
            ng the road with myrtle branches. When the sun rose, <lb/>
            Xerxes, pouring a libation into the sea out of a golden cup, <lb/>
            offered up a prayer to the sun, that no such accident might <unclear/> <lb/>
            lefal him as would prevent him from subduing Europe, until <unclear/> <lb/>
            ie had reached its utmost limits. After having prayed, he <lb/>
            hrew the cup into the Hellespont, and a golden bowl, and a <lb/>
            Persian sword, which they call acinace. But I cannot deter­ <lb/>
            nine with certainty, whether he dropped these things into the <lb/>
            eaas an offering to the sun, or whether he repented of having <lb/>
            courged the Hellespont, and presented these gifts to the sea <lb/>
            is a compensation. 55. When these ceremonies were finished, <lb/>
            he infantry and all the cavalry <unclear>erased</unclear> over by that bridge <pb n="432"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[Y. -55"/> <lb/>
            which was towards the Pontus ; and the beasts of burden and <lb/>
            attendants by that towards the Ægean. First of all the ten <lb/>
            thousand Persians led the van, all wearing crowns; and after <lb/>
            them the promiscuous host of all nations. These crossed on <lb/>
            that day. On the following, first the horsemen, and those <lb/>
            who carried their lances downwards, these also wore crowns: <lb/>
            next came the sacred horses and the sacred chariot; after­ <lb/>
            wards Xerxes himself, and the spearmen, and the thousand <lb/>
            horsemen ; after them the rest of the army closed the march; <lb/>
            and at the same time the ships got under weigh to the oppo­ <lb/>
            site shore. I have also heard that Xerxes crossed over last <lb/>
            of all. 56. Xerxes, when he had crossed over into Europe, <lb/>
            saw the army crossing over under the lash: his army crossed <lb/>
            over in seven days and seven nights without halting at all. On <lb/>
            this occasion it is related, that when Xerxes had crossed over <lb/>
            the Hellespont, a certain Hellespontine said: " 0 Jupiter, <lb/>
            why, assuming the form of a Persian, and taking the name of <lb/>
            Xerxes, do you wish to subvert Greece, bringing all mankind <lb/>
            with you ? since without them it was in your power to do <lb/>
            this."</p>
          <p>57. When all had crossed over, and were proceeding on <lb/>
            their march, a great prodigy appeared to them, which Xerxes <lb/>
            took no account of, although it was easy to be interpreted. A <lb/>
            mare foaled a hare: this, then, might easily have been inter­ <lb/>
            preted thus, that Xerxes was about to lead an army into <lb/>
            Greece with exceeding pomp and magnificence, but would <lb/>
            return to the same place running for his life. Another pro­ <lb/>
            digy had also happened, while he was at Sardis; a mule <lb/>
            brought forth a colt, with double parts, both those of a male <lb/>
            and those of a female; those of the male were uppermost. <lb/>
            58. But taking no account of either of these, he proceeded <lb/>
            forward ; and with him the land forces. But the fleet, sailing <lb/>
            out of the Hellespont, stood along by the land, taking a con­ <lb/>
            trary course to that of the army. For it sailed towards the <lb/>
            west, steering for cape Sarpedon, where, on its arrival, it was <lb/>
            ordered to wait: but the army on the continent marched to­ <lb/>
            wards the east and the rising sun, through the Chersonese, <lb/>
            having on the right hand the sepulchre of Helle, daughter of <lb/>
            Athamas, and on the left the city of Carcia, and going through <lb/>
            the middle of a city, the name of which happened to be Agora; <lb/>
            and from thence, bending round a bay called Melas. and hav- <pb n="433"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="59-61.] "/>ing come to the river Melas, whose stream did not suffice for <lb/>
            the army, but failed,-having crossed this river, from which <lb/>
            the bay derives its name, they marched westward, passing by <lb/>
            ,Enos, an Æolian city, and the lake Stentoris, until they <lb/>
            reached Doriscus. 59. Doriscus is a shore and extensive <lb/>
            plain of Thrace. Through it flows a large river, the Hebrus. <lb/>
            On it a royal fort had been built, the same that is now called <lb/>
            Doriscus, and a Persian garrison had been established in it by <lb/>
            Darius, from the time that he marched against the Scythians. <lb/>
            This place therefore appeared to Xerxes to be convenient for <lb/>
            reviewing and numbering his army; this he accordingly did. <lb/>
            All the ships therefore having arrived at Doriscus, the cap­ <lb/>
            tains, at the command of Xerxes, brought them to the shore <lb/>
            adjoining Doriscus. On this coast stood Sala, a Samothracian <lb/>
            city, and Zona; and at its extremity Serrhium, a celebrated <lb/>
            promontory: this region formerly belonged to the Ciconians. <lb/>
            Having steered to this shore, they hauled up the ships and <lb/>
            repaired them; and in the mean time Xerxes numbered his <lb/>
            army at Doriscus. 60. How great a number of men each <lb/>
            contributed, I am unable to say with certainty; for it is not <lb/>
            mentioned by any one; but the amount of the whole land- <lb/>
            forces was found to be seventeen hundred thousand. They <lb/>
            were computed in this manner: having drawn together ten <lb/>
            thousand men in one place, and having crowded them as close <lb/>
            together as it was possible, they traced a circle on the outside; <lb/>
            :and having traced it, and removed the ten thousand, they threw <lb/>
            up a stone fence on the circle, reaching to the height of a <lb/>
            man's navel. Having done this, they made others enter within <lb/>
            the enclosed space, until they had in this manner computed all; <lb/>
            and having numbered them, they drew out according to nations.</p>
          <p>61. Those who served in this expedition were the following. <lb/>
            The Persians, equipped as follows: on their heads they wore <lb/>
            oose coverings, called tiaras ; on the body various-coloured <lb/>
            leeved breastplates, with iron scales like those of fish; and <unclear/> <lb/>
            ,n their legs, loose trowsers; and instead of shields, bucklers <lb/>
            nade of osiers; and under them their quivers were hung. They <lb/>
            lad short spears, long bows, and arrows made of cane and <unclear/> <lb/>
            .esides, daggers suspended from the girdle on the rignt thigh. <lb/>
            They had for their general, Otanes, father of Amestris, wife <lb/>
            of Xerxes. They were formerly called Cephenes by the <lb/>
            Grecians, but by themselves and neighbours, Artæans 1 but <note type="footnote"> 2 r </note> <pb n="434"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" \:e-z-6å"/> <lb/>
            when Perseus, son of Danae and Jupiter, came to Cepheus, son <lb/>
            of Belus, and married his daughter Andromeda, he had a son <lb/>
            to whom he gave the name of Perses; and him he left in the <lb/>
            country, for Cepheus had no male offspring; from him there­ <lb/>
            fore they derived their appellation. 62. The Medes marched <lb/>
            equipped in the same manner as the Persians ; for the above <lb/>
            is a Medic and not a Persian costume. The Medes had for <lb/>
            their general, Tigranes, of the family of the Achæmenidæ: <lb/>
            they were formerly called Arians by all nations ; but when <lb/>
            Medea of Colchis came from Athens to these Arians, they <lb/>
            also changed their names: the Medes themselves give this <lb/>
            account of their nation. The Cissians, who served in the <lb/>
            army, were in other respects accoutred like the Persians, ex­ <lb/>
            cept that, instead of turbans, they wore mitres. Anaphes, son <lb/>
            of Otanes, commanded the Cissians. The Hyrcanians were <lb/>
            also armed like the Persians, and had for their general, Mega­ <lb/>
            panus, who was afterwards governor of Babylon. 63. The <lb/>
            Assyrians who served in the army had helmets of brass, twist­ <lb/>
            ed in a barbarous fashion, not easy to be described; and they <lb/>
            had shields and spears, and daggers similar to those of the <lb/>
            Egyptians; and besides, wooden clubs knotted with iron, and <lb/>
            linen cuirasses. By the Greeks they were called Syrians, but <lb/>
            by the barbarians, Assyrians. Among them were the Chal­ <lb/>
            deans ; and Otaspes son of Artachæus commanded them. 64. <lb/>
            The Bactrians joined the army, having turbans on their heads, <lb/>
            very much like those of the Medes, and bows made of cane <lb/>
            peculiar to their country, and short spears. The Sacæ, who are <lb/>
            Scythians, had on their heads caps, which came to a point and <lb/>
            stood erect: they also wore loose trowsers, and carried bows <lb/>
            peculiar to their country, and daggers, and also battle-axes, <lb/>
            called sagares. These, though they are Amyrgian Scythians, <lb/>
            they called Sacæ, for the Persians call all the Scythians Sacae. <lb/>
            Hystaspes, son of Darius and Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, com­ <lb/>
            manded the Bactrians and Sacæ. 65. The Indians, clad with <lb/>
            garments made of cotton, had bows of cane, and arrows of cane <lb/>
            tipped with iron. Thus the Indians were equipped ; and they <lb/>
            were marshalled under the command of Phanazathres, son of <lb/>
            Artabates. 66. The Arians were furnished with Medic bows ; <lb/>
            and in other respects were accoutred like the Bactrians. Si­ <lb/>
            samnes, son of Hydarnes, commanded the Arians. The Par­ <lb/>
            thians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, Gandarians. and Dadicæ, joined <pb n="435"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="67-70.]"/> <lb/>
            the army, having the same accoutrements as the Bactrians. The <lb/>
            following leaders commanded them. Artabazus, son of Phar­ <lb/>
            naces, commanded the Parthians and Chorasmians ; Azanes, <lb/>
            son of Artæus, the Sogdians ; and Artyphius, son of Artaba­ <lb/>
            nus, the Gandarians and Dadicæ. 67. The Caspians, clothed in <lb/>
            goat-skin mantles, and carrying bows made of cane peculiar to <lb/>
            their country, and scimetars, joined the expedition. These were <lb/>
            thus equipped, having for their general, Ariomardus, brother of <lb/>
            Artyphius. The Sarangæ were conspicuous by having dyed <lb/>
            garments ; they also wore buskins reaching up to the knee, <lb/>
            and had bows and Medic javelins. Pherendates, son of Me­ <lb/>
            gabazus, commanded the Sarangæ. The Pactyes also wore <lb/>
            goat-skin mantles, and had bows peculiar to the country and <lb/>
            daggers. The Pactyes had for their general, Artyntes, son of <lb/>
            Ithamatres. 68. The Utians, Mycians, and Paricanians <lb/>
            were equipped like the Pactyes. The following leaders com­ <lb/>
            manded them. Arsamenes, son of Darius, led the Utians <lb/>
            and Mycians ; and Siromitres, son of Œobazus, the Parica­ <lb/>
            nians. 69. The Arabians wore cloaks fastened by a girdle; <lb/>
            and carried on their right sides long bows which bent back­ <lb/>
            wards. The Ethiopians were clothed in panthers' and lions. <lb/>
            skins, and carried long bows, not less than four cubits in <lb/>
            ength, made from branches of the palm-tree; and on them <lb/>
            they placed short arrows made of cane; instead of iron, tipped <lb/>
            with a stone, which was made sharp, and of that sort on which <lb/>
            ;hey engrave seals. Besides they had javelins, and at the tip <lb/>
            vas an antelope's horn, made sharp, like a lance; they had <lb/>
            also knotted clubs. When they were going to battle, they <lb/>
            meared one half of their body with chalk, and the other half <lb/>
            vith red ochre. The Arabians and Ethiopians who dwell above <lb/>
            Egypt, were commanded by Arsames, son of Darius and Ar­ <lb/>
            ystone, daughter of Crus, whom Darius loved more than <unclear/> <lb/>
            ill his wives, and whose image he had made of beaten gold. <lb/>
            . The Ethiopians from the sun-rise (for two kinds served <lb/>
            the expedition) were marshalled with the Indians, and did <lb/>
            lot at all differ from the others in appearance, but only in <lb/>
            heir language, and their hair. For the eastern Ethiopians <lb/>
            re straight-haired; but those of Libya have hair more .curly <lb/>
            han that of any other people. These Ethiopians from AsiaAsia <lb/>
            vere accoutred almost the same as the Indians; but they wore <lb/>
            a their heads skins of horses' heads, as masks, stripped off <note type="footnote"> 2F2 </note> <pb n="436"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[71-75"/> <lb/>
            with the ears and mane ; and the mane served instead of a <lb/>
            crest, and the horses* ears were fixed erect; and as defensive <lb/>
            armour they used the skins of cranes instead of shields. 71. <lb/>
            The Libyans marched, clad in leathern garments, and made <lb/>
            use of javelins hardened by fire. They had for their general, <lb/>
            Massages, son of Oarizus. 72. The Paphlagonians joined the <lb/>
            expedition, wearing on their heads plaited helmets, and carried <lb/>
            small shields, and not large spears ; and besides, javelins and <lb/>
            daggers : and on their feet they wore boots, peculiar to their <lb/>
            country, reaching up to the middle of the leg. The Ligyes <lb/>
            and the Matienians, the Mariandynians and Syrians, marched <lb/>
            in the same dress as the Paphlagonians. These Syrians are <lb/>
            called by the Persians, Cappadocians. Now Dotus, son of <lb/>
            Megasidrus, commanded the Paphlagonians and Matienians <lb/>
            and Gobryas, son of Darius and Artystone, the Mariandy­ <lb/>
            nians, Ligyes, and Syrians. 73. The Phrygians had very <lb/>
            nearly the same dress as that of Paphlagonia, varying it <lb/>
            a little. The Phrygians, as the Macedonians say, were called <lb/>
            Briges, as long as they were Europeans, and dwelt with the <lb/>
            Macedonians; but having passed over into Asia, they changed <lb/>
            their name with their country, into that of Phrygians. The <lb/>
            Armenians, being colonists of the Phrygians, were equipped <lb/>
            like the Phrygians. Artochmes, who had married a daughter <lb/>
            of Darius, commanded both these. 74. The Lydians had <lb/>
            arms very like the Grecian. The Lydians were formerly <lb/>
            called Meionians, but took their appellation from Lydus the <lb/>
            son of Atys, having changed their name. The Mysians wore <lb/>
            on their heads a helmet peculiar to their country, and small <lb/>
            shields ; and they used javelins hardened by fire. They are <lb/>
            colonists of the Lydians, and from the mountain Olympus are <lb/>
            called Olympieni. Artaphernes, son of Artaphernes who in­ <lb/>
            vaded Marathon with Datis, commanded the Lydians and <lb/>
            Mysians. 75. The Thracians joined the expedition, having <lb/>
            fox-skins on their heads, and tunics around their body, and <lb/>
            over them they were clothed with various-coloured cloaks, <lb/>
            and on their feet and legs they had buskins of fawn-skin, and <lb/>
            besides they had javelins, light bucklers, and small daggers. <lb/>
            These people having crossed over into Asia, were called Bi­ <lb/>
            thynians; but formerly, as they themselves say, were called <lb/>
            Strymonians, as they dwelt on the river Strymon : they say <lb/>
            that they were removed from their original settlements by the <pb n="437"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[76—81.]"/> <lb/>
            Teucrians and Mysians. Bassaces, son of Artabanus, com­ <lb/>
            banded the Thracians of Asia. 76. The ****** 3 had <lb/>
            mall shields made of raw hides, and each had two javelins <lb/>
            used for hunting wolves, and on their heads brazen helmets; <lb/>
            md in addition to the helmets they wore the ears and horns <lb/>
            of an ox in brass. And over these were crests; and as <lb/>
            o their legs, they were enwrapped in pieces of purple cloth. <lb/>
            Among these people there is an oracle of Mars. 77. The <lb/>
            Labalian Meionians, who are also called Lasonians, had the <lb/>
            ame dress as the Cilicians; which I shall describe when I come <lb/>
            o speak of the army of the Cilicians. The Milyæ had short <lb/>
            ances, and their garments were fastened by clasps. Some of <lb/>
            hem had Lycian bows, and on their heads helmets made of <lb/>
            anned skins. Badres, son of Hystanes, commanded all these.' <lb/>
            '8. The Moschians had on their heads wooden helmets, and <lb/>
            mall bucklers, and spears ; but there were large points on the <lb/>
            pears. The Tibarenians, Macrones, and Mosynoeci joined <lb/>
            he expedition equipped as the Moschians. The following <lb/>
            generals marshalled these: the Moschians and Tibarenians, <lb/>
            Ariomardus, son of Darius and Parmys, daughter of Smerdis, <lb/>
            on of Cyrus; the Macrones and Mosynœci, Artayctes, son' <lb/>
            ,f Cherasmis, who was intrusted with the government of Ses­ <lb/>
            os on the Hellespont. 79. The Mares wore helmets on their <lb/>
            leads, painted after the manner of their country; and small <lb/>
            hields made of skin, and javelins. The Colchians had about <lb/>
            heir heads wooden helmets, and small shields of raw hides, and <lb/>
            hort lances ; and besides they had swords. Pherendates, son <lb/>
            f Teaspes, commanded the Mares and Colchians. The Ala­ <lb/>
            odi and the Saspires marched armed like the Colchians; <lb/>
            Masistius, son of Siromitres, commanded them. 80. The in­ <lb/>
            ular nations that came from the Erythræan Sea, and from the <lb/>
            slands in which the king makes those dwell who are called <lb/>
            the banished," had clothing and arms very similar to the <lb/>
            ledic. Mardontes, son of Bagaeus, who, when commanding <lb/>
            he army at Mycale, two years after this, died in battle <unclear/> <lb/>
            :;'ÃÍlmanded these islanders.</p>
          <p>81. These were the nations that marched on the continent, <unclear/> <lb/>
            d composed the infantry. They, then, who have been men-' <unclear/> <lb/>
            loned commanded this army, and these were they who set in' <note type="footnote"> There is an hiatus in the manuscripts, which the ingenuity of anno­ <lb/>
            .tors and editors has been unable to supply. </note> <pb n="438"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[82—85."/> <lb/>
            order, and numbered them, and appointed commanders <unclear>ol</unclear> <lb/>
            thousands and of ten thousands. But the commanders of ten <lb/>
            thousands appointed the captains of hundreds and captains <unclear>ol</unclear> <lb/>
            tens. There were other subaltern officers over the troops and <lb/>
            nations, but those who have been mentioned were the com­ <lb/>
            manders. 82. Over these and the whole infantry were ap­ <lb/>
            pointed as generals, Mardonius, son of Gobryas; Tritan­ <lb/>
            tæchmes, ,son of Artabanus, who gave his opinion against the <lb/>
            invasion of Greece; Smerdomenes, son of Otanes ; (both these <lb/>
            were sons to brothers of Darius, and cousins to Xerxes;) <lb/>
            Masistes, son of Darius and Atossa; Gergis, son of Arizus ; <lb/>
            and Megabyzus, son of Zopyrus. 83. These were generals ol <lb/>
            the whole land-forces, except the ten thousand ; of these ten <lb/>
            thousand chosen Persians, Hydarnes, son of Hydarnes, was <lb/>
            general. These Persians were called Immortal, for the follow­ <lb/>
            ing reason: if any one of them made a deficiency in the num­ <lb/>
            ber, compelled either by death or disease, another was ready <lb/>
            chosen to supply his place; so that they were never eithe] <lb/>
            more or less than ten thousand. The Persians displayed the <lb/>
            greatest splendour of all, and were also the bravest; their <lb/>
            equipment was such as has been described; but besides this, <lb/>
            they were conspicuous from having a great profusion of gold. <lb/>
            They also brought with them covered chariots, and concubines <lb/>
            in them, and a numerous and well-equipped train of attend­ <lb/>
            ants. Camels and other beasts of burden conveyed their <lb/>
            provisions, apart from that of the rest of the soldiers.</p>
          <p>84. All these nations have cavalry; they did not, however, <lb/>
            all furnish horse, but only the following. First, the Persians, <lb/>
            equipped in the same manner as their infantry, except that on <lb/>
            their heads some of them wore brazen and wrought steel or­ <lb/>
            naments. 85. There is a certain nomadic race, called Sa­ <lb/>
            gartians, of Persian extraction and language, they wear a dress <lb/>
            fashioned between the Persian and the Pactyan fashion ; they <lb/>
            furnished eight thousand horse, but they are not accustomed <lb/>
            to carry arms either of brass or iron, except daggers: they <lb/>
            use ropes made of twisted thongs ; trusting to these they go <lb/>
            to war. The mode of fighting of these men is as follows: <lb/>
            when they engage with the enemy they throw out the ropes, <lb/>
            which have nooses at the end, and whatever any one catches, <lb/>
            whether horse or man, he drags towards himself; and they <lb/>
            that arc entangled in the coils are put to death. This is their <pb n="439"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="M-89.1 "/>mode of fighting; and they were marshalled with the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. 86. The Medcs had the same equipment as that used <lb/>
            in the infantry; and the Cissians in like manner. The Indiana <lb/>
            were also eQuipped like their infantry, but they used saddle­ <lb/>
            horses and chariots; and in their chariots they yoked horses <lb/>
            and wild asses. The Bactrians were equipped in the same <lb/>
            manner as their infantry, and the Caspians likewise. The <lb/>
            Libyans too were accoutred like their infantry; but they all <lb/>
            drove chariots. In like manner the Caspiri and Paricanii <lb/>
            were equipped in the same way as their infantry. And the <lb/>
            Arabians had the same dress as their infantry, but all. rode <lb/>
            camels not inferior to horses in speed. 87. These nations only <lb/>
            furnished cavalry. The number of the horse amounted to <lb/>
            eighty thousand, besides the camels and chariots. All the rest <lb/>
            of the cavalry were marshalled in troops; but the Arabians <lb/>
            were stationed in the rear : for as horses cannot endure camels, <lb/>
            they were stationed behind, that the horses might not be <lb/>
            frightened. 88. Armamithres and Tithæus, sons of Datis, <lb/>
            were generals of the cavalry. Their third colleague in com­ <lb/>
            mand, Pharnuches, had been left at Sardis sick. For as they <lb/>
            were setting out from Sardis he met with a sad accident. For <lb/>
            when he was mounted, a dog ran under the legs of his horse, <lb/>
            and the horse, not being aware of it, was frightened, and rear­ <lb/>
            ing up, threw Pharnuches; upon which he, having fallen, <lb/>
            vomited blood, and the disease turned to a consumption. With <lb/>
            respect to the horse, his servants immediately did as he or­ <lb/>
            dered ; for leading him to the place where he had thrown his <lb/>
            master, they cut off his legs at the knees. Thus Pharnuches <lb/>
            was deprived of the command.</p>
          <p>89. The number of the triremes amounted to twelve hun­ <lb/>
            red and seven ; the following nations furnished them. The <lb/>
            Phœnicians, with the Syrians of Palestine, furnished three <lb/>
            hundred, being thus equipped: on their heads they had hel <lb/>
            mets, made very nearly after the Grecian fashion; and clothed <lb/>
            in linen breastplates, they carried shields without rims, and <lb/>
            javelins. These Phoenicians, as they themselves say, anciently <lb/>
            dwelt on the Red Sea; and having crossed over from thence, <lb/>
            they settled on the sea-coast of Syria; this part of Syria, and <lb/>
            thewhole as far as Egypt, is called Palestine. The Egyptians <lb/>
            contributed two hundred ships. These had on their heads <lb/>
            plaited helmets, and carried hollow shields, with large rims, <pb n="440"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[90—95."/> <lb/>
            and pikes fit for a sea-fight, and large hatchets. The greater <lb/>
            part of them had breastplates, and carried large swords, 90. <lb/>
            The Cyprians contributed a hundred and fifty ships, and were <lb/>
            equipped as follows: their kings had their heads wrapped in <lb/>
            turbans; the rest wore tunics, and were in other respects at­ <lb/>
            tired like the Greeks. Of these there are the following nations, <lb/>
            some from Salamis and Athens ; others from Arcadia; others <lb/>
            from Cythnus; others from Phoenicia ; and others from Ethi­ <lb/>
            opia, as the Cyprians themselves say. 91. The Cilicians con­ <lb/>
            tributed a hundred ships. These, again, wore on their heads <lb/>
            helmets peculiar to their country, and had bucklers instead of <lb/>
            shields, made of raw hides, and were clothed in woollen tunics ; <lb/>
            every one had two javelins, and a sword made very much like the <lb/>
            Egyptian scimetars. They were anciently called Hypachæans, <lb/>
            and took their present name from Cilix, son of Agenor, a Phœ­ <lb/>
            nician. The Pamphylians contributed thirty ships, and were <lb/>
            equipped in Grecian armour. These Pamphylians are descended <lb/>
            from those who, in their return from Troy, were dispersed with <lb/>
            Amphilochus and Calchas. 92. The Lycians contributed fifty <lb/>
            ships, and wore breastplates and greaves. They had bows <lb/>
            made of cornel-wood, and cane arrows without feathers, and <lb/>
            javelins; and besides, goat-skins were suspended over their <lb/>
            shoulders; and round their heads caps encircled with feathers; <lb/>
            they had also daggers and falchions. The Lycians were called <lb/>
            Termilæ, being sprung from Crete, but took their present <lb/>
            name from Lycus, son of Pandion, an Athenian. 93. The <lb/>
            Dorians of Asia contributed thirty ships, wearing Grecian <lb/>
            armour, and sprung from the Peloponnesus. The Carians <lb/>
            contributed seventy ships, and were in other respects ac­ <lb/>
            coutred like the Greeks, but had falchions and daggers. What <lb/>
            these were formerly called I have mentioned in the first part <lb/>
            of my history. 94. The Ionians contributed a hundred ships, <lb/>
            and were equipped as Greeks. The Ionians, as long as they <lb/>
            inhabited that part of the Peloponnesus which is now called <lb/>
            Achaia, and before Danaus and Xuthus arrived in the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus, as the Greeks say, were called Pelasgian Ægialees ; <lb/>
            but Ionians from Ion, son of Xuthus. 95. The Islanders con­ <lb/>
            tributed seventeen ships, and were armed like the Greeks. <lb/>
            This race is also Pelasgic, but was afterwards called Ionian for <lb/>
            the same reason as the Ionians of the twelve cities who came <note type="footnote"> 4 See B. I. chap.. 71. </note> <pb n="441"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="96-99.]"/> <lb/>
            from Athens. The Æolians contributed sixty ships, and were <lb/>
            equipped like the Greeks; they were anciently called Pelas­ <lb/>
            gians, as the Grecians say. The Hellespontines, except those <lb/>
            of Abydos, for the people of Abydos were ordered by the king <lb/>
            to stay at home and guard the bridges,-the rest, however, <lb/>
            who joined the expedition from the Pontus, contributed a hun­ <lb/>
            dred ships; they were equipped like the Greeks: these are <lb/>
            colonists of the Ionians and Dorians.</p>
          <p>96. Persians, Medes, and Sacæ served as marines on board <lb/>
            all the ships. Of these the Phoenicians furnished the best <lb/>
            sailing ships, and of the Phœnicians the Sidonians. Over all <lb/>
            these, as well as over those that formed the land-army, native <lb/>
            officers were appointed to each ; but I do not mention their <lb/>
            names, for I am not necessarily constrained to do so for the <lb/>
            purpose of the history; nor were the officers of each nation <lb/>
            worthy of mention ; and in each nation, as many as the cities <lb/>
            were, so many were the leaders. They did not, however, fol­ <lb/>
            low in the quality of generals, but like the other subjects who <lb/>
            joined the expedition. Moreover the generals, who had all the <lb/>
            power, and were the commanders of the several nations, such <lb/>
            of them as were Persians have been already mentioned by me. <lb/>
            97. The following were admirals of the navy: Ariabignes, son <lb/>
            of Darius; Prexaspes, son of Aspathines: Megabazus, son of <lb/>
            Megabates; and Achæmenes, son of Darius: of the Ionian <lb/>
            and Carian force, Ariabignes, son of Darius and the daughter <lb/>
            of Gobryas ; Achæmenes, who was brother to Xerxes on both <lb/>
            sides, commanded the Egyptians; and the other two com­ <lb/>
            manded the rest of the fleet. Triëconters, penteconters, light <lb/>
            boats, and long horse transports were found to assemble to the <lb/>
            number of three thousand. 98. Of those who served in the <lb/>
            fleet, the following, next to the admirals, were the most illus­ <lb/>
            trious ; Tetramnestus, son of Anysus, a Sidonian ; Mapen, son <lb/>
            of Siromus, a Tyrian ; Merbalus, son of Agbalus, an Aridian ; <lb/>
            Syennesis, son of Oromedon, a Cilician; Cyberniscus, son of <lb/>
            Sicas, a Lycian; Gorgus, son of Chersis, and Timonax, son <lb/>
            of Timagoras, Cyprians ; and of the Carians, Histiæus, son of <lb/>
            Tymnes ; Pygres, son of Seldomus, and 'Damasithymus, son <lb/>
            of Candaules. 99. Of the other captains I make no mention, <lb/>
            as I deem it unnecessary, except of Artemisia, whom I most <lb/>
            admire, as having, though a woman, joined this expedition <lb/>
            against Greece; who, her husband being dead. herself hold- <pb n="442"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[100,101."/> <lb/>
            ing the sovereignty while her son was under age, joined the <lb/>
            expedition from a. feeling of courage and manly spirit, though <lb/>
            there was no necessity for her doing so. Her name was Ar­ <lb/>
            temisia, and she was the daughter of Lygdamis, and by birth <lb/>
            she was of Halicarnassus on her father's side, and on her <lb/>
            mother's a Cretan. She commanded the Halicarnassians, the <lb/>
            Coans, the Nisyrians, and the Calydnians, having contributed <lb/>
            five ships: and of the whole fleet, next to the Sidonians, she <lb/>
            furnished the most renowned ships, and of all the allies, gave <lb/>
            the best advice to the king. The cities which I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned as being under her command, I pronounce to be all <lb/>
            of Doric origin; the Halicarnassians being Trœzenians, and <lb/>
            the rest Epidaurians. Thus far the naval armament has been <lb/>
            spoken of.</p>
          <p>100. Xerxes, when be had numbered his forces, and the <lb/>
            army was drawn up, desired to pass through and inspect them <lb/>
            in person. Accordingly he did so, and driving through on a <lb/>
            chariot, by each separate nation, he made inquiries, and his <lb/>
            secretaries wrote down the answers; until he had gone from <lb/>
            one extremity to the other, both of the horse and foot. When <lb/>
            he had finished this, and the ships had been launched into the <lb/>
            sea, Xerxes thereupon removing from his chariot to a Sidonian <lb/>
            ship, sat under a gilded canopy, and then sailed by the prows <lb/>
            of the ships, asking questions of each, as lie had done with <lb/>
            the land-forces, and having the answers written down. The <lb/>
            captains of the ships having drawn their vessels about four <lb/>
            plethra from the beach, lay to, all having turned their ships <lb/>
            frontwise to land, and having armed the marines as if for <lb/>
            a battle; but Xerxes, sailing between the prows and the <lb/>
            beach, inspected them.</p>
          <p>101. When he had sailed through them, and had landed <lb/>
            from the ship, he sent for Demaratus, son of Ariston, who <lb/>
            accompanied him in the expedition against Greece; and having <lb/>
            called him, he addressed him thus: "Demaratus, it is now <lb/>
            my pleasure to ask of you certain questions that I wish. You <lb/>
            are a Greek, and, as I am informed by you, and other Greeks <lb/>
            who have conversed with me, of a city neither the least nor <lb/>
            the weakest. Now, therefore, tell me this, whether the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians will venture to lift their hands against me: for, as I <lb/>
            think, if all the Grecians, and all the rest of the nations that <lb/>
            dwell towards the west, were collected together, they would <pb n="443"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="102 103.]"/> <lb/>
            not be able to withstand my attack, unless they were united <lb/>
            together. However, I am desirous to know what you say on <lb/>
            this subject." Such was the question he asked; but Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus answering said, " 0 king, whether shall I speak truth <lb/>
            to you, or what is pleasing?" He bade him speak truth,, <lb/>
            assuring him that he. would not be at all less agreeable than <lb/>
            he was before. 102. When Demaratus heard this, he spoke <lb/>
            thus: " 0 king, since you positively require me to speak truth, <lb/>
            I will say such things, as whoever should utter them, would <lb/>
            not hereafter be convicted of falsehood. Poverty has ever <lb/>
            been familiar to Greece, but virtue has been acquired, having <lb/>
            been accomplished. by wisdom and firm laws; by the aid of <lb/>
            which, Greece has warded off poverty and tyranny. I com­ <lb/>
            mend, indeed, all those Greeks who dwell round those Doric <lb/>
            lands; but I shall now proceed to speak, not of all, but of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians only. In the first place, I say it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible that they should ever listen to your proposals, which <lb/>
            bring slavery on Greece: secondly, that they will meet you <lb/>
            in battle, even if all the rest of the Greeks should side with <lb/>
            you. With respect to their number, you need not ask how <lb/>
            many they are, that they are able to do this; for whether a <lb/>
            thousand men, or more, or even less, should have marched out, <lb/>
            they will certainly give you battle." 103. Xerxes, having <lb/>
            heard this, replied, " Demaratus, what have you said ? that a <lb/>
            thousand men will fight with such an army as this ? Come, <lb/>
            tell me, you say that you were yourself king of these men ? <lb/>
            Are you, then, willing on the spot to fight with ten men ? <lb/>
            And yet if all your citizens are such as you represent, you, <lb/>
            who are their king, ought by your own institutions to be <lb/>
            matched against twice that number; for if each of them is a <lb/>
            match for ten men in my army, I expect that you should be <lb/>
            a match for twenty, so the opinion you have given utterance <lb/>
            to would prove correct. But if, being such as yourself, and <lb/>
            of the same stature as you and other Greeks who have con­ <lb/>
            versed with me, ye boast so much, beware that the opinion <lb/>
            you have uttered be not an idle vaunt. For come, let us con­ <lb/>
            sider every probability: how could a thousand men, or even <lb/>
            ten thousand, or even fifty thousand, being all equally free, <lb/>
            and not subject to the command of a single person, resist such <lb/>
            an army as this ? for if they are five thousand, we are more <lb/>
            than a thousand against one. Were they, indeed, according <pb n="444"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[104, 105"/> <lb/>
            to our custom, subject to the command of a single person, <lb/>
            they might, through fear of him, prove superior to their <lb/>
            natural courage; and, compelled by the lash, might, though <lb/>
            fewer, attack a greater number: but now, being left to their <lb/>
            own free-will, they will do nothing of the kind. And I am <lb/>
            of opinion, that even if they were equal in numbers, the <lb/>
            Grecians would hardly contend with the Persians alone. For <lb/>
            the valour that you speak of, exists amongst us; it is not, <lb/>
            however, common, but rare. For there are Persians among <lb/>
            my body-guards, who would readily encounter three Greeks <lb/>
            at once; and you, having no experience of these men, talk <lb/>
            very idly." 104. To this Demaratus replied, " 0 king, I <lb/>
            knew from the first, that by adhering to the truth, I should <lb/>
            not say what would be agreeable to you ; but since you con-' <lb/>
            strained me to speak the exact truth, I told you the real cha­ <lb/>
            racter of the Spartans. However, you yourself well know <lb/>
            how tenderly I must love them, who, after they had deprived <lb/>
            me of my paternal honours and dignity, have made me citiless <lb/>
            and an exile ; but your father, having received me, gave me <lb/>
            maintenance and a home: it is not probable therefore that a pru­ <lb/>
            dent man should repel manifest benevolence, but should by all <lb/>
            means cherish it. For my part, I do not pretend to be able to <lb/>
            fight with ten men, nor with two ; nor would I willingly fight <lb/>
            with one. But if there was any necessity, or any great stake <lb/>
            to rouse me, I would most willingly fight with one of those <lb/>
            men, who pretend to be singly a match for three Grecians: <lb/>
            In like manner the Lacedæmonians in single combat are in­ <lb/>
            ferior to none; but together are the bravest of all men. For <lb/>
            though free, they are not absolutely free; for they have a' <lb/>
            master over them, the law, which they fear much more than <lb/>
            your subjects do you. They do, accordingly, whatever it en­ <lb/>
            joins ; and it ever enjoins the same thing, forbidding them to <lb/>
            fly from battle before any number of men, but to remain <lb/>
            in their ranks, and conquer or die. If I appear to you, In <lb/>
            saying this, to talk idly, I will for the future observe silence <lb/>
            on this subject, and now I have spoken through compulsion ; <lb/>
            however, may events, 0 king, turn out according to your <lb/>
            wish."</p>
          <p>105. Such was the reply he made. But Xerxes turned it <lb/>
            into ridicule, and evinced no anger, but dismissed him kindly. <lb/>
            Xerxes, having held this conversation, and appointed Mas- <pb n="445"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="100-108.]"/> <lb/>
            cames, son of Megadostes, to be governor of this Doriscus, and <lb/>
            having deposed the person placed there by Darius, marched <lb/>
            his army through Thrace towards Greece. 106. Masoames, <lb/>
            whom he left, proved so excellent a man, that Xerxes used to <lb/>
            Bend presents every year to him alone, as being the best of all <lb/>
            the governors whom either he or Darius had appointed ; and <lb/>
            he used to send them every year ; as did also Artaxerxes, son <lb/>
            of Xerxes, to the descendants of Mascames. For even before <lb/>
            this expedition governors had been appointed in Thrace, and <lb/>
            throughout the Hellespont. Now all these, both in Thrace <lb/>
            and on the Hellespont, except the one in Doriscus, were driven <lb/>
            out by the Greeks after this invasion ; but none were able to <lb/>
            drive out Mascames, who was in Doriscus, though many made <lb/>
            the attempt. On this account presents are sent to his family <lb/>
            by the reigning king of Persia. 107. But of all those who <lb/>
            were driven out by the Greeks, king Xerxes thought no one had <lb/>
            behaved himself with courage except Boges, who was governor <lb/>
            of Eion. Him he never ceased praising, and conferred the <lb/>
            highest honours on his sons who survived in Persia. And in­ <lb/>
            deed Boges deserved great praise ; for when he was besieged <lb/>
            by the Athenians under Cimon, son of Miltiades, and might <lb/>
            have marched out by capitulation and returned to Asia, he <lb/>
            would not do so, lest the king should think he saved his life <lb/>
            through cowardice ; but he held out to the last. And when <lb/>
            there was no longer any food in the fort, having raised a great <lb/>
            pile, he slew his children and wife, and concubines and serv­ <lb/>
            ants, and then threw their bodies into the fire ; after this he <lb/>
            cast all the gold and silver that was in the tower, from the fort <lb/>
            into the Strymon ; and having done this, he threw himself <lb/>
            into the fire. So that he is with justice commended by the <lb/>
            Persians even to this day.</p>
          <p>108. Xerxes set out from Doriscus towards Greece, and <lb/>
            compelled such nations as he met with to join his army. For, <lb/>
            as I before observed,5 the whole country as far as Thessaly <lb/>
            had been brought to subjection, and made tributary to the <lb/>
            king, Megabazus, and afterwards Mardonius, having subdued <lb/>
            it. In his march from Doriscus, he first passed the Samothracian <lb/>
            fortresses ; the last of which is situate towards the west, and <lb/>
            is a city called Mesambria; near this is Stryme, a city of the <lb/>
            Thasians. Between these two places the river Lissus flows ; <note type="footnote"> See B. V ch. 12,15; and B. VI. ch. 43—45. </note> <pb n="446"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[109—113."/> <lb/>
            which did not supply sufficient water for the army of Xerxes, <lb/>
            but failed. This country was anciently called Gallaica, but <lb/>
            now Brian tica; in strict right, however, it belongs to the <lb/>
            Ciconians.</p>
          <p>109. Xerxes having crossed the dried-up channel of the <lb/>
            river Lissus, passed by the following Grecian cities, Maronea, <lb/>
            Dicæa, and Abdera; he accordingly went by these, and near <lb/>
            them, the following celebrated lakes ; the Ismaris, situate be­ <lb/>
            tween Maronea and Stryme; and Bistonis, near DicaTa, into <lb/>
            which two rivers empty their water, the Travus and Comp­ <lb/>
            satus. Near Abdera Xerxes passed by no celebrated lake, <lb/>
            but the river Nestus, which flows into the sea. After these <lb/>
            places he passed in his march by several continental cities; <lb/>
            in one of which is a lake about thirty stades in circumference ; <lb/>
            it abounds in fish, and is very brackish. The beasts of burden <lb/>
            alone, being watered there, dried this up. The name of this <lb/>
            city is Pistyrus. These cities, then, maritime and Grecian, he <lb/>
            passed by, leaving them on the left hand. 110. The nations <lb/>
            of Thrace, through whose country he marched, are these ; the <lb/>
            Pæti, Ciconians, Bistonians, Sapæi, Dersæi, Edoni, and Satræ. <lb/>
            Of these, such as dwelt near the sea attended him with their <lb/>
            ships; and such as dwelt inland, who have been enumerated <lb/>
            by me, all, except the Satræ, were compelled to follow by <lb/>
            land. 111. The Satræ, as far as we are informed, were never <lb/>
            subject to any man, but alone, of all the Thracians, have con­ <lb/>
            tinued free to this day. For they inhabit lofty mountains, <lb/>
            covered with all kinds of wood and snow, and arc courageous <lb/>
            in war. These are the people that possess an oracle of Bac­ <lb/>
            chus ; this oracle is on the highest range of their mountains. <lb/>
            The Bessi are those among the Satræ who interpret the oracles <lb/>
            of the temple; a priestess delivers them, as in Delphi, and they <lb/>
            are not at all more ambiguous. 112. Xerxes, having traversed <lb/>
            the country that has been mentioned, after this passed by <lb/>
            the forts of the Pierians, one of which is called Phngres, and <lb/>
            the other Pergamus: here he marched close to the very forts, <lb/>
            keeping on his right hand Mount Pangæus, which is vast and <lb/>
            lofty, and in it are gold and silver mines, which the Pierians <lb/>
            and Odomanti, and especially the Satræ, work. 113. Passing <lb/>
            by the Pæonians, Doberes, and Pæoplæ, who dwell above <lb/>
            Pangaeus to the north, he went westward, till he arrived at <lb/>
            the river Strvmon, and the city of Eion; of which Boges, <pb n="447"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="114- 17.]"/> <lb/>
            whom I have lately mentioned,6 being still alive, was go­ <lb/>
            vernor. The land itself, which is about Mount Pangæus, is <lb/>
            called Phillis, extending westward to the river Angites, which <lb/>
            falls into the Strymon; and on the south, reaching to the <lb/>
            Strymon itself, which the magi propitiated by sacrificing <lb/>
            white horses to it. 114. Having used these enchantments to <lb/>
            the river, and many others besides, they marched by the <lb/>
            Nine Ways of the Edonians to the bridges, and found the <lb/>
            banks of the Strymon united by a bridged But being in­ <lb/>
            formed that this place was called the Nine Ways, they buried <lb/>
            alive in it so many sons and daughters of the inhabitants. It <lb/>
            is a Persian custom to bury people alive; for I have heard <lb/>
            that Amestris, wife of Xerxes, having grown old, caused. <lb/>
            fourteen children of the best families in Persia to be buried <lb/>
            alive, to show her gratitude to the god who is said to be be­ <lb/>
            neath the earth.</p>
          <p>115. When the army marched from the Strymon, there is a <lb/>
            shore towards the sun-set on which it passed by a Grecian <lb/>
            city called Argilus; this and the country above it is called <lb/>
            Bisaltia: from thence keeping the bay near the temple of <lb/>
            Neptune on the left hand, it went through what is called the <lb/>
            plain of Syleus ; and passing. by Stagirus, a Grecian city, ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Acanthus ; taking with them each of the above na­ <lb/>
            tions, and those that dwell round Mount Pangæus, as well as <lb/>
            those which I have before enumerated; having those that <lb/>
            dwelt near the sea to serve on shipboard, and those above the <lb/>
            sea to follow on foot. This road, along which king Xerxes <lb/>
            marched his army, the Thracians neither disturb nor sow, but <lb/>
            regard it with great veneration even to my time. 116. When <lb/>
            he arrived at Acanthus, the Persian enjoined the Acanthians <lb/>
            to show them hospitality, and presented them with a Medic <lb/>
            dress, and commended them, seeing them ready for the war, <lb/>
            and hearing of the excavation at Mount Athos.8 117. While <lb/>
            Xerxes was at Acanthus, it happened that Artachæes, who <lb/>
            had superintended the canal, died of disease ; he was much <lb/>
            asteemed by Xerxes, and was of the race of the Achæmenidæ, <lb/>
            and in stature the tallest of the Persians, for he wanted only <lb/>
            four fingers of five royal cubits; and he had the loudest voice <note type="footnote"> Chap. 107. </note><note type="footnote">7 See chap. 24... </note><note type="footnote">See chap. 22. The Acanthians, who bordered on Mount Athos had, <lb/>
            probably, facilitated the w)rk. </note> <pb n="448"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[118—120"/> <lb/>
            of any man, so that Xerxes, considering his loss very great, <lb/>
            had him carried to the grave and buried him with great pomp ; <lb/>
            and the whole army raised up a mound for his sepulchre. To <lb/>
            this Artachæes the Acanthians, in obedience to an oracle, offer <lb/>
            sacrifice as to a hero, invoking him by name. King Xerxes <lb/>
            therefore, when Artachæes died, considered it a great loss. 118. <lb/>
            Those of the Grecians who received the army and entertained <lb/>
            Xerxes, were reduced to extreme distress, so that they were <lb/>
            obliged to abandon their homes; since Antipater, son of <lb/>
            Orges, one of the most distinguished citizens, being selected <lb/>
            by the Thasians, who received and entertained the army of <lb/>
            Xerxes on behalf of the cities on the continent, showed that <lb/>
            four hundred talents of silver had been expended on the ban­ <lb/>
            quet. 119. In like manner those who superintended in the <lb/>
            other cities gave in their accounts. For the banquet was of <lb/>
            the following kind, as being ordered long beforehand, and <lb/>
            considered of great importance. In the first place, as soon as <lb/>
            they heard the heralds proclaiming it all around, the citizens, <lb/>
            having distributed the corn that was in the cities, all made <lb/>
            flour and meal for many months ; and in the next place, they <lb/>
            fatted cattle, finding the best they could for money, and fed <lb/>
            land and water fowl in coops and ponds, for the entertain­ <lb/>
            ment of the army : moreover, they made gold and silver cups <lb/>
            and vessels, and all such things as are placed on a table. But <lb/>
            these things were made for the king himself, and those who <lb/>
            sat at table with him ; for the rest of the army provisions only <lb/>
            were required. Wherever the army arrived, a tent was readily <lb/>
            pitched, in which Xerxes himself lodged ; but the rest of the <lb/>
            army remained in the open air. When meal time came, those <lb/>
            who received them had all the trouble ; but the guests, when <lb/>
            they had been satisfied and passed the night there, on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing day, having torn up the tent and taken all the furniture, <lb/>
            went away, leaving nothing, but carrying away every thing. <lb/>
            120. On this occasion, a clever remark was made by Maga­ <lb/>
            creon of Abdera, who advised the Abderites " to go in a body, <lb/>
            themselves and their wives, to their own temples, and to seat <lb/>
            themselves as suppliants of the gods, beseeching them also <lb/>
            for the future to avert one half of the evils that were coming <lb/>
            upon them; and to express their hearty thanks for what was <lb/>
            passed, that king Xerxes was not accustomed to take food twice <lb/>
            every day: for if they had been ordered to prepare a dinner <pb n="449"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="121-123.]"/> <lb/>
            as well m a supper, they, the Abderites, would have been com­ <lb/>
            pelled either not to await the arrival of Xerxes, or, if they had <lb/>
            awaited him, they must have been worn down the most miser­ <lb/>
            ably of all men." They, however, though hard put to it, exe <lb/>
            cuted the order imposed on them.</p>
          <p>121. At Acanthus Xerxes dismissed the ships from his <lb/>
            presence to proceed on their voyage, having given orders to <lb/>
            the admirals that the fleet should await his arrival at Ther­ <lb/>
            ma; at Therma which is situated on the Thermaean gulf, and <lb/>
            from which that gulf derives its name; for he had heard that <lb/>
            that was the shortest way. As far as Acanthus the army <lb/>
            marched from Doriscus in the following order. Xerxes, hav­ <lb/>
            ing divided the whole land forces into three bodies, ordered <lb/>
            one of them to accompany the fleet along the coast; of this <lb/>
            division Mardonius and Masistes were commanders. Another <lb/>
            of the three divisions of the army marched inland, commanded <lb/>
            by Trintantæchmes and Gersis. But the third division, with <lb/>
            which Xerxes himself went, marched between the other two, <lb/>
            and had for generals Smerdomenes and Megabyzus. 122. <lb/>
            The fleet accordingly, when it had been dismissed by Xerxes, <lb/>
            and had passed through the canal which was at Athos extend­ <lb/>
            ing to the bay on which the cities of Assa, Pilorus, Singus, <lb/>
            and Sarta are situate, after that, when it had taken troops on <lb/>
            board from those cities sailed with all speed to the Thermæan <lb/>
            bay. Doubling Ampelus, the Toronæan foreland, it passed <lb/>
            bythe following Greek cities, from which it took ships and <lb/>
            men, Torone, Galepsus, Sermyla, Mecyberna, and Olynthus; <lb/>
            all which country is now called Sithonia. 123. Xerxes's <lb/>
            fleet, stretching across from the cape of Ampelus to the cape <lb/>
            ofCanastraeum, which is the most prominent point of all <lb/>
            Pallene, thence took ships and men from Potidæa, Aphytis, <lb/>
            Neapolis, Æga, Therambus, Scione, Menda, and Sana, for <lb/>
            these are the cities that belong to what is now Pallene, but <lb/>
            was formerly called Phlegra. Coasting along this country, it <lb/>
            sailed to the appointed place, taking with them troops also <lb/>
            rom the cities near Pallene and bordering on the Thermæan <lb/>
            gulf ; their names are as follows: Lipaxus, Combrea, Lisæ, <lb/>
            Gigonus, Campsa, Smila, and Ænea. The country in which <lb/>
            hese cities are situate, is to the present time called by the <lb/>
            name of Crossæa. From Ænea, with-.which I ended my <lb/>
            enumeration of the cities, the course of the fleet'was direct to <note type="footnote"> <unclear>a</unclear> e </note> <pb n="450"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[124—158"/> <lb/>
            the Thermæan gulf and the Mygdonian territory : and sailing <lb/>
            on, it reached the appointed place, Therma, and Sindus and <lb/>
            Chalestra, on the river Axius, which divides the territories of <lb/>
            Mygdonia and Bottiæis ; on a narrow tract of which, near the <lb/>
            sea, stand the cities of Ichnæ and Pella.</p>
          <p>124. The naval force encamped there near the river Axius, <lb/>
            and the city of Therma, and the intermediate places, awaiting <lb/>
            the arrival of the king. But Xerxes and the land army <lb/>
            marched from Acanthus, taking the road through the interior, <lb/>
            wishing to reach Therma. And he marched through the Pæo­ <lb/>
            nian and Crestonian territories towards the river Echidorus, <lb/>
            which beginning from the Crestonians, flows through the <lb/>
            Mygdonian territory, and discharges itself into the marsh <lb/>
            which is above the river Axius. 125. While he was march­ <lb/>
            ing in this direction lions fell upon his camels that carried pro­ <lb/>
            visions : for the lions coming down by night and leaving their <lb/>
            usual haunts, seized nothing else, whether beast of burden or <lb/>
            man; but they attacked the camels only. And I wonder <lb/>
            what the reason could be, that induced the lions to abstain <lb/>
            from all the rest, and set upon the camels ; a beast which they <lb/>
            had never before seen or made trial of. 126. But in those <lb/>
            parts lions are numerous, and wild bulls, which have very <lb/>
            large horns that are brought into Greece. The boundaries of <lb/>
            the lions are the river Nestus, which flows through Abdera, <lb/>
            and the Achelous, which flows through Acarnania. For no <lb/>
            one would ever see a lion any where eastward of the Nes­ <lb/>
            tus, throughout the forepart of Europe, nor to the west of <lb/>
            the Achelous, in the rest of the continent, but they breed in <lb/>
            the tract between these two rivers. 127. When Xerxes ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Therma, he there ordered his army to halt. And <lb/>
            his army, when encamped, occupied the following district along <lb/>
            the coast; commencing from the city of Therma, and from <lb/>
            Mygdonia, to the rivers Lydias and Haliacmon, which divide <lb/>
            the territories of Bottiæis and Macedonia, uniting their waters <lb/>
            into the same channel. In these countries, then, the barba­ <lb/>
            rians encamped. Of the rivers above mentioned, the Echido­ <lb/>
            rus, which flows' from the Crestonians, was the only one that <lb/>
            was not sufficient for the army, but failed.</p>
          <p>128. Xerxes seeing from Therma the Thessalonian moun­ <lb/>
            tains, Olympus and Ossa, which are of vast size, and having <lb/>
            learnt that there was a narrow pass between them, through <pb n="451"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="129.]"/> <lb/>
            which the river Peneus runs, and hearing that at that spot <lb/>
            there was a road leading to Thessaly, very much wished to <lb/>
            sail and see the mouth of the Peneus ; because he designed to <lb/>
            march by the upper road through the country of the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians, who dwell higher up, to the territory of the Perrhæbi, <lb/>
            near the city of Gonnus; for he was informed that this was <lb/>
            the safest way. Accordingly, as he wished, so he did. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing gone on board a Sidonian ship, in which he always em­ <lb/>
            barked whenever he wished to do any thing of this kind, he <lb/>
            madea signal for all the rest of the fleet to get under weigh, <lb/>
            leaving the land forces where they were. When Xerxes arrived, <lb/>
            and beheld the mouth of the Peneus, he was .struck with great <lb/>
            astonishment; and having called his guides, asked if it would <lb/>
            be possible to turn the river and conduct'it by another chan­ <lb/>
            nel into the sea. 129. It is said that. Thessaly was an­ <lb/>
            iently a lake, since it is enclosed on all sides by lofty moun­ <lb/>
            ains. For the side next the east Mount Pelion and Ossa shut <lb/>
            n, mingling their bases with each other ; and the side towards <lb/>
            he north Olympus shuts in; and the west, Pindus ; and the <lb/>
            side towards the mid-day and the south wind Othrys: the <lb/>
            pace in the midst of the above-mentioned mountains is Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, which is hollow. Since, then, several other rivers flow <lb/>
            nto it, and these five most noted ones, the Peneus, the Api­ <lb/>
            anus, the Onochonus, the Enipeus, and the Pamisus ; these <lb/>
            hat have been named, accordingly, meeting together in this <lb/>
            lain from the mountains that enclose Thessaly, discharge <lb/>
            hemselves into the sea through one channel, and that a narrow <lb/>
            ne, having all before mingled their waters into the same <lb/>
            tream ; but as soon as they have mingled together, from <lb/>
            hat spot the names of the other rivers merge in that of the <lb/>
            'eneus.9 It is said, that formerly, when the pass and outlet <lb/>
            lid not yet exist, these rivers, and besides them the lake <lb/>
            Bœbeis, were not called by the names they now bear, though <lb/>
            hey flowed not less than they do now; but that by their <lb/>
            tream they made all Thessaly a lake. However, the Thessa­ <lb/>
            ans themselves say, that Neptune made, the pass through <unclear/><lb/>
            hich the Peneus news ; and their story is probable. For who <lb/>
            ver thinks that Neptune shakes the earth, and that rants oc­ <lb/>
            asioned by earthquakes are the works of this god, on seeing <note type="footnote"> * Literally, "the river Peneus gaining the victory <unclear>at</unclear> to the name <lb/>
            auses the others to be nameless." </note><note type="footnote"> 2G2</note> <pb n="452"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[130-138."/> <lb/>
            this, would say that Neptune formed it. For it appears evident <lb/>
            to me, that the separation of these mountains is the effect of <lb/>
            an earthquake. 130. The guides, when Xerxes asked if there <lb/>
            was any other exit for the Peneus to the sea, being accurately <lb/>
            acquainted with the country, said, " 0 king, this river has no <lb/>
            other outlet that extends to the sea, except this one; for all <lb/>
            Thessaly is surrounded by mountains." Xerxes is reported <lb/>
            to have said to this: " The Thessalians are prudent men, and <lb/>
            therefore they long ago took precautions, and altered their <lb/>
            minds, both on other accounts, and because they possessed a <lb/>
            country which might be easily subdued and quickly taken. <lb/>
            For it would only be necessary to turn the river on to their <lb/>
            territory, by forcing it back by a mound at the pass, and di­ <lb/>
            verting it from the channels through which it now flows, so <lb/>
            that all Thessaly, except the mountains, would be inundated." <lb/>
            Xerxes expressed himself thus in reference to the sons of <lb/>
            Aleuas,l because they, being Thessalians, were the first of the <lb/>
            Greeks who gave themselves up to the king; Xerxes sup­ <lb/>
            posing that they promised alliance in behalf of the whole <lb/>
            nation. Having thus spoken, and viewed the spot, he sailed <lb/>
            back to Therma.</p>
          <p>131. He remained several days about Pieria, for a third <lb/>
            division of his army was employed in felling the trees on the <lb/>
            Macedonian range, that the whole army might pass in that <lb/>
            direction to the Perrhæbi. In the mean time the heralds,2 who <lb/>
            had been sent to Greece to demand earth, returned to Xerxes; <lb/>
            some empty, and others bringing earth and water. 132. Of <lb/>
            those who gave them were the following: the Thessalians, <lb/>
            the Dolopes, the Enienes, the Perrhæbi, the Locrians, the Mag­ <lb/>
            netes, the Melians, the Achaeans of Pthiotis, and the Thebans, <lb/>
            and all the rest of the Boeotians, except the Thespians and <lb/>
            Platæans. Against these the Greeks, who engaged in war <lb/>
            with the barbarians, made a solemn oath. The oath ran as <lb/>
            follows: " Whatever Greeks have given themselves up to the <lb/>
            Persian, without compulsion, so soon as their affairs are re­ <lb/>
            stored to order, that these should be compelled to pay a tithe <lb/>
            to the god at Delphi." Such was the oath taken by the <lb/>
            Greeks. 133. To Athens and Sparta he did not send heralds <lb/>
            to demand earth, for the following reasons: On a former oc­ <lb/>
            casion, when Darius sent for the same purpose, the former <note type="footnote"> ' See chap. 6. </note><note type="footnote">2 See chap. 32 </note> <pb n="453"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="134, 135.]"/> <lb/>
            having thrown those who made the demand into the barathrum,3 <lb/>
            and the latter into a well, bade them carry earth and water to <lb/>
            the king from those places. For that reason, Xerxes did not <lb/>
            send persons to make the demand. What calamity betel the <lb/>
            Athenians, in consequence of their having treated the heralds <lb/>
            in this manner, I cannot say, except that their territory and <lb/>
            city were ravaged; but I do not think that happened in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of that crime. 134. On the Lacedæmonians, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the anger of Talthybius, Agamemnon's herald, alighted. <lb/>
            For Talthybius has a temple in Sparta; and there are de­ <lb/>
            scendants of Talthybius, called Talthybiadæ, to whom all <lb/>
            embassies from Sparta are given as a privilege. After these <lb/>
            events, the Spartans were unable, when they sacrificed, to get <lb/>
            favourable omens; and this continued for a long time. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians being grieved, and considering it a great <lb/>
            calamity, and having frequently held assemblies, and at length <lb/>
            made inquiry by public proclamation, whether any Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian was willing to die for Sparta, Sperthies, son of Ane­ <lb/>
            ristus, and Bulls, son of Nicolaus, both Spartans of distin­ <lb/>
            guished birth, and eminent for their wealth, voluntarily offered <lb/>
            to give satisfaction to Xerxes for the heralds of Darius who <lb/>
            had perished at Sparta. Accordingly, the Spartans sent them <lb/>
            to the Medes, for the purpose of being put to death. 135. <lb/>
            And both the courage of these men deserves admiration, and <lb/>
            also the following words on this occasion. For on their way <lb/>
            to Susa, they came to Hydarnes; but Hydarnes was a Persian <lb/>
            by birth, and governor of the maritime people in Asia; he <lb/>
            having offered them hospitality, entertained them, and while <lb/>
            he was entertaining them, he questioned them as follows, say­ <lb/>
            ing, " Men of Lacedæmon, why do you refuse to be friendly <lb/>
            with the king ? For you may see how well the king knows <lb/>
            how to honour brave men, by looking at me and my condition. <lb/>
            So also, if you would surrender yourselves to the king, for <lb/>
            you are deemed by him to be brave men, each of you would <lb/>
            obtain a government in some part of Greece, at the hands of <lb/>
            the king." To this they answered as follows: " Hydarnes, <lb/>
            the advice you hold out to us is not impartial; for you advise <lb/>
            us, having tried the one state, but being inexperienced in the <lb/>
            other: what it is to be a slave you know perfectly well, but <note type="footnote"> 2 The barathrum was a deep pit at Athens, into which certain criminals <lb/>
            who were sentenced to death were thrown. </note> <pb n="454"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[136-148."/> <lb/>
            you have never tried liberty, whether it is sweet or not. For <lb/>
            if you had tried it, you would advise us to fight for it, not <lb/>
            with spears, but even with hatchets." Thus they answered <lb/>
            Hydarnes. 136. Afterwards, when they went up to Susa, <lb/>
            and were come into the king's presence, in the first place, <lb/>
            when the guards commanded and endeavoured to compel them <lb/>
            to prostrate themselves and worship the king, they said, they <lb/>
            would by no means do so, although they were, thrust by them <lb/>
            on their heads; for that it was not their custom to worship <lb/>
            a man, nor had they come for that purpose. When they had <lb/>
            fought off this, and on their addressing Xerxes in words to <lb/>
            the following effect, " King of the Medes, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            have sent us in return for the heralds who were killed at <lb/>
            Sparta, to make satisfaction for them;" on their saying this, <lb/>
            Xerxes answered with magnanimity, " that he would not be <lb/>
            like the Lacedaemonians, for that they had violated the law of <lb/>
            all nations, by murdering his heralds; but he would not do <lb/>
            the very thing which he blamed in them ; nor by killing them <lb/>
            in return, would relieve the Lacedæmonians from guilt." 137. <lb/>
            Thus the wrath of Talthybius, when the Spartans acted in <lb/>
            this manner, ceased for the time, although Sperthies and Bulls <lb/>
            returned to Sparta. But some time afterwards it was again <lb/>
            aroused, during the war between the Peloponnesians and <lb/>
            Athenians, as the Lacedæmonians say; and this appears to <lb/>
            me to have happened in a most extraordinary manner: for <lb/>
            that the wrath of Talthybius alighted on the messengers, and <lb/>
            did not cease until it was satisfied, justice allowed; but that <lb/>
            it should fall on the sons of the men who went up to the king <lb/>
            on account of that wrath, on Nicolaus, son of Bulls, and on <lb/>
            Aneristus, son of Sperthies, who, sailing in a merchant vessel <lb/>
            fully manned, captured some fishermen from Tiryns, makes it <lb/>
            clear to me that the occurrence was extraordinary in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of that wrath. For they, being sent by the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians as ambassadors to Asia, and being betrayed by <lb/>
            Sitalces, son of Teres, king of the Thracians, and by Nympho­ <lb/>
            dorus, son of Pytheas of Abdera, were taken near Bisanthe <lb/>
            on the Hellespont, and being carried to Attica, were put to <lb/>
            death by the Athenians; and with them Aristeas, son of <lb/>
            Adimantus, a Corinthian. These things, however, happened <lb/>
            many years after the expedition of the king.</p>
          <p>138, But I return to my former subject. This expedition <pb n="455"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="139.140.]"/> <lb/>
            of the king was nominally directed against Athens, but was <lb/>
            really sent against all Greece. The Greeks, however, though <lb/>
            they had heard of it long beforehand, were not all affected <lb/>
            alike. For those who had given earth and water to the Per­ <lb/>
            sian, felt confident that they should suffer no harm from the <lb/>
            barbarian; but those who had refused to give them, were in <lb/>
            great consternation, since the ships in Greece were not suf­ <lb/>
            ficient in number to resist the invader, and many were un­ <lb/>
            willing to engage in the war, and were much inclined to side <lb/>
            with the Medes. 139. And here I feel constrained by neces­ <lb/>
            sity to declare my opinion, although it may excite the envy <lb/>
            of most men; however, I will not refrain from expressing <lb/>
            how the truth appears to me to be. If the Athenians, terri­ <lb/>
            fied with the impending danger, had abandoned their country; <lb/>
            or not having abandoned it, but remaining in it, had given <lb/>
            themselves up to Xerxes, no other people would have at­ <lb/>
            tempted to resist the king at sea. If, then, no one had op­ <lb/>
            posed Xerxes by sea, the following things must have occurred <lb/>
            on land. Although many lines of walls had been built by <lb/>
            the Peloponnesians across the Isthmus, yet the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            being abandoned by the allies, (not willingly, but by necessity, <lb/>
            they being taken by the barbarian city by city,) would have <lb/>
            been left alone; and being left alone, after having displayed <lb/>
            noble deeds, would have died nobly. They would either have <lb/>
            suffered thus, or before that, seeing the rest of the Greeks <lb/>
            siding with the Medes, would have made terms with Xerxes; <lb/>
            and so, in either case, Greece would have become subject to <lb/>
            the Persians; for I am unable to discover what would have <lb/>
            been the advantage of the walls built across the Isthmus, if <lb/>
            the king had been master of the sea. Any one, therefore, <lb/>
            who should say that the Athenians were the saviours of <lb/>
            Greece, would not deviate from the truth; for to whichever <lb/>
            side they turned, that must have preponderated. But having <lb/>
            chosen that Greece should continue free, they were the people <lb/>
            who roused the rest of the Greeks who did not side with the <lb/>
            Medes, and who, next to the gods, repulsed the king. Neither <lb/>
            did alarming oracles, that came from Delphi, and inspired <lb/>
            t4iem with terror, induce them to abandon Greece; but, stand­ <lb/>
            ing their ground, they had courage to await the invader of <lb/>
            their country.</p>
          <p>140. For the Athenians, having sent deputies to Delphi, were <pb n="456"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="f141,142."/> <lb/>
            anxious to consult the oracle: and after they had performed <lb/>
            the usual ceremonies about the temple, when they entered the <lb/>
            sanctuary and sat down, the Pythian, whose name was Aria­ <lb/>
            tonica, uttered the following warning: " 0 wretched men, <lb/>
            why sit ye here ? fly to the ends of the earth, leaving your <lb/>
            houses and the lofty summits of your wheel-shaped city. For <lb/>
            neither does the head remain firm nor the body, nor the lowest <lb/>
            feet nor the hands, nor is aught of the middle left, but they are <lb/>
            all fallen to ruin. For fire and fleet Mars, driving the Syrian <lb/>
            chariot, destroys it. And he will destroy many other turrets, <lb/>
            and not yours alone; and he will deliver many temples of <lb/>
            the immortals to devouring fire, which now stand dripping <lb/>
            with sweat, shaken with terror; and from the topmost roofs <lb/>
            trickles black blood, pronouncing inevitable woe. But go <lb/>
            from the sanctuary, and infuse your mind with courage to <lb/>
            meet misfortunes." 141. The deputies of the Athenians, <lb/>
            having heard this, deemed it a very great calamity; and when <lb/>
            they were dejected at the predicted evil, Timon, son of An­ <lb/>
            drobulus, a man reputed at Delphi equally with the best, ad­ <lb/>
            vised them to take supplicatory branches and go again and <lb/>
            consult the oracle as suppliants. The Athenians yielding to <lb/>
            this advice, and saying, " 0 king, vouchsafe to give us a <lb/>
            more favourable answer concerning our country, having re­ <lb/>
            gard to these supplicatory branches which we have brought <lb/>
            with us ; otherwise we will never depart from thy sanctuary, <lb/>
            but will remain here till we die." When they had said this, <lb/>
            the priestess gave a second answer, in these terms : " Pallas <lb/>
            is unable to propitiate Olympian Jove, entreating him with <lb/>
            many a prayer and prudent counsel. But to you again I <lb/>
            utter this speech, making it like adamant; for when all is <lb/>
            taken that the limit of Cecrops contains within it, and the <lb/>
            recesses of divine Cithæron, wide-seeing Jupiter gives a <lb/>
            wooden wall to the Triton-born goddess, to be alone impreg­ <lb/>
            nable, which shall preserve you and your children. Nor do <lb/>
            you quietly wait for the cavalry and infantry advancing in <lb/>
            multitudes from the continent, but turn your back and with­ <lb/>
            draw. You will still be able to face them. 0 divine Salamis, <lb/>
            thou shalt cause the sons of women to perish, whether Ceres <lb/>
            is scattered or gathered in." 142. Having written this an­ <lb/>
            swer down, for it appeared to them to be of milder import than <lb/>
            the former one, they departed for Athens: and when the <pb n="457"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="143, 144.]"/> <lb/>
            deputies, on their return, reported it to the people, many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent opinions were given by persons endeavouring to dis­ <lb/>
            cover the meaning of the oracle, and amongst them the two <lb/>
            following most opposed each other: Some of the old men said, <lb/>
            they thought the god foretold, that the Acropolis should be <lb/>
            saved ; for formerly the Acropolis was defended by a hedge; <lb/>
            they therefore on account of the hedge conjectured that this <lb/>
            was the wooden wall. Others, on the other hand, said, that <lb/>
            the god alluded to their ships, and therefore advised, that, <lb/>
            abandoning every thing else, they should get them ready. <lb/>
            However, the two last lines uttered by the Pythian perplexed <lb/>
            those who said that the wooden wall meant the ships: " 0 <lb/>
            divine Salamis, thou shalt cause the sons of women to perish, <lb/>
            whether Ceres is scattered or gathered in." By these words <lb/>
            the opinions of those who said that the ships were the wooden <lb/>
            wall, were disturbed : for the interpreters of oracles took them <lb/>
            in this sense, that they should be defeated off Salamis, if they <lb/>
            prepared for a sea-fight. 143. There was a certain Athenian <lb/>
            who had lately risen to eminence, whose name was Themisto­ <lb/>
            cles, but he was commonly called the son of Neocles ; this man <lb/>
            maintained, that the interpreters had not rightly understood <lb/>
            the whole, saying thus : " If the word that had been uttered <lb/>
            really did refer to the Athenians, he did not think that it <lb/>
            would have been expressed so mildly, but thus, ' 0 unhappy <lb/>
            Salamis,' instead of ' 0 divine Salamis,' if the inhabitants <lb/>
            were about to perish on its shores ; therefore whoever under­ <lb/>
            stood them rightly would conclude, that the oracle was pro­ <lb/>
            nounced by the god against their enemies, and not against the <lb/>
            Athenians." He advised them, therefore, to make preparations <lb/>
            for fighting by sea, since that was the wooden wall. When <lb/>
            Themistocles thus declared his opinion, the Athenians con­ <lb/>
            sidered it preferable to that of the interpreters who dissuaded <lb/>
            them from making preparations for a sea-fight, and in short <lb/>
            advised them not to make any resistance at all, but to aban­ <lb/>
            don the Attic territory, and settle in some other 144. An­ <lb/>
            other opinion of Themistocles had before this opportunely <lb/>
            prevailed. When the Athenians, having great riches in the <lb/>
            treasury, which came in from the mines of Laureum, were <lb/>
            about to share them man by man, to each ten drachmas ; <lb/>
            then Themistocles persuaded them to refrain from this dis­ <lb/>
            tribution, and to build two hundred ships with this money, <pb n="458"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[146, 14"/> <lb/>
            meaning for the war with the Æginetæ. For that war spring­ <lb/>
            ing up, at this time saved Greece, by compelling the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans to apply themselves to maritime affairs. The ships, how­ <lb/>
            ever, were used for the purpose for which they were built, but <lb/>
            were thus very serviceable to Greece. These, therefore, were <lb/>
            already built for the Athenians, and it was necessary to con­ <lb/>
            struct others besides. And it was resolved on their consulting <lb/>
            after the receipt of the oracle, to await the barbarian, who <lb/>
            was invading Greece, with their whole people on shipboard, <lb/>
            in obedience to the god, together with such Greeks as would <lb/>
            join them. Such, then, were the oracles delivered to the <lb/>
            Athenians.</p>
          <p>145. When the Greeks who were better affected towards <lb/>
            Greece were assembled together, and consulted with each <lb/>
            other, and gave pledges of mutual fidelity, it was thereupon <lb/>
            determined, on deliberation, that, before all things, they should <lb/>
            reconcile all existing enmities and wars with each other. For <lb/>
            there were wars in hand between several others, but the most <lb/>
            considerable was that between the Athenians and Æginetæ. <lb/>
            After this, being informed that Xerxes was with his army at <lb/>
            Sardis, they determined to send spies into Asia, in order to <lb/>
            discover the true state of the king's affairs; and to send am­ <lb/>
            bassadors to Argos to conclude an alliance against the Persians, <lb/>
            and others to Sicily, to Gelon, son of Dinomenes, and to Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra, and others to Crete, begging them to come to the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of Greece ; purposing, if possible, that Greece should be <lb/>
            united, and that all should combine in adopting the same plan, <lb/>
            in dangers which threatened all the Greeks alike; but the <lb/>
            power of Gelon was said to be very great, being far superior <lb/>
            to that of any other Grecian states. 146. When these things <lb/>
            were determined on by them, having reconciled their enmities, <lb/>
            they first of all sent three men as spies into Asia ; and they <lb/>
            having arrived at Sardis, and endeavoured to get intelligence <lb/>
            of the king's forces, when they were discovered, were ex­ <lb/>
            amined by the generals of the land-army, and led out to exe­ <lb/>
            cution, for sentence of death had been passed upon them. But <lb/>
            when Xerxes heard of this, disapproving of the decision of the <lb/>
            generals, he sent some of his guards, with orders to bring the <lb/>
            spies to him, if they should find them still alive. And when they <lb/>
            found them yet living, and brought them into the king's pre­ <lb/>
            sence, he thereupon, having inquired for what purpose they came. <pb n="459"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="147, 148.]"/> <lb/>
            commanded the guards to conduct them round, and show them <lb/>
            all the infantry and cavalry, and when they should be satisfied <lb/>
            with seeing them, to send them away unharmed, to whatever <lb/>
            country they should choose. 147. He issued these orders, <lb/>
            alleging the following reason, that " if the spies were put to <lb/>
            leath, the Greeks would neither be informed beforehand of <lb/>
            his power, that it was greater than could be described; nor <lb/>
            would he do any great harm to his enemies, by putting three <lb/>
            nen to death; whereas, if they returned to Greece, it was <lb/>
            is opinion," he said, " that the Greeks, having heard of his <lb/>
            power, would, of their own accord, surrender their liberty, <lb/>
            before the expedition should take place, and so it would not <lb/>
            be necessary to have the trouble of marching against them." <lb/>
            his opinion of his was like this other one. When Xerxes <lb/>
            as at Abydos, he saw certain ships laden with corn from the <lb/>
            Pontus, sailing through the Hellespont, on their way to Ægina <lb/>
            and the Peloponnesus. Those who sat near him, having heard <lb/>
            hat the ships belonged to the enemy, were ready to capture <lb/>
            hem, and fixing their eyes on the king, watched when he <lb/>
            vould give the order. But Xerxes asked his attendants where <lb/>
            hey were sailing ; they answered, " To your enemies, sire, <lb/>
            arrying corn." He answering, said, "Are not we also sailing <lb/>
            o the same place to which these men are, and provided with <lb/>
            ther things, and with corn ? What hurt, then, can they do <lb/>
            is by carrying corn thither for us ?" The spies, accordingly, <lb/>
            having seen the army, and being sent away, returned to <lb/>
            Europe.</p>
          <p>148. But the Greeks who had engaged in a confederacy <lb/>
            gainst the Persian, after the despatch of the spies, next sent <lb/>
            mbassadors to Argos. But the Argives say, that what con­ <lb/>
            erned them occurred as follows; that they heard from the <lb/>
            ery first of the design of the barbarian against Greece, and <lb/>
            aving heard of it, and learnt that the Greeks would endea­ <lb/>
            our to obtain their assistance against the Persian, they sent <lb/>
            ersons to consult the oracle of Delphi, and inquire of the <lb/>
            od " what course it would be best for them to adopt; for <lb/>
            x thousand of their number had recently been slain by the <lb/>
            acedæmonians, and by Cleomenes, son of Anaxandrides :’ <lb/>
            )r this reason they sent, and the Pythian gave the following <lb/>
            nswer to their inquiries: " Hated by your neighbours, be.! <lb/>
            ved by the immortal gods, holding your lance at rest, keep <pb n="460"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[149, 150"/> <lb/>
            on the watch, and guard your head; the head shall save the <lb/>
            body." They say, that the Pythian gave this answer first, <lb/>
            and afterwards, when the ambassadors came to Argos, they <lb/>
            were introduced to the council, and delivered their message; <lb/>
            and they answered to what was said, that " the Argives were <lb/>
            ready to comply, having first made a thirty years' truce with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and provided they might have an equal <lb/>
            share of the command of the allied forces; though in justice <lb/>
            the whole command belonged to them, yet they would be con­ <lb/>
            tent with the command over half." 149. This, they say, was <lb/>
            the answer of their senate, although the oracle had forbidden <lb/>
            them to enter into any alliance with the Grecians; and that <lb/>
            they were anxious to make a thirty years' truce, although they <lb/>
            feared the oracle, in order that their children might become <lb/>
            men during that time; but if a truce was not made, they were <lb/>
            apprehensive lest, if in addition to their present calamity, <lb/>
            another failure should befal them in the Persian war, they <lb/>
            might in future become subject to the Lacedæmonians. Those <lb/>
            of the ambassadors who came from Sparta gave the following <lb/>
            answer to what was said by the council: " that with respect <lb/>
            to a truce, it should be referred to the people; but with respect <lb/>
            to the command, they were instructed to. answer, and say, <lb/>
            that they had two kings, but the Argives only one; and <lb/>
            therefore it was not possible to deprive either of their kings <lb/>
            of his command; but that there was nothing to hinder the <lb/>
            Argive king from having an equal vote with their two." Thus <lb/>
            the Argives say, that they could not put up with the arrogance <lb/>
            of the Spartans, but that they rather chose to be subject to <lb/>
            the barbarians, than to yield to the Lacedæmonians ; and that <lb/>
            they ordered the ambassadors to quit the territories of the <lb/>
            Argives before sun-set, otherwise they would treat them as <lb/>
            enemies. 150. Such is the account which the Argives them­ <lb/>
            selves give of this affair. But another report is prevalent <lb/>
            throughout Greece, that Xerxes sent a herald to Argos, before <lb/>
            he set out on his expedition against Greece; and it is related <lb/>
            that he, on his arrival, said: " Men of Argos, king Xerxes <lb/>
            speaks thus to you. We are of opinion that Perses, from <lb/>
            whom we are sprung, was son of Perseus, son of Danae, born <lb/>
            of Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus. Thus, then, we must <lb/>
            be your descendants: it is, therefore, neither right that we <lb/>
            should lead an army against our progenitors, nor that you <pb n="461"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="151—153.]"/> <lb/>
            should assist others, and be opposed to us ; but should remain <lb/>
            quiet by yourselves: and if I succeed according to my wish, I <lb/>
            shall esteem none greater than you." It is said that the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, when they heard this, considered it a great thing, and <lb/>
            it once determined neither to promise any thing nor demand <lb/>
            my thing in return; but when the Greeks wished to take <lb/>
            them into the confederacy, they then, knowing that the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians would not share the command with them, made <lb/>
            the demand in order that they might have a pretext for re­ <lb/>
            maining quiet. 151. Some of the Greeks also say that the <lb/>
            following circumstance, which occurred many years after, ac­ <lb/>
            cords with this: Callias, son of Hipponicus, and those who <lb/>
            went up with him as ambassadors of the Athenians, happened <lb/>
            o be at the Memnonian Susa on some other business; and <lb/>
            he Argives at the same time having sent ambassadors to <lb/>
            3usa, asked Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, "whether the alliance <lb/>
            vhich they had formed with Xerxes still subsisted, or whether <lb/>
            hey were considered by him as enemies." King Artaxerxes <lb/>
            answered, "that it certainly subsisted, and that he considered <lb/>
            o city more friendly than Argos." 152. Now whether <lb/>
            Xerxes did send a herald to Argos with such a message, and <lb/>
            whether ambassadors of the Argives, having gone up to Susa, <lb/>
            sked Artaxerxes about the alliance, I cannot affirm with <lb/>
            certainty ; nor do I declare any other opinion on the subject <lb/>
            han what the Argives. themselves say. But this much I know, <lb/>
            hat if all men were to bring together their own faults into <lb/>
            one place, for the purpose of making an exchange with their <lb/>
            neighbours, when they had looked closely into their neigh­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ours' faults, each would gladly take back those which they <lb/>
            rought with them. Thus, the conduct of the Argives was <lb/>
            not the most base. But I am bound to relate what is said, <lb/>
            I hough I am not by any means bound to believe every thing: <lb/>
            nd let this remark apply to the whole history. For even this <lb/>
            s reported, that the Argives were the people who invited the <lb/>
            Persian to invade Greece, since their war with the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            nonians went on badly, wishing that any thing might happen <lb/>
            o them rather than continue in their present troubles. This <lb/>
            s sufficient concerning the Argives.</p>
          <p>153. Other ambassadors went from the allies to Sicily, to con­ <lb/>
            er with Gelon ; and amongst them Syagrus on the part of the <unclear/> <lb/>
            Lecedæmonians. An ancestor of this Gelon, who was an inhabit- <pb n="462"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[154,155]"/> <lb/>
            ant of Gela, game from the island of Telus, which lies off Trio­ <lb/>
            plum ; when Gela was founded by the Lindians from Rhodes <lb/>
            and by Antiphemus, he was not left behind ; and in course of <lb/>
            time his descendants becoming priests of the infernal deities, <lb/>
            continued to be so, Telines, one of their ancestors, having ac­ <lb/>
            quired that dignity in the following manner. Some of the <lb/>
            inhabitants of Gela being worsted in a sedition, had fled to <lb/>
            Mactorium, a city situated above Gela ; these men, then, Te­ <lb/>
            lines conducted back again, without the assistance of any <lb/>
            human force, but with the sacred things to those deities; <lb/>
            though whence he got them, or how he became possessed of <lb/>
            them, I am unable to say. However, relying on these, he <lb/>
            brought back the fugitives, on condition that his descendants <lb/>
            should be priests of the deities. From what I hear, I am <lb/>
            much astonished that Telines should have achieved such an <lb/>
            action ; for I have ever thought that such actions are not in <lb/>
            the reach of every man, but proceed from a brave spirit and <lb/>
            manly vigour. Whereas, on the contrary, he is reported by <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Sicily to have been an effeminate and deli­ <lb/>
            cate man. Thus, however, he acquired this dignity. 154. <lb/>
            On the death of Oleander, son of Pantares, who reigned seven <lb/>
            years over Gela, but was killed by Sabyllus, a citizen of Gela, <lb/>
            thereupon Hippocrates, who was brother to Oleander, succeed­ <lb/>
            ed to the sovereignty. While Hippocrates held the tyranny, <lb/>
            Gelon, who was a descendant of Telines the priest, was with <lb/>
            many others, and with Ænesidemus, son of Pataicus, one of <lb/>
            the guards of Hippocrates; and soon after was made com­ <lb/>
            mander of the whole cavalry on account of Iris valour. For <lb/>
            when Hippocrates besieged the Callipolitae, the Naxians, the <lb/>
            Zanclæans, the Leontines, and besides the Syracusans, and <lb/>
            divers of the barbarians, Gelon signalized himself in these <lb/>
            several wars ; and of the cities that I have mentioned, not one, <lb/>
            except the Syracusans, escaped servitude at the hands of Hippo­ <lb/>
            erates. But the Corinthians and Corcyræans saved the Syracu­ <lb/>
            sans, after they had been defeated in battle on the river Elorus ; <lb/>
            and they saved them, having reconciled them on the following <lb/>
            terms, that the Syracusans should give up Camarina to Hip­ <lb/>
            pocrates ; but Camarina originally belonged to the Syracusans. <lb/>
            155. When Hippocrates, having reigned the same number of <lb/>
            years as his brother Oleander, met with his death before Hybla, <lb/>
            while carrying on the war against the Sicilians. Gelon there­ <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" 156,157.]"/> <lb/>
            upon, under colour of .defending the rights of Euclides and <lb/>
            Oleander, sons of Hippocrates, the citizens refusing to be any <lb/>
            longer subject to them,—in fact, when he had defeated the <lb/>
            Geloans in battle, possessed himself of the sovereignty, and <lb/>
            leposed the sons of Hippocrates. After this success, Gelon <lb/>
            eading back those Syracusans who were called Gamori,4 and <lb/>
            had been expelled by the people, and by their own slaves, <lb/>
            called Cyllyrii, leading them back from the city of Casmene <lb/>
            o Syracuse, got possession of this also. For the people of <lb/>
            he Syracusans gave up the city and themselves to Gelon on <lb/>
            is first approach. 156. When he had made himself master <lb/>
            f Syracuse, he took less account of the government of Gela, <lb/>
            nd intrusted it to his brother Hiero; but he strengthened <lb/>
            Syracuse, and Syracuse was every thing to him; and it grew <lb/>
            p rapidly and flourished. For, first of all, he removed all <lb/>
            heCamarinæans to Syracuse, and made them citizens, and <lb/>
            estroyed the city of Camarina; and in the next place, he did <lb/>
            with more than half the Geloans the same that he had done <lb/>
            ith the Camarinæans. Moreover, the Megarians in Sicily, <lb/>
            when being besieged they came to terms, the more opulent of <lb/>
            hem, who had raised the war against him, and, therefore, <lb/>
            xpected to be put to death, he took to Syracuse and made <lb/>
            tizens; but the populace of the Megarians,'who had no part <lb/>
            promoting this war, nor expected to suffer any harm, he <lb/>
            so took to Syracuse, and sold them for exportation from <lb/>
            icily. He treated the Eubœans in Sicily in the same <lb/>
            tanner, and made the same distinction; and he treated them <lb/>
            othin this way, from an opinion that a populace is a most <lb/>
            sagreeable neighbour. By such means Gelon became a <lb/>
            owerful tyrant.</p>
          <p>157. At this time, when the ambassadors of the Grecians <lb/>
            rived at Syracuse, having come to a conference with him, <lb/>
            ey spoke as follows : " The Lacedæmonians, the Athenians, <lb/>
            id their allies have sent us to invite you to join with them <lb/>
            gainst the barbarian ; for doubtless you have heard that he <lb/>
            marching against Greece, and that a Persian, having thrown <lb/>
            bridge over the Hellespont, and bringing with him all the <lb/>
            stern host out of Asia, is about to invade Greece, holding <lb/>
            ut as a pretence that he is advancing against Athens, but <unclear/> <lb/>
            ally designing to reduce all Greece under his own power. <note type="footnote"> 5 Land-holders. </note> <pb n="464"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[158, 159."/> <lb/>
            But you have attained to great power, and possess not the <lb/>
            least part of Greece, since you rule Sicily; assist, therefore, <lb/>
            those who are asserting the liberty of Greece, and join them <lb/>
            in maintaining its liberty. For if all Greece is assembled, a <lb/>
            large force is collected, and we become able to resist the in­ <lb/>
            vaders. But if some of us should betray the common cause, <lb/>
            and others refuse to assist, so that the sound part of Greece <lb/>
            should be small, then there is great danger that the whole <lb/>
            of Greece will fall. For you must not expect that if the <lb/>
            Persian should subdue us, having conquered in battle, he <lb/>
            will not proceed also against you, but take precautions before­ <lb/>
            hand ; for by assisting us, you protect yourself. A favour­ <lb/>
            able result is generally wont to attend a well-devised plan." <lb/>
            Thus they spoke. 158. Gelon was very vehement, speaking <lb/>
            as follows : "Men of Greece, holding arrogant language, you <lb/>
            have dared to invite me to come to your assistance against the <lb/>
            barbarian. And yet you yourselves, when I formerly besought <lb/>
            you to assist me in attacking a barbarian army when a quarrel <lb/>
            was on foot between me and the Carthaginians, and when I <lb/>
            exhorted you to avenge the death of Dorieus,5 son of Anax­ <lb/>
            andrides, upon the Ægestæans, and promised that I would <lb/>
            join in freeing the ports, from whence great advantages and <lb/>
            profits accrued to you ; neither for my sake did you come to <lb/>
            assist me, nor to avenge the death of Dorieus. So that as far <lb/>
            as you are concerned, all this country is subject to barbarians. <lb/>
            However, matters turned out well with me, and prospered; <lb/>
            and now, when the war has come round and reached you, at <lb/>
            length you remember Gelon. But though I met with dis­ <lb/>
            graceful treatment from you, I shall not imitate your example, <lb/>
            but am ready to assist you, furnishing two hundred triremes, <lb/>
            twenty thousand heavy-armed troops, two thousand horse, <lb/>
            two thousand bowmen, two thousand slingers, and two thou­ <lb/>
            sand light-horse; I likewise undertake to supply corn for the <lb/>
            whole Grecian army until we have finished the war. But I <lb/>
            promise these things on this condition, that I shall be general <lb/>
            and leader of the Greeks against the barbarian: on no other <lb/>
            condition will I come myself, or send others." 159. Syagrus, <lb/>
            when he heard this, could not contain himself, but spoke as <lb/>
            follows: "Agamemnon, the descendant of Pelops, would <lb/>
            indeed groan aloud, if he heard that the Spartans had <note type="footnote"> 5 See B. V chap 45 46. </note> <pb n="465"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="160, 161.]"/> <lb/>
            been-deprived of the supreme command by a Gelon and by <lb/>
            Syracusans. Never mention this proposition again, that we <lb/>
            should give up the command to you; but if you are willing <lb/>
            to succour Greece, know that you must be commanded by <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, or, if you will not deign to be commanded, <lb/>
            you need not assist us." 160. Upon this Gelon, when he <lb/>
            observed the indignant language of Syagrus, made this last <lb/>
            proposal: " Spartan stranger, reproaches uttered against a <lb/>
            man are wont to rouse his indignation. Yet, though you <lb/>
            have used insulting words in your speech, you have not pro­ <lb/>
            voked me to be unseemly in return. Nevertheless, since you <lb/>
            are so exceedingly anxious for the supreme command, it is <lb/>
            reasonable that I also should be more anxious for it than you, <lb/>
            since I am leader of a far greater army, and many more ships. <lb/>
            However, since my proposal is so repugnant to you, I will <lb/>
            abate something of my first demand. If, then, you choose <lb/>
            to command the army, I will command the fleet; or if it please <lb/>
            yourather to have the command at sea, I will lead the land- <lb/>
            forces. And you must either be content with these terms, or <lb/>
            return destitute of such allies." 161. Gelon, then, proposed <lb/>
            these terms; but the ambassador of the Athenians, anticipating <lb/>
            that of the Lacedæmonians, answered him in these words: <lb/>
            "King of the Syracusans, the Grecians sent us to you, not <lb/>
            toask for a general, but an army. You declare that you will <lb/>
            not send an army, unless you have the command of Greece, <lb/>
            and you are anxious to be made general of it: as long as <lb/>
            yourequired to command all the forces of the Grecians, we <lb/>
            Athenians were contented to remain silent, as we knew that <lb/>
            he Spartan would be sufficient to answer for us both; but <lb/>
            since, being excluded from the whole command, you require <lb/>
            to govern the navy, the matter stands thus. Even if the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians should allow you to govern it, we shall not <lb/>
            allow it, for that is ours, unless the Lacedæmonians wish to <lb/>
            take it themselves. If they, indeed, wish to have the com­ <lb/>
            and, we shall not oppose them, but we will never cede to <lb/>
            my one else the command of the navy. For in vain should <unclear/> <lb/>
            ve possess the greatest naval power of the Greeks, if we, <lb/>
            oeing Athenians, should yield the command to the Syracusans, <lb/>
            ve who are the most ancient nation, and the only people of <lb/>
            he Greeks who have never changed their country; from <lb/>
            whom also Homer, the epic poet, said, the best man went to <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[162- 164"/> <lb/>
            Troy, both for arraying and marshalling an army So that it <lb/>
            is no disgrace to us to speak as we do." 162. To this Gelon <lb/>
            answered: "Athenian stranger, you seem to have commanders, <lb/>
            but as if you would not have men to be commanded. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, you are resolved to concede nothing, but to retain <lb/>
            the whole power, you cannot be too quick in returning back <lb/>
            again, and informing Greece, that the spring of the year has <lb/>
            been taken from her." The meaning of this saying is, which <lb/>
            he wished to intimate, that as the spring is evidently the most <lb/>
            valuable season in the year, so of the army of the Grecians, <lb/>
            his was the best: Greece, therefore, deprived of his alliance, <lb/>
            he compared to a year from which the spring should be taken <lb/>
            away.</p>
          <p>163. The ambassadors of the Greeks, having thus negoci­ <lb/>
            ated with Gelon, sailed away. But Gelon, upon this, fearing <lb/>
            for the Grecians, that they would not be able to withstand <lb/>
            the barbarian, but deeming it an intolerable disgrace that he <lb/>
            who was tyrant of Sicily should go to Peloponnesus, and be <lb/>
            subject to the Lacedæmonians, gave up all thoughts of that <lb/>
            course and adopted another. As soon as he was informed <lb/>
            that the Persian had crossed the Hellespont, he despatched <lb/>
            Cadmus, son of Scythes, a Coan, to Delphi, with three pente­ <lb/>
            conters, taking with him much treasure and friendly messages, <lb/>
            for the purpose of watching the contest, in what way it would <lb/>
            terminate; and if the barbarian should conquer, he was to <lb/>
            present him with the treasure, and earth and water for the <lb/>
            countries which Gelon ruled over; but if the Greeks should <lb/>
            be victorious, he was to bring back the treasure. 164. This <lb/>
            Cadmus, having before these events received from his father <lb/>
            the sovereignty of the Coans, firmly established, of his own <lb/>
            accord, when no danger threatened him, but from a sense of <lb/>
            justice, surrendered the government into the hands of the <lb/>
            Coans, and retired into Sicily; there, with the Samians, he <lb/>
            possessed and inhabited the city of Zancle, which changed its <lb/>
            name to Messana. This Cadmus, therefore, who had in this <lb/>
            manner come to Sicily, Gelon sent on account of other proofs <lb/>
            which he had of his uprightness ; and he, in addition to other <lb/>
            instances of uprightness that had been given by him, left this <lb/>
            not the least monument of them: for having in his possession <lb/>
            vast treasures, which Gelon had intrusted to him, when it <lb/>
            was in his power to appropriate them, he would not; but <pb n="467"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="165—167"/> <lb/>
            when the Greeks conquered in the sea-fight, and Xerxes had <lb/>
            retired, he also returned to Sicily, and took back all the <lb/>
            treasures.</p>
          <p>165. However, the following account is given by those who <lb/>
            inhabit Sicily, that Gelon, notwithstanding that he must be <lb/>
            governed by the Lacedæmonians, would have assisted the <lb/>
            Greeks, had not Terillus, son of Crinippus, who was tyrant <lb/>
            of Himera, being expelled from Himera by Theron, son of <lb/>
            Ænesidemus king of the Agrigentines, at that time brought <lb/>
            in an army of three hundred thousand men, consisting of Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicians, Libyans, Iberians, Ligyans, Elisycians, Sardinians, <lb/>
            and Cyrnians, under the conduct of Amilcar, son of Hanno, <lb/>
            king of the Carthaginians. Terillus persuaded him by the <lb/>
            hospitality which existed between them, and especially by the <lb/>
            zeal of Anaxilaus, son of Critines, who being tyrant of Rhe­ <lb/>
            gium, and having given his children as hostages into the hands <lb/>
            &gt;f Amilcar, induced him to enter Sicily, in order to revenge <lb/>
            he injury done to his father-in-law. For Anaxilaus had <lb/>
            narried a daughter of Terillus, whose name was Cydippe. <lb/>
            Thus, as Gelon was not able to assist the Greeks, he sent the <lb/>
            reasures to Delphi. 166. In addition to this, they say, that <lb/>
            it happened on the same day, that Gelon and Theron conquered <lb/>
            Amilcar the Carthaginian in Sicily, and the Greeks con­ <lb/>
            uered the Persian at Salamis. I am informed, that Amilcar, <lb/>
            who was a Carthaginian by his father, and a Syracusan by his <lb/>
            mother, and chosen king of Carthage for his virtue, when the <lb/>
            ngagement took place, and he was defeated in battle, vanished <lb/>
            at of sight; for he was seen no where on the earth, either <lb/>
            live or dead, though Gelon had search made for him every <lb/>
            here. 167. The following story is also related by the Cartha­ <lb/>
            inians themselves, who endeavour to give a probable account, <unclear/> <lb/>
            at the barbarians fought with the Grecians in Sicily from <unclear/> <lb/>
            e morning till late in the evening, for it is said that the con­ <lb/>
            ict lasted so long ; and during this time, Amilcar, continuing <lb/>
            t the camp, offered sacrifices, and observed the omens, burn­ <lb/>
            g whole victims upon a large pile ; and when he saw the <lb/>
            ;feat of his own army, as he happened to be pouring liba­ <lb/>
            ons on the victims, he threw himself into the flames, and <unclear/> <lb/>
            us, being burnt to ashes, disappeared. But whether AmU­ <lb/>
            r disappeared in such manner as the Phoenicians relate, <lb/>
            in another manner, as the Syracusans, the Carthaginiens <note type="footnote"> 2H2</note> <pb n="468"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[168, 169."/> <lb/>
            in the first place offer sacrifices to him, and in the next, have <lb/>
            erected monuments to his memory in all the cities inhabited <lb/>
            by colonists, and the most considerable one in Carthage itself. <lb/>
            So much for the affairs of Sicily.</p>
          <p>168. The Corcyraeans, having given the following answer to <lb/>
            the ambassadors, acted as I shall relate. For the same ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors who went to Sicily, invited them to join the league, <lb/>
            using the same language to them as they had done to Gelon. <lb/>
            They indeed immediately promised to send and give assistance, <lb/>
            adding, " that they could not look on and see the ruin of Greece, <lb/>
            for if it should be overthrown, nothing else would remain for <lb/>
            them, than to become slaves on the very first day; therefore <lb/>
            they would assist to the utmost of their power." Thus spe­ <lb/>
            ciously they answered; but when they ought to have assisted, <lb/>
            with different intentions, they manned sixty ships, and having <lb/>
            put to sea, after great delays, drew near to the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus, and anchored about Pylus and Tænarus, of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian territory ; they also carefully watched the war, in <lb/>
            what way it would terminate ; having no expectation that the <lb/>
            Grecians would get the better, but thinking that the Persian, <lb/>
            having gained a decided superiority, would become master of <lb/>
            all Greece. They therefore acted thus purposely, in order <lb/>
            that they might be able to say to the Persian, “ 0 king, when <lb/>
            the Greeks invited us to take part in the war, we, who have a <lb/>
            considerable force, and were able to supply not the least num­ <lb/>
            ber of ships, but the greatest number, next to the Athenians, <lb/>
            would not oppose you, nor do any thing displeasing to you." <lb/>
            By saying this, they hoped to get better terms than the rest; <lb/>
            which would have been the case, as appears to me ; and to­ <lb/>
            wards the Greeks their excuse was ready prepared, which <lb/>
            indeed they did make use of. For when the Greeks ac­ <lb/>
            cused them of not having sent assistance, they said " that <lb/>
            they had manned sixty ships, but were unable to double Malea <lb/>
            by reason of the Etesian winds ; and so they could not reach <lb/>
            Salamis, and were absent from the sea-fight from no bad mo <lb/>
            tive." In this manner they attempted to elude the charge of <lb/>
            the Greeks.</p>
          <p>169. The Cretans, when those Greeks who were appointed <lb/>
            for that purpose invited them to join the league, acted as i <lb/>
            follows. Having sent, in the name of the commonwealth, per­ <lb/>
            sons to consult the oracle at Delphi, they inquired of the god, <pb n="469"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="70,171."/> <lb/>
            whether it would be for their advantage to assist Greece. <lb/>
            The Pythian answered: " Fools, you complain of all the woes <lb/>
            which Minos in his anger sent you, for aiding Menelaus, be­ <lb/>
            cause they would not assist you in avenging his death at Cami­ <lb/>
            cus, and yet you assisted them in avenging a woman who wall <lb/>
            carried off from Sparta by a barbarian." When the Cretans <lb/>
            heard this answer reported, they refrained from sending assist­ <lb/>
            ance.170. For it is said, that Minos, having come to Sicania, <lb/>
            which is now called Sicily, in search of Dædalus, met with a <lb/>
            violent death: that after some time the Cretans, at the in­ <lb/>
            stigation of a deity, all except the Polichnitæ and the Præ­ <lb/>
            sians, went with a large force to Sicania, and during five <lb/>
            years besieged the city of Camicus, which in my time the <lb/>
            Agrigentines possessed; and at last, not being able either to <lb/>
            take it, or to continue the siege, because they were oppressed <lb/>
            by famine, they abandoned it and went away : and when they <lb/>
            were sailing along the coast of Iapygia, a violent storm over­ <lb/>
            look them, and drove them ashore. And as their ships were <lb/>
            broken to pieces, and there appeared no means of their return­ <lb/>
            ng to Crete, they thereupon founded the city of Hyria, and <lb/>
            settled there, changing their name from Cretans to Messapian <lb/>
            apygians, and becoming, instead of islanders, inhabitants of the <lb/>
            continent. From the city of Hyria they founded other cities, <lb/>
            vhich a long time after the Tarentines endeavouring to destroy, <lb/>
            ignally failed ;so that this was the greatest Grecian slaugh­ <lb/>
            er of all that we know of, both of the Tarentines themselves, <lb/>
            nd of the Rhegians, who being compelled by Micythus, son <lb/>
            of Chœrus, and coming to assist the Tarentines, thus perished <lb/>
            o the number of three thousand ; but of the Tarentines them­ <lb/>
            elves no number was given. This Micythus was a servant <lb/>
            of Anaxilaus, and had been left in charge of Rhegium. He <lb/>
            9 the same person that was expelled from Rhegium, and who, <lb/>
            laving settled in Tegea, a city of Arcadia, dedicated the many <lb/>
            tatues in Olympia. 171. These events relating to the Rhe­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ians and Tarentines., are a digression from my history. To <lb/>
            Crete, then, destitute of inhabitants, as the Præsians say, other <lb/>
            ten, and especially the Grecians, went, and settled there: and <unclear/> <lb/>
            the third generation after the death of Minos the Trojan <lb/>
            var took place, in which the Cretans proved themselves not <lb/>
            he worst avengers of Menelaus: as a punishment for this, <lb/>
            when they returned from Troy, famine and pestilence fell <pb n="470"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[172, 173"/> <lb/>
            both on themselves and their cattle ; so that Crete being a <lb/>
            second time depopulated, the Cretans are the third people <lb/>
            who, with those that were left, now inhabit it. The Pythian <lb/>
            therefore, putting them in mind of these things, checked them <lb/>
            in their desire to assist the Grecians.</p>
          <p>172. The Thessalians at first sided with the Mede from <lb/>
            necessity, as they showed, in that the intrigues of the Aleuadæ6 <lb/>
            did not please them. For as soon as they were informed that <lb/>
            the Persian was about to cross over into Europe, they sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to the Isthmus ; and at the Isthmus deputies from <lb/>
            Greece were assembled chosen from those cities that were better <lb/>
            disposed towards Greece. The ambassadors of the Thessalians, <lb/>
            having come to them, said: " Men of Greece, it is necessary to <lb/>
            guard the pass of Olympus, that Thessaly and all Greece may <lb/>
            be sheltered from the war. Now we are ready to assist in guard­ <lb/>
            ing it, but you also must send a large army ; for if you will <lb/>
            not send, be assured, we shall come to terms with the Per­ <lb/>
            sian : for it is not right that we, who are situated so far in <lb/>
            advance of the rest of Greece, should perish alone in your de­ <lb/>
            fence. If you will not assist us, you cannot impose any obli­ <lb/>
            gation upon us; for obligation was ever inferior to inability ; <lb/>
            and we must ourselves endeavour to contrive some means of <lb/>
            safety." 173. Thus spoke the Thessalians. And the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians thereupon resolved to send an army by sea to Thessaly, <lb/>
            to guard the pass; and when the army was assembled, it <lb/>
            sailed through the Eurlpus, and having arrived at Alus of <lb/>
            Achaia, disembarked, and marched to Thessaly, having left <lb/>
            the ships there ; and arrived at Tempe, at the pass that leads <lb/>
            from the lower Macedonia into Thessaly, by the river Peneus, <lb/>
            between Mount Olympus and Ossa. There heavy-armed troops <lb/>
            of the Grecians, being assembled together to the number of <lb/>
            ten thousand, encamped, and to them was added the cavalry of <lb/>
            the Thessalians. The Lacedæmonians were commanded by <lb/>
            Euænetus, son of Carenus, chosen from among the Polemarchs, <lb/>
            though not of the royal race, and the Athenians were com­ <lb/>
            manded by Themistocles, son of Neocles. There they re­ <lb/>
            mained but a few days, for messengers coming from Alexan­ <lb/>
            der, son of Amyntas, a Macedonian, advised them to retire, <lb/>
            and not to stay in the pass and be trampled under foot by the <lb/>
            invading army; describing the numbers of the army and the <note type="footnote"> 6 See chap. 6 and 130. </note> <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="174—176.]"/> <lb/>
            ships. When the messengers gave this advice, as the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians conceived the advice to be good, and the Macedonian <lb/>
            was evidently well-disposed to them, they determined to follow <lb/>
            it; but, in my opinion, it was fear that persuaded them, when <lb/>
            they heard that there was another pass into Thessaly and <lb/>
            Upper Macedonia, through the country of the Perrhæbi, near <lb/>
            the city of Gonnus; by which, indeed, the army of Xerxes <lb/>
            did enter. The Grecians, therefore, going down to their ships <lb/>
            went back again to the Isthmus. 174. This expedition into <lb/>
            Thessaly took place while the king was about to cross over <lb/>
            from Asia into Europe, and was still at Abydos. But the <lb/>
            Thessalians, being abandoned by their allies, then readily took <lb/>
            part with the Medes, and with no further hesitation, so much <lb/>
            -o, that in emergency they proved most useful to the king.</p>
          <p>175. The Greeks, when they arrived at the Isthmus, con­ <lb/>
            sulted on the message they had received from Alexander, in <lb/>
            what way and in wkat places they should prosecute the war. <lb/>
            The opinion which prevailed was, that they should defend the <lb/>
            pass at Thermopylae; for it appeared to be narrower than that <lb/>
            into Thessaly, and at the same time nearer to their own ter­ <lb/>
            citories. For the path by which the Greeks who were taken <lb/>
            it Thermopylae were afterwards surprised, they knew nothing <lb/>
            of, till, on their arrival at Thermopylae, they were informed <lb/>
            of it by the Trachinians. They accordingly resolved to guard <lb/>
            his pass, and not suffer the barbarian to enter Greece ; and <lb/>
            hat the naval force should sail to Artemisium, in the terri­ <lb/>
            ory of Histiæotis, for these places are near one another, so <lb/>
            hat they could hear what happened to each other. These <lb/>
            pots are thus situated. 176. In the first place, Artemisium <unclear/> <lb/>
            scontracted from a wide space of the Thracian sea into a <unclear/> <lb/>
            parrowfrith, which lies between the island of Sciathus and <lb/>
            he continent of Magnesia. From the narrow frith begins <lb/>
            he coast of Eubœa, called Artemisium, and in it is a temple <lb/>
            of Diana. But the entrance into Greece through Trachis, in <lb/>
            he narrowest part, is no more than a half plethrum in width ; <lb/>
            owever, the narrowest part of the country is not in this spot, <lb/>
            ut before and behind Thermopylae; for near Alpeni, which <lb/>
            i behind, there is only a single carriage-road; and before, by <lb/>
            he river Phoenix, near the city of Anthela, is another single <lb/>
            arriage-road. On the western side of Thermopylae is an in­ <lb/>
            ccessible and precipitous mountain, stretching to Mount Œta; <pb n="472"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[177—179]"/> <lb/>
            and on the eastern side of the way, is the sea, and a morass. <lb/>
            In this passage there are hot baths, which the inhabitants call <lb/>
            Chytri, and above these is an altar to Hercules. A wall had <lb/>
            been built in this pass, and formerly there were gates in it. <lb/>
            The Phocæans built it through fear, when the Thessalians <lb/>
            came from Thesprotia to settle in the Æolian territory which <lb/>
            they now possess : apprehending that the Thessalians would <lb/>
            attempt to subdue them, the Phocæans took this precaution : <lb/>
            at the same time they diverted the hot water into the en­ <lb/>
            trance, that the place might be broken into clefts ; having re­ <lb/>
            course to every contrivance to prevent the Thessalians from <lb/>
            making inroads into their country. Now this old wall had <lb/>
            been built a long time, and the greater part of it had already <lb/>
            fallen through age ; but they determined to rebuild it, and <lb/>
            in that place to repel the barbarian from Greece. Very near <lb/>
            this road there is a village called Alpeni ; from this the Greeks <lb/>
            expected to obtain provisions. 177. Accordingly these situa­ <lb/>
            tions appeared suitable for the Greeks. For they, having <lb/>
            weighed every thing beforehand, and considered that the <lb/>
            barbarians would neither be able to use their numbers nor <lb/>
            their cavalry, there resolved to await the invader of Greece. <lb/>
            As soon as they were informed that the Persian was in Pieria, <lb/>
            breaking up from the Isthmus, some of them proceeded by <lb/>
            land to Thermopylae and others by sea to Artemisium.</p>
          <p>178. The Greeks, therefore, being appointed in two divi­ <lb/>
            sions, hastened to meet the enemy. But at the same time the <lb/>
            Delphians, alarmed for themselves and for Greece, consulted <lb/>
            the oracle; and the answer given them was, " that they should <lb/>
            pray to the winds, for that they would be powerful allies to <lb/>
            Greece." The Delphians having received the oracle, first of <lb/>
            all communicated the answer to those Greeks who were zealous <lb/>
            to be free; and as they very much dreaded the barbarians, <lb/>
            by giving that message they acquired a claim to everlasting <lb/>
            gratitude. After that, the Delphians erected an altar to the <lb/>
            winds at Thyia, where there is an enclosure consecrated to <lb/>
            Thyia, daughter of Cephisus, from whom this district derives <lb/>
            its name, and conciliated them with sacrifices. And the Del­ <lb/>
            phians, in obedience to that oracle, to this day propitiate the <lb/>
            winds.</p>
          <p>179. The naval force of Xerxes, setting out from the city <lb/>
            of Therma, advanced with ten of the fastest sailing ships <pb n="473"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="180-183.]"/> <lb/>
            straight to Scyathus, where were three Grecian ships keeping <lb/>
            a look-out, a Troezenian, an Æginetan, and an Athenian. <lb/>
            These, seeing the ships of the barbarians at a distance, betook <lb/>
            themselves to flight. 180. The Troezenian ship, which Prax­ <lb/>
            inus commanded, the barbarians pursued and soon captured; <lb/>
            and then, having led the handsomest of the marines to the <lb/>
            prow of the ship, they slew him, deeming it a good omen that <lb/>
            the first Greek they had taken was also very handsome. The <lb/>
            ame of the man that was slain was Leon, and perhaps he <lb/>
            an some measure reaped the fruits of his name. 181. The <lb/>
            Æginetan ship, which Asonides commanded, gave them some <lb/>
            Itrouble, Pytheas, son of Ischenous, being a marine on board, <lb/>
            a man who on this day displayed the most consummate valour; <lb/>
            who, when the ship was taken, continued fighting until he <lb/>
            was entirely cut to pieces. But when, having fallen, he was <lb/>
            not dead, but still breathed, the Persians who served on board <lb/>
            he ships were very anxious to save him alive, on account of <lb/>
            is valour, healing his wounds with myrrh, and binding them <lb/>
            with bandages of flaxen cloth. And when they returned to <lb/>
            heir own camp, they showed him with admiration to the <lb/>
            whole army, and treated him well; but the others, whom they <lb/>
            ook in this ship, they treated as slaves. 182. Thus, then, <lb/>
            wo of the ships were taken; but the third, which Phormus, <lb/>
            in Athenian, commanded, in its flight ran ashore at the mouth <unclear/> <lb/>
            the Peneus; and the barbarians got possession of the ship, <unclear/> <lb/>
            out not of the men: for as soon as the Athenians had run the <unclear/> <lb/>
            hip aground, they leapt out, and, proceeding through Thes­ <lb/>
            aly, reached Athens. The Greeks who were stationed at <lb/>
            Artemisium were informed of this event by signal-fires from <lb/>
            Sciathus; and being informed of it, and very much alarmed, <lb/>
            hey retired from Artemisium to Chalcis, intending to defend <lb/>
            he Euripus, and leaving scouts on the heights of Eubœa. <lb/>
            183. Of the ten barbarian ships, three approached the sunken <unclear/> <lb/>
            ock called Myrmex, between Sciathus and Magnesia. Then <lb/>
            he barbarians, when they had erected on the rock a stone <lb/>
            column, which they had brought with them, set out from <lb/>
            fherma, now that every obstacle had been removed, and <lb/>
            ailed forward with all their ships, having waited eleven days <lb/>
            iter the king's departure from Therma. Pammon, a Scyrian, <lb/>
            minted out to them this hidden rock, which was almost di­ <lb/>
            rectly in their course. The barbarians, sailing all day, reached <pb n="474"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[184, 185"/> <lb/>
            Sepias in Magnesia, and the shore that lies between the city <lb/>
            of Casthanæa and the coast of Sepias.</p>
          <p>184. As far as this place, and Thermopylae, the army had <lb/>
            suffered no loss, and the numbers were at that time, as I find <lb/>
            by calculations, of the following amount: of those in ships <lb/>
            from Asia, amounting to one thousand two hundred and seven, <lb/>
            originally the whole number of the several nations was two <lb/>
            hundred forty-one thousand four hundred men, allowing two <lb/>
            hundred to each ship; and on these ships thirty Persians, <lb/>
            Medes, and Sacæ served as marines, in addition to the native <lb/>
            crews of each: this further number amounts to thirty-six <lb/>
            thousand two hundred and ten. To this and the former num­ <lb/>
            her I add those that were on the penteconters, supposing <lb/>
            eighty men on the average to be on board of each: but, as I <lb/>
            have before said,7 three thousand of these vessels were assem­ <lb/>
            bled ; therefore the men on board them must have been two <lb/>
            hundred and forty thousand. This, then, was the naval force <lb/>
            from Asia, the total being five hundred and seventeen thousand <lb/>
            six hundred and ten. Of infantry there were seventeen bUll­ <lb/>
            dred thousand, and of cavalry eighty thousand; to these I <lb/>
            add the Arabians who rode camels, and the Libyans who drove <lb/>
            chariots, reckoning the number at twenty thousand men. <lb/>
            Accordingly, the numbers on board the ships and on the land <lb/>
            added together, make up two millions three hundred and seven­ <lb/>
            teen thousand six hundred and ten. This, then, is the force <lb/>
            which, as has been mentioned, was assembled from Asia itself, <lb/>
            exclusive of the servants that followed, and the provision <lb/>
            ships, and the men that were on board them. 185. But the <lb/>
            force brought from Europe must still be added to this whole <lb/>
            number that has been summed up ; but it is necessary to speak <lb/>
            by guess. Now the Grecians from Thrace, and the islands <lb/>
            contiguous to Thrace, furnished one hundred and twenty <lb/>
            ships; these ships give an amount of twenty-four thousand <lb/>
            men. Of land-forces, which were furnished by Thracians, <lb/>
            Pæonians, the Eordi, the Bottiæans, the Chalcidian race, <lb/>
            Brygi, Pierians, Macedonians, Perrhæbi, Ænianes, Dolopians, <lb/>
            Magnesians, and Achæans, together with those who inhabit <lb/>
            the maritime parts of Thrace ; of these nations I suppose that <lb/>
            there were three hundred thousand men. So that these my­ <lb/>
            riads added to those from Asia, make a total of two millions <note type="footnote"> 7 Chap, 97. </note> <pb n="475"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[186—189.]"/> <lb/>
            six hundred forty one thousand six hundred and ten fighting <lb/>
            men. 186. I think that the servants who followed them, and <lb/>
            with thoseon board the provision ships and other vessels that <lb/>
            ailed with the fleet, were not fewer than the fighting men, but <lb/>
            more numerous; but supposing them to be equal in number <lb/>
            with the fighting men, they make up the former number of <lb/>
            myriads. Thus Xerxes, son of Darius, led five millions two <lb/>
            hundred and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty <lb/>
            men, to Sepias and Thermopylae. 187. This, then, was the <lb/>
            number of the whole force of Xerxes. But of women who <lb/>
            aIde bread, and concubines, and eunuchs, no one could men­ <lb/>
            ion the number with accuracy ; nor of draught-cattle and <lb/>
            other beasts of burden ; nor of Indian dogs that followed, could <lb/>
            any one mention the number, they were so many. Therefore <lb/>
            [am not astonished that the streams of some rivers failed ; <lb/>
            put rather, it is a wonder to me, how provisions held out for <lb/>
            o many myriads. For I find by calculation, if each man had <lb/>
            choenix of wheat daily, and no more, one hundred and ten <lb/>
            housand three hundred and forty medimni must have been <lb/>
            onsumed every day ; and I have not reckoned the food for <lb/>
            he women, eunuchs, beasts of burden, and dogs. But of so <lb/>
            any myriads of men, not one of them, for beauty and sta­ <lb/>
            ure, was more entitled than Xerxes himself to possess this <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>I 188. When the fleet, having set out, sailed and reached the <lb/>
            pore of Magnesia that lies between the city of Casthanæa <lb/>
            nd the coast of Sepias, the foremost of the ships took up their <lb/>
            tation close to land, others behind rode at anchor, (the beach <lb/>
            of being extensive enough,) with their prows towards the <lb/>
            3a, and eight deep. Thus they passed the night, but at day­ <lb/>
            reak, after serene and tranquil weather, the sea began to <lb/>
            well, and a heavy storm with a violent gale from the east, <lb/>
            hich those who inhabit these parts call a Hellespontine, <lb/>
            urst upon them ; as many of them, then, as perceived the <lb/>
            ale increasing, and who were able to do so from their position, <lb/>
            iticipated the storm by hauling their ships on shore, and both <lb/>
            ley and their ships escaped. But such of the ships as the <lb/>
            orm caught at sea, it carried away, some to the parts called <unclear/> <lb/>
            oni, near Pelion, others to the beach ; some were dashed on <lb/>
            ape Sepias itself; some were wrecked at Meliboea, and others <lb/>
            Casthanæa. The storm was indeed irresistible. : 89. A <pb n="476"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[190, 191"/> <lb/>
            story is told, that the Athenians invoked Boreas, in obedience <lb/>
            to an oracle, another response having come to them, “ that <lb/>
            they should call their son-in-law to their assistance." But Bo­ <lb/>
            reas, according to the account of the Greeks, married a woman <lb/>
            of Attica, Orithyia, daughter to Erectheus. On account of <lb/>
            this marriage, the Athenians, as the report goes, conjecturing <lb/>
            that Boreas was their son-in-law, and having stationed their <lb/>
            fleet at Chalets of Euboea, when they saw the storm increas­ <lb/>
            in,, or even before, offered sacrifices to and invoked Boreas <lb/>
            and Orithyia, praying that they would assist them, and de­ <lb/>
            stroy the ships of the barbarians, as they had done before at <lb/>
            Mount Athos. Whether, indeed, the north wind in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of this fell upon the barbarians as they rode at anchor, <lb/>
            I cannot undertake to say; however, the Athenians say, that <lb/>
            Boreas, having assisted them before, then also produced this <lb/>
            effect; and on their return they erected a temple to Boreas <lb/>
            near the river Ilissus. 190. In this disaster those who give <lb/>
            the lowest account say, that not fewer than four hundred ships <lb/>
            perished, and innumerable lives, and an infinite quantity of <lb/>
            treasure ; so that this wreck of the fleet proved a source <lb/>
            of great profit to Aminocles, son of Cretinus, a Magnesian, <lb/>
            who possessed land about Sepias; he some time afterwards <lb/>
            picked up many golden cups that had been driven ashore, and <lb/>
            many silver ones; he also found treasures belonging to the <lb/>
            Persians, and gained an unspeakable quantity of other golden <lb/>
            articles. He then, though in other respects unfortunate, be­ <lb/>
            came very rich by what he found ; for a sad calamity, which <lb/>
            occasioned the death of his son,8 gave him great affliction. 191. <lb/>
            The provision ships and other vessels destroyed were beyond <lb/>
            number ; so that the commanders of the naval force, fearing <lb/>
            lest the Thessalians should attack them in their shattered con­ <lb/>
            dition, threw up a high rampart from the wrecks ; for the <lb/>
            storm lasted three days. But at length the Magi, having <lb/>
            sacrificed victims, and endeavoured to charm the winds by <lb/>
            incantations, and moreover, having offered sacrifices to Thetis <lb/>
            and the Nereids, laid the storm on the fourth day ; or perhaps <lb/>
            it abated of its own accord. They sacrificed to Thetis, having <lb/>
            heard from the Ionians the story that she had been carried oil <lb/>
            from this country by Peleus, and that all the coast of Sepias <note type="footnote"> <unclear>Παιδοφόνος</unclear>, is by others understood to imply " that he killed his <lb/>
            own son." I have followed Baehr. </note> <pb n="477"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="192-195 ]"/> <lb/>
            belonged to her and the other Nereids. Accordingly the <lb/>
            ',ind was lulled on the fourth day. 192. The scouts on the <lb/>
            heights of Euboea, running down on the second day after the <lb/>
            storm first began, acquainted the Greeks with all that had <lb/>
            occurred with respect to the wreck of the fleet. They, when <lb/>
            hey heard it, having offered up vows and poured out libations <lb/>
            o Neptune the Deliverer, immediately hastened back to Arte­ <lb/>
            nisium ; hoping that there would be only some few ships to <lb/>
            oppose them. Thus they coming there a second time took up <lb/>
            heir station at Artemisium ; and from that time to the pre­ <lb/>
            sent have given to Neptune the surname of the Deliverer.</p>
          <p>193. The barbarians, when the wind had lulled, and the <lb/>
            vaves had subsided, having hauled down their ships, sailed <lb/>
            long the continent; and having doubled the promontory of <lb/>
            dagnesia, stood directly into the bay leading to Pagasæ. There <unclear/> <lb/>
            a spot in this bay of Magnesia, where it is said Hercules <lb/>
            vas abandoned by Jason and his companions, when he had <lb/>
            een sent from the Argo for water, as they were sailing to <lb/>
            Asia in Colchis, for the golden fleece ; for from thence they <lb/>
            urposed to put out to sea, after they had taken in water : from <lb/>
            its circumstance the name of Aphetæ was given to the place. <unclear/> <lb/>
            this place, then, the fleet of Xerxes took up its moorings. <lb/>
            94. Fifteen of these ships happened to be driven out to sea <lb/>
            ome time after the rest, and somehow saw the ships of the <lb/>
            reeks at Artemisium ; the barbarians thought that they <lb/>
            ere their own, and sailing on fell in among their enemies. <lb/>
            'hey were commanded by Sandoces, son of Thaumasius, <lb/>
            overnor of Cyme, of Æolia. He, being one of the royal <unclear/> <lb/>
            dges, had been formerly condemned by king Darius, who <lb/>
            ad detected him in the following offence, to be crucified. <lb/>
            andoces gave an unjust sentence, for a bribe. But while he <lb/>
            as actually banging on the cross, Darius, considering with <lb/>
            mself, found that the services he had done to the royal family <lb/>
            ere greater than his faults ; Darius therefore, having dis­ <lb/>
            vered this, and perceiving that he himself had acted with <lb/>
            ore expedition than wisdom, released him. Having thus <lb/>
            caped being put to death by Darius, he survived ; but now, <lb/>
            ling down among the Grecians, he was not to escape a se­ <lb/>
            nd time. For when the Greeks saw them sailing towards <lb/>
            em, perceiving the mistake they had committed, they bore <lb/>
            wn upon them and easily took them. 195. In one of these <pb n="478"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[196 197"/> <lb/>
            Aridolis, tyrant of the Alabandians, in Caria, was taken ; and <lb/>
            in another, the Paphian commander, Penthylus, son of De­ <lb/>
            monous. He brought twelve ships from Paphos ; but having <lb/>
            lost eleven in the storm that took place off Sepias, he was taken <lb/>
            with the one that escaped, as he was sailing to Artemisium. <lb/>
            The Grecians, having learnt by inquiry what they wished to <lb/>
            know respecting the forces of Xerxes, sent these men away <lb/>
            bound to the isthmus of the Corinthians.</p>
          <p>196. Accordingly, the naval force of the barbarians, with <lb/>
            the exception of the fifteen ships which, I have mentioned, <lb/>
            Sandoces commanded, arrived at Aphetæ. But Xerxes and <lb/>
            the land-forces, marching through Thessaly and Achaia, had <lb/>
            entered on the third day into the territories of the Mælians. <lb/>
            In Thessaly he had made a match with his own horses, for <lb/>
            the purpose of trying the Thessalian cavalry, having heard <lb/>
            that it was the best of all Greece ; and on that occasion the <lb/>
            Grecian horses proved very inferior. Of the rivers in Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, the Onochonus alone did not supply a sufficient stream <lb/>
            for the army to drink ; but of the rivers that flow in Achaia, <lb/>
            even the largest of them, the Epidanus, scarcely held out. 197. <lb/>
            When Xerxes arrived at Alos in Achaia, the guides, wishing <lb/>
            to tell every thing, related to him the tradition of the coun­ <lb/>
            try, concerning the temple of Laphystian Jupiter ; how Atha­ <lb/>
            mas, son of Æolus, conspiring with Ino, planned the death of <lb/>
            Phryxus ; and then, how the Achæans, in obedience to an <lb/>
            oracle, imposed the following penalty on his descendants. <lb/>
            Whoever is the eldest person of this race, having ordered him <lb/>
            to be excluded from the prytaneum, they themselves keep watch; <lb/>
            the Achæans call the prytaneum, Leiturn; and if he should enter, <lb/>
            he cannot possibly go out again except in order to be sacrificed: <lb/>
            and how moreover many of those who were on the point of <lb/>
            being sacrificed, through fear, went away and fled the country; <lb/>
            but in process of time having returned back again, if they were <lb/>
            taken, entering the prytaneum, they related, how such an one <lb/>
            being covered with sacred fillets, is sacrificed, and how con­ <lb/>
            ducted with great pomp. The descendants of Cytissorus, son <lb/>
            of Phryxus, are liable to this punishment; because when the <lb/>
            Achaians, in obedience to an oracle, were about to make an <lb/>
            expiation for their country by the sacrifice of Athamas, son of <lb/>
            Æolus, Cytissorus, arriving from Aia of Colchis, rescued <lb/>
            him, and having done so, drew down the anger if the gods! <pb n="479"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="198-201.]"/> <lb/>
            lpon his descendants. Xerxes having heard this, when he <lb/>
            came to the grove, both abstained from entering it himself, <lb/>
            and commanded all the army to do the same; and he showed <lb/>
            he same respect to the dwelling of the descendants of Atha­ <lb/>
            nas as he did to the sacred precinct.</p>
          <p>198. These things occurred in Thessaly and in Achaia- <lb/>
            From these countries Xerxes advanced to Malis, near a bay <lb/>
            f the sea in which an ebb and flow takes place every day. <lb/>
            About this bay lies a plain country, in one part wide, and in <lb/>
            he other very narrow, and around it high and impassable <lb/>
            nountains, called the Trachinian rocks, enclose the whole <lb/>
            Malian territory. The first city in the bay, as one comes <unclear/> <lb/>
            om Achaia, is Anticyra, by which the river Sperchius, flow­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ng from the country of the Ænianes, falls into the sea: and <unclear/><lb/>
            rom thence about twenty stades is another river, to which <lb/>
            ne name of Dyras is given, which, it is said, rose up to assist <lb/>
            ercules when he was burning. From this, at a distance of <lb/>
            other twenty stades, is another river, which is called Melas. <lb/>
            99. The city of Trachis is distant five stades from this river <lb/>
            elas; and in this part where Trachis is built, is the widest <unclear/> <lb/>
            lace of all this country, from the mountains to the sea; for <lb/>
            ere are twenty-two thousand plethra of plain. In this <lb/>
            ountain, which encloses the Trachinian territory, there is a <lb/>
            vine to the south of Trachis, and through the ravine the <lb/>
            per Asopus flows, by the base of the mountain. 200. To <unclear/> <lb/>
            esouth of the Asopus is another river, the Phoenix, not <unclear/> <lb/>
            ge, which, flowing from these mountains, falls into the <lb/>
            opus. At the river Phoenix it is the narrowest; for only <lb/>
            single carriage-road has been constructed there. From the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ver Phœnix it is fifteen stades to Thermopylæ; and between <unclear/> <lb/>
            river Phoenix and Thermopylae is a village, the name of <unclear/> <lb/>
            rich is Anthela, by which the Asopus flowing, falls into the <lb/>
            s <unclear>:</unclear> the country about it is wide, and in it is situated a tem­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            of Ceres Amphictyonis, and there are the seats of the <unclear/> <lb/>
            Anphistyons, and a temple of Amphictyon himself. 201. <unclear/> <lb/>
            ng Xerxes, then, encamped in the Trachinian territory of <lb/>
            ilis, and the Greeks in the pass. This spot is called by <lb/>
            n st of the Greeks, Thermopylae, but by the inhabitants and <unclear/> <lb/>
            nghbours, Pylæ. Both parties, then, encamped in these <lb/>
            p ces. The one was in possession of all the parts towards <lb/>
            tJ north, as far as Trachis ; and the others, of the parts <pb n="480"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[202—205"/> <lb/>
            which stretch towards the south and meridian, on this con <lb/>
            tinent.</p>
          <p>202. The following were the Greeks who awaited the Per. <lb/>
            sian in this position. Of Spartans three hundred heavy-armed <lb/>
            men; of Tegeans and Mantineans one thousand, half of each <lb/>
            from Orchomenus in Arcadia one hundred and twenty; ani <lb/>
            from the rest of Arcadia one thousand, there were so manj <lb/>
            Arcadians; from Corinth four hundred; from Phlius tw&lt; <lb/>
            hundred men, and from Mycenæ eighty. These came fron <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. From Bœotia, of Thespians seven hundred <lb/>
            and of Thebans four hundred. 203. In addition to these <lb/>
            the Opuntian Locrians, being invited, came with all theii <lb/>
            forces, and a thousand Phocians. For the Greeks themselves <lb/>
            had invited them, representing by their ambassadors tha <lb/>
            " they had arrived as forerunners of the others, and that th&lt; <lb/>
            rest of the allies might be daily expected; that the sea wai <lb/>
            protected by them, being guarded by the Athenians, the Ægi <lb/>
            neta, and others, who were appointed to the naval service <lb/>
            and that they had nothing to fear, for that it was not a <unclear>god</unclear> <lb/>
            who invaded Greece, but a man; and that there never was <lb/>
            and never would be, any mortal who had not evil mixed witl <lb/>
            his prosperity from his very birth; and to the greatest of then <lb/>
            the greatest reverses happen. That it must, therefore, need: <lb/>
            be, that he who is marching against us, being a mortal, wil <lb/>
            be disappointed in his expectation." They, having heard this <lb/>
            marched with assistance to Trachis. 204. These nations hat <lb/>
            separate generals for their several cities; but the one mos <lb/>
            admired, and who commanded the whole army, was a Lace <lb/>
            dæmonian, Leonidas, son of Anaxandrides, son of Leon, <unclear>son</unclear> <lb/>
            of Eurycratides, son of Anaxander, son of Eurycrates, soi <lb/>
            of Polydorus, son of Alcamenes, son of Teleclus, son c <lb/>
            Archelaus, son of Agesilaus, son of Doryssus, son of Leo <lb/>
            botes, son of Echestratus, son of Agis, son of Eurysthenei <lb/>
            son of Aristodemus, son of Aristomachus, son of Cleodaeuf <lb/>
            son of Hyllus, son of Hercules; who had unexpectedly sue <lb/>
            ceeded to the throne of Sparta. 205. For as he had tw <lb/>
            elder brothers, Cleomenes and Dorieus, he was far from an <lb/>
            thought of the kingdom. However, Cleomenes having die; <lb/>
            without male issue, and Dorieus being no longer alive, havin, <lb/>
            ended his days in Sicily,9 the kingdom thus devolved upo <note type="footnote"> 9 B. V. chap. 42—45. </note> <pb n="481"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="206-208"/> <lb/>
            Leonidas; both because he was older than Cleombrotus, <unclear/>(fo <lb/>
            he was the youngest son of Anaxandrides,) and also because <lb/>
            he had married the daughter of Cleomenes. He then marched <lb/>
            to Thermopylae, having chosen the three hundred men allowed <lb/>
            by law,1 and such as had children. On his march he took <lb/>
            with him the Thebans, whose numbers I have already reck­ <lb/>
            oned,2 and whom Leontiades, son of Eurymachus, commanded. <lb/>
            For this reason Leonidas was anxious to take with him the <lb/>
            Thebans alone of all the Greeks, because they were strongly <lb/>
            accused of favouring the Medes: he, therefore, summoned <lb/>
            hem to the war, wishing to know whether they would send <lb/>
            heir forces with him, or would openly renounce the alliance <lb/>
            of the Grecians. But they, though otherwise minded, sent <lb/>
            ssistance. 206. The Spartans sent these troops first with <lb/>
            Leonidas, in order that the rest of the allies, seeing them, <lb/>
            night take the field, and might not go over to the Medes, if <lb/>
            hey heard that they were delaying. But afterwards, for the <lb/>
            Carnean festival was then an obstacle to them, they purposed, <lb/>
            when they had kept the feast, to leave a garrison in Sparta, <unclear/> <lb/>
            nd to march immediately with their whole strength. The <lb/>
            est of the confederates likewise intended to act in the same <unclear/> <lb/>
            anner; for the Olympic games occurred at the same period <lb/>
            s these events. As they did not, therefore, suppose that the <lb/>
            igagement at Thermopylae would so soon be decided, they <unclear/> <lb/>
            espatched an advance-guard. Thus, then, they intended <lb/>
            do</p>
          <p>207. The Greeks at Thermopylae, when the Persian came <lb/>
            ear the pass, being alarmed, consulted about a retreat; ac­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            rdingly, it seemed best to the other Peloponnesians to retire <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, and guard the Isthmus; but Leonidas, per­ <lb/>
            iving the Phocians and Locrians very indignant at this <lb/>
            oposition, determined to stay there, and to despatch mes­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ngers to the cities, desiring them to come to their assistance, <lb/>
            being too few to repel the army of the Medes. 208. While <unclear/> <lb/>
            tey were deliberating on these matters, Xerxes sent a scout <unclear/> <lb/>
            horseback, to see how many they were, and what they <unclear/> <lb/>
            redoing. For while he was still in Thessaly, he had heard <lb/>
            tat a small army had been assembled at that spot, and as to <lb/>

            their leaders, that they were Lacedæmonians, and Leonidas, <lb/>
            who was of the race of Hercules. When the horseman rode <lb/>
            up to the camp, he reconnoitred, and saw not indeed the whole <lb/>
            camp, for it was not possible that they should be seen who <lb/>
            were posted within the wall, which, having rebuilt, they were <lb/>
            now guarding: but he had a clear view of those on the out­ <lb/>
            side, whose arms were piled in front of the wall. At this <lb/>
            time the Lacedæmonians happened to be posted outside; and <lb/>
            some of the men he saw performing gymnastic exercises, and <lb/>
            others combing their hair. On beholding this he was aston­ <lb/>
            ished, and ascertained their number; and having informed <lb/>
            himself of every thing accurately, he rode back at his leisure, <lb/>
            for no one pursued him, and he met with general contempt. <lb/>
            On his return he gave an account to Xerxes of all that he <lb/>
            had seen. 209. When Xerxes heard this, he could not com­ <lb/>
            prehend the truth, that the Grecians were preparing to be <lb/>
            slain and to slay to the utmost of their power. But, as they <lb/>
            appeared to behave in a ridiculous manner, he sent for Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus, son of Ariston, who was then in the camp; and when <lb/>
            he was come into his presence, Xerxes questioned him as to <lb/>
            each particular, wishing to understand what the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians were doing. Demaratus said, " You before heard me, <lb/>
            when we were setting out against Greece, speak of these <lb/>
            men; and when you heard, you treated me with ridicule, <lb/>
            though I told you in what way I foresaw these matters would <lb/>
            issue. For it is my chief aim, 0 king, to adhere to the truth <lb/>
            in your presence; hear it, therefore, once more. These men <lb/>
            have come to fight with us for the pass, and are now pre­ <lb/>
            paring themselves to do so. For such is their custom, when <lb/>
            they are going to hazard their lives, then they dress their <lb/>
            heads. But be assured, if you conquer these men, and those <lb/>
            that remain in Sparta, there is no other, nation in the world <lb/>
            that will dare to raise their hands against you, 0 king. For <lb/>
            you are now to engage with the noblest kingdom and city oi <lb/>
            all amongst the Greeks, and with the most valiant men.' <lb/>
            What was said seemed very incredible to Xerxes, and h&lt; <lb/>
            asked again, “ how, being so few in number, they could con­ <lb/>
            tend with his army." He answered, " 0 king, deal with <unclear>mo</unclear> <lb/>
            as with a liar, if these things do not turn out as I say.”</p>
          <p>210. By saying this he did not convince Xerxes. He there, <unclear/> <lb/>
            few <unclear>let</unclear> four days pass,constantly expreting that they <unclear>woule</unclear> <pb n="483"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="211, 212.]"/> <lb/>
            betake themselves to flight. But on the fifth day, as they had <lb/>
            not retreated, but appeared to him to stay through arrogance <lb/>
            and rashness, he being enraged, sent the Medes and Cissians <lb/>
            against them, with orders to take them alive, and bring them <lb/>
            into his presence. When the Medes bore down impetuously <lb/>
            upon the Greeks, many of them fell; others followed to the <lb/>
            charge, and were not repulsed, though they suffered greatly. <lb/>
            But they made it evident to every one, and not least of all to <lb/>
            the king himself, that they were indeed many men, but few <lb/>
            soldiers. The engagement lasted through the day. 211. <lb/>
            When the Medes were roughly handled, they thereupon re­ <lb/>
            tired ; and the Persians whom the king called " Immortal," <lb/>
            and whom Hydarnes commanded, taking their place, advanced <lb/>
            to the attack ; thinking that they indeed should easily settle <lb/>
            the business. But when hey engaged with the Grecians, <lb/>
            theysucceeded no better than the Medic troops, but just the <lb/>
            same, as they fought in a narrow space, and used shorter <lb/>
            Spears than the Greeks, and were unable to avail themselves <lb/>
            )f their numbers. The Lacedaemonians fought memorably <lb/>
            both in other respects, showing that they knew how to fight <lb/>
            with men who knew not, and whenever they turned their <lb/>
            backs, they retreated in close order : but the barbarians seeing <lb/>
            hem retreat, followed with a shout and clamour ; then they, <lb/>
            )eing overtaken, wheeled round so as to front the barbarians, <lb/>
            ,nd having faced about, overthrew an inconceivable number <lb/>
            of the Persians; and then some few of the Spartans them­ <lb/>
            elves fell. So that when the Persians were unable to gain <lb/>
            ny thing in their attempt on the pass, by attacking in troops <lb/>
            nd in every possible manner, they retired. 212. It is said <lb/>
            hat during these onsets of the battle, the king, who witnessed <lb/>
            hem, thrice sprang from his throne, being alarmed for his <unclear/> <lb/>
            rmy. Thus they strove at that time. On the following day <unclear/> <lb/>
            e barbarians fought with no better success ; for considering <unclear/> <lb/>
            at the Greeks were few in number, and expecting that they <unclear/> <lb/>
            ere covered with wounds, and would not be able to raise <unclear/> <lb/>
            eir heads against them any more, they renewed the contest. <lb/>
            ut the Greeks were marshalled in companies and according <lb/>
            their several nations, and each fought in turn, except only <unclear/> <lb/>
            e Phocians, they were stationed at the mountain to guard <unclear/> <lb/>
            e pathway. When therefore the Persians found nothing <note type="footnote"> 2I2</note> <pb n="484"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[213-215"/> <lb/>
            different from what they had seen on the preceding day, they <lb/>
            retired.</p>
          <p>213. While the king was in doubt what course to take in <lb/>
            the present state of affairs, Ephialtes, son of Eurydemus, a <lb/>
            Malian, obtained an audiences of him, expecting that he should <lb/>
            receive a great reward from the king, and informed him of the <lb/>
            path which leads over the mountain to Thermopylae ; and by <lb/>
            that means caused the destruction of those Greeks who were <lb/>
            stationed there. But afterwards, fearing the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            he fled to Thessaly ; and when he had fled, a price was set on <lb/>
            his head by the Pylagori, when the Amphictyons were assem­ <lb/>
            bled at Pylae. But some time after, he went down to Anti­ <lb/>
            cyra, and was killed by Athenades, a Trachinian. This Athen­ <lb/>
            ades killed him for another reason, which I shall mention in a <lb/>
            subsequent part of my history;4 he was however rewarded <lb/>
            none the less by the Lacedæmonians. 214. Another account is <lb/>
            given, that Onetes, son of Phanagoras, a Carystian, and Cory­ <lb/>
            dallus of Anticyra, were the persons who gave this informa­ <lb/>
            tion to the king, and conducted the Persians round the moun­ <lb/>
            tain. But to me this is by no means credible : for in the first <lb/>
            place we may draw that inference from this circumstance, that <lb/>
            the Pylagori of the Grecians set a price on the head not of <lb/>
            Onetes and Corydallus, but of Ephialtes the Trachinian, having <lb/>
            surely ascertained the exact truth ; and in the next place we <lb/>
            know that Ep<unclear>tes</unclear> fled on that account. Onetes indeed, <lb/>
            though he was not a Malian, might be acquainted with this <lb/>
            path, if he had <unclear>much</unclear> conversant with the country ; but <lb/>
            it was Ephialtes who conducted them round the mountain by <lb/>
            the path, and I charge him as the guilty person. 215. Xerxes, <lb/>
            since he was pleased with what Ephialtes promised to perform, <lb/>
            being exceedingly delighted, immediately despatched Hydarnes <lb/>
            and the troops that Hydarnes commanded; and he started <lb/>
            from the camp about the hour of lamp-lighting. The native <lb/>
            Malians discovered this pathway ; and having discovered it, <lb/>
            conducted the Thessalians by it against the Phocians, at tho <lb/>
            time when the Phocians, having fortified the pass by a wall, <lb/>
            were under shelter from an attack. From that time it ap- <note type="footnote"> 3 Literally, " came to speak with him." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The promised account is no where given in any extant writings of <lb/>
            the historian. </note> <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="218-219.]"/> <lb/>
            peurcd to have been of no service to the Malians. 216. This <lb/>
            path is situated as follows : it begins from the river Asopus, <lb/>
            which flows through the cleft; the same name is given both <lb/>
            to the mountain and to the path, Anopaea ; and this Anopæa <lb/>
            extends along the ridge of the mountain, and ends near Alpe­ <lb/>
            nus, which is the first city of the Locrians towards the Ma­ <lb/>
            lians, and by the rock called Melampygus, and by the seats of <lb/>
            the Cercopes; and there the path is the narrowest. 217. Along <lb/>
            this path, thus situate, the Persians, having crossed the Aso­ <lb/>
            pus, marched all night, having on their right the mountains <lb/>
            of the Œtæans, and on their left those of the Trachinians ; <lb/>
            morning appeared, and they were on the summit of the moun­ <lb/>
            tain. At this part of the mountain, as I have already men­ <lb/>
            ioned, a thousand heavy-armed Phocians kept guard, to de­ <lb/>
            fend their own country, and to secure the pathway. For the <lb/>
            lower pass was guarded by those before mentioned ; and the <lb/>
            Phocians had voluntarily promised Leonidas to guard the path <lb/>
            cross the mountain. 218. The Phocians discovered them <lb/>
            after they had ascended, in the following manner ; for the <lb/>
            Persian ascended without being observed, as the whole moun­ <lb/>
            ain was covered with oaks ; there was a perfect calm, and as <lb/>
            vas likely, a considerable rustling taking place from the leaves <lb/>
            trewn under foot, the Phocians sprung up and put on their <lb/>
            rms, and immediately the barbarians made their appearance. <lb/>
            Butwhen they saw men clad in armour they were astonished , <lb/>
            Dr, expecting to find nothing to oppose them, they fell in with <lb/>
            n army. Thereupon Hydarnes, fearing lest the Phocians might <unclear/> <lb/>
            e Lacedæmonians, asked Ephialtes of what nation the troops <lb/>
            vere; and being accurately informed, he drew up the Per­ <lb/>
            ans for battle. The Phocians, when they were hit by many <lb/>
            id thick-falling arrows, fled to the summit of the mountain, <unclear/> <lb/>
            pposing that they had come expressly to attack them, and <lb/>
            pared to perish. Such was their determination. But the <lb/>
            ersians, with Ephialtes and Hydarnes, took no notice of the <lb/>
            hocians, but marched down the mountain with all speed. <lb/>
            219. To those of the Greeks who were at Thermopylae, the <unclear/> <lb/>
            gur Megistias, having inspected the sacrifices, first made <lb/>
            own the death that would beta! them in the morning ; cer­ <lb/>
            in deserters afterwards came and brought intelligence of the <unclear/> <lb/>
            rcuit the Persians were taking ; these brought the news <lb/>
            hile it was yet night, and, thirdly, the scouts running down <pb n="486"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[220, 221."/> <lb/>
            from the heights, as soon as day dawned, brought the same <lb/>
            intelligence. Upon this the Greeks held a consultation, and <lb/>
            their opinions were divided. For some would not hear of <lb/>
            abandoning their post, and others opposed that view. After <lb/>
            this, when the assembly broke up, some of them departed, and <lb/>
            being dispersed betook themselves to their several cities ; but <lb/>
            others of them prepared to remain there with Leonidas. 220. <lb/>
            It is said that Leonidas himself sent them away, being anxious <lb/>
            that they should not perish ; but that he and the Spartans <lb/>
            who were there could not honourably desert the post which <lb/>
            they originally came to defend. For my own part, I am <lb/>
            rather inclined to think, that Leonidas, when he perceived <lb/>
            that the allies were averse and unwilling to share the danger <lb/>
            with him, bade them withdraw ; but that he considered it dis­ <lb/>
            honourable for himself to depart: on the other hand, by re­ <lb/>
            maining there, great renown would be left for him, and the <lb/>
            prosperity of .Sparta would not be obliterated. For it had <lb/>
            been announced to the Spartans, by the Pythian, when they <lb/>
            consulted the oracle concerning this war, as soon as it com­ <lb/>
            menced, " that either Lacedæmon must be overthrown by the <lb/>
            barbarians, or their king perish." This answer she gave in <lb/>
            hexameter verses to this effect: " To you, 0 inhabitants of <lb/>
            spacious Lacedæmon, either your vast, glorious city shall be <lb/>
            destroyed by men sprung from Perseus, or, if not so, the con­ <lb/>
            fines of Lacedæmon mourn a king deceased of the race of <lb/>
            Hercules. For neither shall the strength of bulls nor of lions <lb/>
            withstand him,5 with force opposed to force; for he has the <lb/>
            strength of Jove ; -and I say he shall not be restrained, before <lb/>
            he has, certainly, obtained one of these for his share." I think, <lb/>
            therefore, that Leonidas, considering these things, and being <lb/>
            desirous to acquire glory for the Spartans alone, sent away <lb/>
            the allies, rather than that those who went away differed in <lb/>
            opinion, and went away in such an unbecoming manner. 221. <lb/>
            The following in no small degree strengthens my conviction6 <lb/>
            on this point. For not only did he send away the others, but <lb/>
            it is certain, that Leonidas also sent away the augur who fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the army, Megistias the Acarnanian, who was said to <lb/>
            have been originally descended from Melampus, the same who <lb/>
            announced from an inspection of the victims what was about <lb/>
            to befal them, in order that he might not perish with them. <note type="footnote"> I The Persian king. </note><note type="footnote">6." Is not the least proof to me." </note> <pb n="487"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="222—224."/> <lb/>
            He, however, though dismissed, did not himself depart, but <lb/>
            sent away his son, who served with him in the expedition, <lb/>
            being his only child. 222. The allies accordingly, that were <lb/>
            dismissed, departed, and obeyed Leonidas; but only the Thes­ <lb/>
            pians and the Thebans remained with the Lacedæmonians : <lb/>
            the Thebans, indeed, remained unwillingly, and against theii <lb/>
            inclination, for Leonidas detained them, treating them as host­ <lb/>
            ages; but the Thespians willingly, for they refused to go <lb/>
            away and abandon Leonidas and those with him, but remained <lb/>
            and died with them. Demophilus, son of Diadromas, com­ <lb/>
            manded them.</p>
          <p>223. Xerxes, after he had poured out libations at sun-rise, <lb/>
            having waited a short time, began his attack about the time <lb/>
            of full market; for he had been so instructed by Ephialtes; <lb/>
            forthe descent from the mountain is more direct, and the dis­ <lb/>
            tance much shorter, than the circuit and ascent. The bar­ <lb/>
            arians, therefore, with Xerxes, advanced; and the Greeks <lb/>
            vith Leonidas, marching out as if for certain death, now ad­ <lb/>
            vanced much farther than before into the wide part of the <lb/>
            defile. For the fortification of the wall had protected them, <lb/>
            and they on the preceding days, having taken up their posi­ <lb/>
            ion in the narrow part, there fought. But now engaging <unclear/> <lb/>
            outside the narrows, great numbers of the barbarians fell. <lb/>
            For the officers of the companies from behind, having scourges, <lb/>
            Logged every man, constantly urging them forward; in con­ <lb/>
            equence, many of them falling into the sea, perished, and <lb/>
            many more were trampled alive under foot by one another; <lb/>
            nd no regard was paid to any that perished. For the Greeks, <lb/>
            nowing that death awaited them at the hands of those who <lb/>
            vere going round the mountain, being desperate, and regard­ <lb/>
            ess of their own lives, displayed the utmost possible valour <lb/>
            gainst the barbarians. 224. Already were most of their <lb/>
            ivelins broken, and they had begun to despatch the Persians <lb/>
            with their swords. In this part of the struggle fell Leonidas, <unclear/> <lb/>
            ghting valiantly, and with him other eminent Spartans, whose <lb/>
            sames, seeing they were deserving men, I have ascertained; <unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[225—228."/> <lb/>
            king Darius, and son of Hystaspes, son of Arsames. He, <lb/>
            when he gave his daughter to Darius, gave him also all his <lb/>
            property, as she was his only child. 225. Accordingly, two <lb/>
            brothers of Xerxes fell at this spot, fighting for the body of <lb/>
            Leonidas, and there was a violent struggle between the Per­ <lb/>
            sians and Lacedæmonians, until at last the Greeks rescued it <lb/>
            by their valour, and four times repulsed the enemy. Thus <lb/>
            the contest continued until those with Ephialtes came up. <lb/>
            When the Greeks heard that they were approaching, from this <lb/>
            time the battle was altered. For they retreated to the narrow <lb/>
            part of the way, and passing beyond the wall, came and took <lb/>
            up their position on the rising ground, all in a compact body, <lb/>
            with the exception of the Thebans: the rising ground is at <lb/>
            the entrance where the stone lion now stands to the memory <lb/>
            of Leonidas. On this spot, while they defended themselves <lb/>
            with swords, such as had them still remaining, and their hands <lb/>
            and teeth, the barbarians overwhelmed them with missiles, <lb/>
            some of them attacking them in front, and having thrown <lb/>
            down the wall; and others surrounding and attacking them <lb/>
            on every side.</p>
          <p>226. Though the Lacedæmonians and Thespians behaved <lb/>
            in this manner, yet Dieneces, a Spartan, is said to have been <lb/>
            the bravest man. They relate that he made the following <lb/>
            remark, before they engaged with the Medes, having heard <lb/>
            a Trachinian say, that when the barbarians let fly their arrows, <lb/>
            they would obscure the sun by the multitude of their shafts, <lb/>
            so great were their numbers: but he, not at all alarmed at <lb/>
            this, said, holding in contempt the numbers of the Medes, <lb/>
            that " their Trachinian friend told them every thing to their <lb/>
            advantage, since if the Medes obscure the sun, they would <lb/>
            then have to fight in the shade, and not in the sun." This <lb/>
            and other sayings of the same kind they relate that Dieneces, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian, left as memorials. 227. Next to him, two <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian brothers, Alpheus and Maron, sons of Orisi­ <lb/>
            phantus, are said to have distinguished themselves most; and of <lb/>
            the Thespians, he obtained the greatest glory whose name was <lb/>
            Dithyrambus, son of Harmatides. 228. In honour of the slain, <lb/>
            who were buried on the spot where they fell, and of those who <lb/>
            died before they who were dismissed by Leonidas went away, <lb/>
            the following inscription has been engraved over them : " Four <lb/>
            thousand from Peloponnesus once fought on this spot with <pb n="489"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="229-231]"/> <lb/>
            three hundred myriads." This inscription was made for all; <lb/>
            and for the Spartans in particular: " Stranger, go tell the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, that we lie here, obedient to their commands." <lb/>
            This was for the Lacedæmonians ; and for the prophet, the <lb/>
            following : "This is the monument of the illustrious Megistias, <lb/>
            whom once the Medes, having passed the river Sperchius, <lb/>
            slew; a prophet, who, at the time well knowing the impend­ <lb/>
            ing fate, would not abandon the leaders of Sparta." The <lb/>
            Amphictyons are the persons who honoured them with these <lb/>
            inscriptions and columns, with the exception of the inscription <lb/>
            tothe prophet; that of the prophet Megistias, Simonides, <unclear/> <lb/>
            sonof Leoprepes, caused to be engraved, from personal <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>229. It is said, that two of these three hundred, Eurytus <lb/>
            and Aristodemus, when it was in the power of both, if they <lb/>
            lad agreed together, either to return alike safe to Sparta, since <lb/>
            hey had been dismissed from the camp by Leonidas, and were <lb/>
            ying at Alpeni desperately afflicted with a disease of the eyes; <unclear/> <lb/>
            or, if they would not return, to have died together with the <lb/>
            est; when it was in their power to do either of these, they <lb/>
            ould not agree; and being divided in opinion, Eurytus, having <lb/>
            card of the circuit made by the Persians, and having called <lb/>
            )r and put on his arms, ordered his helot to lead him to the <lb/>
            ombatants ; and when he had led him, the man who led him <lb/>
            an away, but he, rushing into the midst of the throng, perished ; <lb/>
            jut Aristodemus, failing in courage, was left behind. Now if it <lb/>
            ad happened that Aristodemus alone, being sick, had returned <unclear/> <lb/>
            Sparta, or if both had gone home together, in my opinion the <lb/>
            partans would not have shown any anger against them. But <lb/>
            "w, since one of them perished, and the other, who had only <lb/>
            ie same excuse, refused to die, it was necessary for them to <lb/>
            ■ exceedingly angry with Aristodemus. 230. Some say that <lb/>
            ristodemus thus got safe to Sparta, and on such a pretext; <lb/>
            it others, that being sent as a messenger from the army, <lb/>
            ough he might have arrived while the battle was going on, <lb/>
            would not, but having lingered on the road, survived; <unclear/> <lb/>
            Inle his fellow-messenger, arriving in time for the battle, <unclear/> <lb/>
            ed. 231. Aristodemus having returned to Lacedæmon, met <lb/>
            ith insults and infamy. He was declared infamous by being <unclear/> <lb/>
            cated as follows: not one of the Spartans would either give <unclear/> <lb/>
            m fire or converse with him; and he met with insult, being <pb n="490"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[232—234,"/> <unclear/><lb/>
            alled Aristodemus the coward. However, in the battle of <lb/>
            Platæa, he removed all the disgrace that attached to him." <lb/>
            232. It is also said, that another of the three hundred, whose <lb/>
            name was Pantites, having been sent as a messenger to Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, survived; and that he, on his return to Sparta, finding <lb/>
            himself held in dishonour, hung himself. 233. The Thebans, <lb/>
            whom Leontiades commanded, as long as they were with the <lb/>
            Greeks, being constrained by necessity, fought against the <lb/>
            king's army; but when they saw the forces of the Persians <lb/>
            gaining the upper hand, as the Greeks with Leonidas were <lb/>
            hastening to the hill, having separated from them, they held <lb/>
            out their hands and went near the barbarians, saying the truest <lb/>
            thing they could say, that " they were both on the side of the <lb/>
            Modes, and were among the first who gave earth and water <lb/>
            to the king, and that they came to Thermopylae from compul­ <lb/>
            sion, and were guiltless of the blow that had been inflicted on <lb/>
            the king. So that, by saying this, they saved their lives; for <lb/>
            they had the Thessalians as witnesses to what they said: they <lb/>
            were not, however, fortunate in every respect; for when the <lb/>
            barbarians seized them as they came up, some they slew, and <lb/>
            the greater number of them, by the command of Xerxes, they <lb/>
            branded with the royal mark, beginning with the general, <lb/>
            Leontiades; whose son, Eurymachus, some time afterwards, <lb/>
            the Platæans slew, when he was commanding four hundred <lb/>
            Thebans, and had got possession of the citadel of the Platæans. <lb/>
            234. Thus the Greeks fought at Thermopylæ. And Xerxes, <lb/>
            having sent for Demaratus, questioned him, beginning as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " Demaratus, you are an honest man ; I judge so from <lb/>
            experience; for whatever you said, has turned out accord­ <lb/>
            ingly. Now tell me, how many the rest of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            may be; and how many of them, or whether all, are such as <lb/>
            these in war?" He answered, "0 king, the number of all <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians is great, and their cities are many; but I <lb/>
            shall inform you of that which you desire to know. In La­ <lb/>
            conia is Sparta, a city containing about eight thousand men; <lb/>
            all these are equal to those who have fought here; the rest; <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians, however, are not equal to these, though <lb/>
            brave." To this Xerxes said: " Demaratus, in what way can <lb/>
            we conquer these men with the least trouble, come tell me ; <lb/>
            for you must be acquainted with the course of their counsel <note type="footnote"> 7 See B. IX. chap. 71. </note> <pb n="491"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="35, 236.]"/> <lb/>
            ince you have been their king." 235. He replied: " 0 king, <lb/>
            ince you ask my advice so earnestly, it is right that I should <lb/>
            ell you what is best. You should, then, despatch three hun­ <lb/>
            red ships of your naval force to the Laconian coast. Off that <lb/>
            oast there lies an island called Cythera, which Chilori, the <lb/>
            visest man amongst us, said would be more advantageous to <lb/>
            he Spartans if sunk to the bottom of the sea, than if it <lb/>
            emained above water; always apprehending that some such <lb/>
            hing would come from it, as I am going to propose; not that <lb/>
            e foresaw the arrival of your fleet, but fearing equally every <lb/>
            aval force. Sallying from this island, then, let them alarm <lb/>
            he Lacedæmonians ; and when they have a war of their own <lb/>
            ear home, they will no longer give you cause to fear, lest <unclear/> <lb/>
            they should succour the rest of Greece, while it is being taken <unclear/> <lb/>
            y your land-forces. But when the rest of Greece is sub­ <lb/>
            tied, the Laconian territory, being left alone, will be feeble. <lb/>
            If you will not act in this manner, you may expect that this <unclear/> <lb/>
            vill happen. There is in Peloponnesus a narrow isthmus ; in <lb/>
            is place, all the Peloponnesians being combined against you, <unclear/> <lb/>
            expect to meet more violent struggles than the past; whereas, <lb/>
            you do as I advise, both this isthmus and the cities will <lb/>
            ibmit to you without a battle." 236. After him spoke Achæ­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            enes, who was brother of Xerxes, and commander of the <lb/>
            aval forces, having been present at the conversation, and <lb/>
            caring lest Xerxes might be induced to adopt that plan: " O <lb/>
            ing, I perceive you listening to the suggestions of a man, <lb/>
            ho envies your prosperity, or would betray your cause. For <unclear/> <lb/>
            he Greeks are commonly of that character; they envy suc­ <lb/>
            ;ss, and hate superior power. If, therefore, in the present <lb/>
            ate of our affairs, after four hundred ships have been wrecked, <lb/>
            ou should detach three hundred more from the fleet to sail <unclear/> <lb/>
            fund Peloponnesus, our enemies may fight us upon equal <lb/>
            rms ; but if our fleet is kept together, it becomes invincible, <unclear/> <lb/>
            and they will be unable to fight with us at all: moreover, the <lb/>
            hole fleet will assist the land-forces, and the land-forces the <lb/>
            eet, by advancing together; but if you separate them, neither <lb/>
            ill they be useful to you, nor you to them. Having, there­ <lb/>
            re, ordered your own matters well, resolve to pay no atten­ <lb/>
            on to what your enemies are doing, how they will carry on <lb/>
            e war, what they will do, or how many their numbers are. <lb/>
            or they are able to think about themselves, and we in like <pb n="492"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1237-239."/> <lb/>
            manner about ourselves. But the Lacedæmonians, if they <lb/>
            venture a battle against the Persians, will not cure this one <lb/>
            present wound." 237. To this Xerxes answered : " Achæ­ <lb/>
            menes, you appear to me to speak well, and I will act accord­ <lb/>
            ingly. But Demaratus said what he thought was best for me <lb/>
            though he is surpassed by you in judgment. For that I will <lb/>
            not admit, that Demaratus is not well-disposed to my interests, <lb/>
            forming my conclusion from what was before said by him, <lb/>
            and from the fact, that a citizen envies a fellow-citizen who is <lb/>
            prosperous, and hates him in silence ; nor, when a citizen asks <lb/>
            for advice, will a fellow-citizen suggest what seems to him to <lb/>
            be best, unless he has reached a high degree of virtue : such <lb/>
            persons, however, are rare. But a friend bears the greatest <lb/>
            regard for his friend in prosperity; and, when he asks his <lb/>
            advice, gives him the best advice he can. I therefore enjoin <lb/>
            all men for the future to abstain from calumny concerning <lb/>
            Demaratus, since he is my friend. 238. Xerxes having spoken <lb/>
            thus, passed through the dead ; and having heard that Leo­ <lb/>
            nidas was king and general of the Lacedaemonians, he com­ <lb/>
            manded them to cut off his head, and fix it upon a pole. It <lb/>
            is clear to me from many other proofs, and not least of all <lb/>
            from this, that king Xerxes was more highly incensed against <lb/>
            Leonidas during his life, than against any other man; for <lb/>
            otherwise he would never have violated the respect due to <lb/>
            his dead body ; since the Persians, most of all men with whom <lb/>
            I am acquainted, are wont to honour men who are brave in <lb/>
            war. They, however, to. whom the order was given to do <lb/>
            this, did it.</p>
          <p>239. But I return to that part of my narration where I <lb/>
            before left it incomplete. The Lacedæmonians first had in­ <lb/>
            formation that the king was preparing to invade Greece ; and <lb/>
            accordingly they sent to the oracle at Delphi, whereupon the <unclear/> <lb/>
            answer was given them, which I lately mentioned.8 But they <lb/>
            obtained their information in a remarkable manner. For <lb/>
            Demaratus, son of Ariston, being in exile among the Medes, <lb/>
            as I conjecture, and appearances support my opinion, was not <lb/>
            well affected to the Lacedæmonians. However, it is a ques­ <lb/>
            tion, whether he acted as he did from a motive of benevolence, <lb/>
            or by way of exultation. For when Xerxes had determined <lb/>
            to invade Greece, Demaratus, who was then at Susa, and had <note type="footnote"> <unclear>8</unclear> Chap. 220 </note> <pb n="493"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="2.] "/>card of his intention, communicated it to the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            but he was unable to make it known by any other means, for <lb/>
            tore was great danger of being detected ; he therefore had <lb/>
            ecourse to the following contrivance. Having taken a folding <unclear/> <lb/>
            blet, he scraped off the wax, and then wrote the king's in­ <lb/>
            ention on the wood of the tablet ; and having done this, he <lb/>
            melted the wax again over the writing, in order that the tablet, <lb/>
            eing carried with nothing written on it, might occasion him <lb/>
            trouble from the guards upon the road. When it arrived <lb/>
            Sparta, the Lacedæmonians were unable to comprehend it; <lb/>
            ntil, as I am informed, Gorge, daughter of Cleomenes, and <lb/>
            ife to Leonidas, made a suggestion, having considered the <lb/>
            atter with herself, and bade them scrape off the wax, and <lb/>
            ey would find letters written on the wood. They, having <lb/>
            eyed, found and read the contents, and forwarded them to <lb/>
            e rest of the Greeks. These things are reported to have <lb/>
            opened in this manner.</p>

          <p>HE Greeks who were assigned to the navy, were these. The <lb/>
            henians, who furnished one hundred and twenty-seven <lb/>
            sps; but the Platæans, from a spirit of valour and zeal, though <lb/>
            experienced in the sea-service, assisted the Athenians in <lb/>
            inning the ships. The Corinthians furnished forty ships ; <lb/>
            t Megareans twenty ; the Chalcidians manned twenty, the <lb/>
            henians having furnished them with ships ; the Æginetæ, <lb/>
            ejhteen; the Sicyonians, twelve; the Lacedæmonians, ten ; the <lb/>
            Fidaurians, eight; the Eretrians, seven ; the Trœzenians, five; <lb/>
            Styreans, two ; and the Ceians, two ships, and two pente­ <lb/>
            citers ; the Opuntian Locrians also came to their assistance, <lb/>
            wih seven penteconters. 2. These, then, were they who were en­ <lb/>
            gred in the war at Artemisium, and I have mentioned how each <unclear/> <lb/>
            ctributed to the number of the ships. The total of the ships <pb n="494"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[3—5. "/>assembled at Artemisium, besides the penteconters, was two hun <lb/>
            dred and seventy-one. The admiral, who had the chief power <lb/>
            the Spartans supplied, Eurybiades, son of Euryclides, for the <lb/>
            allies had refused "if the Lacedoemonian did not command, t( <lb/>
            follow Athenian leaders, but said they would break up the in. <lb/>
            tended fleet." 3. For from the first there was a talk, even before <lb/>
            they sent to Sicily to solicit an alliance, that it would be propel <lb/>
            to intrust the navy to the Athenians. But as the allies opposed <lb/>
            the Athenians gave way, deeming it of high importance tha <unclear/> <lb/>
            Greece should be saved, and knowing that if they shouli <lb/>
            quarrel about the command, Greece would be lost; hereir <unclear/> <lb/>
            thinking justly. For intestine discord is as much worse thar <lb/>
            war carried on in concert, as war is than peace. Being, there­ <lb/>
            fore, convinced of this, they did not resist, but yielded as long <lb/>
            as they had need of their assistance, as they clearly showed. <lb/>
            For when, having repulsed the Persian, they were now con. <lb/>
            tending for his country, they put forward as a pretext thE <lb/>
            arrogance of Pausanias, and deprived the Lacedæmonians <unclear>O</unclear> <lb/>
            the chief command. But these things occurred afterwards. <lb/>
            4. But at that time, those Greeks who had arrived at Arte­ <lb/>
            misium, when they saw a vast number of ships drawn up a<unclear>l</unclear> <lb/>
            Aphetæ, and all parts full of troops, since- the affairs of the <lb/>
            barbarian turned out contrary to their expectation, in great <lb/>
            consternation, deliberated about retiring from Artemisium tc <lb/>
            the inner parts of Greece. The Euboeans, knowing that they <lb/>
            were deliberating on this matter, entreated Eurybiades to re-: <lb/>
            main a short time longer, until they could remove their chil­ <lb/>
            dren and domestics to a place of safety. But finding they <lb/>
            could not persuade him, they then went over to the AtheniaD <lb/>
            general, and prevailed on Themistocles, by a bribe of thirty <lb/>
            talents, to promise that they would stay and engage the enemy <lb/>
            by sea before Eubœa. 5. Themistocles, to retain the Greeks, <lb/>
            did as follows. Of this money he gave five talents to Eury. <lb/>
            biades, as if indeed he gave it from himself; and when he <lb/>
            had gained him over, as Adimantus, son of Ocytus, the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthian commander, was the only person who resisted, affirming <lb/>
            that he would sail away from Artemisium, and not stay, to <lb/>
            him Themistocles said with an oath : " You shall not aban­ <lb/>
            don us ; for I will make you a greater present than the king <lb/>
            of the Modes would send you for abandoning the allies." He <lb/>
            at the same time said this and sent three talents of silver <unclear>o</unclear> <pb n="495"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[6—8.]"/> <lb/>
            board the ship of Adimantus. They therefore, being swayed <unclear/> <lb/>
            by the present, were gained over, and complied with the <lb/>
            vishes of the Eubœans ; but Themistocles himself was a con­ <lb/>
            iderable gainer, as he secretly kept the rest; but those who <lb/>
            ook part of this money, thought it came from the Athenians, <lb/>
            n that condition.</p>
          <p>6. They accordingly remained in Eubœa, and came to an <lb/>
            ngagement by sea. It happened in this manner. When the <lb/>
            arbarians arrived at Aphetæ, in the afternoon, having been <lb/>
            ready informed that a few Grecian ships were stationed, and <lb/>
            hendescrying them at Artemisium, they were eager to attack, <unclear/> <lb/>
            the hope of taking them. However, they did not think it <lb/>
            dvisable to sail directly upon them, for the following reasons, <lb/>
            st the Greeks, seeing them sailing towards them, should be­ <lb/>
            ake themselves to flight, and the night should cover their re­ <lb/>
            eat, by which means they would escape; but, according to <lb/>
            heir saying, they thought that not even the torch-bearer <lb/>
            ould escape alive. 7. For this purpose, then, they had re­ <lb/>
            ourse to the following plan : having detached two hundred <lb/>
            hips from the whole fleet, they sent them round, outside <lb/>
            ciathus, that they might not be seen by the enemy sailing <lb/>
            bund Eubcea, by Caphareus and round Geræstus to the Eu­ <lb/>
            pus ; that so they might surround them, the one party ar­ <lb/>
            ving at the place appointed in that way, and intercepting <lb/>
            heir retreat, and themselves attacking them in front. Having <lb/>
            etermined on this, they despatched the ships appointed for <lb/>
            is service, themselves not intending to attack the Greeks that <lb/>
            ay, nor before the agreed signal should be seen, given by those <lb/>
            ho sailed round, announcing their arrival. These, then, they <lb/>
            nt round, and set about taking the number of the rest of the <lb/>
            ips at Aphetae. 8. At this time, while they were taking <lb/>
            e number of their ships, there was in this camp Scyllias of <lb/>
            cyone, the best diver of his time ; he, in the shipwreck that <lb/>
            appened off Pelion, had saved much of their treasure for the <lb/>
            ersians, and had acquired a good deal for himself. This <lb/>
            cyllias had long before entertained the design of deserting to <lb/>
            e Greeks, but had had no opportunity of doing so until that <lb/>
            ne. In what way he at length made his escape to the <lb/>
            recians I cannot certainly affirm, and I wonder whether the <lb/>
            count given is true. For it is said, that having plunged <unclear/> <lb/>
            to the sea at Aphetæ, he never rose until he reached Arte <pb n="496"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[9-11."/> <lb/>
            misium, having passed this distance through the sea, as near 84 <lb/>
            can be, eighty stadia. Many other things are related of this <lb/>
            man that are very like falsehood, and some that are true. If, <lb/>
            however, I may give my opinion of this matter, it is, that he i <lb/>
            came to Artemisium in a boat. On his arrival, he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately informed the commanders of the shipwreck, how it had <lb/>
            occurred, and of the ships that were sent round Eubœa. 9. <lb/>
            The Greeks, having heard this, held a conference among <lb/>
            themselves ; and, after much debate, it was resolved, that re­ <lb/>
            maining there and continuing in their station during that <lb/>
            day, then, when midnight was passed, they should proceed, <lb/>
            and meet the ships that were sailing round. But after this, <lb/>
            when no ship sailed against them, having waited for the <lb/>
            evening of the day, they sailed of themselves against the <lb/>
            barbarians, being desirous to make trial of their manner of <lb/>
            fighting, and of breaking through the line. 10. The other <lb/>
            soldiers of Xerxes, and the commanders, seeing them sailing to­ <lb/>
            wards them with so few ships, attributed their conduct to mad­ <lb/>
            ness, and on their part got their ships under weigh, expecting <lb/>
            that they should easily take them; and their expectations <lb/>
            were very reasonable, when they saw that the Grecian ships <lb/>
            were few, and their own many more in number, and better <lb/>
            sailers : taking these things into consideration, they enclosed <lb/>
            them in the middle of a circle. Now, such of the lonians as <lb/>
            were well-affected to the Greeks, and joined the expedition <lb/>
            unwillingly, regarded it as a great calamity, when they saw <lb/>
            them surrounded, feeling convinced that not one of them <lb/>
            would return ; so weak did the Grecian forces appear to them <lb/>
            to be. But such as were pleased with what was going on, <lb/>
            vied with each other how each might be the first to take an <lb/>
            Athenian ship, and receive a reward from the king. For <lb/>
            throughout the fleet they had the highest opinion of the <lb/>
            Athenians. 11. When the signal was given to the Greeks, first <lb/>
            of all turning their prows against the barbarians, they contract­ <lb/>
            ed their sterns inwardly to the middle ; and when the second <lb/>
            signal was given, they commenced the attack, though enclosed <lb/>
            in a narrow space, and that prow to prow. On this occasion <lb/>
            they took thirty ships of the barbarians, and Philaon, son of <lb/>
            Chersis, the brother of Gorgus, king of the Salaminians, a <lb/>
            man highly esteemed in their army. Lycomedes, son of Æs­ <lb/>
            chreus, an Athenian, was the first of the Greeks who took a <pb n="497"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="12-14]"/> <lb/>
            hip from the enemy, and he received the palm of valour. <lb/>
            ut night coming on, separated the combatants, who in this <unclear/> <lb/>
            ngagement fought with doubtful success. The Greeks re­ <lb/>
            rned to Artemisium, and the barbarians to Aphetæ, having <lb/>
            bught with far different success than they expected. In this <lb/>
            ngagement Antidorus, a Lemnian, was the only one of the <lb/>
            reeks in the king's service who went over to the Grecians; <lb/>
            id on that account the Athenians presented him with lands <lb/>
            t Salamis.</p>
          <p>12. When night came on, and it was now the middle of <lb/>
            ummer, heavy rain fell through the whole night, and violent <lb/>
            under about Pelion; but the dead bodies and pieces of <lb/>
            reck were driven to Aphetæ, and got entangled round the <lb/>
            rows of the ships, and impeded the blades of the oars. But <lb/>
            te soldiers who were on board, when they heard the thunder, <lb/>
            ere seized with terror, expecting that they must certainly <lb/>
            rrish, into such calamities had they fallen. For before they <lb/>
            ad recovered breath, after the wreck and tempest that had <lb/>
            curred off Pelion, a fierce engagement followed; and after <lb/>
            e engagement, impetuous rain and mighty torrents rushing <lb/>
            to the sea, and violent thunder. Such was the night to <lb/>
            tem. IS. But to those who had been appointed to sail <lb/>
            rund Euboea, this same night proved so much the more wild, <lb/>
            it that it fell upon them while they were in the open sea ; <lb/>
            ad the end was grievous to them; for as they were sailing, <lb/>
            te storm and rain overtook them when they were near the <lb/>
            œla of Euboea, and being driven by the wind, and not know­ <lb/>
            ig where they were driven, they were dashed upon the rocks. <lb/>
            1 this was done by the deity, that the Persian might be <lb/>
            bought to an equality with the Grecian, or at least not be <lb/>
            geatly superior. Thus they perished near the Coela of <lb/>
            libœa. 14. The barbarians at Aphetæ, when to their great <lb/>
            day dawned, kept their ships at rest, and were content, <lb/>
            er they had suffered so much, to remain quiet for the pre­ <lb/>
            it. But three and fifty Attic ships came to reinforce the <lb/>
            Geeks j and both these by their arrival gave them additional <lb/>
            urage, as did the news that came at the same time, that <lb/>
            se of the barbarians who were sailing round Euboea had <lb/>
            perished in the late storm; therefore having waited to the <unclear/> <lb/>
            ne hour, they set sail and attacked the Cilician ships, and <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <pb n="498"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[15—19."/> <lb/>
            having destroyed them, as soon as It was night they sailed <lb/>
            back to Artemisium.</p>
          <p>15. On the third day the commanders of the barbarians, <lb/>
            indignant at being insulted by so few ships, and fearing the <lb/>
            displeasure of Xerxes, no longer waited for the Greeks to be­ <lb/>
            gin the battle; but encouraging one another, got under weigh <lb/>
            about the middle of the day. It happened that, these actions <lb/>
            by sea and those by land at Thermopylae took place on the <lb/>
            same days; and the whole struggle for those at sea was for <lb/>
            the Euripus, as for those with Leonidas to guard the pass., <lb/>
            The one party encouraging each other not to suffer the bar­ <lb/>
            barians to enter Greece; and the other, to destroy the Grecian <lb/>
            forces, and make themselves masters of the channel. 16. <lb/>
            When the barbarians, having formed in line, sailed onwards, <lb/>
            the Grecians remained still at Artemisium; but the barbari­ <lb/>
            ans, having drawn up their ships in the form of a crescent, <lb/>
            encircled them as if they would take them; whereupon the <lb/>
            Greeks sailed out to meet them, and engaged. In this battle <lb/>
            they were nearly equal to one another; for the fleet of Xerxes, <lb/>
            by reason of its magnitude and number, impeded itself, as the <lb/>
            ships incommoded and ran foul of one another: however they <lb/>
            continued to fight, and would not yield, for they were ashamed <lb/>
            to be put to flight by a few ships. Accordingly many ships <lb/>
            of the Grecians perished, and many men ; and of the barbari­ <lb/>
            ans a much greater number both of ships and men. Having <lb/>
            fought in this manner they separated from each other. 17. <lb/>
            In this engagement the Egyptians signalized themselves <lb/>
            among the forces of Xerxes; for they both achieved other <lb/>
            great actions, and took five Grecian ships, with their crews. <lb/>
            On the part of the Greeks, the Athenians signalized them­ <lb/>
            selves on this day, and among the Athenians, Clinias. son of <lb/>
            Alcibiades ; who at his own expense joined the fleet with two <lb/>
            hundred men, and a ship of his own.</p>
          <p>18. When they had separated, each gladly hastened to their <lb/>
            own stations: but the Grecians, when, having left the battle, <lb/>
            they had withdrawn, were in possession of the dead and of <lb/>
            the wrecks; yet having been severely handled, and especially <lb/>
            the Athenians, the half of whose ships were disabled, they <lb/>
            consulted about a retreat to the interior of Greece. 19. But <lb/>
            Themistocles having considered with himself that if the Ionis <pb n="499"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="0—22.] "/>is and Cariaus could be detached from the barbarian, they <lb/>
            ould be able to overcome the rest; as the Eubœans wore <lb/>
            riving their cattle down to the shore, he there assembled the <lb/>
            recian commanders together, and told them that he thought <lb/>
            e had a contrivance, by which he hoped to draw off the best <lb/>
            the king's allies. This, then, he so far discovered to them, <lb/>
            it in the present state of affairs he told them what they ought <lb/>
            do ; every one should kill as many of the Eubœan cattle as <lb/>
            thought fit; for it was better that their own army should <lb/>
            ve them than the enemy. He also advised them each to <lb/>
            rect their own men to kindle fires ; and promised that he <lb/>
            ould choose such a time for their departure, that they should <lb/>
            arrive safe in Greece. These things they were pleased to <lb/>
            ; and forthwith, having kindled fires, they fell upon the <lb/>
            ttle. 20. For the Eubœans, disregarding the oracles of <lb/>
            cis as importing nothing, had neither carried out any thing <lb/>
            t a place of safety, nor collected stores, as if war was ap- <lb/>
            I oaching; and so had brought their affairs into a precarious <lb/>
            ite. The oracle of Bads respecting them was as follows: <lb/>
            Beware of the barbarian-tongued, when he shall cast a byb- <lb/>
            I -yoke across the sea, remove the bleating goats from <lb/>
            ] bœa.” As they paid no attention to these verses, in the <lb/>
            c amities then present and those that were impending, they <lb/>
            linto the greatest distress. 21. They, then, were acting <lb/>
            t is, and in that conjuncture the scout arrived from Trachis. <lb/>
            Hr there was a scout stationed off Artemisium, Polyas of <lb/>
            Aticyra, who had been ordered, (and he had a well-furnished <lb/>
            bat ready,) if the fleet should be in difficulty, to make it <lb/>
            k own to those that were at Thermopylae; and in like man­ <lb/>
            n' Abronychus, son of Lysicles an Athenian, was with <lb/>
            I onidas, ready to carry the tidings to those at Artemisium in <lb/>
            a riëconter, if. any reverse should happen to the land-forces. <lb/>
            T6 is Abronychus then arriving, informed them of what had <lb/>
            b allen Leonidas and his army; but they, when they heard <lb/>
            il no longer deferred their departure, but retired each in the <lb/>
            o er in which they were stationed, the Corinthians first, and <lb/>
            th Athenians last.</p>
          <p>22. Themistocles, having selected the best sailing ships <lb/>
            o the Athenians, went to the places where there was water. <lb/>
            fi for drinking, and engraved upon the stones inscriptions, <lb/>
            xich the Ionians, upon arriving next day at Artemisium, <note type="footnote"> 2K2 </note> <pb n="500"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[23—2 "/>read. The inscriptions were to this effect: ' Men of Ioni: <lb/>
            you do wrong in fighting against your fathers, and helping 1 <lb/>
            enslave Greece: rather, therefore, come over to us; or, if yo <lb/>
            cannot do that, withdraw your forces from the contest, an <lb/>
            entreat the Carians to do the same. But if neither of the!! <lb/>
            things is possible, and you are bound by too strong a necessit <lb/>
            to revolt, yet in action, when we are engaged, behave ill o <lb/>
            purpose, remembering that you are descended from us, an <lb/>
            that the enmity of the barbarian against us originally sprun <lb/>
            from you." Themistocles, in my opinion, wrote this with tw <lb/>
            objects in view ; that either, if the inscriptions escaped th <lb/>
            notice of the king, he might induce the Ionians to change side <lb/>
            and come over to them; or, if they were reported to him, an <lb/>
            made a subject of accusation before Xerxes, they might mak <lb/>
            the Ionians suspected, and cause them to be excluded from th <lb/>
            sea-fights. 23. Themistocles left this inscription, and imme <lb/>
            diately afterwards a certain Histiæan came to the barbarian <lb/>
            in a boat, announcing the flight of the Greeks from Artemi <lb/>
            slum; but they, through distrust, kept the man who brough <lb/>
            the news under guard, and despatched some swift vessels t <lb/>
            reconnoitre. When they reported the truth as it was, thi <lb/>
            whole fleet, as soon as the sun's rays were spread, sailed in; <lb/>
            body to Artemisium; and having waited in that place unti <lb/>
            mid-day, they then sailed to Histiæa, and on their arrival pos <lb/>
            sessed themselves of the city of the Histiæans, and ravaged at <lb/>
            the maritime villages of the Ellopian district, in the territorj <lb/>
            of Histiæotis.</p>
          <p>24. Whilst they were on this coast, Xerxes, having made <lb/>
            preparations with respect to the dead, sent a herald to thE <lb/>
            fleet. And he made the following previous preparations. 0 <lb/>
            those of his own army, who were slain at Thermopylae, and <lb/>
            they were about twenty thousand, of these having left aboul <lb/>
            one thousand, the remainder, having caused pits to be dug, he <lb/>
            buried, throwing leaves over them and heaping up earth, thai <lb/>
            they might not be seen by those who should come from the <lb/>
            fleet. When the herald crossed over to Histiæa, having con­ <lb/>
            vened a meeting of the whole encampment, he spoke as follows: <lb/>
            "Allies, king Xerxes permits any of you who please, to leave <lb/>
            his post and come and see how he fights against those sense­ <lb/>
            less men, who hoped to overcome the king's power." 25. <lb/>
            After he had made this announcement, nothing was more <pb n="501"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="k 27.]"/> <lb/>
            earce than boats, so many were anxious to behold the sight; <lb/>
            nd having crossed over, they went through and viewed the <lb/>
            ead; and all thought that those that lay there were all Lace­ <lb/>
            monians and Thespians, though they also saw the Helots: <lb/>
            owever Xerxes did not deceive those who had crossed over by <lb/>
            hat he had done with respect to his own dead, for indeed it <lb/>
            as ridiculous; of the one party a thousand dead were seen <lb/>
            ving ; but the others lay all heaped up together, to the number <lb/>
            four thousand. This day they spent in the view, and on <lb/>
            e next they returned to Histiæa, to their ships, and those <lb/>
            ith Xerxes set out on their march. 26. Some few deserters <lb/>
            me to them from Arcadia, in want of subsistence, and <lb/>
            ished to be actively employed: taking these men into the <lb/>
            ng's presence, the Persians inquired concerning the Greeks, <lb/>
            hat they were doing. One in particular it was who asked <lb/>
            em this question. They answered, that they were celebrating <lb/>
            e Olympic games, and viewing gymnastic combats and horse­ <lb/>
            ces. He then asked, what was the reward proposed to them, <lb/>
            r which they contended. They mentioned the crown of olive <lb/>
            tat is given. Upon which Tritantæchmes, son of Artabanus, <lb/>
            living uttered a noble sentiment, incurred the charge of cow­ <lb/>
            a dice from the king: for having heard that the prize was a <lb/>
            &lt; )wn, and not riches, he could not remain silent, but spoke <lb/>
            t follows before all: " Heavens, Mardonius, against what <lb/>
            id of men have you brought us to fight, who contend not <lb/>
            f wealth, but for glory!" This, then, was said by him.</p>
          <p>27. In the mean time, and when the defeat had occurred at <lb/>
            1 hermopylæ, the Thessalians immediately sent a herald to the <lb/>
            hocians, as they had always1 entertained a grudge against <lb/>
            t em, and particularly since their last defeat. For not many <lb/>
            y irs before this expedition of the king, the Thessalians them­ <lb/>
            a ves and their allies, having invaded the territories of the <lb/>
            Hocians with all their forces, had been worsted by the Pho­ <lb/>
            c ns and roughly handled. For when the Phocians had been <lb/>
            s it up in Mount Parnassus, having with them the Elean <lb/>
            p ophet Tellias, this Tellias thereupon devised the following <lb/>
            a atagem for them. Having smeared over with chalk six <lb/>
            hndred of the bravest Phocians, both the men themselves <lb/>
            a I their armour, he attacked the Thessalians by night, having <lb/>
            olered them to kill every man they should see not covered <note type="footnote"> 1 See B. VII. chap. 176. </note> <pb n="502"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[28—31."/> <lb/>
            with white. The sentinels of the Thessalians, accordingly, <lb/>
            seeing them first, were terrified, supposing it was some strange <lb/>
            prodigy, and after the sentinels, the whole army, so that the <lb/>
            Phocians got possession of four thousand dead and shields; <lb/>
            of these they dedicated one half at Abæ, and the other at <lb/>
            Delphi. The tenth of the treasures taken in this battle com­ <lb/>
            posed those great statues which stand about the tripod in the <lb/>
            front of the temple at Delphi, and others like them were dedi­ <lb/>
            cated at Abæ. 28. Thus the Phocians dealt with the infantry <lb/>
            of the Thessalians, who were besieging them; and they in­ <lb/>
            flicted an irreparable blow on their cavalry, when they made <lb/>
            an irruption into their territory; for in the entrance which is <lb/>
            near Hyampolis, having dug a large pit, they put empty jars <lb/>
            in it, and having heaped soil over and made it like the rest of <lb/>
            the ground, they waited the attack of the Thessalians; but <lb/>
            they, hoping to overwhelm the Phocians, being borne violently <lb/>
            on, fell among the jars, whereupon the horses had their legs <lb/>
            broken. 29. The Thessalians, bearing a grudge against them <lb/>
            for these two things, sent a herald and made the following <lb/>
            announcement: " 0 Phocians, now at length learn better, and <lb/>
            know that you are not equal to us. For both before among <lb/>
            the Greeks, as long as that party pleased us, we always proved <lb/>
            superior to you; and now, we have so great influence with <lb/>
            the barbarian, that it is in our power to deprive you of your <lb/>
            country; and, moreover, to reduce you to slavery. We, how­ <lb/>
            ever, though possessing full power, are not mindful of injuries; <lb/>
            therefore, let fifty talents of silver be given us by way of re­ <lb/>
            paration, and we promise you to avert the evils that impend <lb/>
            over your country."</p>
          <p>30. The Thessalians sent them this message. For the <lb/>
            Phocians were the only people of those parts who did not <lb/>
            side with the Mede; for no other reason, as I conjecture, <lb/>
            than their hatred of the Thessalians; but if the Thessalians <lb/>
            had taken part with the Greeks, in my opinion the Phocians <lb/>
            would have sided with the Mede. When the Thessalians sent <lb/>
            this message, they said they would not give money, and that <lb/>
            it was in their power to join the Mede as well as the Thes­ <lb/>
            salians, if only they chose to do so; but that they would not <lb/>
            willingly be traitors to Greece. 31. When this answer was <lb/>
            brought back, the Thessalians thereapon, being incensed with <lb/>
            the Phocians, became guides to the barbarian; and, accord- <pb n="503"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="32—35.] "/>ingly, they entered from Trachinia into Dons. For a narrow <lb/>
            strip of Doric territory extends that way, about thirty stades <lb/>
            in breadth, and situate between the Malian and Phocian terri­ <lb/>
            tory, and which was anciently Dryopis. This region is the <lb/>
            mother country of the Dorians in Peloponnesus. The bar­ <lb/>
            barians, in their passage through, did not ravage this Doric <lb/>
            territory; for the inhabitants sided with the Mede, and the <lb/>
            Thessalians wished them not to do so. 32. When they <lb/>
            entered from the Doric to the Phocian territory, they did not <lb/>
            take the Phocians themselves, for some of the Phocians had <lb/>
            ascended to the heights of Parnassus ; and the summit of Par­ <lb/>
            nassus lying near the city of Neon, which stands apart, is will <lb/>
            adapted to receive a multitude ; its name is Tithorea ; to this, <lb/>
            then, they carried their property, and ascended themselves : <lb/>
            but the greater number of them had conveyed their effects to <lb/>
            the Locrian Ozolæ, to the city of Amphissa, which is situate <lb/>
            on the Crisæan plain. But the barbarians overran the whole <lb/>
            Phocian territory. 33. For marching this way along the <lb/>
            river Cephissus, they ravaged the whole country, and burnt <lb/>
            down the cities of Drymus, Charadra, Erochus, Tethronium, <lb/>
            Amphicæa, Neon, Pedieæ, Triteæ, Elatea, Hyampolis, Parapo­ <lb/>
            tamil, and Abæ ; where was a rich temple of Apollo, adorned <lb/>
            with many treasures and offerings, and there was then, and <lb/>
            still is, an oracle there; this temple they plundered and burnt; <lb/>
            and pursuing some of the Phocians, they took them near the <lb/>
            mountains; and they caused the death of some women, by <lb/>
            having intercourse with them in great numbers. 34. The <lb/>
            barbarians having passed by Parapotamii, arrived at Pano­ <lb/>
            peæ, and from thence, their army being divided, proceeded in <lb/>
            two bodies. The largest and most powerful part of the army <lb/>
            marching with Xerxes himself towards Athens, entered Bœo­ <lb/>
            tia, at the territory of the Orchomenians. But the Bœotians <lb/>
            sided with the Mede ; Macedonian soldiers therefore posted in <lb/>
            different places, having been sent by Alexander,' saved their <lb/>
            cities ; and they saved them in order by this means to make <lb/>
            it known to Xerxes that the Boeotians favoured the cause of <lb/>
            the Medea. These barbarians, then, took this route.</p>
          <p>35. The rest of them, having guides, proceeded towards <lb/>
            the temple of Delphi, keeping Parnassus on their right: and <lb/>
            whatever parts of Phocis they came to, they pillaged; for they <lb/>
            set fire to the city of the Panopians, and of the Daulians, and <pb n="504"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[36-38,"/> <lb/>
            the Æolidæ They marched this way detached from the <lb/>
            rest of the army for this reason, that having plundered the <lb/>
            temple at Delphi, they might present the treasures to king <lb/>
            Xerxes. But Xerxes, as I am informed, knew every thing <lb/>
            that was of value in the temple better than what he had left <lb/>
            at home, many persons continually telling him, especially of <lb/>
            the offerings of Crœsus, son of Alyattes. 36. The Delphians <lb/>
            having heard of this, fell into a great consternation ; and being <lb/>
            in a state of great terror, consulted the oracle respecting the <lb/>
            sacred treasures, whether they should hide them under ground, <lb/>
            or transport them to another country. But the god would <lb/>
            not suffer them to be moved; saying, " that he was able to <lb/>
            protect his own." The Delphians having received this answer, <lb/>
            began to think of themselves: accordingly they sent their <lb/>
            children and wives across to Achaia; and the greater part of <lb/>
            the men ascended to the tops of Parnassus, and carried their <lb/>
            effects into the Corycian cavern ; whilst others withdrew to <lb/>
            the Locrian Amphissa. Thus all the Delphians abandoned the <lb/>
            city, except only sixty men, and the prophet. 37. When the <lb/>
            barbarians were advanced hear, and saw the temple in the <lb/>
            distance, then the prophet, whose name was Aceratus, saw the <lb/>
            sacred arms, which it was not lawful for any mortal to touch, <lb/>
            lying before the temple, having been brought out from within <lb/>
            the fane. He therefore went to make known the prodigy to <lb/>
            the Delphians who were at hand. But when the barbarians, <lb/>
            hastening their march, were near the temple of Minerva Pro­ <lb/>
            næa prodigies still greater than the former succeeded. And <lb/>
            this indeed is a great wonder, that warlike instruments should <lb/>
            be seen, self-moved, lying before the temple, yet the second <lb/>
            prodigies, which succeeded after this, are worthy of admira­ <lb/>
            tion beyond all other portents. For when the barbarians had <lb/>
            advanced near the temple of Minerva Pronæa, at that moment <lb/>
            thunder fell on them from heaven, and two crags, broken away <lb/>
            from Parnassus, bore down upon them with a loud crash, and <lb/>
            killed many of them, and a loud cry and a war-shout issued <lb/>
            from the temple of the Pronæa. 38. All these things being <lb/>
            commingled together, a panic struck the barbarians ; and the <lb/>
            Delphians, having learnt that they had fled, came down after <lb/>
            them, and slew a great number of them: the survivors fled <lb/>
            direct into Boeotia. Those of the barbarians who returned, as I <lb/>
            am informed, declared, that besides these they saw other mira- <pb n="505"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="39—41.]"/> <lb/>
            culous things, for that two heavy-armed men, of more than <lb/>
            human stature, followed them, slaying and pursuing them. <lb/>
            39. The Delphians say these two were heroes of the country <lb/>
            Phylacus and Autonous, whose precincts are near the temple ; <lb/>
            that of Phylacus by the road-side, above the temple of the Pro­ <lb/>
            naea ; and that of Autonous, near the Castalian spring under <lb/>
            the Hyampeian summit. The rocks that fell from Parnassus <lb/>
            were still preserved in my time, lying in the enclosure of <lb/>
            Minerva Pronæa, where they fell when borne among the barba­ <lb/>
            rians. Such, then, was the retreat of these men from the temple.</p>
          <p>40. The Grecian fleet from Artemisium, at the request of <lb/>
            the Athenians, put in at Salamis. For this reason the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians requested them to direct their course to Salamis, that <lb/>
            they might remove their children and wives out of Attica, and <lb/>
            moreover might consult of what measures were to be taken. <lb/>
            For in the present posture of affairs they intended to hold a <lb/>
            consultation, as they had been disappointed in their expecta­ <lb/>
            tion. For whereas they expected to find the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            with all their forces waiting in Bœotia to receive the barba­ <lb/>
            rian, they found nothing of the kind ; but were informed that <lb/>
            they were fortifying the isthmus leading into the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus, considering it of the greatest importance that it should <lb/>
            be saved, and that, keeping guard there, they gave up all the <lb/>
            rest. Having been informed of this, they therefore entreated <lb/>
            them to direct their course to Salamis. 41. The rest there­ <lb/>
            fore held on to Salamis, but the Athenians to their own coun­ <lb/>
            try ; and on their arrival they caused proclamation to be <lb/>
            made, " that every one should save his children and family by <lb/>
            the best means he could." Thereupon the greatest part sent <lb/>
            away their families to Trœzene, some to Ægina, and others to <lb/>
            Salamis. They used all diligence to remove them to a place <lb/>
            of safety, both from a desire to obey the oracle, and more <lb/>
            particularly for the following reason : the Athenians say, that <lb/>
            a large serpent used to live in the temple as a guard to the <lb/>
            Acropolis; they both say this, and, as if it were really there, <lb/>
            they do it honour by placing before it its monthly food; the <lb/>
            monthly food consists of a honey-cake: this honey-cake having <lb/>
            been in former time always consumed, now remained untouch­ <lb/>
            ed. When the priestess made this known, the Athenians <lb/>
            with more readiness abandoned the city, since even the god­ <lb/>
            dess had forsaken the Acropolis. As soon as every thing had <pb n="506"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[42-46."/> <lb/>
            been deposited in a place of safety, they sailed to the encamp­ <lb/>
            ment. 42. When those from Artemisium stationed their ships <lb/>
            at Salamis, the rest of the naval forces of the Greeks being <lb/>
            informed of this joined them from Trcezene ; for they had <lb/>
            been ordered to assemble at Pogon, a harbour of the Trœze­ <lb/>
            nians. Many more ships were assembled together than had <lb/>
            fought at Artemisium, and from a greater number of cities. <lb/>
            The same admiral commanded them as at Artemisium, Eury­ <lb/>
            biades, son of Euryclides, a Spartan, though he was not of <lb/>
            the royal family: the Athenians, however, furnished by far <lb/>
            the most and the best sailing ships.</p>
          <p>43. The following joined the fleet. From the Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, furnishing sixteen ships ; the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, furnishing the same number as at Artemisium ; the Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians furnished fifteen ships ; the Epidaurians, ten ; the <lb/>
            Trœzenians, five ; and the Hermionians, three ; all these, ex­ <lb/>
            cept the Hermionians, being of Doric and Macednic extraction, <lb/>
            having come from Erineum, and Pindus, and last of all from <lb/>
            Dryopis. The Hermionians are Dryopians, driven out by <lb/>
            Hercules and the Malians, from the country now called Doris. <lb/>
            These, then, of the Peloponnesians served, in the fleet. 44. <lb/>
            The following were from the outer continent: the Athenians, be­ <lb/>
            yond all the rest, alone furnished one hundred and eighty ships ; <lb/>
            for at Salamis the Platæans did not join their forces to the <lb/>
            Athenians, on account of the following circumstance. When <lb/>
            the Greeks retired from Artemisium, and were off Chalcis, the <lb/>
            Platæans, having landed on the opposite coast in Bœotia, set <lb/>
            about carrying away their families: they, therefore, while <lb/>
            saving them, were left behind. The Athenians, when the <lb/>
            Pelasgians possessed that which is now called Greece, were <lb/>
            Pelasgians, and went by the name of Cranai: under the <lb/>
            reign of Cecrops, they were surnamed Cecropidæ ; but when <lb/>
            Erectheus succeeded to the government, they changed their <lb/>
            name for that of Athenians ; and when Ion, son of Xuthus, be­ <lb/>
            came their leader, from him they were called Ionians. 45. <lb/>
            The Megarenes furnished the same complement as at Arte­ <lb/>
            sium ; the Ambraciots assisted with seven ships ; and the <lb/>
            Leucadians, three, these are of Doric extraction, from Corinth. <lb/>
            46. Of the islanders, the Æginetæ furnished thirty ships ; <lb/>
            they bad also other ships ready manned, but with some they <lb/>
            untry, and with thirty the best sailing <pb n="507"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="47—49.] "/>vessels, they fought at Salamis. The Æginetæ are Dorians, <lb/>
            from Epidaurus, and their island formerly had the name of <lb/>
            Œnone. Next to the Æginetæ, the Chalcidians furnished the <lb/>
            same twenty as at Artemisium, and the Eretrians the same <lb/>
            seven: these are Ionians. Next, the Ceians furnished the <lb/>
            same; they are of Ionian extraction, from Athens. The <lb/>
            Naxians furnished four; though they had been sent by their <lb/>
            fellow-citizens to join the Medes, like the rest of the island­ <lb/>
            ers; but disregarding their orders, they went over to the <lb/>
            Greeks, at the instigation of Democritus, a man eminent <lb/>
            amongst the citizens, and then commander of a trireme. The <lb/>
            Naxians also are Ionians, sprung from Athens. The Styreans <lb/>
            furnished the same ships as at Artemisium; the Cythnians <lb/>
            one, and a penteconter: both these people are Dryopians. <lb/>
            The Seriphians, the Siphnians, and the Malians also joined <lb/>
            the fleet; for they only of the islanders refused to give earth <lb/>
            and water to the barbarian. 47. All these nations, situate on <lb/>
            this side the Thesprotians and the river Acheron, joined the <lb/>
            fleet; for the Thesprotians border on the Ampraciots and <lb/>
            Leucadians, who joined the fleet from the most distant coun­ <lb/>
            tries. Of those that dwell beyond them, the Crotoniatæ were <lb/>
            the only people who came to assist Greece in this time of <lb/>
            danger, with one ship, which Phayllus, who had thrice been <lb/>
            victorious in the Pythian games, commanded. The Crotoniatæ <lb/>
            are Achæans by extraction. 48. Now the rest joined the <lb/>
            fleet, furnishing triremes; but the Malians, Siphnians, and <lb/>
            Seriphians, penteconters. The Malians, who are by extrac­ <lb/>
            tion from Lacedæmon, furnished two; the Siphnians and the <lb/>
            Seriphians, who are Ionians from Athens, one each. So that <lb/>
            the whole number of ships, besides the penteconters, amounted <lb/>
            to three hundred and seventy-eight.</p>
          <p>49. When the leaders from the above-mentioned cities met <lb/>
            together at Salamis, they held a council, in which Eurybiades <lb/>
            proposed that any one who chose should deliver his opinion, <lb/>
            where he thought it would be most advantageous to come to <lb/>
            an engagement by sea, of all the places of which they were <lb/>
            still in possession: for Attica was already given up, and he <lb/>
            made this proposition concerning the rest. Most of the opin­ <lb/>
            ions of those who spoke coincided, that they should sail to the <lb/>
            Isthmus, and fight before Peloponnesus; alleging this reason, <lb/>
            that if they should be conquered by sea while they were at <pb n="508"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[50-53."/> <lb/>
            Salamis, they should be besieged in the island, where no sue­ <lb/>
            cour could reach them; but if at the Isthmus, they might <lb/>
            escape to their own cities.</p>
          <p>50. While the commanders from Peloponnesus were debat­ <lb/>
            ing these matters, an Athenian arrived with intelligence, that <lb/>
            the barbarian had entered Attica, and was devastating the <lb/>
            whole of it by fire. For the army with Xerxes, having taken <lb/>
            its route through Boeotia, after having burnt the city of the <lb/>
            Thespians, who had departed to Peloponnesus, and likewise <lb/>
            the city of the Platæans, had arrived at Athens, and was lay­ <lb/>
            ing waste every part of it. They set fire to Thespia and <lb/>
            Platæa, being informed by the Thebans that they were not on <lb/>
            the side of the Modes. 51. From the passage over the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, thence the barbarians began to march, having spent one <lb/>
            month there, including the time they were crossing over into <lb/>
            Europe; in three months more they were in Attica, when <lb/>
            Calliades was archon of the Athenians. They took the city, <lb/>
            deserted of inhabitants, but found some few of the Athenians <lb/>
            in the temple, with the treasurers of the temple, and some <lb/>
            poor people; who, having fortified the Acropolis with planks <lb/>
            and stakes, tried to keep off the invaders: they had not with­ <lb/>
            drawn to Salamis, partly through want of means, and more­ <lb/>
            over they thought they had found out the meaning of the <lb/>
            oracle which the Pythian delivered to them, that the wooden <lb/>
            wall should be impregnable;” imagining, that this was the <lb/>
            refuge according to the oracle, and not the ships. 52. The <lb/>
            Persians, posting themselves on the hill opposite the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis, which the Athenians call the Areopagus, besieged them <lb/>
            in the following manner : when they had wrapped tow round <lb/>
            their arrows, and set fire to it, they shot them at the fence. <lb/>
            Thereupon those Athenians who were besieged, still defended <lb/>
            themselves, though driven to the last extremity, and the fence <lb/>
            had failed them ; nor, when the Pisistratidæ proposed them, <lb/>
            would they listen to terms of capitulation ; but still defending <lb/>
            themselves, they both contrived other means of defence, and <lb/>
            when the barbarians approached the gates, they hurled down <lb/>
            large round stones ; so that Xerxes was for a long time kept <lb/>
            in perplexity, not being able to capture them. 53. At length, <lb/>
            in the midst of these difficulties, an entrance was discovered <lb/>
            by the barbarians; for it was necessary, according to the ora­ <lb/>
            cle, that all Attica, on the continent, should be subdued by the <pb n="509"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="54—57.]"/> <lb/>
            Persians. In front of the Acropolis, then, but behind the gates <lb/>
            and the road up, where neither any one kept guard, nor would <lb/>
            ever have expected that any man would ascend that way, there <lb/>
            some of them ascended near the temple of Cecrops' daughter <lb/>
            Aglauros, although the place was precipitous. When the <lb/>
            Athenians saw that they had ascended to the Acropolis, some <lb/>
            threw themselves down from the wall and perished, and <lb/>
            others took refuge in the recess of the temple. But the Per­ <lb/>
            sians who had ascended first turned to the gates, and having <lb/>
            opened them, put the suppliants to death: and when all were <lb/>
            thrown prostrate, having pillaged the temple, they set fire to <lb/>
            the whole Acropolis.</p>
          <p>54. Xerxes having entire possession of Athens, despatched <lb/>
            a messenger on horseback to Susa, to announce to Artabanus <lb/>
            his present success. And on the second day after the despatch <lb/>
            of the herald, having summoned the exiled Athenians who at­ <lb/>
            tended him, he ordered them to offer sacrifices after their own <lb/>
            manner, having ascended to the Acropolis ; whether he gave <lb/>
            this order from having seen a vision in a dream, or a religious <lb/>
            scruple came upon him for having set fire to the temple. The <lb/>
            exiles of the Athenians performed what was commanded. 55. <lb/>
            Why I have recorded these things, I will now mention. There <lb/>
            is in this Acropolis a shrine of Erectheus, who is said to be <lb/>
            earth-born: in this is an olive-tree and a sea; which, as the <lb/>
            story goes among the Athenians, Neptune and Minerva, when <lb/>
            contending for the country, placed there as testimonies. Now <lb/>
            it happened that this olive-tree was burnt by the barbarians <lb/>
            with the rest of the temple; but on the second day after the <lb/>
            burning, the Athenians who were ordered by the king to sacrifice, <lb/>
            when they went up to the temple, saw a shoot from the stump, <lb/>
            sprung up to the height of a cubit. This they affirmed.</p>
          <p>56. The Greeks at Salamis, when intelligence was brought <lb/>
            them how matters were with respect to the Acropolis of the <lb/>
            Athenians, were thrown into such consternation, that some of <lb/>
            the generals would not wait until the subject before them was <lb/>
            decided on, but rushed to their ships and hoisted sail, as about <lb/>
            to hurry away; by such of them as remained it was determined <lb/>
            to come to an engagement before the Isthmus. Night came <lb/>
            on, and they, being dismissed from the council, went on <lb/>
            board their ships. 57. Thereupon Mnesiphilus, an Athenian, <lb/>
            inquired of Themistocles, on his return tohis shipwhat <pb n="510"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[58—60."/> <lb/>
            been determined on by them. And being informed by him <lb/>
            that it was resolved to conduct the ships to the Isthmus, and <lb/>
            to come to an engagement before the Peloponnesus, he said, <lb/>
            " If they remove the ships from Salamis, you will no longer <lb/>
            fight for any country; for they will each betake themselves to <lb/>
            their cities ; and neither will Eurybiades nor any one else be <lb/>
            able to detain them, so that the fleet should not be dispersed ; <lb/>
            and Greece will perish through want of counsel. But, if <lb/>
            there is any possible contrivance, go and endeavour to annul <lb/>
            the decree, if by any means you can induce Eurybiades to alter <lb/>
            his determination, so as to remain here. 58. The suggestion <lb/>
            pleased Themistocles exceedingly; and without giving any <lb/>
            answer he went to the ship of Eurybiades ; and on reaching <lb/>
            it he said that he wished to confer with him on public busi­ <lb/>
            ness. He desired him to come on board his ship, and say <lb/>
            what he wished. Thereupon Themistocles, seating himself by <lb/>
            him, repeated all that he had heard from Mnesiphilus, making <lb/>
            it his own, and adding much more, until he prevailed on him, <lb/>
            by entreaty, to leave his ship, and assemble the commanders <lb/>
            in council. 59. When they were assembled, before Eurybiades <lb/>
            brought forward the subject on account of which he had con­ <lb/>
            vened the commanders, Themistocles spoke much, as being <lb/>
            very earnest; and as he was speaking, the Corinthian general, <lb/>
            Adimantus, son of Ocytus, said: " 0 Themistocles, in the <lb/>
            games those who start before the time are beaten with stripes." <lb/>
            But he, excusing himself, answered : “ But they who are left <lb/>
            behind are not crowned." 60. At that time he answered the <lb/>
            Corinthian mildly. But to Eurybiades he said not a word of <lb/>
            what he had before mentioned, that if they should remove <lb/>
            from Salamis, they would disperse themselves ; for when the <lb/>
            allies were present it would be by no means becoming in him <lb/>
            to accuse any one ; he therefore made use of another argument, <lb/>
            speaking as follows: (1.) "It rests now with you to save <lb/>
            Greece, if you will listen to me, and, remaining here, give <lb/>
            battle, and not attend to those who advise you to remove the <lb/>
            fleet to the Isthmus. For hear and compare each opinion. <lb/>
            In engaging near the Isthmus, you will fight in the open sea, <lb/>
            where it is least advantageous to us, who have heavier ships <lb/>
            and fewer in number. Besides, you will lose Salamis, and <lb/>
            Megara, and Ægina, even if we succeed in other respects: <lb/>
            for the laud-forces will follow close upon their navy ; thus <pb n="511"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="61, 62.]"/> <lb/>
            you will yourself lead them to the Peloponnesus, and expose all <lb/>
            Greece to danger. (2.) But if you should do what I advise, <lb/>
            you will find the following advantages in it. First of all, by <lb/>
            engaging in a narrow space with few ships against many, if <lb/>
            the probable results of war happen, we shall be much superior. <lb/>
            For to fight in a narrow space is advantageous to us ; but in <lb/>
            a wide space, to them. Again: Salamis is preserved, in which <lb/>
            our children and wives are deposited: Moreover, there is <lb/>
            advantage in the plan I advise, for which, too, you are very <lb/>
            anxious: by remaining here, you will fight for the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus just as much as at the Isthmus; nor, if you are wise, <lb/>
            will you lead them to the Peloponnesus. (3.) But if what I <lb/>
            hope should happen, and we conquer with our fleet, neither <lb/>
            will the barbarians come to you at the Isthmus, nor will they <lb/>
            advance farther than Attica, but will retreat in disorder, and <lb/>
            we shall gain, by saving Megara, and Ægina, and Salamis, <lb/>
            where it is announced by an oracle we shall be superior to our <lb/>
            enemies. To men who determine on what is reasonable, cor­ <lb/>
            responding results are for the most part wont to follow; but <lb/>
            to those who do not determine on what is reasonable, the deity <lb/>
            is not wont to further human designs." 61. When Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles had spoken thus, Adimantus the Corinthian again at­ <lb/>
            tacked him, bidding him who had no country be silent, and <lb/>
            urging Eurybiades not to go to the vote for a man who had <lb/>
            no city; for when Themistocles showed a city, then he would <lb/>
            allow him to give his suffrage. He threw out this against <lb/>
            him, because Athens had been taken and was in the possession <lb/>
            of the enemy. Then, at length, Themistocles spoke with much <lb/>
            severity of Adimantus and the Corinthians; and showed by <lb/>
            his speech that the Athenians themselves had a city and a <lb/>
            territory greater than they, so long as they had two hundred <lb/>
            ships fully manned; for that none of the Greeks could repel <lb/>
            their attack. 62. Having intimated this, he transferred his <lb/>
            discourse to Eurybiades, saying with greater earnestness: ".If <lb/>
            you remain here, by remaining you will show yourself a brave <lb/>
            man;—if not, you will subvert Greece: for the whole success <lb/>
            of the war depends on our fleet; therefore yield to my advice. <lb/>
            But if you will not do so, we, as we are, will take our families <lb/>
            on board and remove to Siris in Italy, which is an ancient <lb/>
            possession of ours, and oracles say it is fated to be founded <lb/>
            by us. And you, when bereft of such alliesj will remember <pb n="512"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[63-65."/> <lb/>
            my words. 63. When Themistocles had spoken thus, Eury­ <lb/>
            blades changed his opinion: in my opinion, he changed his <lb/>
            opinion chiefly from a dread of the Athenians, lest they should <lb/>
            desert them, if he took the fleet to the Isthmus. For if the <lb/>
            Athenians deserted them, the rest would no longer be a match <lb/>
            for the enemy. He, therefore, adopted this advice, to stay <lb/>
            there and come to a decisive engagement. 64. Thus they at <lb/>
            Salamis, having skirmished in words, when Eurybiades had <lb/>
            come to a determination, made preparations to come to an <lb/>
            engagement there. Day came, and at sun-rise an earthquake <lb/>
            took place on land and at sea. They determined to pray to <lb/>
            the gods, and to invoke the Æacidæ as allies; and as they <lb/>
            had determined, so they did. For having prayed to all the <lb/>
            gods, they forthwith, from Salamis, invoked Ajax and Telamon; <lb/>
            and sent a ship to Ægina for Æacus and the Æacidæ. 65. <lb/>
            Dicæus, son of Theocydes, an Athenian, and an exile at that <lb/>
            time esteemed by the Medes, related, that when the Attic <lb/>
            territory was being devastated by the land-forces of Xerxes, <lb/>
            having been deserted by the Athenians, he happened then to <lb/>
            be with Demaratus the Lacedæmonian, in the Thriasian plain; <lb/>
            and he saw a cloud of dust coming from Eleusis, as if occa­ <lb/>
            sioned by about thirty thousand men: they were wondering <lb/>
            at the cloud of dust, from whatever it might proceed, and <lb/>
            suddenly heard a voice, and the voice appeared to him to be <lb/>
            that of the mystic Iacchus. Demaratus was unacquainted <lb/>
            with the mysteries of Eleusis, and asked Dicæus what it might <lb/>
            be that was uttered; but he said: “ 0 Demaratus, it cannot <lb/>
            be otherwise than that some great damage will befal the king's <lb/>
            army. For this is clear, since Attica is deserted, that what is <lb/>
            uttered is supernatural, proceeding from Eleusis to the assist­ <lb/>
            ance of the Athenians and the allies. And if it should rush <lb/>
            towards the Peloponnesus, there will be danger to the king <lb/>
            himself and his army on the continent; but if it should turn <lb/>
            toward the ships at Salamis, the king will be in danger of <lb/>
            losing his naval armament. The Athenians celebrate this feast <lb/>
            every year to the Mother and the Damsel,2 and whoever wishes <lb/>
            of them and the other Greeks is initiated; and the sound, <lb/>
            which you hear, they shout in this very festival." To this <lb/>
            Demaratus said: " Be silent, and tell this story to no one <lb/>
            else; for if these words should be reported to the king you <note type="footnote"> I Cores and Proserpina </note> <pb n="513"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="66-68.]"/> <lb/>
            would lose your head; and neither should I nor any other <lb/>
            human being be able to save you. Keep quiet, therefore; and <lb/>
            the gods will take care of the army." He, accordingly, gave <lb/>
            this advice. But from the dust and voice there arose a cloud, <lb/>
            and being raised aloft it was borne towards Salamis, to the <lb/>
            encampment of the Greeks. Thus they understood that the <lb/>
            fleet of Xerxes was about to perish. This account Dicæus, <lb/>
            son .of Theocydes, gave, calling on Demaratus and others as <lb/>
            witnesses.</p>
          <p>66. When the men belonging to the fleet of Xerxes, having <lb/>
            viewed the Lacedæmonian loss, crossed over from Tracbis to <lb/>
            Histiæa, they remained there three days, and then sailed <lb/>
            through the Euripus, and in three days more arrived off <lb/>
            Phalerus. In my opinion, they were not fewer in number <lb/>
            when they entered Athens, as well those that came by the <lb/>
            continent as those in the ships, than when they arrived at <lb/>
            Sepias and at Thermopylae For I set off against those that <lb/>
            perished by the storm, and at Thermopylae, and at the sea- <lb/>
            fight at Artemisium, the following who at that time did not <lb/>
            attend the king: the Malians, Dorians, Locrians, and Bœoti­ <lb/>
            ans, who attended with all their forces, except the Thespians <lb/>
            and Platæans; and besides, the Carystians, Andrians, Tenians, <lb/>
            and all the rest of the islanders, except the five cities whose <lb/>
            names I have before mentioned: for the farther the Persian <lb/>
            advanced into the interior of Greece, a greater number of <lb/>
            rations attended him. 67. When, therefore, all these, except <lb/>
            the Parians, arrived at Athens, the Parians, being left behind <lb/>
            at Cythnus, watched the war, in what way it would turn out; <lb/>
            when, however, the rest arrived at Phalerus, then Xerxes <lb/>
            himself went down to the ships, wishing to mix with them, <lb/>
            and to learn the opinions of those on board. When he had <lb/>
            arrived and taken the first seat, the tyrants and admirals of <lb/>
            the several nations, being summoned from their ships, came, <lb/>
            and seated themselves according as the king had given pre­ <lb/>
            cedence to each: first, the Sidonian king ; next, the Tyrian; <lb/>
            and then the others. When they had seated themselves in <lb/>
            due order, Xerxes, having sent Mardonius, asked, in order to <lb/>
            make trial of the disposition of each, whether he should come <lb/>
            to an engagement by sea. 68. When Mardonius, going round, <lb/>
            asked the question, beginning from the Sidonian, all the others <lb/>
            gave an opinion to the same effect, advising that battle should <note type="footnote"> 2 L </note> <pb n="514"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[69."/> <lb/>
            be given, but Artemisia spoke as follows: “ Tell the king from <lb/>
            me, Mardonius, that I say this. It is right that I, sire, who <lb/>
            proved myself by no means a coward in the sea-fight ofl <lb/>
            Eubœa, and performed achievements not inferior to others, <lb/>
            should declare my real opinion, and state what I think best <lb/>
            for your interest. Therefore I say this, abstain from using <lb/>
            your ships, nor risk a sea-fight; for these men are as much <lb/>
            superior to your men by sea, as men are to women. And <lb/>
            why must you run a risk by a naval engagement ? Have you <lb/>
            not possession of Athens, for the sake of which you undertook <lb/>
            this expedition, and have you not the rest of Greece ? No <lb/>
            one stands in your way; and those who still held out against <lb/>
            you, have fared as they deserved. (2.) In what way the affairs <lb/>
            of your enemies will turn out, I will now say. If you should <lb/>
            not hasten to engage in a sea-fight, but keep your fleet here, <lb/>
            remaining near land, or even advancing to the Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            you will easily effect what you came purposing to do. For <lb/>
            the Greeks will not be able to hold out long against you; but <lb/>
            you will disperse them, and they will respectively fly to their <lb/>
            cities. For neither have they provisions in this island, as I <lb/>
            am informed, nor is it probable, if you march your land-forces <lb/>
            against the Peloponnesus, that those of them who came from <lb/>
            thence, will remain quiet; nor will they care to fight by sea <lb/>
            for the Athenians. (3.) But if you should hasten forthwith <lb/>
            to engage, I fear lest the sea-forces, being worsted, should at <lb/>
            the same time bring ruin on the land-forces. Besides, 0 king, <lb/>
            consider this, that the good among men commonly have bad <lb/>
            slaves, and the bad ones, good; and you, who are the best of <lb/>
            all men, have bad slaves, who are said to be in the number <lb/>
            of allies, such as the Egyptians, Cyprians, Cilicians, and <lb/>
            Pamphylians, who are of no use at all." 69. When she said <lb/>
            this to Mardonius, such as were well affected to Artemisia <lb/>
            were grieved at her words, thinking she would suffer some <lb/>
            harm at the king's hand, because she dissuaded him from <lb/>
            giving battle by sea : but those who hated and envied her, as <lb/>
            being honoured above all the allies, were delighted with her deci­ <lb/>
            sion, thinking she would be ruined. When, however, the opinions <lb/>
            were reported to Xerxes, he was very much pleased with the <lb/>
            opinion of Artemisia ; and having before thought her an ad­ <lb/>
            mirable woman, he then praised her much more. However, he <lb/>
            gave orders to follow the advice of the majority in this matter <pb n="515"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="70—73.]"/> <lb/>
            thinking that they had behaved ill at Euboea on purpose, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was not present; he now prepared in person to behold <lb/>
            them engaging by sea.</p>
          <p>70. When they gave the signal for putting to sea, they got <lb/>
            the ships under weigh for Salamis, and drew up near it, tak­ <lb/>
            ing their stations in silence : at that time, however, there was <lb/>
            not day enough for them to enter on a naval engagement; for <lb/>
            night was coming on, they therefore held themselves in readi­ <lb/>
            ness for the next day. But fear and dismay took possession <lb/>
            of the Greeks, and not least those from Peloponnesus. They <lb/>
            were dismayed, because, being posted at Salamis, they were <lb/>
            about to fight for the territory of the Athenians ; and if con­ <lb/>
            quered, they would be shut up and besieged in the island, <lb/>
            having left their own country defenceless. 71. The land- <lb/>
            forces of the barbarians marched that same night against the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus ; although every possible expedient had been <lb/>
            contrived to hinder the barbarians from entering by the main <lb/>
            land. For as soon as the Peloponnesians heard that those <lb/>
            with Leonidas at Thermopylae had perished, they flocked toge­ <lb/>
            ther from the cities and stationed themselves at the Isthmus ; <lb/>
            and Cleombrotus, son of Anaxandrides, and brother of Leo­ <lb/>
            nidas, commanded them. Having stationed themselves there­ <lb/>
            fore at the Isthmus, and having blocked up the Scironian way, <lb/>
            they then, as they determined on consultation, built a wall <lb/>
            across the Isthmus. As they were many myriads in number, <lb/>
            and every man laboured, the work progressed rapidly ; for <lb/>
            stones, bricks, timber, and baskets full of sand were brought <lb/>
            to it, and those who assisted flagged not a moment in their <lb/>
            work, either by night or by day. 72. Those who assisted at the <lb/>
            Isthmus with all their forces, were the following of the Greeks; <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and all the Arcadians, the Eleans, Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians, Sicyonians, Epidaurians, Phliasians, Trœzenians, and <lb/>
            Hermionians. These were they who assisted, and were very <lb/>
            much alarmed at the dangerous situation of Greece : but the <lb/>
            rest of the Peloponnesians did not concern themselves about it; <lb/>
            however, the Olympian and. Carnian festivals were now past. <lb/>
            73. Seven nations inhabit the Peloponnesus: of these, two, <lb/>
            being indigenous, are now seated in the same country in which <lb/>
            they originally dwelt, the Arcadians and Cynurians. One <lb/>
            nation, the Achæans, never removed from the Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            though they did from their own territory, and now occupy <note type="footnote">2L2 </note> <pb n="516"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[74, 75."/> <lb/>
            another. The remaining four nations of the seven are foreign, <lb/>
            Dorians, Ætolians, Dryopians, and Lemnians. The Dorians <lb/>
            have many and celebrated cities ; the Ætolians, only Elis: <lb/>
            the Dryopians, Hermione and Asine, situate near Cardamyle <lb/>
            of Laconia ; the Lemnians have all the Paroreatæ. The Cy­ <lb/>
            nurians, who are indigenous, are the only people that appear <lb/>
            to be Ionians; but they have become Dorians by being <lb/>
            governed by the Argives, and through lapse of time, being <lb/>
            Orneatæ3 and neighbouring inhabitants. Of these seven na­ <lb/>
            tions, the remaining cities, except those I have enumerated, <lb/>
            remained neutral; or, if I may speak freely, by remaining <lb/>
            neutral, favoured the Mede.</p>
          <p>74. Those at the Isthmus, then, persevered with such zeal, <lb/>
            as having now to contend for their all, and as they did not <lb/>
            expect to distinguish themselves by their fleet; meanwhile, <lb/>
            those at Salamis, having heard of these things, were alarmed, <lb/>
            not fearing so much for themselves as for the Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            For some time one man standing by another began to talk in <lb/>
            secret, wondering at the imprudence of Eurybiades; till at last <lb/>
            their discontent broke out openly, and a council was called, <lb/>
            and much was said on the same subject. Some said, that <lb/>
            they ought to sail for the Peloponnesus, and hazard a battle <lb/>
            for that, and not stay and fight for a place already taken by <lb/>
            the enemy; but the Athenians, Æginetæ, and Megareans, <lb/>
            that they should stay there and defend themselves. 75. There­ <lb/>
            upon, Themistocles, when he saw his opinion was overruled <lb/>
            by the Peloponnesians, went secretly out of the council; and <lb/>
            having gone out, he despatched a man in a boat to the encamp­ <lb/>
            ment of the Medes, having instructed him what to say: his <lb/>
            name was Sicinnus ; and he was a domestic, and preceptor to <lb/>
            the children of Themistocles; him, after these events, The­ <lb/>
            mistocles got made a Thespian, when the Thespians augment­ <lb/>
            ed the number of their citizens, and gave him a competent <lb/>
            fortune. He, then, arriving in the boat, spoke as follows to <lb/>
            thegenerals of the barbarians : “ The general of the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans has sent me unknown to the rest of the Greeks, (for he <lb/>
            is in the interest of the king, and wishes that your affairs <note type="footnote"> a Biehr takes the word Orneatæ to describe people who were trans- <lb/>
            planted from a distance, and made to dwell near Argos. One advantage <lb/>
            in following his interpretation is, that it obviates the necessity of altering </note> <pb n="517"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="76, 77.]"/> <lb/>
            may prosper, rather than those of the Greeks,) to inform you, <lb/>
            that the Greeks in great consternation are deliberating en <lb/>
            flight; and you have now an opportunity of achieving the <lb/>
            most glorious of all enterprises, if you do not suffer them to <lb/>
            escape. For they do not agree among themselves, nor will <lb/>
            they oppose you ; but you will see those who are in your in­ <lb/>
            terest, and those who are not, fighting with one another." He <lb/>
            having delivered this message to them, immediately departed. <lb/>
            76. As these tidings appeared to them worthy of credit, in the <lb/>
            first place, they landed a considerable number of Persians on <lb/>
            the little island of Psyttalea, lying between Salamis and the <lb/>
            continent; and, in the next place, when it was midnight, they <lb/>
            got their western wing under weigh, drawing it in a circle <lb/>
            towards Salamis, and those who were stationed about Ceos and <lb/>
            Cynosura got under weigh and occupied the whole passage as <lb/>
            far as Munychia, with their ships. And for this reason they <lb/>
            got their ships under weigh, that the Greeks might have no <lb/>
            way to escape, but being shut up in Salamis, might suffer <lb/>
            punishment for the conflicts at Artemisium ; and they landed <lb/>
            the Persians at the little island of Psyttalea for this reason, <lb/>
            that, when an engagement should take place, as they expected <lb/>
            most part of the men and wrecks would be driven thither, <lb/>
            (for that island lay in the strait where the engagement was <lb/>
            likely to take place,) they might save the one party, and destroy <lb/>
            the other. But these things they did in silence, that the enemy <lb/>
            might not know what was going on. They therefore made <lb/>
            these preparations by night, without taking any rest.</p>
          <p>77. I am unable to speak against the oracles as not being <lb/>
            true, nor wish to impugn the authority of those that speak <lb/>
            clearly, when I look on such occurrences as the following. <lb/>
            " When they shall bridge with ships the sacred shore of Diana <lb/>
            with the golden sword, and sea-girt Cynosura, having with <lb/>
            mad hope destroyed beautiful Athens, then divine Vengeance <lb/>
            shall quench strong Presumption, son of Insolence, when <lb/>
            thinking to subvert all things. For brass shall engage with <lb/>
            brass, and Mars shall redden the sea with blood. Then the <lb/>
            far-thundering son of Saturn and benign victory shall bring <lb/>
            a day of freedom to Greece." Looking on such occurrences, <lb/>
            and regarding Bads, who spoke thus clearly, I neither dare <lb/>
            myself say any thing in contradiction to oracles, nor allow <lb/>
            others to do so. <pb n="518"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[78—81."/>
          <p>78. There was great altercation between the generals at <lb/>
            Salamis : and they did not yet know that the barbarians had <lb/>
            surrounded them with their ships ; but they supposed that <lb/>
            they were in the same place as they had seen them stationed <lb/>
            in during the day. 79. While the generals were disput­ <lb/>
            ing, Aristides, son of Lysimachus, crossed over from Ægina ; <lb/>
            be was an Athenian, but had been banished by ostracism: <lb/>
            having heard of his manner of life, I consider him to have <lb/>
            been the best and most upright man in Athens. This per­ <lb/>
            son, standing at the entrance of the council, called Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles out, who was not indeed his friend, but his most <lb/>
            bitter enemy; yet, from the greatness of the impending <lb/>
            danger, he forgot that, and called him, wishing to confer <lb/>
            with him ; for he had already heard that those from Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus were anxious to get the ships under weigh for the Isth­ <lb/>
            mus. When Themistocles came out to him, Aristides spoke <lb/>
            as follows : " It is right that we should strive, both on other <lb/>
            occasions, and particularly on this, which of us shall do the <lb/>
            greatest service to our country. I assure you, that to say <lb/>
            little or much to the Peloponnesians about sailing from hence, <lb/>
            is the same thing; for I, an eye-witness, tell you, now, even <lb/>
            if they would, neither the Corinthians, nor Eurybiades him­ <lb/>
            self, will be able to sail away; for we are on all sides enclosed <lb/>
            by the enemy. Go in therefore, and acquaint them with <lb/>
            this." 80. He answered as follows: " You both give <lb/>
            very useful advice, and have brought good news; for you are <lb/>
            come yourself as an eye-witness of what I wished should <lb/>
            happen. Know, then, that what has been done by the Modes, <lb/>
            proceeds from me. For it was necessary, since the Greeks <lb/>
            would not willingly come to an engagement, that they should <lb/>
            be compelled to it against their will. But do you, since you <lb/>
            come bringing good news, announce it to them yourself, for if <lb/>
            I tell them, I shall appear to speak from my own invention, <lb/>
            and shall not persuade them, as if the barbarians were doing <lb/>
            no such thing. But do you go in, and inform them how the <lb/>
            case is : and when you have informed them, if they are per­ <lb/>
            suaded, so much the better ; but if they attach no credit to <lb/>
            what you say, it will be the same to us: for they can no <lb/>
            longer escape by flight, if, as you say, we are surrounded on <lb/>
            all sides." 81. Aristides, going in, gave this account, saving <lb/>
            that he came from Ægina, and with difficulty sailed through <pb n="519"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="82-85.]"/> <lb/>
            unperceived by those that .were stationed round; for that the <lb/>
            whole Grecian fleet was surrounded by the ships of Xerxes. <lb/>
            He advised them, therefore, to prepare themselves for their <lb/>
            defence. And he, having said this, withdrew ; a dispute, how­ <lb/>
            ever, again arose, for the greater part of the generals gave <lb/>
            no credit to the report. 82. While they were still in doubt, <lb/>
            there arrived a trireme of Tenians that had deserted, which <lb/>
            Panætius, son of Socimenes, commanded, and which brought <lb/>
            an account of the whole truth. For that action the name of <lb/>
            the Tenians was engraved on the tripod at Delphi, among <lb/>
            those who had defeated the barbarian. With this ship that <lb/>
            came over at Salamis, and with the Lemnian before, off Arte­ <lb/>
            misium,4 the Grecian fleet was made up to the full number <lb/>
            of three hundred and eighty ships; for before it wanted two <lb/>
            of that number.</p>
          <p>83. When the account given by the Tenians was credited by <lb/>
            the Greeks, they prepared for an engagement. Day dawned, <lb/>
            and when they had mustered the marines, Themistocles, above <lb/>
            all the others, harangued them most eloquently. His speech <lb/>
            was entirely taken up in contrasting better things with worse, <lb/>
            exhorting them to choose the best of all those things which <lb/>
            depended on the nature and condition of man. Having finished <lb/>
            his speech, he ordered them to go on board their ships: they <lb/>
            accordingly were going on board, when the trireme from <lb/>
            Ægina, which had gone to fetch the Æacidæ, returned. <lb/>
            Thereupon the Greeks got all their ships under weigh. 84. <lb/>
            When they were under weigh, the barbarians immediately fell <lb/>
            upon them. Now all the other Greeks began to back water <lb/>
            and made for the shore; but Aminias of Pallene, an Athenian, <lb/>
            being carried onwards, attacked a ship; and his ship becoming <lb/>
            entangled with the other, and the crew not being able to clear, <lb/>
            the rest thereupon coming to the assistance of Aminias, en­ <lb/>
            gaged. Thus the Athenians say the battle commenced; but <lb/>
            the Æginetæ affirm, that the ship which went to Ægina to <lb/>
            fetch the Æacidæ, was the first to begin. This is also said, <lb/>
            that a phantom of a woman appeared to them, and that on <lb/>
            her appearance she cheered them on, so that the whole fleet of <lb/>
            the Greeks heard her, after she had first reproached them in <lb/>
            these words: "Dastards, how long will you back .water?" <lb/>
            85. Opposite the Athenians the Phœnicians were drawn up, <note type="footnote">4 See chap 11, </note> <pb n="520"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[86, 87."/> <lb/>
            for they occupied the wing towards Eleusis and westward; <lb/>
            opposite the Lacedæmonians, the Ionians occupied the wing <lb/>
            towards the east and the Piræeus. Of these some few be­ <lb/>
            haved ill on purpose, in compliance with the injunctions of <lb/>
            Themistocles;5 but most of them, not so. I am able to <lb/>
            mention' the names of several captains of triremes who took <lb/>
            Grecian ships; but I shall make no use of them, except of <lb/>
            Theomestor, son of Androdamas, and Phylacus, son of Histi­ <lb/>
            æus, both Samians. I mention these two only for this reason, <lb/>
            because Theomestor, on account of this exploit, was made <lb/>
            tyrant of Samos by the appointment of the Persians; and <lb/>
            Phylacus was inscribed as a benefactor of the king, and a <lb/>
            large tract of land was given him. The benefactors of the <lb/>
            king are called in the Persian language, Orosangæ. Such was <lb/>
            the case with regard to these men. 86. The greater part of <lb/>
            the ships were run down at Salamis; some being destroyed <lb/>
            by the Athenians, others by the Æginetæ. For as the Greeks <lb/>
            fought in good order, in line, but the barbarians were neither <lb/>
            properly formed nor did any thing with judgment, such an <lb/>
            event as did happen, was likely to occur. However, they were <lb/>
            and proved themselves to be far braver on this day than off <lb/>
            Euboea, every one exerting himself vigorously, and dreading <lb/>
            Xerxes; for each thought that he himself was observed by <lb/>
            the king.</p>
          <p>87. As regards the rest, of some of them I am unable to <lb/>
            say with certainty how each of the barbarians or Greeks <lb/>
            fought; but with respect to Artemisia, the following incident <lb/>
            occurred, by which she obtained still greater credit with the <lb/>
            king. For when the king's forces were in great confusion, at <lb/>
            that moment the ship of Artemisia was chased by an Attic <lb/>
            bhip, and she not being able to escape, for before her were <lb/>
            other friendly ships, and her own happened to be nearest the <lb/>
            enemy, she resolved to do that, which succeeded in the at­ <lb/>
            tempt. For being pursued by the Athenian, she bore down <lb/>
            upon a friendly ship, manned by Calyndians, and with Da­ <lb/>
            masitbymus himself, king of the Calyndians, on board; whe­ <lb/>
            ther she had any quarrel with him while they were at the <lb/>
            Hellespont, I am unable to say, or whether she did it on pur­ <lb/>
            pose, or whether the ship of the Calyndians happened by chance <lb/>
            to be in her way; however, she ran it down, and sunk it, and <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Sec chap. 22, </note> <pb n="521"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="88-90.]"/> <lb/>
            by good fortune gained a double advantage to herself. For <lb/>
            the captain of the Attic ship, when he saw her bearing down <lb/>
            on a ship of the barbarians, concluding Artemisia's ship to be <lb/>
            either a Grecian, or one that had deserted from the enemy <lb/>
            and was assisting them, turned aside and attacked others. <lb/>
            88. In the first place, this was the result to her, that she <lb/>
            escaped and did not perish; and in the next, it fell out that <lb/>
            she.having done an injury, in consequence of it, became still <lb/>
            more in favour with Xerxes. For it is said, that Xerxes look­ <lb/>
            ing on observed her ship making the attack, and that some <lb/>
            near him said: " Sire, do you see Artemisia, how well she <lb/>
            fights, and has sunk one of the enemy's ships?" Whereupon <lb/>
            he asked, if it was in truth the exploit of Artemisia: they <lb/>
            answered, " that they knew the ensign of her ship perfectly <lb/>
            well;" but they thought that it was an enemy that was sunk. <lb/>
            For, as has been mentioned, other things turned out fortunately <lb/>
            for her, and this in particular, that no one of the crew of the <lb/>
            Calyndian ship was saved so as to accuse her. And it is <lb/>
            related that Xerxes said in answer to their remarks: " My <lb/>
            men have become women, and my women, men." They relate <lb/>
            that Xerxes said this.</p>
          <p>89. In this battle perished the admiral, Ariabignes, son of <lb/>
            Darius, and brother of Xerxes, and many other illustrious <lb/>
            men of the Persians and Medes, and the other allies; but only <lb/>
            some few of the Greeks: for as they knew how to swim, they <lb/>
            whose ships were destroyed, and who did not perish in actual <lb/>
            conflict, swam safe to Salamis; whereas many of the barba­ <lb/>
            rians, not knowing how to swim, perished in the sea. When <lb/>
            the foremost ships were put to flight, then the greatest num­ <lb/>
            bers were destroyed; for those who were stationed behind, <lb/>
            endeavouring to pass on with their ships to the front, that <lb/>
            they, too, might give the king some proof of their courage, <lb/>
            fell foul of their own flying ships. 90. The following event <lb/>
            also occurred in this confusion. Some Phœnicians, whose <lb/>
            ships were destroyed, going to the king, accused the Ionians, <lb/>
            that their ships had perished by their means, for that they <lb/>
            had betrayed him. It, however, turned out that the Ionian <lb/>
            captains were not put to death, but that those Phœnicians who <lb/>
            accused them, received the following reward. For while they <lb/>
            were yet speaking, a Samothracian ship bore down on an <lb/>
            Athenian ship; the Athenian was sunk, and an Ægineta <unclear/> <pb n="522"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[91, 92."/> <lb/>
            ship, coming up, sunk the ship of the Samothracians. But the <lb/>
            Samothracians being javelin-men, by hurling their javelins, <lb/>
            drove the marines from the ship that had sunk them, and <lb/>
            boarded and got possession of it. This action saved the <lb/>
            Ionians: for when Xerxes saw them perform so great an <lb/>
            exploit, he turned round to the Phœnicians, as being above <lb/>
            measure grieved, and ready to blame all, and ordered their <lb/>
            heads to be struck off, that they who had proved themselves <lb/>
            cowards, might no more accuse those who were braver. (For <lb/>
            whenever Xerxes saw any one of his own men performing a <lb/>
            gallant action in the sea-fight, being seated at the foot of the <lb/>
            mountain opposite Salamis, which is called Ægaleos, he in­ <lb/>
            quired the name of the person who did it, and his secretaries <lb/>
            wrote down the family and country of the captain of the <lb/>
            trireme.) Moreover, Ariaramnes, a Persian, who was a friend <lb/>
            to the lonians, and happened to be present, contributed to the <lb/>
            ruin of the Phœnicians. They accordingly betook themselves <lb/>
            to the Phœnicians.6</p>
          <p>91. The barbarians being turned to flight, and sailing away <lb/>
            towards Phalerus, the Æginetæ waylaying them in the strait, <lb/>
            performed actions worthy of record. For the Athenians in <lb/>
            the rout ran down both those ships that resisted and those <lb/>
            that fled; and the Æginetæ, those that sailed away from the <lb/>
            battle: so that when any escaped the Athenians, being borne <lb/>
            violently on, they fell into the hands of the Æginetæ. 92. <lb/>
            At this time there happened to meet together the ship of <lb/>
            Themistocles, giving chace to one of the enemy, and that of <lb/>
            Polycritus, son of Crius, an Æginetan, bearing down upon a <lb/>
            Sidonian ship, the same that had taken the Æginetan ship, <lb/>
            which was keeping watch off Sciathus, and on board of which <lb/>
            sailed Pytheas, son of Ischenous, whom, though covered with <lb/>
            wounds, the Persians kept in the ship from admiration of his <lb/>
            valour.7 The Sidonian ship that carried him about, was taken <lb/>
            with the Persians on board, so that Pytheas, by this means, <lb/>
            returned safe to Ægina. But when Polycritus saw the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian ship, he knew it, seeing the admiral's ensign; and shout­ <lb/>
            ing to Themistocles, he railed at him, upbraiding him with <lb/>
            the charge of Medism brought against the Æginetæ.8 Poly­ <lb/>
            critus, accordingly, as he was attacking the ship, threw out <note type="footnote"> 6 That s, " the executioners put them to death " </note><note type="footnote"> See B. VII chap. 181. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> See B. VI. chap. 49, 50 </note> <pb n="523"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="93-95.]"/> <lb/>
            these reproaches against Themistocles. But the barbarians, <lb/>
            whose ships survived, fled and arrived at Phalerus, under the <lb/>
            protection of the land-forces.</p>
          <p>93. In this engagement of the Greeks, the Æginetæ ob­ <lb/>
            tained the greatest renown ; and next, the Athenians:—of par­ <lb/>
            ticular persons, Polycritus of Ægina, and Athenians, Eumenes <lb/>
            the Anagyrasian, with Aminias a Pallenian, who gave chace <lb/>
            to Artemisia; and if he had known that Artemisia sailed in <lb/>
            that ship, he would not have given over the pursuit, till he <lb/>
            had either taken her, or been himself taken. For such had <lb/>
            been the order given to the Athenian captains; and besides, <lb/>
            a reward of ten thousand drachmas was offered to whoever <lb/>
            should take her alive; for they considered it a great indignity <lb/>
            that a woman should make war against Athens. She, how­ <lb/>
            ever, as has been before mentioned, made her escape; and <lb/>
            the others, whose ships survived, lay at Phalerus. 94. The <lb/>
            Athenians say, that Adimantus, the Corinthian admiral, im­ <lb/>
            mediately from the commencement, when the ships engaged, <lb/>
            being dismayed, and excessively frightened, hoisted sail and <lb/>
            fled; and that the Corinthians, seeing their admiral's ship <lb/>
            flying, likewise bore away; and when, in their flight, they <lb/>
            arrived off the temple of Minerva Sciras, on the coast of <lb/>
            Salamis, a light bark fell in with them by the guidance of <lb/>
            heaven ; that no one appeared to have sent it, and that it came <lb/>
            up to the Corinthians, who knew nothing relating to the fleet. <lb/>
            From this circumstance they conjectured the circumstance to <lb/>
            be divine; for that when those on board the bark neared the <lb/>
            ships, they spoke as follows: " Adimantus, having drawn off <lb/>
            your ships, you have hurried away in flight, betraying the <lb/>
            Greeks: they, however, are victorious, as far as they could <lb/>
            have desired to conquer their enemies." Having said this, as <lb/>
            Adimantus did not credit them, they again spoke as follows: <lb/>
            that " they were ready to be taken as hostages, and be put to <lb/>
            death, if the Greeks were not found to be victorious:" upon <lb/>
            which, having put about ship, he and the rest returned to the <lb/>
            fleet, when the work was done. Such a story is told of them <lb/>
            by the Athenians; the Corinthians, however, do not admit its <lb/>
            truth, but affirm that they were among the foremost in the <lb/>
            engagement; and the rest of Greece bears testimony in their <lb/>
            favour 95. Aristides, son of Lysimachus, an Athenian, of <lb/>
            whom made mention a little before as a most upright man, <pb n="524"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[96—98."/> <lb/>
            in this confusion that took place about Salamis, did as follows: <lb/>
            taking with him a considerable number of heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            who were stationed along the shore of the Salaminian terri­ <lb/>
            tory, and were Athenians by race, he landed them Dn the <lb/>
            island of Psyttalea, and they put to the sword all the Persians <lb/>
            who were on that little island.</p>
          <p>96. When the sea-fight was ended, the Greeks, having hauled <lb/>
            on shore at Salamis all the wrecks that still happened to be <lb/>
            there, held themselves ready for another battle, expecting the <lb/>
            king would still make use of the ships that survived. But a <lb/>
            west wind carrying away many of the wrecks, drove them on <lb/>
            the shore of Attica, which is called Colias, so as to fulfil both <lb/>
            all the other oracles delivered by Bacis and Musæus concern­ <lb/>
            ing this sea-fight, and also that relating to the wrecks which <lb/>
            were drifted on this shore, which many years before had been <lb/>
            delivered by Lysistratus, an Athenian augur, but had not been <lb/>
            understood by any of the Greeks : " The Colian women shall <lb/>
            broil their meat with oars."9 This was to happen after the <lb/>
            departure of the king.</p>
          <p>97. Xerxes, when he saw the defeat he had sustained, fear­ <lb/>
            ing lest some of the Ionians might suggest to the Greeks, or <lb/>
            lest they themselves might resolve to sail to the Hellespont, <lb/>
            for the purpose of breaking up the bridges, and lest he, being <lb/>
            shut up in Europe, might be in danger of perishing, meditated <lb/>
            flight. But wishing that his intention should not be known <lb/>
            either to the Greeks or his own people, he attempted to throw <lb/>
            a mound across to Salamis; and he fastened together Phoe­ <lb/>
            nician merchantmen, that they might serve instead of a raft <lb/>
            and a wall; and he made preparation for war, as if about to <lb/>
            fight another battle at sea. All the others who saw him thus <lb/>
            occupied, were firmly convinced that he had seriously deter­ <lb/>
            mined to stay and continue the war; but none of these things <lb/>
            escaped the notice of Mardonius, who was well acquainted <lb/>
            with his design. At the same time that Xerxes was doing <lb/>
            this, he despatched a messenger to the Persians, to inform <lb/>
            them of the misfortune that had befallen him. 98. There is <lb/>
            nothing mortal that reaches its destination more rapidly than <lb/>
            these couriers: it has been thus planned by the Persians. <lb/>
            They say that as many days as are occupied in the whole <lb/>
            journey, so many horses and men are posted at regular inter- <note type="footnote">9 Or, " shall shudder at the <unclear>s</unclear>." </note> <pb n="525"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="99, 100.] "/>vals, a horse and a mail being stationed at each day's journey: <lb/>
            neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor night, prevents them <lb/>
            from performing their appointed stage as quick as possible. <lb/>
            The first courier delivers his orders to the second, the second <lb/>
            to the third, and so it passes throughout, being delivered from <lb/>
            one to the other, just like the torch-bearing among the Greeks, <lb/>
            which they perform in honour of Vulcan. This mode of tra­ <lb/>
            velling by horses the Persians call angarelon. 99. The first <lb/>
            message that reached Susa, with the news that Xerxes was in <lb/>
            possession of Athens, caused so great joy among the Persians <lb/>
            who had been left behind, that they strewed all the roads with <lb/>
            myrtle, burnt perfumes, and gave themselves up to sacrifices <lb/>
            and festivity. But the second messenger arriving threw them <lb/>
            into such consternation, that they all rent their garments, and <lb/>
            uttered unbounded shouts and lamentations, laying the blame <lb/>
            on Mardonius. The Persians acted thus, not so much being <lb/>
            grieved for the ships, as fearing for Xerxes himself. And this <lb/>
            continued with the Persians during all the time that elapsed until <lb/>
            Xerxes himself arrived and stopped them front doing so.</p>
          <p>100. Mardonius, seeing Xerxes much afflicted on account <lb/>
            of the sea-fight, and suspecting he was meditating a retreat <lb/>
            from Athens, and having thought within himself, that he should <lb/>
            suffer punishment for having persuaded the king to invade <lb/>
            Greece, and that it would be better for him to incur the <lb/>
            hazard either of subduing Greece, or ending his life gloriously <lb/>
            in attempting great achievements: however, the thought of <lb/>
            subduing Greece weighed more with him; having, therefore, <lb/>
            considered these things, he thus addressed the king: " Sire, <lb/>
            do not grieve, nor think you have suffered any great loss in <lb/>
            consequence of what has happened; for the contest with us <lb/>
            does not depend on wood alone, but on men and horses. None <lb/>
            of those who imagine they have already finished the whole <lb/>
            business, will quit their ships and attempt to oppose you, nor <lb/>
            will any one from this continent; and they who have opposed <lb/>
            us, have suffered punishment. If, then, you think fit, let us <lb/>
            immediately make an attempt on Peloponnesus; or if you <lb/>
            think right to delay, you may do so. But be not discouraged; <lb/>
            for the Greeks have no means of escape from rendering an <lb/>
            account of what they have done now and formerly, and from <lb/>
            becoming your slaves. By all means, therefore, do this. If, <lb/>
            however you have determined yourself to retire and to with <pb n="526"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[101, 102"/> <lb/>
            draw the army, I have then other advice to offer. Do not <lb/>
            you, 0 king, suffer the Persians to be exposed to the derision <lb/>
            of the Greeks; for where the Persians fought,1 your affairs <lb/>
            received no damage, nor can you say that we have on any <lb/>
            occasion proved cowards. But if the Phœnicians, Egyptians, <lb/>
            Cyprians, and Cilicians, have shown themselves cowards, this <lb/>
            disaster in no respect extends to the Persians. Since, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the Persians are not to blame, yield to my advice. If <lb/>
            you have resolved not to stay here, do you return to your own <lb/>
            home, and take with you the greatest part of the army; but <lb/>
            it is right that I should deliver Greece to you reduced tc <lb/>
            slavery, having selected three hundred thousand men from the <lb/>
            army." 101. Xerxes, having heard this, was rejoiced and de­ <lb/>
            lighted, as relieved from troubles, and said to Mardonius, that <lb/>
            alter deliberation, he would give him an answer as to which <lb/>
            of these plans he would adopt. While he was deliberating <lb/>
            with his Persian counsellors, he thought fit to send for Arte­ <lb/>
            misia to the council, because she was evidently the only person <lb/>
            who before understood what ought to have been done. When <lb/>
            Artemisia arrived, Xerxes having ordered his other counsel­ <lb/>
            lors of the Persians and his guards to withdraw, spoke as <lb/>
            follows: " <unclear>lonus</unclear> advises me to stay here, and make an <lb/>
            attempt on — Peloponnesus; saying, that the Persians and <lb/>
            the land army are not at all to blame for the defeat I have <lb/>
            sustained, and wish to give me proof of it. He, therefore, <lb/>
            advises me either to do this, or wishes himself, having selected <lb/>
            three hundred thousand men from the army, to deliver Greece <lb/>
            to me reduced to slavery ; and advises me to return to my own <lb/>
            home with the rest of the army. Do you, therefore, for you <lb/>
            gave me good advice respecting the sea-fight that has taken <lb/>
            place, in dissuading me from engaging in'it, advise me now, <lb/>
            by adopting which measure I shall consult best for my inter­ <lb/>
            est." 102. Thus he asked her advice. She answered as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " 0 king, it is difficult for me to say what is best for <lb/>
            you who ask my advice. However, in the present state of <lb/>
            affairs, it appears to me that you should return home, and <lb/>
            leave Mardonius here with the troops he requires, if he wishes <lb/>
            it, and promises to effect what he says. For, on the one <lb/>
            hand, if he conquers what he says he will, and his plans should <lb/>
            succeed, the achievement, sire, will be yours, for your servants <note type="footnote"> I Literally, " among the Persians." </note> <pb n="527"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="163—106.]"/> <lb/>
            will have accomplished it. But, on the other hand, if things <lb/>
            fall out contrary to the expectation of Mardonius, it will be no <lb/>
            great misfortune, so long as you survive, and your own affairs <lb/>
            are safe at home. For whilst you survive, and your house, <lb/>
            the Greeks will have to hazard frequent struggles for them­ <lb/>
            selves. But of Mardonius, if he should suffer any reverse, no <lb/>
            account will be taken ; nor if the Greeks are victorious, will <lb/>
            they gain any great victory in destroying your slave. But you, <lb/>
            having burnt Athens, for which you undertook this expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, will return home." 103. Xerxes was pleased with her <lb/>
            advice, for she happened to say the very things that he de­ <lb/>
            signed. For even if all the men and women of the world had <lb/>
            advised him to stay, in my opinion, he would not have stayed, <lb/>
            so great was his terror. Having commended Artemisia, he <lb/>
            sent her to conduct his sons to Ephesus ; for some of his <lb/>
            natural sons had accompanied him.</p>
          <p>104. With the children he sent Hermotimus, as guardian, <lb/>
            who was by birth a Pedasian, and among the eunuchs second <lb/>
            to none in the king's favour. The Pedasians dwell above <lb/>
            Halicarnassus; and among these Pedasians the following oc­ <lb/>
            currence takes place : when within a certain time any calamity <lb/>
            is about to fall on the different neighbours who dwell round <lb/>
            their city, then the priestess of Minerva has a large beard. <lb/>
            This has already happened twice to them. 105. Hermotimus,. <lb/>
            then, was sprung from these Pedasians; and of all the men we <lb/>
            know, revenged himself in the severest manner for an injury <lb/>
            he had received. For having been taken by an enemy, and <lb/>
            sold, he was purchased by one Panionius, a Chian, who gained <lb/>
            a livelihood by most infamous practices. For whenever he <lb/>
            purchased boys remarkable for beauty, having castrated them, <lb/>
            lie used to take and sell them at Sardis and Ephesus for large <lb/>
            sums; for with the barbarians eunuchs are more valued than <lb/>
            others, on account of their perfect fidelity. Panionius, there­ <lb/>
            fore, had castrated many others, as he made his livelihood by <lb/>
            this means, and among them this'man: Hermotimus, however, <lb/>
            was not unfortunate in every respect, for he went to Sardie <lb/>
            with other presents to the king; and in process of time was <lb/>
            most esteemed by Xerxes of all his eunuchs. 106. When the <lb/>
            king was preparing to march his Persian army against Athens, <lb/>
            and was at Sardis, at that time having gone down, on some busi­ <lb/>
            ness or other, to the Mysian territory which the Chians possess, <pb n="528"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[107. 108."/> <lb/>
            and is called Atarneus, he there met with Panionius. Hav­ <lb/>
            in- recognised him, he addressed many friendly words to him ; <lb/>
            first recounting to him the many advantages lie had acquired <lb/>
            by his means ; and secondly, promising him how many benefits <lb/>
            he would confer on him in requital, if he would bring his <lb/>
            family and settle there :2 so that Panionius, joyfully accepting <lb/>
            the proposal, brought his children and wife. But when Her­ <lb/>
            motimus got him with his whole family in his power, he ad­ <lb/>
            dressed him as follows: " 0 thou, who of all mankind hast <lb/>
            gained thy livelihood by the most infamous acts, what harm <lb/>
            had either I, or any of mine, done to thee, or any of thine, that <lb/>
            of a man thou hast made me nothing? Thou didst imagine, <lb/>
            surely, that thy machinations would pass unnoticed by the <lb/>
            gods ; who following righteous laws, have enticed thee, who <lb/>
            hast committed unholy deeds, into my hands, so that thou <lb/>
            canst not complain of the punishment I shall inflict on thee." <lb/>
            When he had thus upbraided him, his sons being brought into <lb/>
            his presence, Panionius was compelled to castrate his own <lb/>
            sons, who were four in number; and being compelled, he did <lb/>
            it; and, after he had finished it, his sons, being compelled, cas­ <lb/>
            trated him. Thus the vengeance of Hermotimus 3 overtook <lb/>
            Panionius.</p>
          <p>107. Xerxes, when he had committed his sons to Artemisia <lb/>
            to convey to Ephesus, having sent for Mardonius, bade him <lb/>
            choose what forces he would out of the army, and endeavour <lb/>
            to make his actions correspond with his words. Thus much <lb/>
            was done that day; but in the night, the admirals, by the <lb/>
            king's order, took back the ships from Phalerus to the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, as quickly as each was able, in order to guard the bridges <lb/>
            for the king to pass over. But when the barbarians were <lb/>
            sailing near Zoster, where some small promontories jut out <lb/>
            from the main land, they fancied that they were ships, and fled <lb/>
            for a considerable distance ; but after a while, perceiving that <lb/>
            they were not ships but promontories, they collected together, <lb/>
            and pursued their voyage. 108. When day came, the Greeks, <lb/>
            seeing the land-forces remaining in the same place, supposed <lb/>
            that their ships also were at Phalerus; they expected also <lb/>
            that they would come to an engagement, and prepared to defend <lb/>
            themselves ; but when they were informed that the ships had <lb/>
            departed, they immediately determined to pursue them. How- <note type="footnote"> 2 At Sardis. </note><note type="footnote">3 Literally, "vengeance and Hermotimus." </note> <pb n="529"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="109.J"/> <lb/>
            ever they did not get sight of Xerxes' naval force, although <lb/>
            they pursued them as far as Andros : on arriving at Andros, <lb/>
            therefore, they held a council. Themistocles accordingly gave <lb/>
            his opinion, " that shaping their course between the islands, <lb/>
            and pursuing the ships, they should sail directly to the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, and destroy the bridges." But Eurybiades gave a con­ <lb/>
            trary opinion, saying, that " if they destroyed the bridges, they <lb/>
            would do the greatest possible harm to Greece: for if the <lb/>
            Persian, being shut in, should be compelled to remain in <lb/>
            Europe, he would endeavour not to continue inactive ; for if <lb/>
            he continued inactive, he could neither advance his affairs, nor <lb/>
            find any means of returning home, but his army must perish <lb/>
            by famine ; and if he should attack them and' apply himself to <lb/>
            action, all Europe would probably go over to him, by cities and <lb/>
            nations, either through being taken by force, or capitulating <lb/>
            beforehand ; and they would derive sustenance from the an­ <lb/>
            nual produce of the Greeks. He thought however that the <lb/>
            Persian, having been conquered in the sea-fight, would not <lb/>
            remain in Europe, and therefore should be permitted to fly, <lb/>
            until in his flight he should reach his own country. After that <lb/>
            he advised that he should be compelled to fight for his own <lb/>
            territories." This opinion the commanders of the other <lb/>
            Peloponnesians adhered to.</p>
          <p>109. When Themistocles perceived that he could not per­ <lb/>
            suade the majority to sail for the Hellespont, changing his <lb/>
            plan, he thus addressed the Athenians, (for they were exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly annoyed at the escape of the enemy, and were desirous, <lb/>
            having consulted among themselves, to sail to the Hellespont, <lb/>
            even if the others would not.) " I have myself, ere this, wit­ <lb/>
            nessed many such instances, and have heard of many more ; <lb/>
            that men, when driven to necessity after being conquered, <lb/>
            have renewed the fight and repaired their former loss. Since, <lb/>
            then, we have met with unexpected success for ourselves and <lb/>
            Greece, by having repelled such a cloud of men, let us no <lb/>
            longer pursue the fugitives. For we have not wrought this <lb/>
            deliverance, but the gods and the heroes, who were jealous <lb/>
            that one man should reign over both Asia and Europe, and he <lb/>
            unholy and wicked; who treated sacred and profane things <lb/>
            alike, burning and throwing down the images of the gods; <lb/>
            who even scourged the sea, and threw fetters into it. Since, <lb/>
            then, our affairs are in a prosperous condition, let us remain in <note type="footnote"> 2 M </note> <pb n="530"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[110,111."/> <lb/>
            Greece, and take care of ourselves and our families ; let every <lb/>
            one repair his house and apply attentively to sowing his <lb/>
            ground, after he has thoroughly expelled the barbarian ; and <lb/>
            at the beginning of the spring let us sail to the Hellespont and <lb/>
            Ionia." This he said wishing to secure favour with the Per­ <lb/>
            sian, that, if any misfortune should overtake him from the <lb/>
            Athenians, he might have a place of refuge; which eventually <lb/>
            came to pass. 110. Themistocles, in saying this, deceived <lb/>
            them ; and the Athenians were persuaded ; for as he had been <lb/>
            before considered a wise man, and had now shown himself to <lb/>
            be really wise and prudent in counsel, they were ready to yield <lb/>
            implicitly to what he said. But after they had been persuaded, <lb/>
            Themistocles presently sent off certain persons in a boat, who <lb/>
            he was confident would, though put to every torture, keep <lb/>
            secret what he had enjoined them to say to the king ; and of <lb/>
            these his domestic Sicinnus4 was again one. When they <lb/>
            reached the shore of Attica, the rest remained in the boat, and <lb/>
            Sicinnus having gone up to the king, spoke as follows: " The­ <lb/>
            mistocles, son of Neocles, general of the Athenians, the most <lb/>
            valiant and wisest of all the allies, has sent me to tell you, that <lb/>
            Themistocles, the Athenian, wishing to serve you, has with­ <lb/>
            held the Greeks, who wished to pursue your ships, and to de­ <lb/>
            stroy the bridges on the Hellespont; now therefore retire at <lb/>
            your leisure." They, having made this communication, sailed <lb/>
            back again.</p>
          <p>111. The Greeks, when they had determined neither to <lb/>
            pursue the ships of the barbarians any farther, nor to sail to <lb/>
            the Hellespont and destroy the passage, invested Andros with <lb/>
            intention to destroy it: for the Andrians were the first of the <lb/>
            islanders who, when asked for money by Themistocles, re­ <lb/>
            fused to give it: but when Themistocles held this language <lb/>
            to them, that " the Athenians had come having with them two <lb/>
            powerful deities, Persuasion and Necessity, and that therefore <lb/>
            they must give money ;" they answered to this, saying, that <lb/>
            " the Athenians were with good reason great and prosperous, <lb/>
            and were favoured by propitious gods; since however the <lb/>
            Andrians were poor in territory, and had reached the lowest <lb/>
            pitch of penury, and two unprofitable goddesses, Poverty and <lb/>
            Impossibility, never forsook their island, but ever loved to <lb/>
            dwell there ; therefore that the Andrians, being in possession <note type="footnote"> 4See chap. 75, </note> <pb n="531"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="112, 113.]"/> <lb/>
            of these deities, would not give any money; for that the power <lb/>
            of the Athenians would never prove superior to their in­ <lb/>
            ability." They then, having made this answer, and refused <lb/>
            to give money, were besieged. 112. Themistocles, for he <lb/>
            never ceased coveting more wealth, sending threatening mes­ <lb/>
            sages to the other islands, demanded money by the same per­ <lb/>
            sons, using the same language he had used with the Andrians ; <lb/>
            saying that unless they gave what was demanded, he would <lb/>
            lead the forces of the Greeks against them, and would besiege <lb/>
            and destroy them. By saying this he collected large sums <lb/>
            from the Carystians and the Parians; who being informed <lb/>
            respecting Andros that it was besieged for siding with the <lb/>
            Mede, and with regard to Themistocles, that he was in the <lb/>
            greatest reputation of the generals, alarmed at these things, <lb/>
            sent money. Whether any other of the islanders gave it I <lb/>
            am unable to say; but I am of opinion that some others did, <lb/>
            and not these only. However, the Carystians5 did not by <lb/>
            these means at all defer calamity; though the Parians, having <lb/>
            conciliated Themistocles with money, escaped a visit from the <lb/>
            army. Themistocles, accordingly, setting out from Andros, <lb/>
            obtained money from the islanders, unknown to the other <lb/>
            generals.</p>
          <p>113. The army with Xerxes having stayed a few days after <lb/>
            the sea-fight, marched back into Bœotia by the same way, for <lb/>
            it appeared to Mardonius, both that he should escort the king, <lb/>
            and that the season of the year was unfit for military opera­ <lb/>
            tions ; and that it would be better to winter in Thessaly, and <lb/>
            to make an attempt on the Peloponnesus early in the spring. <lb/>
            When he arrived in Thessaly, Mardonius there selected, first, all <lb/>
            the Persians who are called Immortals, except Hydarnes their <lb/>
            general, for he declared he would not leave the king; after these, <lb/>
            out of the rest of the Persians, the cuirassiers, and the body of a <lb/>
            thousand horse,6 and the Modes, Sacæ, Bactrians, and Indians, <lb/>
            both infantry and cavalry; he chose these whole nations ; <lb/>
            but from the rest of the allies he selected a few, choosing <lb/>
            such as were of a good stature, or by whom he knew some <lb/>
            gallant action had been performed. Amongst them, he chose <lb/>
            the greatest part of the Persians, who wore necklaces and <lb/>
            bracelets ; next to them, the Medes; these were not less nu­ <lb/>
            merous than the Persians, but were inferior in strength. Thus <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> See ch. 121</note><note type="footnote"> "See B. VII. ch. 40 and IN. ch. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> 2M2 </note> <pb n="532"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[114—116."/> <lb/>
            the whole together, with the cavalry, made up the number of <lb/>
            three hundred thousand. 114. At this time, while Mardonius <lb/>
            was selecting his army, and Xerxes was in Thessaly, an oracle <lb/>
            came to the Lacedæmonians from Delphi, admonishing them <lb/>
            to demand satisfaction of Xerxes for the death of Leonidas, <lb/>
            and to accept whatever should be given by him. Accordingly <lb/>
            the Spartans immediately despatched a herald as quickly as <lb/>
            possible, who, when he overtook the whole army still in Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, having come into the presence of Xerxes, spoke as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : "King of the Medes, the Lacedaemonians and Heracli­ <lb/>
            dæ of Sparta demand of you satisfaction for blood, because you <lb/>
            have slain their king, while protecting Greece." But he <lb/>
            laughing, and having waited a considerable time, as Mardo­ <lb/>
            nius happened to be standing near him, pointed to him, and said, <lb/>
            " This Mardonius, then, shall give them such satisfaction as they <lb/>
            deserve." The herald, having accepted the omen, went away.</p>
          <p>115. Xerxes, having left Mardonius in Thessaly, himself <lb/>
            marched in all haste to the Hellespont; and arrived at the <lb/>
            place of crossing in forty-five days, bringing back no part of <lb/>
            his army, so to speak. Wherever, and among whatever na­ <lb/>
            tion, they happened to be marching, they seized and consumed <lb/>
            their corn; but if they found no fruit, overcome by hunger, <lb/>
            they eat up the herbage that sprung up from the ground, and <lb/>
            stripped off the bark of trees and gathered leaves, both from <lb/>
            the wild and cultivated, and left nothing ; this they did from <lb/>
            hunger. But a pestilence and dysentery falling on the <lb/>
            army, destroyed them on their march. Such of them as were <lb/>
            sick, Xerxes left behind, ordering the cities through which he <lb/>
            happened to be passing, to take care of and feed them: some <lb/>
            in Thessaly, others at Siris of Pæonia, and in Macedonia. <lb/>
            Here having left the sacred chariot of Jupiter, when he march­ <lb/>
            ed against Greece, he did not receive it back, as he returned ; <lb/>
            for the Pæonians having given it to the Thracians, when <lb/>
            Xerxes demanded it back, said that the mares had been stolen, <lb/>
            as they were feeding, by the upper Thracians, who dwell <lb/>
            round the sources of the Strymon. 116. There the king of <lb/>
            the Bisaltæ and of the Crestonian territory, a Thracian, per­ <lb/>
            petrated a most unnatural deed: he declared that he would <lb/>
            not willingly be a slave to Xerxes, but went up to the top cf <lb/>
            Mount Rhodope, and enjoined his sons not to join the expe­ <lb/>
            dition against Greece. They, however disregarding his pro- <pb n="533"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="117—119.]"/> <lb/>
            hibition, from a desire to see the war, served in the army with <lb/>
            the Persian: but when they all returned safe, being six in <lb/>
            number, their father had their eyes put out for this disobedi­ <lb/>
            ence ; and they met with this recompence.</p>
          <p>117. The Persians, when in their march from Thrace they <lb/>
            arrived at the passage, in great haste crossed over the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont to Abydos in their ships; for they found the rafts no <lb/>
            longer stretched across, but broken up by a storm. While <lb/>
            detained there, they got more food than on their march, and <lb/>
            having filled themselves immoderately, and changed their <lb/>
            water, a great part of the army that survived, died: the rest <lb/>
            with Xerxes reached Sardis. 118. This different account is <lb/>
            also given, that when Xerxes in his retreat from Athens <lb/>
            arrived at Eion on the Strymon, from thence he no longer <lb/>
            continued his journey by land, but committed the army to <lb/>
            Hydarnes to conduct to the Hellespont, and himself going on <lb/>
            board a Phœnician ship passed over to Asia: that during his <lb/>
            voyage a violent and tempestuous wind from the Strymon <lb/>
            overtook him; and then, for the storm increased in violence, <lb/>
            the ship being overloaded, so that many of the Persians who <lb/>
            accompanied Xerxes were on the deck, thereupon the king <lb/>
            becoming alarmed, and calling aloud, asked the pilot if there <lb/>
            were any hope of safety for them; and he said: "There <lb/>
            is none, sire, unless we get rid of some of those many passen­ <lb/>
            gers." It is further related, that Xerxes, having heard this <lb/>
            answer, said: " 0 Persians, now let some among you show his <lb/>
            regard for the king, for on you my safety seems to depend." <lb/>
            That he spoke thus; and that they, having done homage, leapt <lb/>
            into the sea; and that the ship, being lightened, thus got safe <lb/>
            to Asia. It is added, that Xerxes, immediately after he landed, <lb/>
            did as follows: he presented the pilot with a golden crown, <lb/>
            because he had saved the king's life; but ordered his head to <lb/>
            be struck off, because he had occasioned the loss of many <lb/>
            Persians. 119. This latter story is told of the return of <lb/>
            Xerxes, but appears to me not at all deserving of credit, <lb/>
            either in other respects, nor as to this loss of the Persians; for <lb/>
            if this speech bad been made by the pilot to Xerxes, I should <lb/>
            not find one opinion in ten thousand to deny that the king <lb/>
            would have acted thus: that he would have sent down into <lb/>
            the hold of the ship those who were on deck, since they were <lb/>
            Persians, and Persians of high rank, and would have thrown <pb n="534"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[120-123."/> <lb/>
            into the sea a number of rowers, who were Phœnicians, <lb/>
            equal to that of the Persians. He, however, as I have before <lb/>
            related, proceeding on the march with the rest of the army, <lb/>
            returned to Asia. 120. This also is a strong proof: it is <lb/>
            known that Xerxes reached Abdera on his way back, and <lb/>
            made an alliance of friendship with the people, and presented <lb/>
            them with a golden scymetar, and a gold-embroidered tiara. <lb/>
            And as the Abderites themselves say, saying what is by no <lb/>
            means credible to me, he there for the first time loosened his <lb/>
            girdle in his flight from Athens, as being at length in a place <lb/>
            of safety. Abdera is situated nearer to the Hellespont than <lb/>
            the Strymon and Eion, whence they say he embarked on <lb/>
            board the ship.</p>
          <p>121. Meanwhile the Greeks, finding they were not able to <lb/>
            reduce Andros, turned to Carystus, and having ravaged their <lb/>
            country, returned to Salamis. In the first place, then, they <lb/>
            set apart first-fruits for the gods, and among other things, <lb/>
            three Phoenician triremes ; one to be dedicated at the Isthmus, <lb/>
            which was there in my time; a second at Sunium, and the <lb/>
            third to Ajax, there at Salamis. After that, they divided the <lb/>
            booty, and sent the first-fruits to Delphi, from which a statue <lb/>
            was made, holding the beak of a ship in its hand, and twelve <lb/>
            cubits in height; it stands in the place where is the golden <lb/>
            statue of Alexander the Macedonian. 122. The Greeks, having <lb/>
            sent first-fruits to Delphi, inquired of the god in the name of <lb/>
            all, if he had received sufficient and acceptable first-fruits: <lb/>
            he answered, that from the rest of the Greeks he had, but <lb/>
            not from the Æginete; of them he demanded an offering on <lb/>
            account of their superior valour in the sea-fight at Salamis. <lb/>
            The Æginetæ, being informed of this, dedicated three golden <lb/>
            stars, which are placed on a brazen mast in the corner, very <lb/>
            near the bowl of Crœsus.7 123. After the division of the <lb/>
            booty, the Greeks, sailed to the Isthmus, for the purpose of <lb/>
            conferring the palm of valour upon him among the Greeks <lb/>
            who had proved himself most deserving throughout the war. <lb/>
            When the generals, having arrived, distributed the ballots at <lb/>
            the altar of Neptune, selecting the first and second out of all; <lb/>
            thereupon every one gave his vote for himself, each thinking <lb/>
            himself the most valiant; but with respect to the second place, <lb/>
            the majority concurred in selecting Themistocles. They, there- <note type="footnote"> 7 See B. I. chap. 51. </note> <pb n="535"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="124—126.]"/> <lb/>
            fore, had but one vote, whereas Themistocles had a great <lb/>
            majority for the second honour. 124. Though the Greeks, <lb/>
            out of envy, would not determine this matter, but returned <lb/>
            to their several countries without coming to a decision; yet <lb/>
            Themistocles was applauded and extolled throughout all <lb/>
            Greece, as being by far the wisest man of the Greeks. But <lb/>
            because, although victorious, he was not honoured by those <lb/>
            who fought at Salamis, he immediately afterwards went to <lb/>
            Lack'daemon, hoping to be honoured there. The Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians received him nobly, and paid him the greatest honours. <lb/>
            They gave the prize of valour to Eurybiades, a crown of <lb/>
            olive; and of wisdom and dexterity to Themistocles, to him <lb/>
            also a crown of olive. And they presented him with the most <lb/>
            magnificent chariot in Sparta; and having praised him highly, <lb/>
            on his departure, three hundred chosen Spartans, the same <lb/>
            that are called knights, escorted him as far as the Tegean <lb/>
            boundaries. He is the only man that we know of whom the <lb/>
            Spartans escorted on his journey. 125. When he arrived at <lb/>
            Athens, from Lacedæmon, thereupon Timodemus of Aphidnæ, <lb/>
            who was one of Themistocles' enemies, though otherwise a <lb/>
            man of no distinction, became mad through envy, reproached <lb/>
            Themistocles, alleging against him his journey to Lacedæmon ; <lb/>
            and that the honours he received from the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            were conferred on account of Athens, and not for his own <lb/>
            sake. But he, as Timodemus did not cease to repeat the same <lb/>
            thing, said: " The truth is, neither should I, were I a Bel­ <lb/>
            binite, have been thus honoured by the Spartans ; nor would <lb/>
            you, fellow, were you an Athenian." So far, then, this <lb/>
            occurred.</p>
          <p>126. In the mean time, Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, a man <lb/>
            even before of high repute among the Persians, and much <lb/>
            more so after the battle of Platæa, having with him sixty <lb/>
            thousand men of the army which Mardonius selected, escorted <lb/>
            the king as far as the passage. And when the king arrived <lb/>
            in Asia, he, marching back, came into the neighbourhood oi <lb/>
            Pallene: but as Mardonius was wintering in Thessaly and <lb/>
            Macedonia, and there was nothing as yet to urge him to join <lb/>
            the rest of the army, he did not think it right, since he hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be in the way of the Potidæans who had revolted, <lb/>
            to neglect the opportunity of reducing them to slavery. For <lb/>
            the Potidæans, as soon as the king had passed by, and the <pb n="536"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[127-129."/> <lb/>
            Persian fleet had fled from Salamis, openly revolted from the <lb/>
            barbarians; as also did the other inhabitants of Pallene. 127. <lb/>
            Artabazua, therefore, besieged Potidæa. And as he suspected <lb/>
            that the Olynthians intended to revolt from the king, he also <lb/>
            besieged their city. The Bottiæans then held it, who had <lb/>
            been driven from the bay of Therma by the Macedonians. <lb/>
            When he had besieged and taken them, having taken them <lb/>
            out to a marsh, he slaughtered them, and gave the city to <lb/>
            Critobulus of Torone to govern, and to the Chalcidian race <lb/>
            thus the Chalcidians became possessed of Olynthus. 128. <lb/>
            Artabazus, having taken this city, applied himself vigorously <lb/>
            to the siege of Potidæa; and, as he was earnestly engaged <lb/>
            with it, Timoxenus, general of the Scionæans, treated with <lb/>
            him for the betrayal of the city: in what way at first I am <lb/>
            unable to say, for it is not. reported; at last, however, the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing plan was adopted. When either Timoxenus had written <lb/>
            a letter and wished to send it to Artabazus, or Artabazus to <lb/>
            Timoxenus, having <unclear>olled</unclear> it round the butt-end of an arrow, <lb/>
            and put the feathers over the letter, they shot the arrow to a <lb/>
            spot agreed upon. But Timoxenus was detected in attempting <lb/>
            to betray Potidæa. For Artabazus, when endeavouring to <lb/>
            shoot to the spot agreed upon, missed the right spot and <lb/>
            wounded one of the Potidæans on the shoulder; a crowd ran <lb/>
            round the wounded man, as is usual in time of war; they <lb/>
            having immediately drawn out the arrow, when they per­ <lb/>
            ceived the letter, carried it to the generals; and an allied <lb/>
            force of the other Pallenians was also present. When the <lb/>
            generals had real the letter, and discovered the author of <lb/>
            the treachery, they determined not to Impeach Timoxenus <lb/>
            of treason, for the sake of the city of the Scionæans, lest <lb/>
            the Scionæans should ever after be accounted traitors. In <lb/>
            this manner, then, he was detected. 129. After three months <lb/>
            had been spent by Artabazus in the siege, there happened a <lb/>
            great ebb of the sea, which lasted for a long time. The bar­ <lb/>
            barians, seeing a passage that might be forded, marched across <lb/>
            towards Pallene; and when they had performed two parts of <lb/>
            their journey, and three still remained, which they m ut have <lb/>
            passed over to be within Pallene, a strong flood-tide of the <lb/>
            sea. came on them, such as was never seen before, as the in­ <lb/>
            habitants say, though floods are frequent. Those, then, that <lb/>
            did not know how to swim, perished, and those that did know <pb n="537"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="130, 131.]"/> <lb/>
            how, the Potidæans, sailing upon them in boats, put to death <lb/>
            The Potidæans say, that the cause of this flux and inundation, <lb/>
            and of the Persian disaster, was this, that these very Persians <lb/>
            who were destroyed by the sea, had committed impieties at <lb/>
            the temple of Neptune, and the statue which stands in the <lb/>
            suburbs; and in saying this was the cause, they appear to me <lb/>
            to speak correctly. The survivors Artabazus led to Thessaly, <lb/>
            to join Mardonius. Such, then, was the fate of those troops <lb/>
            that had escorted the king.</p>
          <p>130. The naval force of Xerxes, that survived when it <lb/>
            reached Asia in its flight from Salamis, and had transported <lb/>
            the king and his army from the Chersonese to Abydos, winter­ <lb/>
            ed at Cyme. And at the first appearance of spring, it as­ <lb/>
            sembled early at Samos; and some of the ships had wintered <lb/>
            there. Most of the marines were Persians and Modes, and <lb/>
            their generals came on board, Mardontes, son of Bagæus, and <lb/>
            Artayntes, son of Artachaeus; and Ithamitres, nephew of the <lb/>
            latter, shared the command with them, Artayntes himself hav­ <lb/>
            ing associated him with them. As they had sustained a <lb/>
            severe blow, they did not advance farther to the westward, <lb/>
            nor did any one compel them; but remaining, they kept watch <lb/>
            over Ionia lest it should revolt, having three hundred ships, <lb/>
            including those of Ionia. Neither did they expect that the <lb/>
            Greeks would come to Ionia, but thought they would be con­ <lb/>
            tent to guard their own territory; inferring this, because they <lb/>
            had not pursued them in their flight from Salamis, but had <lb/>
            readily retired. By sea therefore they despaired of success, <lb/>
            but on land they imagined that Mardonius would be decided­ <lb/>
            ly superior. While they were at Samos, they at the same <lb/>
            time consulted together whether they could do the enemy any <lb/>
            damage, and listened anxiously for news of how the affairs of <lb/>
            Mardonius would succeed. 131. The approach of spring, <lb/>
            and Mardonius being in Thessaly, aroused the Grecians. <lb/>
            Their land-forces were not yet assembled; but their fleet ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Ægina, in number one hundred and ten ships. Their <lb/>
            leader and admiral was Leotychides, son of Menares, son of <lb/>
            Agesilaus, son of Hippocratides, son of Leotychides, son of <lb/>
            Anaxilaus, son of Archidamus, son of Anaxandrides, son of <lb/>
            Theopompus, son of Nicander, son of Charillus, son of Euno. <lb/>
            mus, son of Polydectes, son of Prytanis, son of Euryphon, soc <lb/>
            of Procles, son of Aristodemus, son of Aristomachus, son ot <pb n="538"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[132—134."/> <lb/>
            Cleodæus, son of Hyllus, son of Hercules: he was of the <lb/>
            second branch of the royal family. All these, except the two <lb/>
            mentioned first after Leotychides, were kings of Sparta. <lb/>
            Xanthippus, son of Ariphron, commanded the Athenians. <lb/>
            132. When all these ships were assembled at Ægina, ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors from the Ionians arrived at the encampment of the <lb/>
            Greeks; who a short time before had gone to Sparta, and en­ <lb/>
            treated the Lacedæmonians to liberate Ionia; and among them <lb/>
            was Herodotus, son of Basilides. These, who were originally <lb/>
            seven in number, having conspired together, formed a plan of <lb/>
            putting Strattis, the tyrant of Chios, to death; but as they <lb/>
            were detected in their plot, one of the accomplices having <lb/>
            given information of the attempt, thereupon the rest, being six, <lb/>
            withdrew from Chios and went to Sparta, and at the present <lb/>
            time to Ægina, beseeching the Greeks to sail down to Ionia; <lb/>
            they with difficulty prevailed on them to advance as far as <lb/>
            Delos. For all beyond that was dreaded by the Greeks, who <lb/>
            were unacquainted with those countries, and thought all parts <lb/>
            were full of troops; Samos, they were convinced in their <lb/>
            imaginations, was as far distant as the columns of Hercules. <lb/>
            Thus it fell out, that at the same time the barbarians durst not <lb/>
            sail farther westward than Samos; nor the Greeks, though <lb/>
            the Chians besought them, further eastward than Delos. <lb/>
            Thus fear protected the midway between them.</p>
          <p>133. The Greeks, then, sailed to Delos, and Mardonius was <lb/>
            in winter-quarters about Thessaly. When preparing to set out <lb/>
            from thence, he sent a man, a native of Europus, whose name <lb/>
            was Mys, to consult the oracles, with orders to go every where <lb/>
            and consult all that it was possible for him to inquire of. What <lb/>
            he wished to learn from the oracles when he gave these orders, <lb/>
            I am unable to say, for it is not related; I am of opinion, <lb/>
            however, that he sent to inquire about the affairs then depend­ <lb/>
            ing, and not about any others. 134. This Mys clearly appears <lb/>
            to have arrived at Lebadea, and having persuaded a native of <lb/>
            the place by a bribe, descended into the cave of Trophonius ; <lb/>
            and arrived also at the oracle of Abæ of the Phocians; more­ <lb/>
            over, as soon as he arrived at Thebes, he first of all consulted <lb/>
            the Ismenian Apollo, and it is there the custom, as in Olympia, <lb/>
            to consult the oracle by means of victims; and next, having <lb/>
            persuaded some stranger, not a Theban, by money, he caused <lb/>
            him to sleep in the temple of Amphiaraus. For none of the <pb n="539"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="135,136.]"/> <lb/>
            Thebans are permitted to consult there, for the following <lb/>
            reason : Amphiaraus, communicating with them by means of <lb/>
            Oracles, bade them choose whichever they would of these two <lb/>
            tilings, to have him either for their prophet, or their ally, ab­ <lb/>
            staining from the other : they chose to have him for their ally: <lb/>
            for this reason therefore no Theban is allowed to sleep there. <lb/>
            135. The following, to me very strange circumstance, is re­ <lb/>
            lated by the Theban to have happened: that this Mys, of <lb/>
            Europus, in going round to all the oracles, came also to the <lb/>
            precinct of the Ptoan Apollo; this temple is called Ptoan, <lb/>
            but belongs to the Thebans, and is situate above the lake Co­ <lb/>
            pais, at the foot of a mountain, very near the city of Acræphia: <lb/>
            that when this man, called Mys, arrived at this temple, three <lb/>
            citizens, chosen by the public, accompanied him for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of writing down what the oracle should pronounce: and <lb/>
            forthwith the priestess gave an answer in a foreign tongue; <lb/>
            and that those Thebans who accompanied him stood amazed <lb/>
            at hearing a foreign language instead of Greek, and knew <lb/>
            not what to do on the present occasion ; but that Mys suddenly <lb/>
            snatching from them the tablet which they brought, wrote on <lb/>
            it the words spoken by the prophet; and said that he had <lb/>
            given an answer in the Carian tongue; and after he had <lb/>
            written it down he departed for Thessaly.</p>
          <p>136. Mardonius having read the answers of the oracles, af­ <lb/>
            terwards sent Alexander, son of Amyntas, a Macedonian, as <lb/>
            an ambassador to Athens; as well because the Persians were <lb/>
            related to him, (for Bubares, a Persian, had married Alexan­ <lb/>
            der's sister Gygæa, daughter of Amyntas, by whom he had the <lb/>
            Amyntas in Asia, who took his name from his maternal grand­ <lb/>
            father: to him Alabanda, a large city of Phrygia, had been <lb/>
            given by the king to govern,) as because he had been informed <lb/>
            that Alexander was a friend and benefactor of the Athenians; <lb/>
            Mardonius therefore sent him. For in this way he thought <lb/>
            he should best be able to gain over the Athenians, having <lb/>
            heard that they were a numerous and valiant people; and <lb/>
            besides, he knew that the Athenians had been the principal <lb/>
            cause of the late disaster of the Persians at sea. If these <lb/>
            were won over, he hoped that he should easily become master <lb/>
            at sea, which indeed would have been the case; and on land <lb/>
            he imagined that he was much superior: thus he calculated that <lb/>
            his power would get the upper hand of the Grecian. Per- <pb n="540"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[137, 138"/> <lb/>
            haps also the oracles had given him this warning, advising <lb/>
            him to make Athens his ally; accordingly, relying on them, <lb/>
            he sent.</p>
          <p>137. The seventh ancestor of this Alexander was Perdic­ <lb/>
            cas, who obtained the sovereignty of the Macedonians in the <lb/>
            following manner. Gauanes, Aëropus, and Perdiccas, three <lb/>
            brothers, of the descendants of Temenus, fled from Argos to the <lb/>
            Illyrians, and crossing over from the Illyrians into the upper <lb/>
            Macedonia, they arrived at the city of Lebæa; there they <lb/>
            entered into the king's service for wages. One of them had <lb/>
            the care of his horses ; another, of his oxen ; and the youngest <lb/>
            of them, Perdiccas, of the lesser cattle. Formerly, even <lb/>
            monarchs were poor in wealth, and not only the people; so <lb/>
            that the wife of the king used herself to cook their food. <lb/>
            Whenever the bread of the hireling lad Perdiccas was baked, <lb/>
            it became twice as large as at first: and when this always <lb/>
            happened, she told it to her own husband. It immediately <lb/>
            occurred to him, when he heard it, that it was a prodigy, and <lb/>
            boded something of importance. Having therefore summoned <lb/>
            the hirelings, he commanded them to depart out of his territo­ <lb/>
            ries. They answered, that they were entitled to receive their <lb/>
            wages, and then they would go. Thereupon the king, hearing <lb/>
            about wages, as the rays of the sun reached into the house <lb/>
            down the chimney, said, being deprived of his senses by the <lb/>
            deity: " I give you this, as your wages equal to your ser­ <lb/>
            vices ; "pointing to the sun. Gauanes and Aëropus, the elder, <lb/>
            stood amazed when they heard this. But the lad, for he hap­ <lb/>
            pened to have a knife, saying thus, " We accept thy offer, 0 <lb/>
            king," traced a circle on the floor of the house round the sun's <lb/>
            rays, and having so traced the circle, and having drawn the <lb/>
            sun's rays three times on his bosom, departed, and the others <lb/>
            with him. 138. They accordingly went away; but one of <lb/>
            those who were sitting by him, informed the king what the <lb/>
            lad had done, and how the youngest of them accepted the offer <lb/>
            with some design. He, on hearing this, being in a rage, des­ <lb/>
            patched after them some horsemen to kill them. In this <lb/>
            country is a river, to which the descendants of these men from <lb/>
            Argos sacrifice as their deliverer. It, when the Temenidæ <lb/>
            had crossed over, swelled to such a height, that the horsemen <lb/>
            were unable to cross it. They, then, coming to another dis­ <lb/>
            trict of Macedonia, settled near the gardens that are said to <pb n="541"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="139,140.]"/> <lb/>
            have belonged to Midas, son of Gordias; in which wild roses <lb/>
            grow, each one having sixty leaves, and surpassing all others <lb/>
            in fragrance. In these gardens, Silenus was taken, as is re­ <lb/>
            lated by the Macedonians. Above the gardens is a mountain, <lb/>
            called Bermion, inaccessible from the cold. Issuing from <lb/>
            thence, when they had possessed themselves of this tract, they <lb/>
            subdued the rest of Macedonia. 139. From this Perdiccas, <lb/>
            Alexander was thus descended. Alexander was the son of <lb/>
            Amyntas, Amyntas of Alcetes, the father of Alcetes was Aë­ <lb/>
            ropus, of him Philip, of Philip, Argæus, and of him, Perdic­ <lb/>
            cas, who acquired the sovereignty. Thus, then, was Alexan­ <lb/>
            der son of Amyntas descended.</p>
          <p>140. When he arrived at Athens, being sent by Mardonius, <lb/>
            he spoke as follows: (1.) "Men of Athens, Mardonius says <lb/>
            thus: A message has come to me from, the king, conceived in <lb/>
            these terms: 'I forgive the Athenians all the injuries com­ <lb/>
            mitted by them against me; therefore, Mardonius, do thus. <lb/>
            First, restore to them their territory; and next, let them <lb/>
            choose, in addition to it, another country, whatever they please, <lb/>
            and live under their own laws; and rebuild all their temples <lb/>
            which I have burnt, if they are willing to come to terms with <lb/>
            me.' These orders having come to me, I must of necessity <lb/>
            execute them, unless you on your part oppose. And now I <lb/>
            say this to you. Why are you so mad as to levy war against <lb/>
            the king: for neither can you get the better of him, nor can <lb/>
            you resist him for ever. You are acquainted with the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of Xerxes' army, and their achievements; you have heard <lb/>
            of the force that is even now with me; so that even if you <lb/>
            should get the better of us and conquer, (of which, however, <lb/>
            you can have no hope, if you think soberly,) another much <lb/>
            more numerous will come against you. Suffer not yourselves, <lb/>
            then, to be deprived of your country, and to be continually <lb/>
            running a risk for your existence, by equalling yourselves with <lb/>
            the king, but be reconciled to him; and it is in your power <lb/>
            to be reconciled honourably, since the king is so disposed. <lb/>
            Be free, having contracted an alliance with us, without guile <lb/>
            or deceit. (2.) This, 0 Athenians, Mardonius charged me to <lb/>
            say to you. But I, for my own part, will say nothing of the <lb/>
            good-will I bear towards you; for you would not learn it for <lb/>
            the first time. But I entreat you, listen to Mardonius, for I <lb/>
            see that you will not always be able to carry on war against <pb n="542"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[141, 142."/> <lb/>
            Xerxes. For if I had seen this power in you, I would never <lb/>
            have come to you bringing such a proposal. For the power <lb/>
            of the king is more than human, and his arm exceeding long. <lb/>
            If, then, you do not immediately come to terms, when they <lb/>
            offer such favourable conditions on which they are willing to <lb/>
            agree, I greatly fear for you, who of all the allies dwell in <lb/>
            the most beaten road, and who must continually be the only <lb/>
            people destroyed, since ye possess a territory exposed, as <lb/>
            being between both armies. Be persuaded, then; for this <lb/>
            is a high honour to you, that the great king, forgiving your <lb/>
            offences alone among all the Greeks, is willing to become <lb/>
            your friend." Thus spoke Alexander. 141. But the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, having been informed that Alexander had ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Athens, in order to induce the Athenians to an <lb/>
            agreement with the barbarian; and remembering the oracles, <lb/>
            how it was fated that they, with the rest of the Dorians, should <lb/>
            be driven out of Peloponnesus by the Medes and Athenians, <lb/>
            were very much afraid lest the Athenians should make terms <lb/>
            with the Persian, and therefore resolved forthwith to send <lb/>
            ambassadors. It so happened that the introduction of both <lb/>
            took place at the same time. For the Athenians had pur­ <lb/>
            posely delayed the time, well knowing that the Lacedæmoniam <lb/>
            would hear that an ambassador had come from the barbarian <lb/>
            to negociate a treaty, and that when they did hear of it, they <lb/>
            would send ambassadors with all speed. They, therefore, de­ <lb/>
            signedly so contrived, as to show their intentions to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians. 142. When Alexander had ceased speaking, thE <lb/>
            ambassadors from Sparta, speaking next, said : " The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians have sent us to entreat you not to adopt any new mea­ <lb/>
            sures with respect to Greece, nor to listen to proposals from the <lb/>
            barbarian; for neither would it be by any means just nor hon­ <lb/>
            ourable either in any others of the Greeks, and least of all in you, <lb/>
            for many reasons. For you raised this war, against our wish, <lb/>
            and the contest arose about your sovereignty ; but it now re­ <lb/>
            lates to the whole of Greece. Beside, that the Athenians, whc <lb/>
            are the authors of all these things, should prove the occasion <lb/>
            of slavery to Greece, is on no account to be borne ; you, whc <lb/>
            always, and from of old, have been seen to assert the freedom <lb/>
            of many nations. We, however, sympathize with you in your <lb/>
            difficulties, and that you have already been deprived of two <lb/>
            harvests, and that your property has been so long involved in <pb n="543"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="143, 144.]"/> <lb/>
            ruin. But in compensation for this, the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            the allies promise to support your wives and all the rest of <lb/>
            your families which are useless in war, as long as the war <lb/>
            shall continue. Therefore, let not Alexander the Macedonian <lb/>
            persuade you, by glossing over the proposal of Mardonius ; <lb/>
            for this is what he would naturally do; for being himself a <lb/>
            tyrant, he aids a tyrant's cause. But you should not so act, <lb/>
            if indeed you think rightly; because you know that with bar­ <lb/>
            barians there is neither faith nor truth." Thus spoke the am­ <lb/>
            bassadors. 143. The Athenians gave the following answer to <lb/>
            Alexander: " We ourselves are aware of this, that the power <lb/>
            of the Modes is far greater than ours; so that there was no <lb/>
            need to insult us with that. But, nevertheless, being ardent <lb/>
            for liberty, we will defend ourselves in such manner as we are <lb/>
            able. But do not you attempt to persuade us to come to terms <lb/>
            with the barbarian, for we will not be persuaded. Go, then, <lb/>
            and tell Mardonius, that the Athenians say, so long as the sun <lb/>
            shall continue in the same course as now, we will never make <lb/>
            terms with Xerxes: but we will go out to oppose him, trusting <lb/>
            in the gods, who fight for us, and in the heroes, whose temples <lb/>
            and images he, holding them in no reverence, has burnt. And <lb/>
            do you appear no more in the presence of the Athenians, <lb/>
            bringing such proposals; nor, imagining that you do us good <lb/>
            service, urge us to do wicked deeds. For we are unwilling <lb/>
            that you, who are our guest and friend, should meet with any <lb/>
            ungracious treatment at the hands of the Athenians." 144. <lb/>
            To Alexander they gave this answer; and to the ambassadors <lb/>
            from Sparta the following: " That the Lacedæmonians should <lb/>
            fear lest we should make terms with the barbarian, was very <lb/>
            natural; yet, knowing as you do the mind of the Athenians, <lb/>
            you appear to entertain an unworthy dread ; for there is nei­ <lb/>
            ther so much gold any where in the world, nor a country so <lb/>
            pre-eminent in beauty and fertility, by receiving which, we <lb/>
            should be willing to side with the Mede and enslave Greece. <lb/>
            For there are many and powerful considerations that forbid <lb/>
            us to do so, even if we were inclined. First and chief, the <lb/>
            images and dwellings of the gods, burnt and laid in ruins: <lb/>
            his we must needs avenge to the utmost of our power, rather <lb/>
            than make terms with the man who has perpetrated such deeds. <lb/>
            Secondly, the Grecian race being of the-same blood and the <unclear/> <lb/>
            mne language, and the temples of the gods and sacrifices in <pb n="544"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[1,2."/> <lb/>
            common; and our similar customs; for the Athenians to be­ <lb/>
            come betrayers of these would not be well. Know, therefore, <lb/>
            if you did not know it before, that so long as one Athenian is <lb/>
            left alive, we will never make terms with Xerxes. Your fore­ <lb/>
            thought, however, which you manifest towards us, we admire, <lb/>
            in that you provide for us whose property is thus ruined, so <lb/>
            as to be willing to support our families; and you have fulfilled <lb/>
            the duty of benevolence; we, however, will continue thus in <lb/>
            the state we are, without being burdensome to you. Now, <lb/>
            since matters stand as they do, send out an army with all pos­ <lb/>
            sible expedition; for, as we conjecture, the barbarian will in <lb/>
            no long time be here to invade our territories, as soon as he <lb/>
            shall hear our message that we will do none of the things he <lb/>
            required of us. Therefore, before he has reached Attica, it is <lb/>
            fitting that we go out to meet him in Bocotia." When the <lb/>
            Athenians had given this answer, the ambassadors returned <lb/>
            to Sparta.</p>

          <p>MARDONIUS, when Alexander, having returned, had made <lb/>
            known the answer from the Athenians, set out from Thessaly, <lb/>
            and led his army in haste against Athens; and wherever he <lb/>
            arrived from time to time, he joined the people to his own <lb/>
            forces. The leaders of Thessaly were so far from repenting <lb/>
            of what had been before done, that they urged on the Persian <lb/>
            much more: and Thorax of Larissa both assisted in escorting <lb/>
            Xerxes in his flight, and now openly gave Mardonius a passage <lb/>
            into Greece. 2. When the army on its march arrived among <lb/>
            the Bocotians, the Thebans endeavoured to restrain Mardonius, <lb/>
            and advised him, saying that there was no country more con­ <lb/>
            venient to encamp in than that, and dissuaded him from ad­ <lb/>
            vancing farther, but urged him to take up his station there, <lb/>
            and contrive so as to subdue the whole of Greece without a <lb/>
            battle. " For that if the Greeks continue firmly united, as <lb/>
            they had dene before, it would be difficult even for all man- <pb n="545"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="3—6.]"/> <lb/>
            kind to overcome them. But," they continued, " if you will <lb/>
            do what we advise, you will without difficulty frustrate all <lb/>
            their plans: send money to the most powerful men in the <lb/>
            cities ; and by sending it you will split Greece into parties. <lb/>
            and then, with the assistance of those of your party, you may <lb/>
            easily subdue those who are not in your interest." 3. They <lb/>
            gave this advice; he, however, was not prevailed on, but a <lb/>
            vehement desire of taking Athens a second time was instille <unclear/> <lb/>
            into 'him ; partly by presumption, and partly he hoped, by sig <lb/>
            nal fires across the islands, to make known to the king while <lb/>
            he was at Sardis, that he was in possession of Athens. When <lb/>
            he arrived in Attica, he did not find the Athenians there ; but <lb/>
            was informed that most of them were at Salamis, and on board <lb/>
            their ships; he therefore took the deserted city. The capture <lb/>
            by the king was ten months before this second invasion by <lb/>
            Mardonius.</p>
          <p>4. While Mardonius was at Athens, he sent Murychides, <lb/>
            a Hellespontine, to Salamis, with the same proposals which <lb/>
            Alexander the Macedonian had already conveyed to the <lb/>
            Athenians. He sent this second time, although before aware <lb/>
            that the disposition of the Athenians was not friendly to him, <lb/>
            but expecting they would remit something of their haughti­ <lb/>
            ness, since the whole Attic territory was taken and now in <lb/>
            his power. For these reasons he sent Murychides to Salamis. <lb/>
            5. He, on coming before the council, delivered the message <lb/>
            of Mardonius. And Lycidas, one of the councillors, gave his <lb/>
            opinion, that, " it appeared to him to be best to entertain the <lb/>
            proposal which Murychides brought to them, and to report it <lb/>
            to the people." He delivered this opinion, either because he <lb/>
            had received money from Mardonius, or because such was <lb/>
            really his opinion. But the Athenians, immediately being <lb/>
            very indignant, both those belonging to the council, and those <lb/>
            without, as soon as they were informed of it, surrounded <lb/>
            Lycidas, and stoned him to death; but they dismissed Mury­ <lb/>
            chides the Hellespontine unharmed. A tumult having taken <lb/>
            place at Salamis respecting Lycidas, the Athenian women ob­ <lb/>
            tained information of what had happened; whereupon one <lb/>
            woman encouraging another, and uniting together, they went <lb/>
            of their own accord to the house of Lycidas, and stoned his <lb/>
            wife and children. 6. The Athenians had crossed over to <lb/>
            Salamis under the following circumstances. As long as they <note type="footnote"> 2 N </note> <pb n="546"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[1."/> <lb/>
            expected that an army would come from the Peloponnesus to <lb/>
            assist them, they remained in Attica; but when they had <lb/>
            recourse to delay and extreme tardiness, and Mardonius was <lb/>
            advancing and reported to be in Bceotia, they then removed <lb/>
            all their effects, and themselves crossed over to Salamis : they <lb/>
            also sent ambassadors to Lacedæmon, partly to blame the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, because they had allowed the barbarian to <lb/>
            invade Attica, and had not gone out with them to meet him <lb/>
            in Bceotia ; and partly to remind them of what the Persian <lb/>
            had promised to give them, if they would change sides; and <lb/>
            to forewarn them, that unless they assisted the Athenians, <lb/>
            they would themselves find some means of escape. 7. At that <lb/>
            time the Lacedæmonians were employed in celebrating a <lb/>
            festival, and it was the Hyacinthia with them ; and they <lb/>
            deemed it of the greatest importance to attend to the service <lb/>
            of the deity. At the same time they were busied in building <lb/>
            the wall at the Isthmus, and it had already received the <lb/>
            breast-works.</p>
          <p>When the ambassadors from the Athenians arrived at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, bringing with them ambassadors from Megara <lb/>
            and Platæa, they went before the ephori, and spoke as follows : <lb/>
            (1.) " The Athenians have sent us to tell you, that the king <lb/>
            of the Modes in the first place offers to restore our country; <lb/>
            and, secondly, is willing to make us his allies on fair and equal <lb/>
            terms, without fraud or deceit; he is also willing to give us <lb/>
            another territory, in addition to our own, whatever we our­ <lb/>
            selves may choose. We, however, reverencing the Grecian <lb/>
            Jupiter, and thinking it disgraceful to betray Greece, have not <lb/>
            acceded to, but rejected his offers; though we are unjustly <lb/>
            treated, and betrayed by the Greeks, and know that it is more <lb/>
            for our own interest to come to terms with the Persian, than <lb/>
            to continue the war; still we will never willingly come to <lb/>
            terms with him. (2.) Thus sincerely we have acted towards the <lb/>
            Greeks. But you, who were then in the utmost consternation <lb/>
            lest we should come to terms with the Persian, when you were <lb/>
            clearly assured of our resolution, that we will never betray <lb/>
            Greece, and because your wall drawn across the Isthmus is <lb/>
            now nearly completed, no longer show any regard for the <lb/>
            Athenians. For having agreed to advance with us to meet <lb/>
            the Persian in Bœotia, you have betrayed us, and have al­ <lb/>
            owed the barbarian to invade Attica. Hitherto the Atheni- <pb n="547"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="8-10.]"/> <lb/>
            ans are angry with you, for you have not acted in a becoming <lb/>
            manner; and now they exhort you to send out forces with us <lb/>
            with all expedition, that we may receive the barbarian in <lb/>
            Attica; for since we have missed Bocotia, the Thriasian plain <lb/>
            in our own territory is the most convenient place to give battle <lb/>
            in." 8. When the ephori had heard this message, they put off <lb/>
            their answer to the next day, and on the next day to the mor­ <lb/>
            row. This they did for ten days, putting them off from day <lb/>
            to day. During this time they proceeded with the wall at the <lb/>
            Isthmus, all the Peloponnesians using the utmost diligence; <lb/>
            and it was nearly completed. I can give no reason why, <lb/>
            when Alexander the Macedonian went to Athens, they took <lb/>
            such pains to prevent the Athenians from siding with the <lb/>
            Mede, and then took no trouble about it, except that the <lb/>
            Isthmus was now fortified, and they thought they had no <lb/>
            further need of the Athenians ; whereas, when Alexander ar­ <lb/>
            rived in Attica, the wall was not yet built, but they were <lb/>
            working at it, being in great dread of the Persians.</p>
          <p>9. At length, the answer and march of the Sp'artans hap­ <lb/>
            pened in the following manner.1 On the day preceding that <lb/>
            on which the last audience was to take place, Chileus of Tegea, <lb/>
            who had the greatest influence in Lacedæmon of any stranger, <lb/>
            was informed by the ephori of all that the Athenians had said. <lb/>
            Chileus, having heard it, spoke to them as follows : " The case <lb/>
            is thus, 0 ephori; if the Athenians are not united with us, but <lb/>
            are allied to the barbarian, although a strong wall has been <lb/>
            carried across the Isthmus, wide doors leading into the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus are open to the Persian ; therefore give heed, before <lb/>
            the Athenians come to any other determination which may <lb/>
            bring ruin on Greece." 10. He, then, gave them this advice; <lb/>
            and they, taking his remark into consideration, forthwith, <lb/>
            without saying any thing to the ambassadors who had come <lb/>
            from the cities, while it was still night, sent out five thousand <lb/>
            Spartans, appointing seven helots to attend each, and commit­ <lb/>
            ting the conduct of them to Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus. <lb/>
            The command properly belonged to Pleistarchus, son of Leo­ <lb/>
            nidas; but herwas still a boy, and the former his guardian and <lb/>
            cousin. For Cleombrotus, the father of Pausanias, and son to <lb/>
            Anaxandrides, was no longer living, but having led back the <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally " the following manner of the answer and march took <lb/>
            place " </note> <note type="footnote"> 2N2</note> <pb n="548"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[11-13-"/> <lb/>
            army that had built the wall, from the Isthmus, he died shortly <lb/>
            afterwards. Cleombrotus led back the army from the Isthmus <lb/>
            for this reason; as he was sacrificing against the Persians, the <lb/>
            sun darkened in the heavens. Pausanias chose as his col­ <lb/>
            league Euryanax, son of Dorieus, who was a man of the same <lb/>
            family. These forces, accordingly, marched from Sparta with <lb/>
            Pausanias. 11. The ambassadors, when they came, knowing <lb/>
            nothing of the march of the troops, went to the ephori, being <lb/>
            resolved themselves also to depart severally to their own cities <lb/>
            and having come into their presence, they spoke as follows: <lb/>
            " You, 0 Lacedæmonians, remaining here, celebrate the <lb/>
            Hyacinthia, and divert yourselves, while you are betraying <lb/>
            the allies. But the Athenians, being injured by you, and <lb/>
            destitute of allies, will make peace with the Persian on such <lb/>
            terms as they can. And having made peace, it is evident that <lb/>
            we shall become the king's allies, and shall march with them <lb/>
            against whatever country they shall lead us; and then you <lb/>
            will learn what the consequence will be to yourselves." When <lb/>
            the ambassadors had thus spoken, the epbori said with an oath, <lb/>
            " that those who had set out against the foreigners, were al­ <lb/>
            ready at Oresteum ;" for they call the barbarians foreigners. <lb/>
            The ambassadors asked what was meant; and on inquiry, <lb/>
            learnt the whole truth, so that, being much surprised, they <lb/>
            followed after them with all possible expedition ; and with <lb/>
            them, five thousand chosen heavy-armed troops of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring Lacedæmonians did the same. 12. They then hastened <lb/>
            towards the Isthmus. But the Argives, as soon as they heard <lb/>
            that the troops with Pausanias had left Sparta, sent a herald <lb/>
            to Attica, having looked out the best of their couriers, for they <lb/>
            had before promised Mardonius to prevent the Spartans from <lb/>
            going out. He, when he arrived at Athens, spoke as follows : <lb/>
            " Mardonius, the Argives have sent me to inform you, that <lb/>
            the youth of Lacedæmon are marched out, and that the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives were unable to prevent them from going out. Under <lb/>
            these circumstances take the best advice you can." He, hav­ <lb/>
            ing spoken thus, went home again.</p>
          <p>13. Mardonius, when he heard this, was by no means desirous <lb/>
            to stay longer in Attica. Before he heard this, he lingered <lb/>
            there, wishing to know from the Athenians what they would <lb/>
            do ; but he neither ravaged nor injured the Attic territory, be­ <lb/>
            ing in expectation all along that they would come to terms. But <pb n="549"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="14—16.]"/> <lb/>
            when lie could not persuade them, being informed of the whole <lb/>
            truth, he withdrew, before those with Pausanias reached the <lb/>
            Isthmus, having first set fire to Athens, and if any part of the <lb/>
            walls, or houses, or temples, happened to be standing, having <lb/>
            thrown down and laid all in ruins. He marched out for tho <lb/>
            following reasons, because the Attic country was not adapted <lb/>
            for cavalry ; and if he should be conquered in an engagement, <lb/>
            there, was no way to escape except through a narrow pass, so <lb/>
            that even a small number of men could intercept them. He <lb/>
            determined therefore to retire to Thebes, and to fight near a <lb/>
            friendly city, and in a country adapted for cavalry. 14. Mar­ <lb/>
            donius accordingly retreated ; and while he was yet on his <lb/>
            march, another message came in advance, that another army <lb/>
            had reached Megara, consisting of a thousand Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            When he heard this, he deliberated, wishing, if by any means <lb/>
            he could, to take these first; therefore, wheeling round, he led <lb/>
            his army against Megara; and his cavalry going on before <lb/>
            scoured the Megarian territory. This was the farthest part <lb/>
            of Europe, towards the sun-set, to which this Persian army <lb/>
            reached. 15. After this, news came to Mardonius, that the <lb/>
            Greeks were assembled at the Isthmus ; he therefore marched <lb/>
            back through Decelea. For the Boeotian chiefs had sent for <lb/>
            the neighbours of the Asopians; and they conducted him <lb/>
            along the way to Sphendale, and from thence to Tanagra; <lb/>
            and having passed the night at Tanagra, and on the next day <lb/>
            turned towards Scolus, he arrived in the territory of the The­ <lb/>
            bans. There he cleared the lands of the Thebans, though <lb/>
            they aided with the Mede, not out of enmity towards them, <lb/>
            but constrained by urgent necessity ; wishing to make a for­ <lb/>
            tification for his army, and in case, when he engaged, the re­ <lb/>
            sult should not be such as he wished, he might have this as a <lb/>
            place of refuge. His camp beginning at Erythræ, passed by <lb/>
            Hysiæ and extended to the Platæan territory, stretching to <lb/>
            the river Asopus. The wall, however, was not built of this <lb/>
            extent, but each front was about ten stades in length.</p>
          <p>While the barbarians were employed in this task, Atta­ <lb/>
            ginus, son of Phrynon, a Theban, having made great prepar­ <lb/>
            ations, invited Mardonius himself and fifty of the most eminent <lb/>
            Persians to an entertainment; and they, being invited, came. <lb/>
            The feast was held at Thebes. 16. The rest I heard from <lb/>
            Thersander an Orchomenian, a man of high repute at Orcho- <pb n="550"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[17"/> <lb/>
            menus Thersander said that he also was invited by Atta­ <lb/>
            ginus to this feast, and that fifty Thebans were also invited; <lb/>
            and that he did not place each person on a separate couch, <lb/>
            but a Persian and a Theban on each couch. When supper <lb/>
            was over, and they were drinking freely, the Persian who was <lb/>
            on the same couch, using the Grecian tongue, asked him of <lb/>
            what country he was; he answered that he was an Orchome­ <lb/>
            uian, whereupon the other said: " Since you are a partaker <lb/>
            of the same table and of the same cups with me, I wish to <lb/>
            leave with you a memorial of my opinion, in order that, being <lb/>
            forewarned, you may be able to consider what is best for your <lb/>
            own interest. Do you see these Persians feasting here, and <lb/>
            the army that we left encamped near the river ? Of all these you <lb/>
            will see, after the lapse of a short time, only some few surviv­ <lb/>
            ing." As the Persian said this, he shed abundance of tears; <lb/>
            and he himself, being astonished at his words, said to him: <lb/>
            " Would it not be right to tell this to Mardonius, and to those <lb/>
            Persians who are next to him in authority ?" To this he an­ <lb/>
            swered : " My friend, that which is fated by the deity to hap­ <lb/>
            pen, it is impossible for man to avert; for no one will listen to <lb/>
            those who say what is worthy of credit. And though many <lb/>
            of the Persians are convinced of this, we follow, being bound <lb/>
            by necessity. The bitterest grief to which men are liable is <lb/>
            this, when one knows much, to have no power to act." This <lb/>
            I heard from Thersander the Orchomenian; and this besides, <lb/>
            that he immediately told this to several persons before the battle <lb/>
            was fought at Platæa.</p>
          <p>17. While Mardonius encamped in Bœotia, all the rest <lb/>
            furnished troops, and joined in the attack upon Athens, such <lb/>
            however of the Greeks who, dwelling in these parts, sided <lb/>
            with the Mede : but the Phocians only did not join in the at­ <lb/>
            tack ; for they took part with the Mede very unwillingly and <lb/>
            by necessity. But not many days after his arrival at Thebes, <lb/>
            a thousand of their heavy-armed troops arrived ; Harmocydes, <lb/>
            a man of high repute among the citizens, commanded them. <lb/>
            When they also arrived at Thebes, Mardonius, having sent <lb/>
            some horsemen, ordered them to encamp by themselves in the <lb/>
            plain; and when they had done this, the whole cavalry came <lb/>
            up. Upon this a rumour spread through the Grecian forces, <lb/>
            who were with the Medes, that they were going to despatch <lb/>
            them with their javelins; this same rumour also spread among <pb n="551"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="18, 19.|"/> <lb/>
            the Phocians themselves. Whereupon, their general Harmo­ <lb/>
            cydes encouraged them, addressing them as follows: " 0 Pho­ <lb/>
            cians, it is plain that these men are about to deliver us up to <lb/>
            certain death, we having been calumniated by the Thessalians, <lb/>
            as I conjecture. Now, therefore, it is fitting that every one <lb/>
            of you should prove himself valiant, for it is better to die <lb/>
            doing something, and defending ourselves, than expose our­ <lb/>
            selves to be destroyed by a most disgraceful death. Let some <lb/>
            of these men learn, then, that being barbarians, they have <lb/>
            plotted death against men who are Greeks." 18. Thus he <lb/>
            encouraged them. But the cavalry, when they had surrounded <lb/>
            them on all sides, rode up as if to destroy them, and brandished <lb/>
            their javelins, as if about to hurl them; and one here and <lb/>
            there did hurl his javelin. They, however, faced them, form­ <lb/>
            ing themselves into a circle, and closing their ranks as much <lb/>
            as possible: whereupon the cavalry wheeled round and rode <lb/>
            away. I am unable to say with certainty, whether they came <lb/>
            to destroy the Phocians at the request of the Thessalians, and <lb/>
            when they saw them prepared to defend themselves, were <lb/>
            afraid lest they might receive some wounds, and therefore <lb/>
            rode off, (because Mardonius had so ordered them,) or whether <lb/>
            he wished to try whether they had any courage. But when <lb/>
            the cavalry had ridden back, Mardonius sent a herald and <lb/>
            spoke as follows: " Be of good heart, 0 Phocians, for you <lb/>
            have proved yourselves to be brave men, contrary to what I <lb/>
            heard. Therefore sustain this war with resolution, and you <lb/>
            shall not surpass me or the king in generosity." Such were <lb/>
            the events in regard to the Phocians.</p>
          <p>19. The Lacedæmonians, when they arrived at the Isth­ <lb/>
            mus, there encamped. And the rest of the Peloponnesians, <lb/>
            who favoured the better cause, when they heard of this, and <lb/>
            others also who saw the Spartans marching out, thought it <lb/>
            would be a disgrace to absent themselves from the expedition <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians. Accordingly, the victims having <lb/>
            proved favourable, they all marched out from the Isthmus, <lb/>
            and advanced to Eleusis. And having consulted the victims <lb/>
            there also, when they were again favourable, they continued <lb/>
            their march ; and the Athenians with them, they having <lb/>
            crossed over from Salamis, and joined them at Eleusis. When <lb/>
            they reached Erythræ in Bœotia, they learnt that the bar­ <lb/>
            barians were encamped on the Asopus, and having there- <lb/>
             <pb n="552"/>
            [20-22 <lb/>
            upon consulted together, they formed themselves opposite, at <lb/>
            the foot of Mount Cithaeron. 20. Mardonius, when the Greeks <lb/>
            did not corn 3 down to the plain, sent against them all his ca­ <lb/>
            valry, which Masistius commanded, a man highly esteemed <lb/>
            among the Persians (and whom the Greeks call Macistius): <lb/>
            he was mounted on a Nisæan horse, that had a golden bit, <lb/>
            and was otherwise gorgeously caparisoned. Thereupon, when <lb/>
            the cavalry rode up to the Greeks, they charged them in <lb/>
            squadrons, and in charging them did them much mischief, and <lb/>
            called them women. 21. By chance the Megarians happened <lb/>
            to be stationed in that part which was most exposed, and there <lb/>
            the cavalry chiefly made their attack. When, therefore, the <lb/>
            cavalry charged, the Megarians, being hard pressed, sent a <lb/>
            herald to the Grecian generals ; and the herald, when be came <lb/>
            into their presence, addressed them as follows: " The Mega­ <lb/>
            rians say; We, 0 confederates, are not able alone to sustain the <lb/>
            Persian cavalry, retaining the post in which we were originally <lb/>
            stationed: hitherto we have held out against them by our con­ <lb/>
            stancy and courage, though hard pressed; but now, unless you <lb/>
            will send some others to relieve us, know we must abandon our <lb/>
            post." He accordingly delivered this message. Pausanias there­ <lb/>
            fore made trial of the Greeks, to see if any others would volun­ <lb/>
            teer to go to that position, and to relieve the Megarians. When <lb/>
            all the others refused, the Athenians undertook to do it, and <lb/>
            of the Athenians three hundred chosen men, whom Olym­ <lb/>
            piodorus, son of Lampon, commanded. 22. These were they <lb/>
            who undertook that service, and who were stationed in front <lb/>
            of all the Greeks at Erythræ, having taken with them some <lb/>
            archers. After they had fought for some time, the result ot <lb/>
            the battle was as follows. As the cavalry charged in squa­ <lb/>
            drons, the horse of Masistius, being in advance of the others, <lb/>
            was wounded in the flank by an arrow; and being in pain, he <lb/>
            reared and threw Masistius. As he fell, the Athenians imme­ <lb/>
            diately attacked him: accordingly they seized his horse, and <lb/>
            killed Masistius, as he endeavoured to defend himself, though <lb/>
            at first they were unable to do so: for he was thus armed; <lb/>
            underneath he had a golden cuirass covered with scales, and <lb/>
            over the cuirass he wore a purple cloak. By striking against <lb/>
            the cuirass they did nothing; until one of them, perceiving <lb/>
            what was the matter, pierced him in the eye, so he fell and <lb/>
            died. By some means this, while it was going on, escaped the <pb n="553"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="13-25.|"/> <lb/>
            notice of the otter horsemen, for they neither saw him when <lb/>
            he fell from his horse, nor when he was killed; for while a <lb/>
            retreat and wheeling round was taking place, they did not <lb/>
            notice what had happened. But when they halted, they im­ <lb/>
            mediately missed him, as there was no one to marshal them. <lb/>
            And as soon as they learnt what had happened, all, cheering <lb/>
            one another on, pushed their horses to the charge, in order to <lb/>
            recover the body. 23. The Athenians, seeing the cavalry no <lb/>
            longer advancing in squadrons, but all together, called out for <lb/>
            assistance to the rest of the army; and while the whole in­ <lb/>
            fantry was coming up to their aid, a sharp struggle took place <lb/>
            for the body. Now as long as the three hundred were alone, <lb/>
            they were much inferior, and abandoned the body; but when <lb/>
            the multitude came up to their assistance, the cavalry no longer <lb/>
            maintained their ground, nor did they succeed in recovering <lb/>
            the body, but lost many others of their number, besides him ; <lb/>
            having therefore retired about two stades, they consulted <lb/>
            about what ought to be done; and determined, as they were <lb/>
            without a commander, to retreat to Mardonius. 24. When <lb/>
            the cavalry arrived at the camp, the whole army, and Mardo­ <lb/>
            nius most of all, mourned the loss of Masistius; cutting off <lb/>
            their own hair, and that of their horses and beasts of burden, <lb/>
            and giving themselves up to unbounded lamentations; for the <lb/>
            sound reached over all Bœotia, as for the loss of a man who, <lb/>
            next to Mardonius, was most esteemed by the Persians and <lb/>
            the king. Thus the barbarians, according to their custom, <lb/>
            honoured Masistius when dead.</p>
          <p>25. The Greeks, when they had withstood the attack of the <lb/>
            cavalry, and having withstood had repulsed it, were much <lb/>
            more encouraged, and first of all, having placed the body on <lb/>
            a carriage, they carried it along the line; but the body was <lb/>
            worthy of admiration, on account of his stature and beauty; <lb/>
            for that reason they did this, and the men, leaving their ranks, <lb/>
            came out to view Masistius. After this, they determined to <lb/>
            go down towards Platæa, for the Platæan territory appeared <lb/>
            to be much more convenient for them to encamp in than the <lb/>
            Erythræan, both in other respects, and as it was better sup­ <lb/>
            plied with water. To this country, therefore, and to the foun­ <lb/>
            tain Gargaphia, which is in this country, they decided that it <lb/>
            would be best to remove, and having drawn up their line, there <lb/>
            to encamp. Accordingly having taken up their arms, they <pb n="554"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[26."/> <lb/>
            marched by the foot of Mount Cithæron, near Hysiæ, into the <lb/>
            Platæan territory; and on arriving there, they formed in line, <lb/>
            nation by nation, near the fountain of Gargaphia, and the pre­ <lb/>
            cinct of the hero Androcrates, on slight elevations and the level <lb/>
            plain. 26. There in the distribution of the stations a vehement <lb/>
            dispute arose between the Tegeans and the Athenians; for <lb/>
            each claimed a right to occupy the other wing,2 alleging both <lb/>
            their recent and former exploits. On the other hand, the <lb/>
            Tegeans spoke thus: " We have ever been thought entitled <lb/>
            to this station by all the allies, in whatever common expeditions <lb/>
            have been undertaken by the Peloponnesians, both anciently <lb/>
            and recently, from the time when the Heraclidæ, after the <lb/>
            death of Eurystheus, attempted to return to Peloponnesus. <lb/>
            We then obtained this honour on the following occasion. <lb/>
            When we, in conjunction with the Achæans and Ionians, <lb/>
            who were then in Peloponnesus, having marched out to the <lb/>
            Isthmus, were posted opposite the invaders, then it is related <lb/>
            that Hyllus made proclamation, that it would be better not to <lb/>
            run the hazard of engaging army with army; but that from <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian camp, the man amongst them whom they <lb/>
            judge to be the best, should fight singly with him on certain <lb/>
            conditions. The Peloponnesians determined that this should <lb/>
            be done; and they took oaths on the following terms: that if <lb/>
            Hyllus should conquer the Peloponnesian leader, the Heraclidæ <lb/>
            should return to their paternal possessions; but if he should <lb/>
            be conquered, the Heraclidæ should depart and lead off their <lb/>
            army, and not seek to return into Peloponnesus during the <lb/>
            space of a hundred years. And Echemus, son of Aeropus, <lb/>
            son of Phegeus, who was our king and general, having volun­ <lb/>
            teered, was chosen out of all the allies, and fought singly and <lb/>
            slew Hyllus. From this exploit we obtained among the Pe­ <lb/>
            loponnesians of that day both other great privileges, which <lb/>
            we continue to enjoy, and that we should always command one <lb/>
            wing, whenever a common expedition is undertaken. With <lb/>
            you, then, 0 Lacedæmonians, we do not contend, but giving <lb/>
            you the choice of whichever wing you wish to command, we <lb/>
            concede it to you ; but we say that it belongs to us to lead the <lb/>
            other, as in former times. And besides this exploit that has <lb/>
            been mentioned, we are more entitled to have that station than <lb/>
            the Athenians, for many and well-contested battles have been <note type="footnote"> 2 The Lacedæmonians chose which wing they pleased. </note> <pb n="555"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="27"/> <lb/>
            fought by us with you, 0 men of Sparta, and many with others. <lb/>
            It is right, therefore, that we should have one wing, rather <lb/>
            than the Athenians; for such exploits have not been achieved <lb/>
            by them as by us, either in modern or ancient times." Thus <lb/>
            they spoke. 27. To this the Athenians answered as follows: <lb/>
            “ We are aware that this assemblage was made for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of fighting with the barbarian, and not for disputes; but <lb/>
            since,the Tegean has proposed to mention the former and re­ <lb/>
            cent actions that have been achieved by each nation in all <lb/>
            times, it is necessary for us to make known to you, whence <lb/>
            it is our hereditary right, having ever proved ourselves valiant, <lb/>
            to hold the first rank, rather than the Arcadians. As to the <lb/>
            Heraclidæ, whose leader they affirm they slew at the Isthmus; <lb/>
            in the first place, these men formerly, when rejected by all the <lb/>
            Greeks to whom they came, when flying from slavery at the <lb/>
            hands of the Mycenæans, we alone received, and put an end to <lb/>
            the insolence of Eurystheus, by conquering in battle, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with them, the people who then possessed Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus. In the next place, when the Argives who marched <lb/>
            with Polynices against Thebes were killed, and lay unburied, <lb/>
            we having led an army against the Cadmæans, affirm that we <lb/>
            recovered the bodies and buried them in our own territory at <lb/>
            Eleusis. We also performed a valiant exploit against the <lb/>
            Amazons, who once made an irruption into Attica from the <lb/>
            river Thermodon; and in the Trojan war we were inferior <lb/>
            to none. But it is of no avail to call these things to mind; <lb/>
            for those who were then valiant, the same may now be cow­ <lb/>
            ards ; and those who were then cowards, may now be brave. <lb/>
            Enough, then, of ancient <unclear>explits</unclear>. But if no other achieve­ <lb/>
            ment had been performed by us, though there were many and <lb/>
            gallant ones, if by any others of the Greeks, yet from our <lb/>
            exploit at Marathon we are worthy of this honour, and more <lb/>
            than this; we who alone of the Greeks, having fought single- <lb/>
            handed with the Persian, and having attempted such a feat, <lb/>
            survived, and conquered six and forty nations. Do we not, <lb/>
            then, from this single action, deserve to hold this post ? But as <lb/>
            it is not becoming on such an occasion as this to be contending <lb/>
            about position, we are ready to submit to you, 0 Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, wherever it seems most convenient to place us, and <lb/>
            against whatsoever nation. For, wheresoever we are stationed, <lb/>
            we shall endeavour to prove ourselves brave. Command us, <pb n="556"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[28, 29."/> <lb/>
            then. as ready to obey." 28. Thus they answered; and the <lb/>
            whole army of the Lacedæmonians shouted out, that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were more worthy to occupy the wing than the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians. Accordingly the Athenians had it, and got the better <lb/>
            of the Tegeans.</p>
          <p>After this, those of the Greeks who came up later, and those <lb/>
            who arrived at first, were drawn up in the following manner. <lb/>
            Ten thousand of the Lacedæmonians occupied the right wing ; <lb/>
            five thousand of these being Spartans, were attended by thirty- <lb/>
            five thousand lightly armed Helots, seven being assigned to <lb/>
            each man. The Spartans chose the Tegeans to stand next <lb/>
            themselves, both for honour and valour; of these there were <lb/>
            fifteen hundred heavy-armed men: next to them stood five <lb/>
            thousand of the Corinthians ; and with them they got permis­ <lb/>
            sion from Pausanias for three hundred Potidaeans, who came <lb/>
            from Pallene, to stand: next these stood six hundred Arca­ <lb/>
            dians of Orchomenus ; next them three thousand Sicyonians ; <lb/>
            next them were eight hundred Epidaurians; and by the side <lb/>
            of these were stationed three thousand of the Trœzenians; <lb/>
            and next the Troezenians two hundred Lepreatæ; next these <lb/>
            four hundred of the Mycenæans and Tirynthians; next them <lb/>
            one thousand Phliasians ; and by the side of them stood three <lb/>
            hundred Hermionians; next the Hermionians were stationed <lb/>
            six hundred of the Eretrians and Styrians; and next them <lb/>
            four hundred Chalcidians; next them five hundred Ambra­ <lb/>
            ciots; after them stood eight hundred of the Leucadians and <lb/>
            Anactorians; next them two hundred Paleans from Cephal­ <lb/>
            lenia; and after them five hundred of the Æginetæ were sta­ <lb/>
            tioned ; and by the side of them were posted three thousand <lb/>
            of the Megarians; and next them six hundred Platæans; and <lb/>
            last of all, and at the same time first, eight thousand Atheniana <lb/>
            took their station, occupying the left wing, Aristides, son of <lb/>
            Lysimachus, commanding them. 29. These, except the seven <lb/>
            assigned to each of the Spartans, were heavy-armed; their <lb/>
            total number amounting to thirty-eight thousand seven hun­ <lb/>
            dred. All the heavy-armed men assembled to oppose the <lb/>
            barbarian were so many. Of the light-armed the number <lb/>
            was as follows: in the Spartans' line thirty-five thousand <lb/>
            men, there being seven to each man; every one of these was <lb/>
            equipped as for war: and the light-armed of the rest of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and other Greeks, about one to each man, <pb n="557"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="30—32.]"/> <lb/>
            amounted to thirty-four thousand five hundred. So that <lb/>
            the number of the light-armed fighting men was sixty-nine <lb/>
            thousand fire hundred. 30. Thus, then, the whole of the <lb/>
            Grecian army assembled at Platæa, reckoning heavy-armed <lb/>
            and light-armed fighting men, amounted to one hundred and <lb/>
            ten thousand, wanting one thousand eight hundred men: and <lb/>
            with the Thespians who came up, the full number of one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and ten thousand was completed; for the survivors of <lb/>
            the Thespians joined the army, to the number of one thousand <lb/>
            eight hundred, but they had not heavy armour. These, then, <lb/>
            being drawn up in line, encamped on the Asopus.</p>
          <p>31. The barbarians, with Mardonius, when they had ceased <lb/>
            to mourn for Masistius, having heard that the Greeks were at <lb/>
            Platæa, themselves also marched to the Asopus, which flows <lb/>
            there; and on their arrival, they were thus drawn up by Mar­ <lb/>
            donius. Opposite the Lacedæmonians he stationed the Per­ <lb/>
            sians ; and as the Persians far exceeded them in number, they <lb/>
            were both drawn up several ranks deep, and extended opposite <lb/>
            the Tegeans: and he arrayed them thus; having selected all <lb/>
            the most powerful of his forces, he stationed them opposite <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and the weaker he arrayed by their side <lb/>
            against the Tegeans: this he did by the advice and direction <lb/>
            of the Thebans. Next the Persians he ranged the Modes; <lb/>
            these fronted the Corinthians, Potidæans, Orchomenians, and <lb/>
            Sicyonians. Next the Medes he ranged the Bactrians ; these <lb/>
            fronted the Epidaurians, Trœzenians, Lepreatæ, Tirynthians, <lb/>
            Mycenæans, and Phliasians. Next the Bactrians he stationed <lb/>
            the Indians; these fronted the Hermionians, Eretrians, Sty­ <lb/>
            rians, and Chalcidians. Next the Indians, he ranged the <lb/>
            Sacæ; these fronted the Ampraciots, Anactorians, Leucadians, <lb/>
            Paleans, and Æginetæ. And next the Sacæ, and opposite to <lb/>
            the Athenians, Platæans, and Megarians, he ranged the Bœ­ <lb/>
            otians, Locrians, Melians, Thessalians, and the thousand Pho­ <lb/>
            cians; for all the Phocians did not side with the Mede; but some <lb/>
            of them assisted the cause of the Greeks, being shut up about <lb/>
            Parnassus; and sallying from thence, they harassed the army of <lb/>
            Mardonius, and the Greeks who were with him. He also ranged <lb/>
            the Macedonians, and those that dwelt about Thessaly, against <lb/>
            the Athenians. 32. These, the most considerable of the na­ <lb/>
            tions that were ranged under Mardonius, have been named, <lb/>
            and which were the most distinguished and of most account, <pb n="558"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[83."/> <lb/>
            yet there were also mixed with them men of other nations. <lb/>
            Phrygians, Thracians, Mysians, Pæonians, Æthiopians, and <lb/>
            others; and among them those of the Æthiopians and Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians who are called Hermotybians and Calasirians, armed <lb/>
            with swords; who are the only Egyptians that are warriors.3 <lb/>
            These, while he was still at Phalerus, he took from on board <lb/>
            the ships, they being marines; for the Egyptians were not <lb/>
            arrayed with the land-forces that came with Xerxes to Athens. <lb/>
            Of barbarians there were three hundred thousand, as has been <lb/>
            already shown ; 4 but of Greeks who were allies of Mardonius <lb/>
            no one knows the number, for they were not reckoned up; <lb/>
            but, to make a guess, I conjecture that they were assembled <lb/>
            to the number of fifty thousand. These, who were thus ar­ <lb/>
            rayed, were infantry; the cavalry were marshalled apart.</p>
          <p>33. When they were all ranged by nations and battalions, <lb/>
            thereupon, on the second day, both sides offered sacrifices. <lb/>
            For the Greeks, Tisamenus, son of Antiochus, was the person <lb/>
            who sacrificed, for he accompanied this army as diviner; him, <lb/>
            though an Elean, and by extraction a Clytiad of the Iamidæ, <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians had admitted into the number of their <lb/>
            citizens. For when Tisamenus was consulting the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi about offspring, the Pythian answered, that he should <lb/>
            be victorious in five very great contests. He accordingly, <lb/>
            mistaking the answer, applied himself to gymnastic exercises, <lb/>
            as if he were to be victorious in gymnastic contests; and <lb/>
            having practised the pentathlon, he missed winning the Olym­ <lb/>
            pic prize by one wrestling match, having contended with Hie­ <lb/>
            ronymus of Andros. The Lacedæmonians, having learnt that <lb/>
            the oracle delivered to Tisamenus referred not to gymnastic <lb/>
            but to martial contests, endeavoured by offers of money to <lb/>
            persuade Tisamenus to become the leader of their wars, in <lb/>
            conjunction with their kings of the Heraclidæ. But he, seeing <lb/>
            the Spartans very anxious to make him their friend, having <lb/>
            discovered this, enhanced his price, acquainting them, " that <lb/>
            if they would make him their own citizen, granting him a full <lb/>
            participation of all privileges, he would comply, but not on <lb/>
            any other terms." The Spartans, when they first heard this, <lb/>
            were very indignant, and altogether slighted his prophetic <lb/>
            skill; but at last, when great terror of this Persian army was <lb/>
            hanging over them, they sent for him and assented. But he, <note type="footnote">3 See B. II. chap. 164. </note><note type="footnote">4 See B. VJII. chap. 113. </note> <pb n="559"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="34—37.]"/> <lb/>
            perceiving they had changed their minds, said he would no <lb/>
            longer be contented with these things only, but that his brother <lb/>
            Hegias must also be made a Spartan, on the same terms as <lb/>
            himself. 34. In saying this he imitated Melampus, to com­ <lb/>
            pare a kingdom with citizenship in his demands. For Me­ <lb/>
            ampus also, the women at Argos being smitten with madness, <lb/>
            when the Argives would have hired him from Pylus to cure <lb/>
            heir women of the disease, demanded one half of the king­ <lb/>
            dom for his recompence. But the Argives not yielding to his <lb/>
            terms, but going away, when many more of their women be­ <lb/>
            came mad, they at length submitted to what Melampus de­ <lb/>
            manded, and went to present it to him. But he thereupon, <lb/>
            seeing them changed, coveted still more, saying, that " unless <lb/>
            they would give a third part of the kingdom to his brother <lb/>
            Bias, he would not do what they wished." The Argives, <lb/>
            herefore, being driven to a strait, granted that also. 35. In <lb/>
            ike manner the Spartans, for they wanted Tisamenus ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly, yielded to him entirely : and when the Spartans <lb/>
            atad thus yielded to him, Tisamenus the Elean, having become a <lb/>
            Spartan, accordingly assisted them by his art of divination in <lb/>
            gaining five most important battles. These, then, were the <lb/>
            only persons of all mankind who were made Spartan citizens. <lb/>
            rhe five battles were as follows: one and the first, this at <lb/>
            Platæa ; next, that which took place at Tegea, against the <lb/>
            Tegeans and Argives; afterwards, that at Dipæa, against all <lb/>
            he Arcadians except the Mantineans; next, that of the Mes­ <lb/>
            enians, near Ithomæ ; and the last, that which took place at <lb/>
            Tanagra, against the Athenians and Argives: this was the <lb/>
            last achieved of the five victories. 36. This Tisamenus, then, <lb/>
            he Spartans bringing him, officiated as diviner to the Greeks <lb/>
            t Platæa : now the sacrifices were favourable to the Greeks, <lb/>
            f they stood on the defensive; but if they crossed the Asopus, <unclear/> <lb/>
            nd began the battle, not so.</p>
          <p>37. To Mardonius, who was very desirous to begin the <unclear/> <lb/>
            attle, the sacrifices were not propitious; but to him also, if <unclear/> <lb/>
            e stood on the defensive, they were favourable: for he too <unclear/> <lb/>
            dopted the Grecian sacrifices, having for his,diviner Hegesis­ <lb/>
            ratus, an Elean, and the most renowned of the Telliadæ. This <lb/>
            man, before these events, the Spartans bad taken and bound <lb/>
            For death, because they had suffered many and atrocious things <lb/>
            from him. He being in this sad condition, as being in peril <pb n="560"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[38, 39."/> <lb/>
            for his life, and having to suffer many tortures before death, <lb/>
            performed a deed beyond belief. For as he was confined in <lb/>
            stocks bound with iron, he got possession of a knife, which <lb/>
            had been by some means carried in, and immediately contrived <lb/>
            the most resolute deed of all men we know of: for having <lb/>
            considered in what way the rest of his foot would get out, he <lb/>
            cut off the broad part of the foot; and having done this, as <lb/>
            he was guarded by sentinels, he dug a hole through the wall <lb/>
            and escaped to Tegea, travelling by night, and by day hiding <lb/>
            himself in the woods and tarrying there. Thus, though the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians searched for him with their whole population, <lb/>
            on the third night he arrived at Tegea; but they were struck <lb/>
            with great amazement at his daring, when they saw half his <lb/>
            foot lying on the ground, and were not able to find him. Thus <lb/>
            Hegesistratus, having escaped from the Lacedæmonians, fled to <lb/>
            Tegea, which was at that time not on friendly terms with the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians : and having been cured of his wounds, and <lb/>
            procured a wooden foot, he became an avowed enemy to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. However, at last his hatred conceived <lb/>
            against the Lacedæmonians did not benefit him; for he was <lb/>
            taken by them when acting as diviner at Zacynthus, and put <lb/>
            to death. Now the death of Hegesistratus took place after the <lb/>
            battle of Platæa : but at that time, on the Asopus, being <lb/>
            hired by Mardonius for no small sum, he sacrificed and was <lb/>
            very zealous, both from hatred to the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            from a love of gain.</p>
          <p>38. As the victims were not favourable for fighting, either <lb/>
            to the Persians themselves, or the Greeks who were with <lb/>
            them, (for they also had a diviner for themselves, Hippoma­ <lb/>
            chus, a Leucadian,) and as Greeks were flowing in, and then <lb/>
            numbers increasing, Timagenides, son of Herpys, a Theban, <lb/>
            advised Mardonius to guard the passes of Mount Cithaeron <lb/>
            saying, that the Greeks were continually pouring in ever) <lb/>
            day, and that he would intercept great numbers. 39. Eight <lb/>
            days had already elapsed since they had been posted opposite <lb/>
            each other, when he gave this advice to Mardonius. But he <lb/>
            perceiving that the suggestion was good, as soon as it was <lb/>
            night, sent some cavalry to the passes of Cithaeron, that lead t&lt; <lb/>
            Platæa, which the Bœotians call The Three Heads; but th&lt; <lb/>
            Athenians, The Heads of Oak. The horsemen that were sent die <lb/>
            not arrive in vain ; for issuing on the plain, they took five hun- <pb n="561"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="40, 41.]"/> <lb/>
            dred beasts carrying provisions from Peloponnesus to tho <lb/>
            army, with the men who attended the beasts of burden. The <lb/>
            Persians, having taken this booty, killed them without mercy, <lb/>
            sparing neither beast nor man: and when they had had <lb/>
            enough of slaughter, they surrounded the rest of them, and <lb/>
            drove them off to Mardonius and to the camp. 40. After <lb/>
            this action they passed two more days, neither being will­ <lb/>
            ing to begin the battle; for the barbarians advanced as far as <lb/>
            the Asopus, to tempt the Greeks, but neither crossed over. <lb/>
            However, the cavalry of Mardonius continually pressed on <lb/>
            and harassed the Greeks ; for the Thebans, being entirely in <lb/>
            the interest of the Medes, carried on the war with vigour, <lb/>
            and constantly led on even to actual fighting; but after that <lb/>
            the Persians and Modes, coming up, gave signal proofs of <lb/>
            valour.</p>
          <p>41. Accordingly, during the ten days nothing more than <lb/>
            this took place; but when the eleventh day came after the <lb/>
            two armies had been encamped opposite each other in Platæa, <lb/>
            and the Greeks had become much more numerous, and Mar­ <lb/>
            donius was exceedingly vexed at the delay, thereupon Mardo­ <lb/>
            nius, son of Gobryas, and Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, who <lb/>
            was one of the Persians esteemed by Xerxes, came to a con­ <lb/>
            ference. And on consulting, the following were their opinions : <lb/>
            that of Artabazus, that " it was expedient to remove their whola <lb/>
            army away as quickly as possible, and march to the walls <lb/>
            of Thebes, where a large store of provisions had been laid up <lb/>
            for themselves, and forage for their horses ; and that sitting <lb/>
            down quietly they might accomplish their enterprise, by doing <lb/>
            as follows: for, as they had much coined gold and much un­ <lb/>
            coined, and much silver and many goblets, they should spare <lb/>
            none of these, but distribute them among the Greeks, espe­ <lb/>
            cially among the principal men of the Greeks in the cities; <lb/>
            and they would quickly surrender their liberty, nor run the <lb/>
            hazard of an engagement." Thus his opinion was the same as <lb/>
            that of the Thebans,5 since he had more foresight than the <lb/>
            other.6 But the opinion of Mardonius was more violent, per­ <lb/>
            tinacious, and by no means inclined to yielding. “ For he <lb/>
            thought that their army was far superior to the Grecian, and <lb/>
            that they should engage as quickly as possible, and not suffer <lb/>
            more to be assembled than were already assembled; and that <note type="footnote"> ' See chap. 2. </note><note type="footnote">6 Mardonius. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2o </note> <pb n="562"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="44."/> <lb/>
            they should dismiss the victims of Hegesistratus, and not do <lb/>
            violence to them, but, following the usages of the Persians, to <lb/>
            engage." 42. When he thus decided, no one contradicted him, <lb/>
            so that his opinion prevailed, for he held the command of the <lb/>
            army from the king, and not from Artabazus. Having there­ <lb/>
            fore summoned the commanders of battalions, and the generals <lb/>
            of the Greeks who were in his service, he asked if they knew <lb/>
            any oracle respecting the Persians, which predicted that they <lb/>
            should be destroyed. But when those who were convoked <lb/>
            remained silent, some not knowing the oracles, and others <lb/>
            knowing indeed, but not deeming it safe to mention them, <lb/>
            Mardonius himself said, " Since you either know nothing, or <lb/>
            dare not speak, I will tell you, as I know perfectly welL There is <lb/>
            an oracle, importing, that the Persians arriving in Greece should <lb/>
            sack the temple at Delphi, and after the sacking, all perish. <lb/>
            We, therefore, being apprized of this, neither march against <lb/>
            that temple, nor intend to sack it; and thus we shall not <lb/>
            perish on that account. Let such of you, then, as are well <lb/>
            affected to the Persians, rejoice on this account, that we shall <lb/>
            vanquish the Greeks." Having said this to them, he next <lb/>
            gave orders to get all things in readiness, and put them in <lb/>
            good order, for that a battle would take place early the next <lb/>
            morning. 43. This oracle, which Mardonius said related to <lb/>
            the Persians, I know was delivered in reference to the Illy­ <lb/>
            rians, and the army of the Enchelians, and not to the Persians. <lb/>
            But the following had been delivered by Bads in reference to <lb/>
            this battle : " The meeting of the Greek and the barbarian- <lb/>
            voiced shout on the Thermodon and grassy-banked Asopus; in <lb/>
            which many of the bow-bearing Medes shall fall, despite of <lb/>
            Lachesis and fate, when the destined day shall come." These, <lb/>
            and others like these, I know were pronounced by Musæus in <lb/>
            reference to the Persians; but the river Thermodon flows be­ <lb/>
            tween Tanagra and Glisas.</p>
          <p>44. After the inquiry respecting the oracles, and the ex­ <lb/>
            hortation given by Mardonius, night came on, and they set the <lb/>
            watch. But when the night was far advanced, and silence <lb/>
            appeared to prevail throughout the camps, and the men were <lb/>
            in the most profound sleep, at that time Alexander, son of <lb/>
            Amyntas, who was general and king of the Macedonians, hav­ <lb/>
            ing ridden up on horseback to the sentries of the Athenians, <lb/>
            desired to confer with their generals. Most of the sentries re- <pb n="563"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="45, 46.] "/>mained at their post, while some ran to the generals, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing arrived told them, “ that a man had come on horseback <lb/>
            from the camp of the Medes, who uttered not a word more, <lb/>
            but, naming the generals, said he wished to confer with them." <lb/>
            45. When they heard this, they immediately followed to the <lb/>
            out-posts; and on their arrival Alexander addressed them as <lb/>
            follows: “ 0 Athenians, I leave these words with you as a <lb/>
            deposit, entreating you to keep them secret, and not tell them <lb/>
            to any other than Pausanias, lest you should even ruin me. <lb/>
            For I should not utter them, were I not extremely concerned <lb/>
            for the safety of all Greece; for I am both myself a Grecian <lb/>
            originally, and would by no means wish to see Greece enslaved <lb/>
            instead of free. I tell you, then, that the victims have not <lb/>
            been favourable to Mardonius and his army, or else you would <lb/>
            have fought long ago; but now, he has determined to dismiss <lb/>
            the victims, and to come to an engagement at dawn of day;. <lb/>
            fearing, as I conjecture, lest you should assemble in greater <lb/>
            numbers. Therefore be ready. But if Mardonius should <lb/>
            defer the engagement, and not undertake it, do you persevere <lb/>
            remaining where you are, for in a few days provisions will <lb/>
            fail him. And if this war should terminate according to your <lb/>
            wishes, it is right that you should bear it in mind to effect <lb/>
            my freedom, who on behalf of the Greeks have undertaken so <lb/>
            hazardous a task, out of zeal for them, wishing to acquaint you <lb/>
            with the intention of Mardonius, in order that the barbarians <lb/>
            may not fall upon you unexpectedly. I am Alexander the <lb/>
            Macedonian." He, having spoken thus, rode back to the <lb/>
            camp and his own station.</p>
          <p>46. The generals of the Athenians, having gone to the right <lb/>
            wing, told Pausanias what they had heard from Alexander; <lb/>
            but he, on receiving this intelligence, being in dread of the <lb/>
            Persian, spoke thus: " Seeing an engagement will take place <lb/>
            in the morning, it is proper that you Athenians should be. <lb/>
            placed opposite to the Persians, and we opposite to the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians and those Grecians who are now drawn up opposite to <lb/>
            you, for this reason: you are acquainted with the Medes, and <lb/>
            their manner of fighting, having fought with them at Mara­ <lb/>
            thon; whereas we are inexperienced in and unacquainted <lb/>
            with those men, for no Spartan has ever made trial of the <lb/>
            Medes; but we have made trial of the Bœotians and Thes­ <lb/>
            salians. It is therefore right that you should take up your <note type="footnote">2o 2 </note> <pb n="564"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[47-49."/> <lb/>
            arms and come to this wing, and we go to the left." To this <lb/>
            the Athenians answered as follows: " To us also from the very <lb/>
            first, when we saw the Persians drawn opposite to you, it oc­ <lb/>
            curred to mention the very thing which you have now been <lb/>
            the first to propose; but we feared that the proposal might <lb/>
            not be agreeable to you ; since, however, you yourselves have <lb/>
            mentioned it, the proposal is both agreeable to us, and we are <lb/>
            ready to act accordingly. 47. As this pleased both parties, as <lb/>
            soon as morning dawned they changed their stations: the <lb/>
            Bœotians having perceived what was done, gave notice to <lb/>
            Mardonius ; and he, when he had heard it, immediately began <lb/>
            to alter his order of battle, leading the Persians opposite to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. But when Pausanias observed that this was <lb/>
            being done, perceiving that he was discovered, he led the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans back to the right wing; and Mardonius in like manner <lb/>
            towards the left.</p>
          <p>48. When they were stationed in their original positions, <lb/>
            Mardonius, having sent a herald to the Spartans, spoke as <lb/>
            follows: " 0 Lacedæmonians, you are said to be the bravest, <lb/>
            by the people in these parts, who admire you exceedingly, be­ <lb/>
            cause you neither fly from the field of battle, nor quit your <lb/>
            ranks, but continuing firm, either kill your adversaries, or are <lb/>
            killed yourselves. Of all this however nothing is true. For <lb/>
            even before we engaged, and came to the decision of blows, <lb/>
            we have seen you flying and quitting your ranks, leaving the <lb/>
            first risk to the Athenians, and ranging yourselves against our <lb/>
            slaves; this is by no means the conduct of brave men: we, <lb/>
            then, have been very much deceived in you ; for whereas we <lb/>
            expected, on account of your renown, that you would have <lb/>
            sent a herald to challenge us, and that you would be desirous <lb/>
            of fighting with the Persians alone, though we were ready to <lb/>
            accept these terms, we have found you proposing nothing of <lb/>
            the kind, but rather shrinking from us. Now, therefore, since <lb/>
            you have not begun this proposal, we will begin it; why, then, <lb/>
            should not you, on the part of the Greeks, since you are deemed <lb/>
            to be the bravest, and we, on the part of the barbarians, en­ <lb/>
            gage with equal numbers on both sides ? If you think the <lb/>
            rest ought also to fight, let them fight afterwards; but if you <lb/>
            do not thick so, and that we only are sufficient, we will fight it <lb/>
            out; and whichever of us shall obtain the victory, let them be <lb/>
            victorious for the whole army." 49. He having spoken thus, <pb n="565"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="50, 61.] "/>and waited some time, when no one gave him any answer, <lb/>
            returned back again, and on his arrival gave Mardonius an <lb/>
            account of what had happened. But he, being above measure <lb/>
            rejoiced and elated by a cold victory, sent his cavalry to <lb/>
            charge the Greeks. When the horsemen rode up they harassed <lb/>
            the whole Grecian army, hurling javelins and shooting arrows, <lb/>
            since they were mounted archers, and very difficult to be <lb/>
            brought to a close engagement; and they disturbed and choked <lb/>
            up the fountain of Gargaphia, from which the whole Grecian <lb/>
            army obtained water. Near this fountain the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            only were posted, but the fountain was farther off from the <lb/>
            rest of the Greeks according as they severally happened to be <lb/>
            stationed ; but the Asopus was near. However, being re­ <lb/>
            pulsed from the Asopus, they then had recourse to the foun­ <lb/>
            tain ; for it was impossible for them to get water from the <lb/>
            river, by reason of the cavalry and the arrows.</p>
          <p>50. When this happened, the generals of the Greeks, as the <lb/>
            army was deprived of water and harassed by the cavalry, as­ <lb/>
            sembled together to deliberate on these and other matters, <lb/>
            going to Pausanias on the right wing. For when these things <lb/>
            were so, other circumstances troubled them still more; for <lb/>
            they had no longer any provisions, and their attendants, who <lb/>
            had been despatched to the Peloponnesus to get provisions, <lb/>
            were shut out by the cavalry, and unable to reach the camp. <lb/>
            51. On consultation the generals resolved, if the Persians <lb/>
            should defer making the attack on that day, to remove to the <lb/>
            island. This island is ten stades distant from the Asopus and <lb/>
            the fountain of Gargaphia, on which they were then encamped, <lb/>
            before the city of the Platæans. Thus it is an island in the <lb/>
            midst of the continent. For the river, dividing itself higher <lb/>
            up, flows down to the plain from Mount Cithæron, having its <lb/>
            streams about three stades separate from each other ; and then <lb/>
            they unite together, and the name of it is Oëroë; the inhabitants <lb/>
            say that she is the daughter of Asopus. To this place they <lb/>
            determined to remove, that they might have an abundant sup­ <lb/>
            ply of water, and the cavalry might not harass them, as when <lb/>
            they were directly opposite. They determined to remove <lb/>
            when it should be the second watch of the night, in order that <lb/>
            the Persians might not see them setting out, and the cavalry <lb/>
            might not follow and annoy them. They also resolved, that <lb/>
            when they should arrive at this spot which the Asopian Oëroë <pb n="566"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[52-54 "/>encompasses flowing from Cithæron, they would on the same <lb/>
            night send away one half of their forces to Cithaeron, in order <lb/>
            to bring in the attendants who had gone for provisions; for <lb/>
            they were shut up in Cithæron. 52. Having taken these re • <lb/>
            solutions, during the whole of that day, they suffered inces­ <lb/>
            sant labour by the cavalry pressing on them ; but when the day <lb/>
            ended, and the cavalry had ceased to attack them, night hav­ <lb/>
            ing come, and it being the hour at which they had agreed to <lb/>
            decamp, thereupon the greater part taking up their arms <lb/>
            marched away, without any intention of going to the place <lb/>
            agreed upon : whilst others, as soon as they were put in <lb/>
            motion, gladly fled from the cavalry towards the city of <lb/>
            the Platæans; and in their flight they arrived at the <lb/>
            temple of Juno: it stands before the city of the Platæans, <lb/>
            twenty stades distant from the fountain of Gargaphia ; <lb/>
            and having arrived there, they stood to their arms before <lb/>
            the sacred precinct. 53. They then encamped round the <lb/>
            Heræum ; and Pausanias, seeing them departing from the <lb/>
            camp, ordered the Lacedœmonians also to take up their arms <lb/>
            and go in the same direction as the others, supposing they <lb/>
            were going to the place which they had agreed to go to. <lb/>
            Whereupon all the other commanders of troops were ready <lb/>
            to obey Pausanias; but Amompharetus, son of Poliades, <lb/>
            captain of the band of Pitanetæ, said, " he would not fly from <lb/>
            the foreigners, nor willingly bring disgrace on Sparta;" and <lb/>
            he was astonished at seeing what was being done, because he <lb/>
            had not been present at the preceding conference. Pausanias <lb/>
            and Euryanax considered it a disgrace that he should not obey <lb/>
            them, but still more disgraceful, when he7 had so resolved, to <lb/>
            forsake the band of Pitanetæ, lest if they should forsake him <lb/>
            in order to do what they had agreed on with the rest of the <lb/>
            Grecians, Amompharetus himself, being left behind, and those <lb/>
            with him should perish. Considering these things, they kept <lb/>
            the Laconian forces unmoved, and endeavoured to persuade <lb/>
            him that it was not right for him to do as he did.</p>
          <p>54. They, then, were expostulating with Amompharetus, <lb/>
            who alone of the Lacedæmonians and Tegeans was left be­ <lb/>
            hind. But the Athenians did as follows : they kept themselves <lb/>
            unmoved where they had been stationed, knowing the dispo­ <lb/>
            sitions of the Lacedæmonians, who purpose one thing and say <note type="footnote"> * Amompharetus. </note> <pb n="567"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="55—57.]"/> <lb/>
            another. When, therefore, the army was in motion, they sent <lb/>
            one of their horsemen to see whether the Spartans were be­ <lb/>
            ginning to depart, or whether they did not intend to depart <lb/>
            at all; and to inquire of Pausanias what it was right to do. <lb/>
            55. When the herald came up to the Lacedæmonians, he saw <lb/>
            them drawn up in the same spot, and their chiefs engaged in <lb/>
            disputes. For when Euryanax and Pausanias urged Amom­ <lb/>
            pharetus not to incur danger by remaining with his men alone <lb/>
            of all the Lacedæmonians, they were by no means able to pre­ <lb/>
            vail with him, until they fell into an open quarrel; and the <lb/>
            herald of the Athenians having come up stood by them. And <lb/>
            Amompharetus quarrelling, took up a stone with both his <lb/>
            hands, and laying it down at the feet of Pausanias, said, <lb/>
            " With this pebble I give my vote, not to fly from the foreign­ <lb/>
            ersby foreigners meaning the barbarians. But Pausanias, <lb/>
            calling him a mad-man and out of his senses, then turned to <lb/>
            the herald of the Athenians, who was making the inquiry he <lb/>
            had been ordered to make, and bade him inform them of the <lb/>
            present posture of affairs, and entreated the Athenians to come <lb/>
            over to them, and act, in relation to the departure, just as they <lb/>
            should. 56. He accordingly went back to the Athenians. <lb/>
            But when morning found them still disputing with one ano­ <lb/>
            ther, Pausanias, having stayed during all that time, and sup­ <lb/>
            posing (as indeed happened) that Amompharetus would not <lb/>
            stay behind when the rest of the Lacedæmonians were gone, <lb/>
            having given the signal, led all the rest away along the hills ; <lb/>
            and the Tegeans followed. But the Athenians, drawn up in <lb/>
            order of battle, marched by a different way from the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ; for they kept to the rising ground and the base of <lb/>
            Cithæron, through fear of the cavalry; but the Athenians <lb/>
            took their route towards the plain. 57. But Amompharetus, <lb/>
            thinking that Pausanias would on no account dare to forsake <lb/>
            them, was very earnest that they should remain there and not <lb/>
            abandon their post; but when those with Pausanias had ad­ <lb/>
            vanced some distance, supposing that they were in real earnest <lb/>
            deserting him, he ordered his band to take up their arms, <lb/>
            and led them slowly towards the main body; which, having <lb/>
            marched about ten stades, waited for the band of Amompha­ <lb/>
            retus, halting at the river Moloeis, at a place called Argiopius, <lb/>
            where stands a temple of Eleusinian Ceres; and they waited <lb/>
            there for this reason, that if Amompharetus and his hand <pb n="568"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[58, 60"/> <lb/>
            should not leave the post in which they had been stationed, <lb/>
            but should remain there, they might go back to their assist­ <lb/>
            ance. However, those with Amompharetus came up; and <lb/>
            the whole of the barbarian's cavalry pressed upon them. For <lb/>
            the horsemen did as they were always accustomed to do ; but <lb/>
            seeing the place empty in which the Greeks had been drawn <lb/>
            up on the preceding days, they pushed on continually in ad­ <lb/>
            vance, and as soon as they overtook them, they pressed them <lb/>
            closely.</p>
          <p>58. Mardonius, when he was informed that the Grecians <lb/>
            had withdrawn under cover of night, and saw the place <lb/>
            deserted, having summoned Thorax of Larissa, and his <lb/>
            brothers Eurypilus and Thrasydëius, said: " 0 sons of <lb/>
            Aleuas, what will you say now, when you see this ground <lb/>
            deserted ? For you, their neighbours, said that the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians never fled from battle, but were the first of men in <lb/>
            matters of war; these, whom you before saw changing their <lb/>
            station, and who now we all see have fled away during the <lb/>
            past night. They have clearly shown, when they had to come <lb/>
            to the issue of battle with those who are truly the most valiant <lb/>
            in the world, that being themselves good for nothing, they <lb/>
            have gained distinction among worthless Greeks. And I <lb/>
            readily forgave you, who are unacquainted with the Persians, <lb/>
            when you extolled them by whom you knew something had <lb/>
            been done: but I wondered more at Artabazus, that he should <lb/>
            dread the Lacedæmonians, and dreading them, should have <lb/>
            advanced a most cowardly opinion, that it was expedient to <lb/>
            remove our camp, and retire to the city of the Thebans to be <lb/>
            besieged: of this the king shall hereafter hear from me. But <lb/>
            these matters will be discussed elsewhere. For the present, <lb/>
            we must not suffer them to do what they intend, but they <lb/>
            must be pursued, until they shall be overtaken, and have given <lb/>
            us satisfaction for all the mischief they have done to the Per­ <lb/>
            sians." 59. Having spoken thus, he led the Persians at full <lb/>
            speed, crossing the Asopus in the track of the Greeks, as if <lb/>
            they had betaken themselves to flight; he directed his course <lb/>
            only against the Lacedæmonians and Tegeans; for on account <lb/>
            of the hills he did not discern the Athenians, who had turned <lb/>
            into the plain. The rest of the commanders of the barbarian's <lb/>
            brigades, seeing the Persians advancing to pursue the Greeks, <lb/>
            all immediately took up their standards, and pursued, each as <lb/>
             <pb n="569"/>
            quick as he could, without observing either rank or order: <lb/>
            thus they advanced with a shout and in a throng, as if the, <lb/>
            were about to overwhelm the Greeks.</p>
          <p>60. Pausanias, when the cavalry pressed on him, having <lb/>
            despatched a horseman to the Athenians with this message, <lb/>
            spoke as follows: " Men of Athens, when the mighty contest <lb/>
            lies before us, whether Greece shall be free or enslaved, we <lb/>
            are betrayed by the allies, (both we Lacedæmonians and you <lb/>
            Athenians,) who have fled away during the past night. It is <lb/>
            now, therefore, determined what we must henceforth do; for <lb/>
            defending ourselves in the best manner we can, we must sup­ <lb/>
            port each other. Now if the cavalry had attacked you first, <lb/>
            it would have behoved us and the Tegeans, who with us have <lb/>
            not betrayed Greece, to assist you. But now, since the whole <lb/>
            body has advanced against us, you ought in justice to come <lb/>
            to the succour of that division which is most hardly pressed. <lb/>
            If, however, any inability to assist has befallen you, you will <lb/>
            confer a favour on us by sending your archers to us. We are <lb/>
            aware of your being by far the most zealous in this present <lb/>
            war, so as in this instance to listen to our request." 61. When <lb/>
            the Athenians heard this, they prepared to assist, and to de­ <lb/>
            fend them to the utmost of their power; but as they were <lb/>
            already on their way, those of the Greeks who sided with the <lb/>
            king, that were arrayed against them, attacked them, so that <lb/>
            they were no longer able to render assistance ; for the division <lb/>
            that pressed upon them harassed them. Thus the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and Tegeans being left alone, the former with the <lb/>
            light-armed men, amounting in number to fifty thousand, and <lb/>
            the Tegeans to three thousand, (for these last had never sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from the Lacedæmonians,) performed sacrifices, purpos­ <lb/>
            ing to engage with Mardonius and the forces with him. But <lb/>
            as the victims were not favourable to them, many of them fell <lb/>
            during this interval, and many more were wounded; for the <lb/>
            Persians, having made a fence with their osier-shields, let fly <lb/>
            a number of arrows so incessantly, that, the Spartans being <lb/>
            hard pressed, and the victims continuing unfavourable, Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias, looking towards the temple of Juno of the Platæans, <lb/>
            invoked the goddess, praying that they might not be disap­ <lb/>
            pointed of their hopes.</p>
          <p>62. While he was yet making this invocation, the Tegeans, <lb/>
            starting <unclear>firat</unclear>, advanced against the barbarians; and immedi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="570"/>
            ately after the prayer of Pausanias, the victims became favour­ <lb/>
            able to the Lacedæmonians when they sacrificed. When some <lb/>
            time had elapsed, they also advanced against the Persians, and <lb/>
            the Persians withstood them, laying aside their bows. First <lb/>
            of all a battle took place about the fence of bucklers; and <lb/>
            when that was thrown down, an obstinate fight ensued near <lb/>
            the temple of Ceres, and for a long time, till at last they came <lb/>
            to a close conflict: for the barbarians laying hold of the enemy's <lb/>
            spears, broke them. And indeed, in courage and strength, <lb/>
            the Persians were not inferior; but being lightly armed, they <lb/>
            were moreover ignorant of military discipline, and not equal <lb/>
            to their adversaries in skill; but rushing forward singly, or <lb/>
            in tens, or more or fewer in a body, they fell upon the Spartans <lb/>
            and perished. 63. In that part where Mardonius happened <lb/>
            to be, fighting from a white horse, at the head of a thousand <lb/>
            chosen men, the best of the Persians, there they pressed their <lb/>
            adversaries most vigorously. For as long as Mardonius sur­ <lb/>
            vived, they held out, and defending themselves overthrew many <lb/>
            of the Lacedaemonians ; but when Mardonius had died, and <lb/>
            the troops stationed round him, which were the strongest, had <lb/>
            fallen, then the rest turned to flight, and gave way to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. Their dress, too, was particularly disadvan­ <lb/>
            tageous to them, being destitute of defensive armour; for being <lb/>
            light-armed, they had to contend with heavy-armed men. 64. <lb/>
            Here satisfaction for the death of Leonidas, according to the <lb/>
            oracle, was paid to the Spartans by Mardonius; and Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias, son of Cleombrotus, son to Anaxandrides, obtained the <lb/>
            most signal victory of all that we know of. (The names of <lb/>
            his earlier ancestors have been mentioned in the genealogy of <lb/>
            Leonidas ;8 for they were the same.) Mardonius died by the <lb/>
            hand of Aïmnestus, a man of distinction at Sparta, who, some <lb/>
            time after the Medic affairs, at the head of three hundred men, <lb/>
            engaged at Stenyclerus with all the Messenians, there being <lb/>
            war; and he himself perished and his three hundred. 65. The <lb/>
            Persians at Platæa, when they were put to flight by the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, fled in disorder to their own camp, and to the <lb/>
            wooden fortification which they had made in the Theban ter­ <lb/>
            ritory. It is a wonder to me, that, when they fought near <lb/>
            the grove of Ceres, not one of the barbarians was seen to <lb/>
            enter into the sacred enclosure, or to die in it, but most fell <note type="footnote">' See B. VII. char. 204. </note> <pb n="571"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="66—69.]"/> <lb/>
            round the precinct in unconsecrated ground. I am of opinion, <lb/>
            if it is allowable to form an opinion concerning divine things, <lb/>
            that the goddess would not receive them, because they had <lb/>
            burnt her royal temple at Eleusis. Such was the issue of this <lb/>
            battle.</p>
          <p>66. Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, from the very first had <lb/>
            disapproved of Mardonius being left by the king, and at that <lb/>
            time, though he strongly dissuaded him, he could not prevail, <lb/>
            urging him not to engage. He therefore acted as follows, be­ <lb/>
            ing displeased with the conduct of Mardonius. Those whom <lb/>
            Artabazus commanded, (and he had no small force, but to the <lb/>
            number of forty thousand men with him,) these, as soon as the <lb/>
            action commenced, well knowing what the result of the battle <lb/>
            would be, he drew up in order and advanced, having ordered <lb/>
            them to go where he should lead, whenever they should see <lb/>
            him advancing at a quick pace ; having given this order, he <lb/>
            led his forces as if to join in the engagement: but being in ad­ <lb/>
            vance of his troops, he discovered the Persians flying ; where­ <lb/>
            upon, he no longer led his forces in the same order, but fled <lb/>
            with all possible speed; neither towards the wooden fortifica­ <lb/>
            tion nor the walls of Thebes, but to the Phocians, wishing to <lb/>
            reach the Hellespont as soon as he could. These, then, took <lb/>
            that direction. 67. Although the rest of the Greeks in the <lb/>
            king's army behaved themselves ill on purpose, the Bœotians <lb/>
            fought with the Athenians for a considerable time. For those <lb/>
            Thebans who sided with the Mede displayed no little zeal, <lb/>
            fighting and not willingly behaving ill, so that three hundred <lb/>
            of them, the first and most valiant, fell there by the hands of <lb/>
            the Athenians: but when they also were put to flight, they <lb/>
            fled to Thebes, not as the Persians fled, and the whole throng <lb/>
            of the other allies, without having fought at all, or performed <lb/>
            any thing considerable. 68. And it is manifest to me that on <lb/>
            the side of the barbarians all depended on the Persians, since <lb/>
            the others, before they engaged with the enemy, fled at once, <lb/>
            because they saw the Persians flying. Accordingly all fled, <lb/>
            except the rest of the cavalry and especially the Bœotian : <lb/>
            they so far assisted the fugitives, keeping constantly close to <lb/>
            them against the enemy, and separating their friends who were <lb/>
            flying, from the Greeks. 69. The victors however followed, <lb/>
            pursuing and slaying the soldiers of Xerxes. In the midst of <lb/>
            this rout news came to the rest of the Greeks who were drawn <pb n="572"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[70."/> <lb/>
            up about the Heræum, and were absent from the battle, that <lb/>
            a battle had been fought, and Pausanias's party were vic­ <lb/>
            torious. When they heard this, without observing any kind <lb/>
            of order, the Corinthians took the road that leads by the base <lb/>
            of the mountain and the hills direct to the temple of Ceres, <lb/>
            and the Megarians and the Phliasians the most level of the <lb/>
            roads across the plain. But when the Megarians and Phli­ <lb/>
            asians were near the enemy, the Theban cavalry seeing them <lb/>
            hurrying on without any order, charged them with the horse, <lb/>
            which Asopodorus, son of Timander, commanded; and having <lb/>
            fallen on them they threw down and killed six hundred of <lb/>
            them, and pursuing the rest, drove them headlong to Mount <lb/>
            Cithæron. Thus they perished ingloriously.</p>
          <p>70. The Persians and the rest of the throng, when they ar­ <lb/>
            rived in their flight at the wooden wall, mounted the towers <lb/>
            before the Lacedæmonians came up, and having mounted it, <lb/>
            defended the wall in the best way they could; so that when <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians arrived, a vigorous battle took place be­ <lb/>
            fore the walls. For so long as the Athenians were absent, <lb/>
            the barbarians defended themselves, and had much the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over the Lacedæmonians, as they were not skilled in <lb/>
            attacking fortifications; but when the Athenians came up, <lb/>
            then a vehement fight at the walls took place, and continued <lb/>
            for a long time. But at length the Athenians, by their valour <lb/>
            and constancy, surmounted the wall, and made a breach; <lb/>
            there at length the Greeks poured in. The Tegeans entered <lb/>
            first within the wall; and these were they who plundered the <lb/>
            tent of Mardonius, and among other things took away the <lb/>
            manger for the horses, all of brass, and well worth seeing: <lb/>
            this manger of Mardonius the Tegeans placed in the temple of <lb/>
            the Alean Minerva ; but all the other things they took, they <lb/>
            carried to the same place as the rest of the Greeks. The bar­ <lb/>
            barians, when the wall had fallen, no longer kept in close <lb/>
            order, nor did any one think of valour; but they were in a <lb/>
            state of consternation, as so many myriads of men were en­ <lb/>
            closed within a small space; and the Greeks had such an easy <lb/>
            opportunity of slaughtering them, that of an army of three <lb/>
            hundred thousand men, except the forty thousand with which <lb/>
            Artabazus fled, not three thousand survived. Of Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians from Sparta, all that died in the engagement were <lb/>
            ninety-one ; of Tegeans, sixteen; and of Athenians, fifty-two. <pb n="573"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="71—73.]"/>
          <p>71. Of the barbarians, the infantry of the Persians find the <lb/>
            cavalry of the Sacæ most distinguished themselves; and <lb/>
            Mardonius is said to have shown himself the bravest man. <lb/>
            Of the Greeks, though the Tegeans and Athenians showed <lb/>
            great bravery, the Lacedæmonians exceeded in valour. I can <lb/>
            prove this in no other way, (for all these conquered those op­ <lb/>
            posed to them,) except that they were engaged with the <lb/>
            strongest part of the enemy's army, and conquered them. And <lb/>
            in my opinion Aristodemus proved himself by far the bravest: <lb/>
            he being the only one of the three hundred saved from Ther­ <lb/>
            mopylæ, was held in disgrace and dishonour. After him, <lb/>
            Posidonius, Philocyon, and Amompharetus the Spartan, most <lb/>
            distinguished themselves. However, when it was debated <lb/>
            which of them had been the bravest, the Spartans who were <lb/>
            present decided, that Aristodemus, evidently wishing to die on <lb/>
            account of the disgrace attached to him, and acting like a mad- <lb/>
            man, and leaving the ranks, had performed great deeds; but that <lb/>
            Posidonius, not wishing to die, had shown himself a brave man ; <lb/>
            and therefore that he was the better. Perhaps, however, they <lb/>
            may have said this through envy. All these that I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned, except Aristodemus, of those that died in this battle, <lb/>
            were honoured, but Aristodemus, wishing to die on account of <lb/>
            the before-mentioned guilt, was not honoured. 72. These, then, <lb/>
            were they who acquired the greatest renown at Platæa. For <lb/>
            Callicratides died out of the battle, who came to the army the <lb/>
            handsomest man of the Greeks of that day, not only of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians themselves, but also of the other Greeks ; he, <lb/>
            when Pausanias was sacrificing, was wounded in the side by <lb/>
            an arrow ; and then they fought, but he being carried off, re­ <lb/>
            gretted his death, and said to Arimnestus a Platæan, that he <lb/>
            did not grieve at dying for Greece, but at not having used his <lb/>
            arm, and at not having performed any deed worthy of him­ <lb/>
            self, though he desired to perform it. 73. Of the Athenians, <lb/>
            Sophanes, son of Eutychides, of the borough of Decelea, is <lb/>
            said to have acquired great renown; of the Deceleans, who had <lb/>
            once performed an action that was beneficial for all future <lb/>
            time, as the Athenians themselves say. For in ancient time, <lb/>
            when the Tyndaridæ entered the Attic territory with a numer­ <lb/>
            ous army in search of Helen, and drove out the people, not <lb/>
            knowing where Helen had been carried to, then they say that <lb/>
            the Deceleans. but some say that Decelus himself, being in- <pb n="574"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[74—78 "/>dignant at the insolence of Theseus, and alarmed for the whole <lb/>
            country of the Athenians, discovered the whole matter to them, <lb/>
            and conducted them to Aphidnæ, which Titacus. a native of the <lb/>
            place, delivered up to the Tyndaridæ. In consequence of that <lb/>
            action, the Deceleans in Sparta continue to enjoy immunity <lb/>
            from tribute and precedence up to the present time, so that in; <lb/>
            the war that occurred many years after these events between <lb/>
            the Athenians and Peloponnesians, when the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            ravaged the rest of Attica, they abstained from Decelea. <lb/>
            74. Of this borough was Sophanes, and having at that time <lb/>
            distinguished himself above all the Athenians, he has two dif­ <lb/>
            ferent accounts given of him. One, that he carried an iron <lb/>
            anchor fastened by a brass chain from the girdle of his cuirass ; <lb/>
            which, when he approached the enemy, he used to throw out, <lb/>
            in order that the enemy, rushing from their ranks, might not <lb/>
            be able to move him from his position ; and when the flight of <lb/>
            his adversaries took place, he determined to take up the anchor, <lb/>
            and so pursue. Thus this account is given. But the other <lb/>
            account, varying from that before given, relates, that on his <lb/>
            shield, which constantly turned round and was never at rest, <lb/>
            lie wore an anchor as a device, and not one of iron fastened <lb/>
            from his cuirass. 75. There is also another splendid feat done <lb/>
            by Sophanes, for that when the Athenians invested Ægina, he <lb/>
            challenged and slew Eurybates of Argos, who had been victor <lb/>
            in the pentathlum. But some time after these events it betel <lb/>
            this Sophanes, who proved himself a brave man, as he was <lb/>
            commanding the Athenians jointly with Leagrus, son of <lb/>
            Glaucon, to die at the hands of the Edoni at Datus, as he was <lb/>
            fighting for the gold mines.</p>
          <p>76. When the barbarians were overthrown by the Greeks <lb/>
            at Platæa, thereupon a woman came voluntarily over to them ; <lb/>
            who, when she learnt that the Persians had perished, and that <lb/>
            the Greeks were victorious, being a concubine of Pharandates, <lb/>
            son of Theaspes, a Persian, having decked herself and her <lb/>
            attendants in much gold, and in the richest attire she had, <lb/>
            alighted from her carriage, and advanced towards the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, who were still employed in slaughter, and when <lb/>
            she observed that Pausanias directed every thing, having be­ <lb/>
            fore become acquainted with his name and country, since she <lb/>
            had often heard of them, she knew it must be Pausanias, and <lb/>
            embracing his knees, spoke as follows: " King of Sparta, de- <pb n="575"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="7,78.]"/> <lb/>
            iver me, your suppliant, from captive servitude; for you <lb/>
            lave thus far benefited me, by destroying these men, who <lb/>
            pay no regard either to gods or heroes. I am by birth a <lb/>
            Coan, daughter to Hegetorides, son of Antagoras. The Per­ <lb/>
            lian having taken me away by force at Cos, kept me." He <lb/>
            mswered as follows : " Lady, be of good heart, both as a sup­ <lb/>
            )liant, and moreover, if you have spoken the truth, and are <lb/>
            ndeed the daughter of Hegetorides the Coan, who is the best <lb/>
            Friend I have of all who dwell in those parts." Having thus <lb/>
            ipoken, he committed her to the care of the ephori, who were <lb/>
            present; and afterwards sent her to Ægina, where she her­ <lb/>
            self wished to go. 77. Presently after the arrival of the lady, <lb/>
            lie Mantineans came up when all was over ; and finding they <lb/>
            vere come too late for the engagement, they considered it a <lb/>
            ;reat calamity, and confessed that they deserved to be punish­ <lb/>
            ed. But being informed that the Medes with Artabazus had <lb/>
            led, they wished to pursue them as far as Thessaly; but the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians dissuaded them from pursuing the fugitives. <lb/>
            riiey therefore, having returned to their own country, banish­ <lb/>
            ed the generals of their army from the land. After the Man­ <lb/>
            ineans came the Eleans: and the Eleans, in the same manner <lb/>
            as the Mantineans, considering it a calamity, marched away; <lb/>
            and they also on their return home banished their generals. <lb/>
            Such were the events relating to the Mantineans and Eleans.</p>
          <p>78. In the camp of the Æginetæ at Platæa, was Lampon, <lb/>
            son of Pytheas, one of the most eminent of the Æginetæ: <lb/>
            ne having a most iniquitous proposal to make, went to Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias; and having come into his presence, spoke with earnest­ <lb/>
            less as follows: “Son of Cleombrotus, a superhuman feat <lb/>
            as been achieved by you, both on account of its greatness <lb/>
            and splendour; and God has granted to you, by delivering <lb/>
            Greece, to acquire the greatest renown of all the Greeks <lb/>
            whom we know of. But do you complete what remains to be <lb/>
            one after this, in order that still greater fame may attend <lb/>
            you, and henceforth every barbarian may beware of attempting <lb/>
            o do wicked deeds against the Greeks. For when Leonidas <lb/>
            led at Thermopylae, Mardonius and Xerxes, having cut off <lb/>
            is head, fixed it on a pole. By requiting him in the same <lb/>
            manner, you will have praise first from all the Spartans, and <lb/>
            hen from the rest of the Greeks. For by impaling Mardo­ <lb/>
            ius, you will avenge your uncle Leonidas." He spoke thus, <pb n="576"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[79—81."/> <lb/>
            thinking tc gratify Pausanias. 79. But he answered as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : " Æginetan friend, I admire your good intentions and <lb/>
            your foresight; but you have failed to form a right judgment; <lb/>
            for having highly extolled me, my country, and my achieve­ <lb/>
            ment, you have thrown all down again to nothing, by advising <lb/>
            me to insult a dead body, and saying, that if I do so I shall <lb/>
            increase my fame, which is more fit for barbarians to do than <lb/>
            Greeks, and which we abhor even in them. I cannot there­ <lb/>
            fore in this matter please the Æginetæ, nor those to whom <lb/>
            such things would be pleasing; it is sufficient for me to please <lb/>
            the Spartans, by doing and speaking what is right. As for <lb/>
            Leonidas, whose death you exhort me to avenge, I affirm, <lb/>
            that he has been amply avenged ; both he and all the others <lb/>
            who fell at Thermopylæ, have been avenged by the countless <lb/>
            deaths of these men. However, do not you hereafter come <lb/>
            to me with such a proposal, nor give such advice; and be <lb/>
            thankful that you escape unpunished." He having received <lb/>
            this answer, went away.</p>
          <p>80. Pausanias, having made proclamation that no one <lb/>
            should touch the booty, commanded the helots to bring toge­ <lb/>
            ther all the treasures.- They accordingly, dispersing them­ <lb/>
            selves through the camp, found tents decked with gold and <lb/>
            silver, and couches gilt, and plated and golden bowls, and cups <lb/>
            and other drinking vessels ; they also found sacks on the wag­ <lb/>
            gons in which were discovered gold and silver caldrons : and <lb/>
            from the bodies that lay dead they stripped bracelets, neck­ <lb/>
            laces, and scymetars of gold; but no account at all was taken <lb/>
            of the variegated apparel. Here the helots stole a great deal <lb/>
            and sold it to the Æginetæ, and they also produced a great <lb/>
            deal, such of it as they could not conceal: so that the great <lb/>
            wealth of the Æginetæ hence had its beginning, for that they <lb/>
            purchased gold from the helots as if it had been brass. 81. <lb/>
            Having collected the treasures together, and taken from them a <lb/>
            tithe for the god at Delphi, from which the golden tripod was <lb/>
            dedicated, which stands on the three-headed brazen serpent, <lb/>
            close to the altar ; and having taken out a tithe for the god at <lb/>
            Olympia, from which they dedicated the brazen Jupiter, ten <lb/>
            cubits high; and a tithe to the god at the Isthmus, from which <lb/>
            was made the brazen Neptune, seven cubits high ; having <lb/>
            taken out these, they divided the rest, and each took the share <lb/>
            they were entitled to, as well the concubines of the Persians, <pb n="577"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="82-84.] "/>as the gold, silver, and other treasures, and beasts of burden. <lb/>
            Now what choice presents were given to those who most dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished themselves at Plataea, is mentioned by no one; yet <lb/>
            I am of opinion that such presents were given to them. But <lb/>
            for Pausanias ten of every thing was selected and given him, <lb/>
            women, horses, talents, camels, and all other treasures in like <lb/>
            manner. 82. It is said also that the following occurred: that <lb/>
            Xerxes, flying from Greece, left all his own equipage to Mar­ <lb/>
            donius ; Pausanias, therefore, seeing Mardonius's equipage <lb/>
            furnished with gold, silver, and various-coloured hangings, or­ <lb/>
            dered the bakers and cooks to prepare a supper in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner as for Mardonius: and when they being ordered had so done, <lb/>
            that Pausanias thereupon, seeing gold and silver couches hand­ <lb/>
            somely carved, and gold and silver tables, and magnificent pre­ <lb/>
            parations for the supper, being astonished at the profusion set <lb/>
            before him, in derision ordered his own attendants to prepare a <lb/>
            Laconian supper; and that when the repast was spread, the <lb/>
            difference was great, and Pausanias laughing sent for the gene­ <lb/>
            rals of the Greeks; and when they had assembled, Pausanias, <lb/>
            pointing to each preparation for supper, said, " Men of Greece, <lb/>
            I have called you together for this reason, to show you the <lb/>
            folly of the leader of the Modes ; who having such fare as <lb/>
            this, has come to us, who have such poor fare, to take it from <lb/>
            us." It 'is related that Pausanias said this to the generals of <lb/>
            the Greeks. 83. A considerable time after these events, <lb/>
            many of the Platæans found chests of gold and silver, and <lb/>
            other precious things. And still later than this, the following <lb/>
            also was discovered, when the bodies were bared of flesh; for <lb/>
            the Platæans brought together the bones to one place; there <lb/>
            was found a skull without any seam, consisting of one bone ; <lb/>
            there was also discovered a jaw, and the upper jaw had teeth <lb/>
            growing in a piece, all in one bone, both the front teeth and <lb/>
            the grinders ; there was likewise discovered the skeleton of a <lb/>
            man five cubits high.</p>
          <p>84. The next day after, the body of Mardonius had disap­ <lb/>
            peared ; by whom removed, I am unable to say for certain. I <lb/>
            have indeed heard of many men and of various nations, who <lb/>
            are said to have buried Mardonius, and I know that several <lb/>
            have received large presents from Artontes, son of Mardo­ <lb/>
            nius, for so doing. Yet who of them it was that carried off <lb/>
            and buried the body of Mardonius, I am unable to ascertain <note type="footnote"> 2 P </note> <pb n="578"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[85—87"/> <lb/>
            with certainty. However, Dionysiophanes, an Ephesian, is <lb/>
            commonly reported to have buried Mardonius. Thus, then, <lb/>
            he was buried. 85. But the Greeks, when they had divided <lb/>
            the booty at Platæa, buried their own dead, each nation sepa­ <lb/>
            rately. The Lacedæmonians made three graves ; there, then, <lb/>
            they buried the young officers,9 amongst whom were Posido­ <lb/>
            nius, Amompharetus, Phylocion, and Callicrates ; according- <lb/>
            ingly in one of the graves the young officers were laid; in <lb/>
            another, the rest of the Spartans; and in the third, the he­ <lb/>
            lots : thus they buried their dead. The Tegeans buried all <lb/>
            theirs together, in a separate spot; and the Athenians, theirs <lb/>
            in one place; as also did the Megareans and Phliasians, those <lb/>
            that had been destroyed by the cavalry. Of all these, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the sepulchres were full. But of all the others whose <lb/>
            sepulchres are seen in Platæa, they, as I am informed, being <lb/>
            ashamed of their absence from the battle, severally threw up <lb/>
            empty mounds, for the sake of future generations. For in­ <lb/>
            stance, there is a sepulchre there called that of the Æginetans, <lb/>
            which, I hear, Cleades, son of Autodieus, a Platæan, who was <lb/>
            their friend, threw up ten years after these events, at the re­ <lb/>
            quest of the Æginetans.</p>
          <p>86. When the Greeks had buried their dead in Platæa, they <lb/>
            immediately determined, on consultation, to march against <lb/>
            Thebes, and to demand the surrender of those who had sided <lb/>
            with the Medes, and amongst the first of them Timegenides <lb/>
            and Attaginus, who were the chief leaders, and if they should <lb/>
            not give them up, they resolved not to depart from the city <lb/>
            before they had taken it. When they had determined on this, <lb/>
            they thereupon, in the eleventh day after the engagement, ar­ <lb/>
            rived and besieged the Thebans, requiring them to give up <lb/>
            the men. And when the Thebans refused to give them up, <lb/>
            they both ravaged their country, and attacked the walls. 87. <lb/>
            As they did not cease damaging them, on the twentieth day <lb/>
            Timegenides spoke thus to the Thebans: " Men of Thebes, <lb/>
            since the Greeks have so resolved that they will not give over <lb/>
            besieging us until either they have taken Thebes, or you have <lb/>
            delivered us up to them, let not the Bœotian territory suffer <lb/>
            any more on our account. But if, being desirous of money, <note type="footnote">’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ίρένες</foreign> were those who had attained their second year from boyhood, <lb/>
            and now held a command. The MSS. read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱρέας</foreign>,“those who held sacred <lb/>
            offices." </note> <pb n="579"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="88, 89.] "/>they demand us as a pretence, let us give them money from the <lb/>
            public treasury; for we sided with the Mede by general con­ <lb/>
            sent, and not of ourselves alone. If, however, they carry on <lb/>
            the siege really because they want us, we will present our­ <lb/>
            selves before them to plead our cause." He appeared to speak <lb/>
            well and to the purpose; and the Thebans immediately sent a <lb/>
            herald to Pausanias, expressing their willingness to surrender <lb/>
            the men. 88. When they had agreed on these terms, Atta­ <lb/>
            ginus' escaped from the city, and his sons, who were brought <lb/>
            before him, Pausanias acquitted from the charge, saying that <lb/>
            boys could have no part in the guilt of siding with the Mede. <lb/>
            As to the others whom the Thebans delivered up, they thought <lb/>
            that they should be admitted to plead their cause, and more­ <lb/>
            over trusted to repel the charge by bribery; but he, as soon <lb/>
            as he had them in his power, suspecting this very thing, dis­ <lb/>
            missed the whole army of the allies, and conducting the men <lb/>
            to Corinth, put them to death. Such were the events at <lb/>
            Platæa and Thebes.</p>
          <p>89. In the mean time Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, flying <lb/>
            from Platæa, was already at a considerable distance. And on <lb/>
            his arrival amongst them, the Thessalians invited him to an <lb/>
            entertainment, and asked him news of the rest of the army, <lb/>
            knowing nothing of what had happened in Platæa. But Arta­ <lb/>
            bazus, being aware that if he should tell the whole truth re­ <lb/>
            specting the conflicts, both he and his army would be in danger <lb/>
            of destruction, for he thought that every one would attack him, <lb/>
            when informed of what had happened;—considering this, he <lb/>
            told nothing to the Phocians, and to the Thessalians he spoke <lb/>
            as follows: " I, 0 men of Thessaly, as you see, am hastening <lb/>
            my march to Thrace with the utmost expedition, and am using <lb/>
            all possible diligence, having been sent on certain business <lb/>
            with these forces from the army. Mardonius himself and his <lb/>
            army may be expected following close on my heels. Entertain <lb/>
            him also, and do him all the good offices you can; for you <lb/>
            will never have cause to repent of doing so." Having said <lb/>
            this, he marched his army with all speed through Thessaly <lb/>
            and Macedonia direct towards Thrace, making all the haste <lb/>
            he could, and cutting across by the inland road. At last he <lb/>
            reached Byzantium, having left many of his men behind, <lb/>
            partly cut off by the Thracians on the march, and partly <lb/>
            having to contend with hunger and fatigue. From Byzan- <note type="footnote"> 2P2 </note> <pb n="580"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[90- 92 "/>tium he crossed over in boats. Thus, then, he returned <lb/>
            to Asia.</p>
          <p>90. On the same day on which the defeat at Plat--a oc­ <lb/>
            curred, another happened to take place at Mycale in Ionia. <lb/>
            For while the Greeks1 were stationed at Delos, those who had <lb/>
            gone there on ship-board with Leotychides the Lacedæmonian, <lb/>
            there came to them as ambassadors from Samos, Lampon, son <lb/>
            of Thrasycleus, Athenagoras, son of Archestratides, and He­ <lb/>
            gesistratus, son of Aristagoras, being sent by the Samians, <lb/>
            unknown to the Persians and the tyrant Theomestor, son of <lb/>
            Androdamas, whom the Persians had made tyrant of Samos. <lb/>
            When they came to the generals, Hegesistratus used many <lb/>
            and various arguments, and that " if only the Ionians should <lb/>
            see them, they would revolt from the Persians, and that the <lb/>
            barbarians would not withstand them; or if they should with­ <lb/>
            stand them, the Greeks would not find any other such booty." <lb/>
            Invoking, too, their common gods, he besought them to deliver <lb/>
            Grecian men from servitude, and to repel the barbarian; and <lb/>
            he said, " that this would be easy for them to do, for that their <lb/>
            ships sailed badly, and were not fit to fight with them ; and, <lb/>
            if they suspected at all that they were leading them on deceit- <lb/>
            fully, they were themselves ready to go on board their ships <lb/>
            as hostages." 91. As the Samian stranger was earnest in his <lb/>
            entreaties, Leotychides, either wishing to hear for the sake of <lb/>
            the presage, or by chance, the deity so directing it, asked: <lb/>
            "0 Samian friend, what is your name?. He answered: <lb/>
            " Hegesistratus;” upon which he, interrupting the rest of his <lb/>
            discourse, if Hegesistratus intended to add more, said: “I <lb/>
            accept2 the Hegesistratus, my Samian friend; only do you <lb/>
            take care that before you sail away, both you yourself and <lb/>
            those who are with you, pledge your faith that the Samians <lb/>
            will be zealous allies to us." 92. He at the same time said <lb/>
            this, and added the deed. For the Samians immediately pledged <lb/>
            their faith and made oath of confederacy with the Greeks: <lb/>
            and having done this, the others sailed home, but he ordered <lb/>
            Hegesistratus to sail with the fleet, regarding his name as an <lb/>
            omen. The Greeks, therefore, having tarried that day, on the <lb/>
            next sacrificed auspiciously, Deiphonus, son of Evenius, of <lb/>
            A pollonia in the Ionian gulf, acting as diviner. <note type="footnote"> 1 See B. VIII. chap. 131, 132. </note><note type="footnote"> ' Hegesistratus means, " leader of an army." </note> <pb n="581"/>

          <p>93 The following incident betel <unclear>M</unclear>..(wrther, Evenius. There <lb/>
            are in this Apollonia sheep sacred to the sun, which by day <lb/>
            feed near the river that flows from Mount Lacmon through <lb/>
            the Apollonian territory into the sea, near the port of Oricus; <lb/>
            but by night, chosen men, the most eminent of the citizens <lb/>
            for wealth and birth, keep watch over them, each for a year: <lb/>
            for the Apollonians set a high value upon these sheep, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of some oracle. They are folded in a cavern at a <lb/>
            distance from the city. There, then, on a time, Evenius, being <lb/>
            chosen, kept watch, and one night when he had fallen asleep <lb/>
            during his watch, wolves entered the cave, and destroyed about <lb/>
            sixty of the sheep. He, when he discovered what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened, kept silence, and mentioned it to no one, purposing to <lb/>
            buy others, and put them in their place. This occurrence, <lb/>
            however, did not escape the notice of the Apollonians; but <lb/>
            as soon as they discovered it, having brought him to trial, <lb/>
            they gave sentence that, for having fallen asleep during his <lb/>
            watch, he should be deprived of sight. When they had blinded <lb/>
            Evenius, from that time forward neither did their sheep bring <lb/>
            forth, nor did the land yield its usual fruit. An admonition <lb/>
            was given them at Dodona and Delphi, when they inquired <lb/>
            of the prophets the cause of the present calamities; they told <lb/>
            them, " that they had unjustly deprived Evenius, the keeper <lb/>
            of the sacred sheep, of his sight; for that they themselves <lb/>
            had sent the wolves, and would not cease avenging him, until <lb/>
            they should give such satisfaction for what they had done, as <lb/>
            he himself should choose, and think sufficient: and when they <lb/>
            had done this, the gods themselves would give such a present <lb/>
            to Evenius, that most men would pronounce him happy, from <lb/>
            possessing it." 94. This answer was delivered to them: and <lb/>
            the Apollonians, having kept it secret, deputed some of their <lb/>
            citizens to negotiate the matter; and they negotiated it for <lb/>
            them in the following manner. When Evenius was seated on <lb/>
            a bench, they went and sat down by him, and conversed on <lb/>
            different subjects, till at length they began to commiserate his <lb/>
            misfortune, and having in this way artfully led him on, they <lb/>
            asked, " what reparation he would choose, if the Apollonians <lb/>
            were willing to give him satisfaction for what they had done." <lb/>
            He, not having heard of the oracle, made his choice, saying, <lb/>
            " if any one would give him the lands of certain citizens," <lb/>
            naming those who he knew had the two best estates in Apol • <pb n="582"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[95—97."/> <lb/>
            Ionia; " and besides these a house," which he knew was the <lb/>
            handsomest in the city; " if put in possession of these," he <lb/>
            said, " he would thenceforth forego his anger, and this repara­ <lb/>
            tion would content him." He accordingly spoke thus; and <lb/>
            those who sat by him, immediately taking hold of his answer <lb/>
            said, “ the Apollonians make you this reparation for the loss <lb/>
            of your eyes, in obedience to an oracle they have received." <lb/>
            He thereupon was very indignant, on hearing the whole truth, <lb/>
            as having been deceived; but the Apollonians, having bought <lb/>
            them from the owners, gave him what he chose; and imme­ <lb/>
            diately after this, he had the gift of divination implanted in <lb/>
            him, so that he became celebrated.</p>
          <p>95. Deiphonus, who was the son of this Evenius, the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians having brought him, officiated as diviner to the army. <lb/>
            Yet I have heard this also, that Deiphonus, having assumed <lb/>
            the name of Evenius's son, let out his services for hire through­ <lb/>
            out Greece, though he was not really the son of Evenius. <lb/>
            96. When, therefore, the sacrifices were favourable to the <lb/>
            Greeks, they got their ships under weigh from Delos for Sa­ <lb/>
            mos : and when they were off Calami of the Ionian territory, <lb/>
            having taken up their station there near the temple of Juno <lb/>
            on that coast, they made ready for an engagement. But the <lb/>
            Persians, being informed that they were sailing towards them, <lb/>
            on their part also got the other ships under weigh for the con­ <lb/>
            tinent, and permitted those of the Phœnicians to sail home. <lb/>
            For on consultation, they determined not to come to an en­ <lb/>
            gagement by sea, because they thought they were not equal. <lb/>
            They, therefore, sailed away to the continent, that they might <lb/>
            be under the protection of their land-forces that were at My­ <lb/>
            cale, which by the order of Xerxes had been left behind by <lb/>
            the rest of the army, and guarded Ionia; their number was <lb/>
            sixty thousand; Tigranes commanded them, who surpassed <lb/>
            the Persians in beauty and stature. Under the protection of <lb/>
            this army the commanders of the navy resolved, having fled, <lb/>
            to draw their ships on shore, and to throw up a rampart, as a <lb/>
            defence for the ships, and a place of refuge for themselves. <lb/>
            97. Having taken this resolution, they got under weigh: and <lb/>
            aaving passed by the temple of the Eumenides in Mycale, they <lb/>
            came to the Gæson and Scolopois, where is a temple of <lb/>
            Eleusinian Ceres, which Philistus, son of Pasicles, built, who <lb/>
            accompanied Neleus, son of Codrus, for the purpose of founds <lb/>
             <pb n="583"/>
            mg Miletus: there they drew their ships on shore, and threw <lb/>
            up a rampart of stone and wood, having cut down the fruit- <lb/>
            trees, and around the rampart they drove in sharp stakes. <lb/>
            They made preparations to sustain a siege, and to gain a vic­ <lb/>
            tory, both one and the other; for they made their preparations <lb/>
            deliberately.</p>
          <p>98. The Greeks, when they learnt that the barbarians had <lb/>
            gone to the continent, were vexed that they had escaped ; and <lb/>
            were in doubt what to do, whether they should return home, <lb/>
            or sail to the Hellespont: at length they determined to do <lb/>
            neither of these, but to sail to the continent: having therefore <lb/>
            prepared for a sea-fight both boarding-ladders, and all other <lb/>
            things that were necessary, they sailed to Mycale. When <lb/>
            they were near the camp, and no one was seen ready to meet <lb/>
            them, but they beheld the ships drawn up within the fortifica­ <lb/>
            tion, and a numerous land-force disposed along the beach, <lb/>
            thereupon Leotychides, advancing first in a ship, and nearing <lb/>
            the beach as much as possible, made proclamation by a herald <lb/>
            to the Ionians, saying, " Men of Ionia, as many of you as hear <lb/>
            me, attend to what I say; for the Persians will understand <lb/>
            nothing of the advice I give you. When we engage, it be­ <lb/>
            hoves every one first of all to remember Liberty; and next <lb/>
            the watch-word, Hebe; and let him who does not hear this, <lb/>
            learn it from those who do hear." The meaning of this pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding was the same as that of Themistocles at Artemisium; <lb/>
            for either these words, being concealed from the barbarians, <lb/>
            would induce the Ionians to revolt, or if they should be re­ <lb/>
            ported to the barbarians, would make them distrustful of the <lb/>
            Greeks. 99. Leotychides, having made this suggestion, the <lb/>
            Grecians in the next place did as follows : putting their ships <lb/>
            to shore they landed on the beach, and drew up in order of <lb/>
            battle. But the Persians, when they saw the Greeks prepar­ <lb/>
            ing themselves for action, and knew that they had admonished <lb/>
            the Ionians, in the first place suspecting that the Samians <lb/>
            favoured the Greeks, took away their arms; for when the <lb/>
            Athenian captives, whom, being left in Attica, the forces of <lb/>
            Xerxes had taken, arrived in the ships of the barbarians, hav­ <lb/>
            ing ransomed them all, they sent them back to Athens, <lb/>
            furnishing them with provisions for the voyage: on this ac­ <lb/>
            count they were under no slight suspicion, having redeemed <lb/>
            five hundred of the enemies of Xerxes. In the next place, <pb n="584"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[100-102."/> <lb/>
            the passes that lead to the heights of Mycale they appointed <lb/>
            the Milesians to guard, because forsooth they were best ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the country, but they did it for this purpose, <lb/>
            that they might be at a distance from the army. Those of the <lb/>
            Ionians, then, who they suspected might attempt something <lb/>
            new if they had the power, the Persians took such precautions <lb/>
            against; and they themselves brought their bucklers together, <lb/>
            to serve as a rampart.</p>
          <p>100. When, therefore, the Greeks were prepared, they ad­ <lb/>
            vanced towards the barbarians; and as they were marching, a <lb/>
            rumour flew through the whole army, and a herald's staff was <lb/>
            seen lying on the beach: the rumour that spread among them <lb/>
            was this, that the Greeks had fought and conquered the army <lb/>
            of Mardonius in Bœotia. Thus the interposition of heaven is <lb/>
            manifest by many plain signs; since on this same day on <lb/>
            which the defeat at Platæa took place, and when that at Mycale <lb/>
            was just about to happen, a rumour reached the Greeks in <lb/>
            this latter place ; so that the army was inspired with much <lb/>
            greater courage, and was more eager to meet danger. 101. <lb/>
            There was also this other coincidence, namely, that there was <lb/>
            a temple of Eleusinian Ceres near both the engagements. <lb/>
            For at Platæa, as I have already said, the battle took place <lb/>
            near the temple of Ceres; and at Mycale it was about to hap­ <lb/>
            pen in like manner. The rumour that a victory had been ob­ <lb/>
            tained by the Greeks under Pausanias, turned out to be cor­ <lb/>
            rect ; for the battle of Platæa was fought while it was yet early <lb/>
            in the day, and that of Mycale towards evening : and that <lb/>
            both happened on the same day of the same month, not long <lb/>
            afterwards became manifest on inquiry. Before the rumour <lb/>
            reached them, great alarm prevailed amongst them, not so <lb/>
            much for themselves, as for the Greeks, lest Greece should <lb/>
            stumble in the contest with Mardonius. When, however, <lb/>
            this report flew amongst them, they advanced with greater <lb/>
            readiness and alacrity. Accordingly the Greeks and the bar­ <lb/>
            barians hastened to the battle, as both the islands and the <lb/>
            Hellespont were held out as the reward of victory.</p>
          <p>102. The Athenians, and those who were drawn up next <lb/>
            them, forming about half the army, had to advance along the <lb/>
            shore over level ground; but the Lacedæmonians, and those <lb/>
            drawn up near them, along a ravine and some hills. So that <lb/>
            whilst the Lacedæmonians were making a circuit, those in the <pb n="585"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="103,104. J"/> <lb/>
            other wing were already engaged. Now, so long as the buck­ <lb/>
            lers of the Persians remained standing, they defended them­ <lb/>
            selves strenuously, and had not the worst of the battle; but <lb/>
            when the Athenians and those next them, having mutually <lb/>
            encouraged one another, in order that the victory might belong <lb/>
            to them, and not the Lacedæmonians, applied with more <lb/>
            vigour to the battle, then the face of affairs immediately <lb/>
            changed; for having broke through the bucklers, they fell <lb/>
            in a body on the Persians ; and they having sustained their <lb/>
            attack and defended themselves for a considerable time, at last <lb/>
            fled to the fortification. The Athenians, Corinthians, Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians, and Trcezenians, for thus they were drawn up in order, <lb/>
            following close upon them, rushed into the fortification at the <lb/>
            same time. When, therefore, the fortification was taken, the <lb/>
            barbarians no longer thought of resisting, but all except the <lb/>
            Persians betook themselves to flight; they, in small detach­ <lb/>
            ments, fought with the Greeks who were continually rushing <lb/>
            within the fortification. And of the Persian 'generals, two <lb/>
            made their escape, and two died. Artayntes and Ithramitres, <lb/>
            commanders of the naval forces, escaped; but Mardontes, and <lb/>
            Tigranes, general of the land army, died fighting. 103. While <lb/>
            the Persians were still fighting, the Lacedæmonians and those <lb/>
            with them came up, and assisted in accomplishing the rest. <lb/>
            Of the Greeks themselves many fell on this occasion ; both <lb/>
            others, and especially the Sicyonians, and their general Peri­ <lb/>
            laus. The Samians, who were in the camp of the Modes, and <lb/>
            had been deprived of their arms, as soon as they saw the battle <lb/>
            turning, did all they could, wishing to help the Greeks; and <lb/>
            the rest of the Ionians, seeing the Samians lead the way, <lb/>
            thereupon revolted from the Persians and attacked the bar­ <lb/>
            barians. 104. The Milesians had been appointed to guard <lb/>
            the passes for the Persians, in order for their safety, to the end <lb/>
            that, if that should befal them which did befal them, they might, <lb/>
            having guides, get safe to the heights of Mycale. The Milesi­ <lb/>
            ans accordingly had been appointed to this service for this <lb/>
            reason, and in order that, by being present in the army, they <lb/>
            might not form any new design.. They, however, did every <lb/>
            thing contrary to what was ordered; both guiding them in <lb/>
            their night by other ways which led to the enemy, and at last <lb/>
            themselves became most hostile in slaying them. Thus Ionia <pb n="586"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[105—107."/> <lb/>
            revolted a second time from the Persians. 105. In this battle <lb/>
            of the Greeks, the Athenians most distinguished themselves ; <lb/>
            and of the Athenians, Hermolycus, son of Euthynus, who had <lb/>
            practised in the pancratium: it befel this Hermolycus after <lb/>
            these events, when there was war between the Athenians and <lb/>
            the Carystians, to die fighting at Cyrnus of the Carystian <lb/>
            territory, and to be buried at Geræstus. After the Athenians, <lb/>
            the Corinthians, Trcezenians, and Sicyonians distinguished <lb/>
            themselves. 106. When the Grecians had killed most of the <lb/>
            barbarians, some fighting and others flying, they burnt the <lb/>
            ships and the whole fortification, having first brought out all <lb/>
            the booty on the beach; and they found several chests of <lb/>
            money, and having burnt the fortification and the ships they <lb/>
            sailed away. The Greeks, having arrived at Samos, con­ <lb/>
            sulted about transplanting the Ionians, and in what part of <lb/>
            Greece, of which they themselves were masters, it would be <lb/>
            best to settle them, intending to leave Ionia to the barbarians: <lb/>
            for it was clearly impossible for them to protect and guard the <lb/>
            Ionians for ever; and if they did not protect them, they had <lb/>
            no hope that the Ionians would escape unpunished by the <lb/>
            Persians. Upon this it seemed expedient to the men of rank <lb/>
            among the Peloponnesians to remove the marts of the Grecian <lb/>
            nations that had sided with the Medes, and give their territory <lb/>
            to the Ionians to inhabit; but it did not appear at all expedi­ <lb/>
            ent to the Athenians that the Ionians should be removed, or <lb/>
            that the Peloponnesians should give advice respecting their <lb/>
            colonies. However, as they opposed, the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            readily gave way: and accordingly they took into the alliance <lb/>
            the Samians, Chians, Lesbians, and other islanders, who were <lb/>
            then serving with the Greeks, binding them by pledges and <lb/>
            oaths that they would remain firm and not revolt: when they <lb/>
            had bound them by oaths, they set sail to destroy the bridges, <lb/>
            for they expected to find them still stretched across: accord­ <lb/>
            ingly they sailed to the Hellespont.</p>
          <p>107. The barbarians who fled, and were shut up in the <lb/>
            heights of Mycale, not many in number, got safe to Sardis. <lb/>
            But as they were marching, on their way Masistes, son of I <lb/>
            Darius, having been present at the defeat, uttered many hard <lb/>
            words to the general Artayntes; saying, amongst other things, <note type="footnote"> 3 The Ionians were first subjugated by Harpagus, (i. 164, &amp;c.,) after­ <lb/>
            wards revolted, (v. 28,) and were again reduced, (vi. 32.) </note> <pb n="587"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="108, 109.]"/> <lb/>
            that he was more cowardly than a woman, for having com­ <lb/>
            manded the army in such a manner, and that he deserved the <lb/>
            most extreme punishment, for having brought mischief on the <lb/>
            king's house. Now among the Persians to be called more <lb/>
            cowardly than a woman is the greatest affront: he, therefore, <lb/>
            when he had heard a good deal, being exceedingly indignant, <lb/>
            drew his scymetar upon Masistes. But Xenagoras, son of <lb/>
            Praxilaus, a Halicarnassian, who stood behind Artayntes, per­ <lb/>
            ceiving him rushing forward, seized him round the middle, <lb/>
            and having lifted him up, threw him on the ground ; and in <lb/>
            the mean while the guards of Masistes came to his assistance. <lb/>
            Xenagoras did this, thereby laying an obligation both on Ma­ <lb/>
            sistes himself, and on Xerxes, by saving his brother; and for <lb/>
            this action Xenagoras received the government of all Cilicia, <lb/>
            as the gift of the king. While they were marching on the <lb/>
            road, nothing more than this occurred, but they arrived at <lb/>
            Sardis. At Sardis the king happened to be from the time <lb/>
            when he fled thither from Athens, after his failure in the sea- <lb/>
            fight.</p>
          <p>108. While he was at Sardis he fell in love with the wife of <lb/>
            Masistes, who also was there; but when she could not be moved <lb/>
            by sending to solicit her, and he did not offer violence, out of <lb/>
            regard for his brother Masistes; (and this same circumstance <lb/>
            restrained the woman, for she well knew that she would not <lb/>
            meet with violence ;) thereupon Xerxes, being shut out from <lb/>
            any other resource, brought about the marriage of his son <lb/>
            Darius with the daughter of this woman and Masistes ; think­ <lb/>
            ing that he should get possession of her if he did thus. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing, therefore, concluded the marriage and performed the usual <lb/>
            ceremonies, he departed for Susa. When he arrived there, <lb/>
            he introduced the wife of Darius into his own house ; and <lb/>
            then his passion for the wife of Masistes ceased ; and having <lb/>
            changed his inclinations, he fell in love, and succeeded, with <lb/>
            the wife of Darius, the daughter of Masistes: the name of this <lb/>
            woman was Artaynte. 109. In course of time the matter was <lb/>
            discovered in the following manner. Amestris, the wife of <lb/>
            Xerxes, having woven a large, various-coloured, and beautiful <lb/>
            mantle, presented it to Xerxes, and he, being delighted, put <lb/>
            it on, and went to Artaynte. Being pleased also with her, he <lb/>
            bid her ask whatever she pleased as a reward for the favours <lb/>
            she had granted him, for that she should have whatever she <pb n="588"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[110,111."/> <lb/>
            asked. Thereupon, for it was fated that misfortune should <lb/>
            befal the whole family by her means, she said to Xerxes, <lb/>
            " Will you give me whatever I shall ask of you ?" He, ima­ <lb/>
            gining she would ask for any thing rather than what she did, <lb/>
            promised and swore; and she, when he had sworn, boldly <lb/>
            asked for the mantle. Xerxes used every expedient, not <lb/>
            wishing to give it; for no other reason than that he was afraid <lb/>
            of Amestris, lest having before suspected what was going on, <lb/>
            he should thus be detected; he therefore offered her cities, <lb/>
            and a vast quantity of gold, and an army, which no one but <lb/>
            herself should command: but an army is a common Persian <lb/>
            gift. However, as he could not persuade her, he gave her the <lb/>
            mantle; and she, being overjoyed with the present, wore it, <lb/>
            and prided herself in it: and Amestris was informed that she <lb/>
            had it. 110. Having learnt what had been done, she was not <lb/>
            angry with the woman herself; but believing that her mother <lb/>
            was the cause, and that she had done this, she planned the <lb/>
            destruction of the wife of Masistes. Having therefore watched <lb/>
            the time when her husband Xerxes should give the royal <lb/>
            feast; (this feast is prepared once a year, on the day on which <lb/>
            the king was born ; and the name of this feast is, in the Per­ <lb/>
            sian language, " tycta," and in the Grecian language, " per­ <lb/>
            feet ;" and then only the king washes his head with soap, <lb/>
            and makes presents to the Persians;) Amestris then, having <lb/>
            watched that day, asked Xerxes to give her the wife of Ma­ <lb/>
            sistes. He considered it a dreadful and cruel thing first of <lb/>
            all to give up the wife of his brother, and next, one who was <lb/>
            innocent of what had taken place; for he understood why <lb/>
            she made this request. III. At last, however, as she per­ <lb/>
            sisted, and being constrained by custom, for it is not allowed <lb/>
            for any petitioner to be denied when the royal feast is spread, <lb/>
            he therefore very reluctantly granted her request: and hav­ <lb/>
            in- delivered the woman to her, he did as follows. He bade <lb/>
            her do what she pleased, and then, having sent for his brother, <lb/>
            spoke thus: “ Masistes, you are the son of Darius, and my <lb/>
            brother, and, moreover, you are also a brave man. Cohabit, <lb/>
            then, no longer with the wife you now have ; and instead of <lb/>
            her I will give you my own daughter. Cohabit with her; but <lb/>
            the wife whom you now have, as it does not seem well to me, <lb/>
            no longer retain." Masistes, astonished at what was said, <lb/>
            answered, " Sire, what mischievous language do you hold to <pb n="589"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="112—114.]"/> <lb/>
            ne, bidding me put away a wife, by whom I have three young <lb/>
            sons, and daughters, of whom you have married one to your <lb/>
            )wn son, and this wife too is very much to my mind; you <lb/>
            bid me put away her, and marry your own daughter ? I, how­ <lb/>
            ever, 0 king, though I deem it a great honour to be thought <lb/>
            worthy of your daughter, will do neither of these things; <lb/>
            md do not you use force in your desire to accomplish this <lb/>
            end. Some other man, not inferior to me, will be found for <lb/>
            rour daughter; but let me cohabit with my own wife." Such <lb/>
            vas the answer he gave ; but Xerxes in a rage replied, " Ma­ <lb/>
            sistes, you have thus done for yourself; for neither will I <lb/>
            rive you my daughter in marriage, nor shall you any longer <lb/>
            :ohabit with your present one ; that so you may learn to ac­ <lb/>
            cept what is offered." He, when he heard this, withdrew, <lb/>
            having said this much: " Sire, you have not yet taken away <lb/>
            ny life." 112. In the intermediate time, while Xerxes was <lb/>
            n conference with his brother, Amestris, having sent for the <lb/>
            body-guards of Xerxes, mutilated the wife of Masistes: hav­ <lb/>
            ng cut off her breasts, she threw them to the dogs, and also <lb/>
            ner nose, ears, and lips; and then, having cut out her tongue, <lb/>
            she sent her home thus mutilated. 113. Masistes, who had <lb/>
            not yet heard any thing of this, but suspecting some evil had <lb/>
            pefallen him, rushed home in great haste; and seeing his wife <lb/>
            atterly destroyed, he thereupon consulted with his sons, and <lb/>
            et out with them and some others for Bactria, designing to <lb/>
            nduce the Bactrian district to revolt, and to do the king all <lb/>
            he mischief he could; which, in my opinion, would have <lb/>
            happened, if he had been beforehand in going up to the Bac-, <lb/>
            rians and Sacæ; for they were attached to him, and he was <lb/>
            governor of the Bactrians. But Xerxes, being informed of <lb/>
            is intentions, sent an army after him, and slew him, and his <lb/>
            ions, and his forces upon the way. Such were the circum­ <lb/>
            tances respecting the amour of Xerxes and the death of Ma­ <lb/>
            istes.</p>
          <p>114. The Greeks having set out from Mycale towards the <lb/>
            Hellespont, being overtaken by a storm, anchored near Lec­ <lb/>
            is, and from thence they went to Abydos, and found the <lb/>
            ridges broken in pieces, which they expected to find stretch­ <lb/>
            ed across; and for this reason chiefly they came to the Helles­ <lb/>
            nt. Upon this the Peloponnesians with Leotychides deter­ <lb/>
            mined to sail back to Greece; but the Athenians and their <pb n="590"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[115-117"/> <lb/>
            commander Xanthippus resolved to stay there and make an <lb/>
            attempt on the Chersonesus. The former therefore sailed <lb/>
            away; but the Athenians, having crossed over from Abydos <lb/>
            to Chersonesus, besieged Sestos. 115. To this Sestos, as be­ <lb/>
            in,; the strongest fortress in these parts, when they heard that <lb/>
            the Greeks were arrived in the Hellespont, there came toge­ <lb/>
            ther men from other neighbouring places, and among others, <lb/>
            CEobazus a Persian from Cardia, who had had all the mate­ <lb/>
            rials of the bridges conveyed thither. Native Æolians occu­ <lb/>
            pied it, and there were with them Persians, and a great body <lb/>
            of other allies. 116. Xerxes' viceroy Artayctes ruled over <lb/>
            this district, a Persian wicked and impious, who had even <lb/>
            deceived the king, on his march to Athens, by secretly taking <lb/>
            away from Elæus the treasures of Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus. <lb/>
            For in Elæus of the Chersonesus is a sepulchre of Protesilaus, <lb/>
            and a precinct around it, where were great treasures, both gold <lb/>
            and silver vessels, and brass, and robes, and other offerings, <lb/>
            which Artayotes plundered by permission of the king. By <lb/>
            speaking as follows, he deceived Xerxes : " Sire, there is here <lb/>
            the habitation of a certain Grecian, who having carried arms <lb/>
            in your territories, met with a just punishment and perished. <lb/>
            Give me this man's house, that every one may learn not to <lb/>
            carry arms against your territory." By saying this he would <lb/>
            easily persuade Xerxes to give him the man's house, as he had <lb/>
            no suspicion of his intentions. He said that Protesilaus had <lb/>
            carried arms against the king's territory, thinking thus; the <lb/>
            Persians consider that all Asia belongs to them and the reign­ <lb/>
            ing monarch. When, however, the treasures were granted <lb/>
            he carried them away from Elæus to Sestos, and sowed part <lb/>
            of the precinct, and pastured it; and whenever he went to i <lb/>
            Elæus, he used to lie with women in the sanctuary. At this <lb/>
            time he was besieged by the Athenians, neither being pre­ <lb/>
            pared for a siege, nor expecting the Greeks; so that they fell <lb/>
            upon him somewhat unawares. 117. But when autumn came <lb/>
            on, as they were engaged in the siege, and the Athenians were <lb/>
            impatient at being absent from their own country, and not <lb/>
            able to take the fortification, they besought their leaders to <lb/>
            take them back ; they, however, refused, until either they <lb/>
            should take the place, or the people of Athens should recal <lb/>
            them; accordingly, they acquiesced in the present state of <lb/>
            things. <pb n="591"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="18-121.]"/>
          <p>118. In the mean while those who were within the fortifica­ <lb/>
            ;ion were reduced to the last extremity, so that they boiled <lb/>
            and ate the cords of their beds; and when they had these no <lb/>
            onger, then the Persians, and Artayctes and (Eobazus, made <lb/>
            ;heir escape by night, descending by the back of the fortifica­ <lb/>
            ;ion, where it was most deserted by the enemy. When it was <lb/>
            lay, the Chersonesians from the towers made known to the <lb/>
            Athenians what had happened, and opened the gates; and <lb/>
            he greater part of them went in pursuit, but some took posses­ <lb/>
            lion of the city. 119. As Œobazus was fleeing into Thrace, <lb/>
            he Apsinthian Thracians seized him, and sacrificed him to <lb/>
            Plistorus, a god of the country, according to their custom; <lb/>
            mut those who were with him they slaughtered in another <lb/>
            nanner. Those with Artayctes, who had taken to flight the <lb/>
            ast, when they were overtaken a little above Ægos-Potami, <lb/>
            having defended themselves for a considerable time, some were <lb/>
            tilled, and others taken alive, and the Greeks, having put them <lb/>
            n bonds, conveyed them to Sestos; and with them they took <lb/>
            Artayctes bound, himself and his son. 120. It is related by <lb/>
            he Chersonitæ, that the following prodigy occurred to one of <lb/>
            he guards as he was broiling salt-fish; the salt-fish lying on <lb/>
            he fire leapt and quivered like fish just caught; and the per- <lb/>
            Ions who stood around were amazed; but Artayctes, when he <lb/>
            aw the prodigy, having called the man who was broiling the <lb/>
            alt-fish, said, " Athenian friend, be not afraid of this prodigy, <lb/>
            or it has not appeared to you; but Protesilaus, who is in <lb/>
            Elæus, intimates to me, that though dead and salted, he has <lb/>
            lower from the gods to avenge himself on the person that has <lb/>
            njured him. Now, therefore, I wish to make him reparation, <lb/>
            nd instead of the riches which I took out of his temple, to <lb/>
            epay one hundred talents to the god; and for myself and my <lb/>
            hildren, I will pay two hundred talents to the Athenians, if <lb/>
            Isurvive." By offering this, he did not persuade the general, <lb/>
            Canthippus; for the Elæans, wishing to avenge Protesilaus, <lb/>
            pegged that be might be put to death, and the mind of the <lb/>
            general himself inclined that way. Having, therefore, con­ <lb/>
            lucted him to that part of the shore where Xerxes bridged <lb/>
            over the pass, or, as others say, to a hill above the city of <lb/>
            Madytus, they nailed him to a plank and hoisted him aloft, <lb/>
            nd his son they stoned before the eyes of Artayctes. 121. <lb/>
            laving done these things, they sailed back to Greece ; taking <pb n="592"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[122."/> <lb/>
            with them other treasures and the materials of the bridges, in <lb/>
            order to dedicate them in the temples; and during this year <lb/>
            nothing more was done.</p>
          <p>122. Artembares, the grandfather of this Artayctes who <lb/>
            was hoisted aloft, was the person who originated a remark <lb/>
            which the Persians adopted and conveyed to Cyrus, in these <lb/>
            terms: “ Since Jupiter has given the sovereign power to the <lb/>
            Persians, and among men, to you, 0 Cyrus, by overthrowing <lb/>
            Astyages; as we possess a small territory, and that rugged, <lb/>
            come, let us remove from this, and take possession of another, <lb/>
            better. There are many near our confines, and many at a <lb/>
            distance. By possessing one of these, we shall be more <lb/>
            admired by most men ; and it is right that those who bear <lb/>
            rule should do so; and when shall we have a better oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, than when we have the command of many nations, and of <lb/>
            all Asia ? " Cyrus having heard these words, and not admiring <lb/>
            the proposal, bade them do so; but when he bade them he <lb/>
            warned them to prepare henceforward not to rule, but to be <lb/>
            ruled over; for that delicate men spring from delicate countries, <lb/>
            for that it is not given to the same land to produce excellent <lb/>
            fruits and men valiant in war. So that the Persians, perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing their error, withdrew and yielded to the opinion of Cyrus; <lb/>
            and they chose rather to live in a barren country, and to <lb/>
            command, than to cultivate fertile plains, and be the slaves <lb/>
            of others.</p>
