          </ab>
          <p>YOU have asked me, Lucilius, why, if the world be ruled <lb/>
            by providence, so many evils befall good men ? The <lb/>
            answer to this would be more conveniently given in the <lb/>
            course of this work, after we have proved that providence <lb/>
            governs the universe, and that God is amongst us : but, since <lb/>
            you wish me to deal with one point apart from the whole, <lb/>
            and to answer one replication before the main action has <lb/>
            been decided, I will do what is not difficult, and plead the <lb/>
            cause of the gods. At the present time it is superfluous to <lb/>
            point out that it is not without some guardian that so great <lb/>
            a work maintains its position, that the assemblage and <lb/>
            movements of the stars do not depend upon accidental <lb/>
            impulses, or that objects whose motion is regulated by chance <lb/>
            often fall into confusion and soon stumble, whereas this <lb/>
            swift and safe movement goes on, governed by eternal law, <lb/>
            bearing with it so many things both on sea and land, so many <lb/>
            most brilliant lights shining in order in the skies; that <lb/>
            this regularity does not belong to matter moving at random, <lb/>
            and that particles brought together by chance could not <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            arrange themselves with such art as to make the heaviest <lb/>
            weight, that of the earth, remain unmoved, and behold the <lb/>
            flight of the heavens as they hasten round it, to make the <lb/>
            seas pour into the valleys and so temper the climate of the <lb/>
            land, without any sensible increase from the rivers which <lb/>
            flow into them, or to cause huge growths to proceed from <lb/>
            minute seeds. Even those phenomena which appear to be <lb/>
            confused and irregular, I mean showers of rain and clouds, <lb/>
            the rush of lightning from the heavens, fire that pours from <lb/>
            the riven peaks of mountains, quakings of the trembling <lb/>
            earth, and everything else which is produced on earth by the <lb/>
            unquiet element in the universe, do not come to pass <lb/>
            without reason, though they do so suddenly : but they also <lb/>
            have their causes, as also have those things which excite <lb/>
            our wonder by the strangeness of their position, such as <lb/>
            warm springs amidst the waves of the sea, and new islands <lb/>
            that spring up in the wide ocean. Moreover, any one who <lb/>
            has watched how the shore is laid bare by the retreat of <lb/>
            the sea into itself, and how within a short time it is again <lb/>
            covered, will believe that it is in obedience to some hidden <lb/>
            law of change that the waves are at one time contracted <lb/>
            and driven inwards, at another burst forth and regain their <lb/>
            bed with a strong current, since all the while they wax in <lb/>
            regular proportion, and come up at their appointed day and <lb/>
            hour greater or less, according as the moon, at whose <lb/>
            pleasure the ocean flows, draws them. Let these matters <lb/>
            be set aside for discussion at their own proper season, but <lb/>
            I, since you do not doubt the existence of providence but <lb/>
            complain of it, will on that account more readily reconcile <lb/>
            you to gods who are most excellent to excellent men : for <lb/>
            indeed the nature of things does not ever permit good to <lb/>
            be injured by good. Between good men and the gods <lb/>
            there is a friendship which is brought about by virtue- <lb/>
            friendship do I say ? nay, rather relationship and likeness, <lb/>
            since the good man differs from a god in time alone, <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            being his pupil and rival and true offspring, whom his <lb/>
            glorious parent trains more severely than other men, in­ <lb/>
            sisting sternly on virtuous conduct, just as strict fathers <lb/>
            do. When therefore you see men who are good and ac­ <lb/>
            ceptable to the gods toiling, sweating, painfully struggling <lb/>
            upwards, while bad men run riot and are steeped in <lb/>
            pleasures, reflect that modesty pleases us in our sons, and <lb/>
            forwardness in our house-born slave-boys; that the former <lb/>
            are held in check by a somewhat stern rule, whereas the <lb/>
            boldness of the latter is encouraged. Be thou sure that <lb/>
            God acts in like manner: He does not pet the good man : <lb/>
            He tries him, hardens him, and fits him for Himself.</p>
          <p>II. Why do many things turn out badly for good men p <lb/>
            Why, no evil can befall a good man : contraries cannot <lb/>
            combine. Just as so many rivers, so many showers of rain <lb/>
            from the clouds, such a number of medicinal springs, do not <lb/>
            alter the taste of the sea, indeed, do not so much as soften <lb/>
            it, so the pressure of adversity does not affect the mind of <lb/>
            a brave man; for the mind of a brave man maintains its <lb/>
            balance and throws its own complexion over all that takes <lb/>
            place, because it is more powerful than any external cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. I do not say that he does not feel them, but <lb/>
            he conquers them, and on occasion calmly and tranquilly <lb/>
            rises superior to their attacks, holding all misfortunes to be <lb/>
            trials of his own firmness. Yet who is there who, provided <lb/>
            he be a man and have honourable ambition, does not long <lb/>
            for due employment, and is not eager to do his duty <lb/>
            in spite of danger? Is there any hard-working man to <lb/>
            whom idleness is not a punishment ? We see athletes, <lb/>
            who study only their bodily strength, engage in contests <lb/>
            with the strongest of men, and insist that those who train <lb/>
            them for the arena should put out their whole strength <lb/>
            when practising with them: they endure blows and mal­ <lb/>
            treatment, and, if they cannot find any single person who <lb/>
            is their match, they engage with several at once: their <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            strength and courage droop without an antagonist: they <lb/>
            can only prove how great and how mighty it is by proving <lb/>
            how much they can endure. You should know that good <lb/>
            men ought to act in like manner, so as not to fear troubles <lb/>
            and difficulties, nor to lament their hard fate, to take <lb/>
            in good part whatever befalls them, and force it to be­ <lb/>
            come a blessing to them. It does not matter what you <lb/>
            bear, but how you bear it. Do you not see how diffe­ <lb/>
            rently fathers and mothers indulge their children? how <lb/>
            the former urge them to begin their tasks betimes, will not <lb/>
            suffer them to be idle even on holidays, and exercise them <lb/>
            till they perspire, and sometimes till they shed tears-while <lb/>
            their mothers want to cuddle them in their laps, and keep <lb/>
            them out of the sun, and never wish them to be vexed, or <lb/>
            to cry, or to work. God bears a fatherly mind towards <lb/>
            good men, and loves them in a manly spirit. " Let them," <lb/>
            says He, " be exercised by labours, sufferings, and losses, <lb/>
            that so they may gather true strength." Those who are <lb/>
            surfeited with ease break down not only with labour, but <lb/>
            with mere motion and by their own weight. Unbroken <lb/>
            prosperity cannot bear a single blow; but he who has <lb/>
            waged an unceasing strife with his misfortunes has gained <lb/>
            a thicker skin by his sufferings, yields to no disaster, and <lb/>
            even though he fall yet fights on his knee. Do you wonder <lb/>
            that God, who so loves the good, who would have them <lb/>
            attain the highest goodness and pre-eminence, should ap­ <lb/>
            point fortune to be their adversary ? I should not be sur­ <lb/>
            prised if the gods sometimes experience a wish to behold <lb/>
            great men struggling with some misfortune. We some­ <lb/>
            times are delighted when a youth of steady courage re­ <lb/>
            ceives on his spear the wild beast that attacks him; or <lb/>
            when he meets the charge of a lion without flinching; and <lb/>
            the more eminent the man is who acts thus,l the more <note type="footnote"> 1 honestior is opposed to the gladiator-the loftier the station of the com­ <lb/>
            batant. The Gracchus of Juvenal, Sat. ii. and viii., illustrates the passage. </note> <pb n="5"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            attractive is the sight: yet these are not matters which can <lb/>
            attract the attention of the gods, but are mere pastime and <lb/>
            diversions of human frivolity. Behold a sight worthy to <lb/>
            be viewed by a god interested in his own work, behold a <lb/>
            pair1 worthy of a god, a brave man matched with evil <lb/>
            fortune, especially if he himself has given the challenge. <lb/>
            I say, I do not know what nobler spectacle Jupiter could <lb/>
            find on earth, should he turn his eyes thither, than that of <lb/>
            Cato, after his party had more than once been defeated, still <lb/>
            standing upright amid the ruins of the commonwealth. <lb/>
            Quoth he, " What though all be fallen into one man's power, <lb/>
            though the land be guarded by his legions, the sea by his <lb/>
            fleets, though Caesar's soldiers beset the city gate ? Cato <lb/>
            has a way out of it: with one hand he will open a wide <lb/>
            path to freedom ; his sword, which he has borne unstained <lb/>
            by disgrace and innocent of crime even in a civil war, will <lb/>
            still perform good and noble deeds ; it will give to Cato <lb/>
            that freedom which it could not give to his country. <lb/>
            Begin, my soul, the work which thou so long hast contem­ <lb/>
            plated, snatch thyself away from the world of man. Already <lb/>
            Petreius and Juba have met and fallen, each slain by the <lb/>
            other's hand-a brave and noble compact with fate, yet not <lb/>
            one befitting my greatness : it is as disgraceful for Cato to <lb/>
            beg his death of any one as it would be for him to beg his <lb/>
            life."</p>
          <p>It is clear to me that the gods must have looked on with <lb/>
            great joy, while that man, his own most ruthless avenger, took <lb/>
            thought for the safety of others and arranged the escape <lb/>
            of those who departed, while even on his last night he pur­ <lb/>
            sued his studies, while he drove the sword into his sacred <lb/>
            breast, while he tore forth his vitals and laid his hand <lb/>
            upon that most holy life which was unworthy to be defiled <lb/>
            by steel. This, I am inclined to think, was the reason that <note type="footnote"> 1 par, a. technical term in the language of sport (worthy of such a spec­ <lb/>
            tator). </note> <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            his wound was not well-aimed and mortal: the gods were <lb/>
            not satisfied with seeing Cato die once: his courage was <lb/>
            kept in action and recalled to the stage, that it might dis­ <lb/>
            play itself in a more difficult part: for it needs a greater <lb/>
            mind to return a second time to death. How could they <lb/>
            fail to view their pupil with interest when leaving his life <lb/>
            by such a noble and memorable departure ? Men are raised <lb/>
            to the level of the gods by a death which is admired even <lb/>
            by those who fear them.</p>
          <p>III. However, as my argument proceeds, I shall prove <lb/>
            that what appear to be evils are not so; for the present I <lb/>
            say this, that what you call hard measure, misfortunes, and <lb/>
            things against which we ought to pray, are really to the <lb/>
            advantage, firstly, of those to whom they happen, and <lb/>
            secondly, of all mankind, for whom the gods care more than <lb/>
            for individuals; and next, that these evils befall them <lb/>
            with their own good will, and that men deserve to endure <lb/>
            misfortunes, if they are unwilling to receive them. To this <lb/>
            I shall add, that misfortunes proceed thus by destiny, and <lb/>
            that they befall good men by the same law which makes <lb/>
            them good. After this, I shall prevail upon you never to <lb/>
            pity any good man; for though he may be called unhappy, <lb/>
            he cannot be so.</p>
          <p>Of all these propositions that which I have stated first <lb/>
            appears the most difficult to prove, I mean, that the things <lb/>
            which we dread and shudder at are to the advantage of those <lb/>
            to whom they happen. " Is it," say you, " to their advantage <lb/>
            to be driven into exile, to be brought to want, to carry out <lb/>
            to burial their children and wife, to be publicly disgraced, <lb/>
            to lose their health ?" Yes ! if you are surprised at these <lb/>
            being to any man's advantage, you will also be surprised <lb/>
            at any man being benefited by the knife and cautery, or by <lb/>
            hunger and thirst as well. Yet if you consider that some <lb/>
            men, in order to be cured, have their bones scraped, and <lb/>
            pieces of them extracted, that their veins are pulled out, <pb n="7"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            and that some have limbs cut off, which could not remain <lb/>
            in their place without ruin to the whole body, you will <lb/>
            allow me to prove to you this also, that some misfortunes <lb/>
            are for the good of those to whom they happen, just as <lb/>
            much, by Hercules, as some things which are praised and <lb/>
            sought after are harmful to those who enjoy them, like <lb/>
            indigestions and drunkenness and other matters which kill <lb/>
            us through pleasure. Among many grand sayings of our <lb/>
            Demetrius is this, which I have but just heard, and which <lb/>
            still rings and thrills in my ears : " No one," said he, " seems <lb/>
            to me more unhappy than the man whom no misfortune <lb/>
            has ever befallen." He never has had an opportunity of <lb/>
            testing himself; though everything has happened to him <lb/>
            according to his wish, nay, even before he has formed a <lb/>
            wish, yet the gods have judged him unfavourably; he has <lb/>
            never been deemed worthy to conquer ill fortune, which <lb/>
            avoids the greatest cowards, as though it said, " Why should <lb/>
            I take that man for my antagonist ? He will straightway <lb/>
            lay down his arms: I shall not need all my strength against <lb/>
            him: he will be put to flight by a mere menace: he dares not <lb/>
            even face me; let me look around for some other with whom <lb/>
            I may fight hand to hand : I blush to join battle with one <lb/>
            who is prepared to be beaten." A gladiator deems it a dis­ <lb/>
            grace to be matched with an inferior, and knows that to win <lb/>
            without danger is to win without glory. Just so doth For­ <lb/>
            tune ; she seeks out the bravest to match herself with, passes <lb/>
            over some with disdain, and makes for the most unyielding <lb/>
            and upright of men, to exert her strength against them. <lb/>
            She tried Mucius by fire, Fabricius by poverty, Rutilius by <lb/>
            exile, Regulus by torture, Socrates by poison, Cato by <lb/>
            death : it is ill fortune alone that discovers these glorious <lb/>
            examples. Was Mucius unhappy, because he grasped <lb/>
            the enemy's fire with his right hand, and of his own accord <lb/>
            paid the penalty of his mistake ? because he overcame the <lb/>
            King with his hand when it was burned, though he could <pb n="8"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            not when it held a sword ? Would he have been happier, <lb/>
            if he had warmed his hand in his mistress's bosom ? <lb/>
            Was Fabricius unhappy, because when the state could <lb/>
            spare him, he dug his own land ? because he waged war <lb/>
            against riches as keenly as against Pyrrhus ? because he <lb/>
            supped beside his hearth off the very roots and herbs <lb/>
            which he himself, though an old man, and one who had <lb/>
            enjoyed a triumph, had grubbed up while clearing his <lb/>
            field of weeds ? What then ? would he have been happier <lb/>
            if he had gorged himself with fishes from distant shores, <lb/>
            and birds caught in foreign lands ? if he had roused the <lb/>
            torpor of his queasy stomach with shellfish from the upper <lb/>
            and the lower sea ? if he had piled a great heap of fruits <lb/>
            round game of the first head, which many huntsmen had <lb/>
            been killed in capturing ? Was Rutilius unhappy, because <lb/>
            those who condemned him will have to plead their cause <lb/>
            for all ages ? because he endured the loss of his country <lb/>
            more composedly than that of his banishment ? because he <lb/>
            was the only man who refused anything to Sulla the dic­ <lb/>
            tator, and when recalled from exile all but went further <lb/>
            away and banished himself still more. " Let those," <lb/>
            said he, " whom thy fortunate reign catches at Rome, see to <lb/>
            the Forum drenched with bloody and the heads of Senators <lb/>
            above the Pool of Servilius-the place where the victims of <lb/>
            Sulla's proscriptions were stripped-the bands of assassins <lb/>
            roaming at large through the city, and many thousands of <lb/>
            Roman citizens slaughtered in one place, after, nay, by <lb/>
            means of a promise of quarter. Let those who are unable <lb/>
            to go into exile behold these things." Well! is Lucius <lb/>
            Sulla happy, because when he comes down into the Forum <lb/>
            room is made for him with sword-strokes, because he allows <lb/>
            the heads of consulars to be shown to him, and counts out <lb/>
            the price of blood through the quaestor and the state ex- <note type="footnote"> 1 viderint-Let them see to it: it is no matter of mine. </note> <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            chequer? And this, this was the man who passed the Lex <lb/>
            Cornelia ! Let us now come to Regulus: what injury did for­ <lb/>
            tune do him when she made him an example of good faith, <lb/>
            an example of endurance ? They pierce his skin with nails: <lb/>
            wherever he leans his weary body, it rests on a wound; his <lb/>
            eyes are fixed for ever open ; the greater his sufferings, the <lb/>
            greater is his glory. Would you know how far he is from <lb/>
            regretting that he valued his honour at such a price ? heal <lb/>
            his wounds and send him again into the senate-house; <lb/>
            he will give the same advice. So, then, you think Maecenas <lb/>
            a happier man, who when troubled by love, and weeping at <lb/>
            the daily repulses of his ill-natured wife, sought for sleep <lb/>
            by listening to distant strains of music ? Though he drug <lb/>
            himself with wine, divert himself with the sound of falling <lb/>
            waters, and distract his troubled thoughts with a thousand <lb/>
            pleasures, yet Maecenas will no more sleep on his down <lb/>
            cushions than Regulus on the rack. Yet it consoles the <lb/>
            latter that he suffers for the sake of honour, and he looks <lb/>
            away from his torments to their cause : whilst the other, <lb/>
            jaded with pleasures and sick with over-enjoyment, is <lb/>
            more hurt by the cause of his sufferings than by the suffer­ <lb/>
            ings themselves. Vice has not so utterly taken possession <lb/>
            of the human race that, if men were allowed to choose <lb/>
            their destiny, there can be any doubt but that more would <lb/>
            choose to be Reguluses than to be Maecenases: or if there <lb/>
            were any one who dared to say that he would prefer to be <lb/>
            born Maecenas than Regulus, that man, whether he says so <lb/>
            or not, would rather have been Terentia (than Cicero).</p>
          <p>Do you consider Socrates to have been badly used, <lb/>
            because he took that draught which the state assigned to <lb/>
            him as though it were a charm to make him immortal, and <lb/>
            argued about death until death itself ? Was he in treated, <lb/>
            because his blood froze and the current of his veins <lb/>
            gradually stopped as the chill of death crept over them ? <lb/>
            How much more is this man to be envied than he who is <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            served on precious stones, whose drink a creature trained <lb/>
            to every vice, a eunuch or much the same, cools with snow <lb/>
            in a golden cup ? Such men as these bring up again all <lb/>
            that they drink, in misery and disgust at the taste of their <lb/>
            own bile, while Socrates cheerfully and willingly drains <lb/>
            his poison. As for Cato, enough has been said, and all <lb/>
            men must agree that the highest happiness was reached by <lb/>
            one who was chosen by Nature herself as worthy to contend <lb/>
            with all her terrors: " The enmity," says she, " of the <lb/>
            powerful is grievous, therefore let him be opposed at once <lb/>
            by Pompeius, Caesar, and Crassus: it is grievous, when a <lb/>
            candidate for public offices, to be defeated by one's inferiors; <lb/>
            therefore let him be defeated by Vatinius : it is grievous <lb/>
            to take part in civil wars, therefore let him fight in every <lb/>
            part of the world for the good cause with equal obstinacy <lb/>
            and ill-luck: it is grievous to lay hands upon one's self, <lb/>
            therefore let him do so. What shall I gain by this ? That <lb/>
            all men may know that these things, which I have deemed <lb/>
            Cato worthy to undergo, are not real evils."</p>
          <p>IV. Prosperity comes to the mob, and to low-minded <lb/>
            men as well as to great ones; but it is the privilege of <lb/>
            great men alone to send under the yoke1 the disasters <lb/>
            and terrors of mortal life: whereas to be always pros­ <lb/>
            perous, and to pass through life without a twinge of mental <lb/>
            distress, is to remain ignorant of one half of nature. <lb/>
            You are a great man; but how am I to know it, if fortune <lb/>
            gives you no opportunity of showing your virtue ? You <lb/>
            have entered the arena of the Olympic games, but no one <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, to triumph over. " Two spears were set upright.... and <lb/>
            a third was fastened across them at the top 5 and through this gateway <lb/>
            the vanquished army marched out, as a token that they had been con­ <lb/>
            quered in war, and owed their lives to the enemy's mercy. It was no <lb/>
            peculiar insult devised for this occasion, but a common usage, so far <lb/>
            as appears, in similar cases; like the modern ceremony of piling arms <lb/>
            when a garrison or army surrender themselves as prisoners of war."- <lb/>

            else has done so : you have the crown, but not the victory : <lb/>
            I do not congratulate you as I would a brave man, but as <lb/>
            one who has obtained a consulship or praetorship. You <lb/>
            have gained dignity. I may say the same of a good man, <lb/>
            if troublesome circumstances have never given him a single <lb/>
            opportunity of displaying the strength of his mind. I <lb/>
            think you unhappy because you never have been unhappy: <lb/>
            you have passed through your life without meeting an <lb/>
            antagonist: no one will know your powers, not even you <lb/>
            yourself." For a man cannot know himself without a trial: <lb/>
            no one ever learnt what he could do without putting himself <lb/>
            to the test; for which reason many have of their own free <lb/>
            will exposed themselves to misfortunes which no longer <lb/>
            came in their way, and have sought for an opportunity of <lb/>
            making their virtue, which otherwise would have been lost <lb/>
            in darkness, shine before the world. Great men, I say,. <lb/>
            often rejoice at crosses of fortune just as brave soldiers do <lb/>
            at wars. I remember to have heard Triumphus, who was. <lb/>
            a gladiator! in the reign of Tiberius Caesar, complaining <lb/>
            about the scarcity of prizes. "What a glorious time," <lb/>
            said he, " is past." Valour is greedy of danger, and thinks <lb/>
            only of whither it strives' to go, not of what it will suffer, <lb/>
            since even what it will suffer is part of its glory. Soldiers <lb/>
            pride themselves on their wounds, they joyously display <lb/>
            their blood flowing over their breastplate.2 Though those. <lb/>
            who return unwounded from battle may have done as bravely, <lb/>
            yet he who returns wounded is more admired. God, I <lb/>
            say, favours those whom He wishes to enjoy the greatest <lb/>
            honours, whenever He affords them the means of perform­ <lb/>
            ing some exploit with spirit and courage, something which <lb/>
            is not easily to be accomplished: you can judge of a pilot <lb/>
            in a storm, of a soldier in a battle. How can I know with <note type="footnote"> 1 He was a " mirmillo," a kind of gladiator who was armed with a <lb/>
            Gaulish helmet. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 e lorica. </note> <pb n="12"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            how great a spirit you could endure poverty, if you over­ <lb/>
            flow with riches ? How can I tell with how great firmness <lb/>
            you could bear up against disgrace, dishonour, and public <lb/>
            hatred, if you grow old to the sound of applause, if popular <lb/>
            favour cannot be alienated from you, and seems to flow <lb/>
            to you by the natural bent of men's minds ? How <lb/>
            can I know how calmly you would endure to be childless, <lb/>
            if you see all your children around you ? I have heard <lb/>
            what you said when you were consoling others: then I <lb/>
            should have seen whether you could have consoled your­ <lb/>
            self, whether you could have forbidden yourself to grieve. <lb/>
            Do not, I beg you, dread those things which the immortal <lb/>
            gods apply to our minds like spurs : misfortune is virtue's <lb/>
            opportunity. Those men may justly be called unhappy <lb/>
            who are stupified with excess of enjoyment, whom sluggish <lb/>
            contentment keeps as it were becalmed in a quiet sea: <lb/>
            whatever befalls them will come strange to them. Misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes press hardest on those who are unacquainted with <lb/>
            them: the yoke feels heavy to the tender neck. The re­ <lb/>
            cruit turns pale at the thought of a wound: the veteran, who <lb/>
            knows that he has often won the victory after losing blood, <lb/>
            looks boldly at his own flowing gore. In like manner God <lb/>
            hardens, reviews, and exercises those whom He tests and <lb/>
            loves : those whom He seems to indulge and spare, He is <lb/>
            keeping out of condition to meet their coming misfortunes: <lb/>
            for you are mistaken if you suppose that any one is exempt <lb/>
            from misfortune: he who has long prospered will have his <lb/>
            share some day; those who seem to have been spared them <lb/>
            have only had them put off. Why does God afflict the <lb/>
            best of men with ill-health, or sorrow, or other troubles ? <lb/>
            Because in the army the most hazardous services are <lb/>
            assigned to the bravest soldiers: a general sends his <lb/>
            choicest troops to attack the enemy in a midnight ambus­ <lb/>
            cade, to reconnoitre his line of march, or to drive the <lb/>
            hostile garrisons from their strong places. No one of these <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            men says as he begins his march, " The general has dealt <lb/>
            hardly with me," but " He has judged well of me." <lb/>
            Let those who are bidden to suffer what makes the weak <lb/>
            and cowardly weep, say likewise, " God has thought us <lb/>
            worthy subjects on whom to try how much suffering <lb/>
            human nature can endure." Avoid luxury, avoid effemi­ <lb/>
            nate enjoyment, by which men's minds are softened, and <lb/>
            in which, unless something occurs to remind them of the <lb/>
            common lot of humanity, they lie unconscious, as though <lb/>
            plunged in continual drunkenness. He whom glazed <lb/>
            windows have always guarded from the wind, whose feet <lb/>
            are warmed by constantly renewed fomentations, whose <lb/>
            dining-room is heated by hot air beneath the floor and <lb/>
            spread through the walls, cannot meet the gentlest breeze <lb/>
            without danger. While all excesses are hurtful, excess <lb/>
            of comfort is the most hurtful of all; it affects the brain ; <lb/>
            it leads men's minds into vain imaginings; it spreads a <lb/>
            thick cloud over the boundaries of truth and falsehood. <lb/>
            Is it not better, with virtue by one's side, to endure con­ <lb/>
            tinual misfortune, than to burst with an endless surfeit <lb/>
            of good things ? It is the overloaded stomach that is <lb/>
            rent asunder: death treats starvation more gently. The <lb/>
            gods deal with good men according to the same rule as <lb/>
            schoolmasters with their pupils, who exact most labour <lb/>
            from those of whom they have the surest hopes. Do <lb/>
            you imagine that the Lacedaemonians, who test the mettle <lb/>
            of their children by public flogging, do not love them ? <lb/>
            Their own fathers call upon them to endure the strokes of <lb/>
            the rod bravely, and when they are torn and half dead, ask <lb/>
            them to offer their wounded skin to receive fresh wounds. <lb/>
            Why then should we wonder if God tries noble spirits <lb/>
            severely ? There can be no easy proof of virtue. Fortune <lb/>
            lashes and mangles us: well, let us endure it: it is not <lb/>
            cruelty, it is a struggle, in which the oftener we engage <lb/>
            the braver we shall become. The strongest part of the <pb n="14"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            body is that which is exercised by the most frequent use : <lb/>
            we must entrust ourselves to fortune to be hardened by <lb/>
            her against herself: by degrees she will make us a match <lb/>
            for herself. Familiarity with danger leads us to despise <lb/>
            it. Thus the bodies of sailors are hardened by endurance <lb/>
            of the sea, and the hands of farmers by work; the <lb/>
            arms of soldiers are powerful to hurl darts, the legs of <lb/>
            runners are active : that part of each man which he exer­ <lb/>
            cises is the strongest: so by endurance the mind becomes <lb/>
            able to despise the power of misfortunes. You may see <lb/>
            what endurance might effect in us if you observe what <lb/>
            labour does among tribes that are naked and rendered <lb/>
            stronger by want. Look at all the nations that dwell be­ <lb/>
            yond the Roman Empire: I mean the Germans and all the <lb/>
            nomad tribes that war against us along the Danube. They <lb/>
            suffer from eternal winter, and a dismal climate, the <lb/>
            barren soil grudges them sustenance, they keep off the <lb/>
            rain with leaves or thatch, they bound across frozen <lb/>
            marshes, and hunt wild beasts for food. Do you think <lb/>
            them unhappy ? There is no unhappiness in what use has <lb/>
            made part of one's nature: by degrees men find pleasure <lb/>
            in doing what they were first driven to do by necessity. <lb/>
            They have no homes and no resting-places save those <lb/>
            which weariness appoints them for the day; their food, <lb/>
            though coarse, yet must be sought with their own hands; <lb/>
            the harshness of the climate is terrible, and their bodies <lb/>
            are unclothed. This, which you think a hardship, is the <lb/>
            mode of life of all these races: how then can you wonder <lb/>
            at good men being shaken, in order that they may be <lb/>
            strengthened ? No tree which the wind does not often <lb/>
            blow against is firm and strong; for it is stiffened by <lb/>
            the very act of being shaken, and plants its roots more <lb/>
            securely: those which grow in a sheltered valley are <lb/>
            brittle: and so it is to the advantage of good men, and <lb/>
            causes them to be undismayed, that they should live much <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            amidst alarms, and learn to bear with patience what is not <lb/>
            evil save to him who endures it ill.</p>
          <p>V. Add to this that it is to the advantage of every one <lb/>
            that the best men should, so to speak, be on active service and <lb/>
            perform labours: God has the same purpose as the wise man, <lb/>
            that is, to prove that the things which the herd covets and <lb/>
            dreads are neither good nor bad in themselves. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, He only bestows them upon good men, it will be evi­ <lb/>
            dent that they are good things, and bad, if He only inflicts <lb/>
            them upon bad men. Blindness would be execrable if no <lb/>
            one lost his eyes except those who deserve to have them <lb/>
            pulled out; therefore let Appius and Metellus be doomed <lb/>
            to darkness. Riches are not a good thing: therefore let <lb/>
            Elius the pander possess them, that men who have conse­ <lb/>
            crated money in the temple, may see the same in the <lb/>
            brothel: for by no means can God discredit objects of <lb/>
            desire so effectually as by bestowing them upon the worst <lb/>
            of men, and removing them from the best. "But," you <lb/>
            say, " it is unjust that a good man should be enfeebled, or <lb/>
            transfixed, or chained, while bad men swagger at large <lb/>
            with a whole skin." What! is it not unjust that brave <lb/>
            men should bear arms, pass the night in camps, and stand <lb/>
            on guard along the rampart with their wounds still <lb/>
            bandaged, while within the city eunuchs and professional <lb/>
            profligates live at their ease ? what ? is it not unjust that <lb/>
            maidens of the highest birth should be roused at night to <lb/>
            perform Divine service, while fallen women enjoy the <lb/>
            soundest sleep ? Labour calls for the best men : the senate <lb/>
            often passes the whole day in debate, while at the same <lb/>
            time every scoundrel either amuses his leisure in the <lb/>
            Campus Martius, or lurks in a tavern, or passes his time in <lb/>
            some pleasant society. The same thing happens in this <lb/>
            great commonwealth (of the world) : good men labour, <lb/>
            spend and are spent, and that too of their own free <lb/>
            will; they are not dragged along by fortune, but follow <pb n="16"/>

            her and take equal steps with her; if they knew how, they <lb/>
            would outstrip her. I remember, also, to have heard this <lb/>
            spirited saying of that stoutest-hearted of men, Demetrius. <lb/>
            " Ye immortal Gods," said he, " the only complaint which <lb/>
            I have to make of you is that you did not make your will <lb/>
            known to me earlier; for then I would sooner have gone <lb/>
            into that state of life to which I now have been called. Do <lb/>
            you wish to take my children ? it was for you that I brought <lb/>
            them up. ' Do you wish to take some part of my body ? <lb/>
            take it: it is no great thing that I am offering you, I shall <lb/>
            soon have done with the whole of it. Do you wish for my <lb/>
            life ? why should I hesitate to return to you what you gave <lb/>
            me ? whatever you ask you shall receive with my good <lb/>
            will: nay, I would rather give it than be forced to hand it <lb/>
            over to you: what need had you to take away what you <lb/>
            did ? you might have received it from me: yet even as it <lb/>
            is you cannot take anything from me, because you cannot <lb/>
            rob a man unless he resists."</p>
          <p>I am constrained to nothing, I suffer nothing against my <lb/>
            will, nor am I God's slave, but his willing follower, and so <lb/>
            much the more because I know that everything is ordained <lb/>
            and proceeds according to a law that endures for ever. <lb/>
            The fates guide us, and the length of every man's days is <lb/>
            decided at the first hour of his birth: every cause depends <lb/>
            upon some earlier cause : one long chain of destiny decides <lb/>
            all things, public or private. Wherefore, everything must <lb/>
            be patiently endured, because events do not fall in our way, <lb/>
            as we imagine, but come by a regular law. It has long <lb/>
            ago been settled at what you should rejoice and at what <lb/>
            you should weep, and although the lives of individual men <lb/>
            appear to differ from one another in a great variety of par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, yet the sum total comes to one and the same thing : <lb/>
            we soon perish, and the gifts which we receive soon <lb/>
            perish. Why, then, should we be angry ? why should we <lb/>
            lament ? we are prepared for our fate: let nature deal <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            as she will with her own bodies ; let us be cheerful whatever <lb/>
            befalls, and stoutly reflect that it is not anything of our <lb/>
            own that perishes. What is the duty of a good man ? to <lb/>
            submit himself to fate: it is a great consolation to be <lb/>
            swept away together with the entire universe: whatever <lb/>
            law is laid upon us that thus we must live and thus we must <lb/>
            die, is laid upon the gods also: one unchangeable stream <lb/>
            bears along men and gods alike : the creator and ruler of <lb/>
            the universe himself, though he has given laws to the fates, <lb/>
            yet is guided by them : he always obeys, he only once com­ <lb/>
            manded. " But why was God so unjust in His distribution of <lb/>
            fate, as to assign poverty, wounds, and untimely deaths to <lb/>
            good men ? " The workman cannot alter his materials: <lb/>
            this is their nature. Some qualities cannot be separated <lb/>
            from some others: they cling together ; are indivisible. <lb/>
            Dull minds, tending to sleep or to a waking state exactly <lb/>
            like sleep, are composed of sluggish elements : it requires <lb/>
            stronger stuff to form a man meriting careful description. <lb/>
            His course will not be straightforward; he must go up­ <lb/>
            wards and downwards, be tossed about, and guide his vessel <lb/>
            through troubled waters: he must make his way in spite <lb/>
            of fortune : he will meet with much that is hard which he <lb/>
            must soften, much that is rough that he must make smooth. <lb/>
            Fire tries gold, misfortune tries brave men. See how <lb/>
            high virtue has to climb: you may be sure that it has no <lb/>
            safe path to tread.</p>
          <p>" Steep is the path at first: the steeds, though strong, <lb/>
            Fresh from their rest, can hardly crawl along; <lb/>
            The middle part lies through the topmost sky, <lb/>
            Whence oft, as I the earth and sea descry, <lb/>
            I shudder, terrors through my bosom thrill. <lb/>
            The ending of the path is sheer down hill, <lb/>

          <p>When the spirited youth heard this, he said, " I have no <lb/>
            fault to find with the road: I will mount it, it is worth <lb/>
            while to go through these places, even though one fall." <lb/>

          <p>VI. " Yet, why does God permit evil to happen to <lb/>
            good men ? " He does not permit it: he takes away from <lb/>
            them all evils, such as crimes and scandalous wickedness, <lb/>
            daring thoughts, grasping schemes, blind lusts, and avarice <lb/>
            coveting its neighbour's goods. He protects and saves them. <lb/>

            after the baggage of good men also ? Why, they them­ <lb/>

            God permits that to happen to a good man, which a good <lb/>

            They are slain: why not, since sometimes they choose to <lb/>
            lay violent hands on themselves ? Why do they suffer cer­ <lb/>
            tain miseries ? it is that they may teach others how to do <lb/>
            so. They are born as patterns. Conceive, therefore, that <lb/>
            God says:—" You, who have chosen righteousness, what <lb/>
            complaint can you make of me ? I have encompassed <lb/>
            other men with unreal good things, and have deceived their <lb/>
            inane minds as it were by a long and misleading dream : I <lb/>
            have bedecked them with gold, silver, and ivory, but within <lb/>
            them there is no good thing. Those men whom you re­ <lb/>
            gard as fortunate, if you could see, not their outward show, <lb/>
            but their hidden life, are really unhappy, mean, and base, <lb/>
            ornamented on the outside like the walls of their houses : <lb/>
            that good fortune of theirs is not sound and genuine : it is <lb/>
            only a veneer, and that a thin one. As long, therefore, as <lb/>
            they can stand upright and display themselves as they <lb/>
            choose, they shine and impose upon one; when something <lb/>
            occurs to shake and unmask them, we see how deep <lb/>
            and real a rottenness was hidden by that factitious magni­ <lb/>
            ficence. To you I have given sure and lasting good <lb/>
            things, which become greater and better the more one <lb/>
            turns them over and views them on every side: I have <lb/>
            granted to you to scorn danger, to disdain passion. Yon <lb/>
            do not shine outwardly, all your good qualities are turned <lb/>
            inwards ; even so does the world neglect what lies without <lb/>
            it, and rejoices in the contemplation of. itself. I have <lb/>
            placed every good thing within your own breasts : it is <lb/>
            your good fortune not to need any good fortune. 'Yet <lb/>
            many things befall you which are sad, dreadful, hard to be <lb/>
            borne.' Well, as I have not been able to remove these from <lb/>
            your path, I have given your minds strength to combat <lb/>
            all: bear them bravely. In this you can surpass God <lb/>
            himself; He is beyond suffering evil: you are above it. <lb/>
            Despise poverty; no man lives as poor as he was born: <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            despise pain ; either it will cease or you will cease : despise <lb/>
            death; it either ends you or takes you elsewhere : despise <lb/>
            fortune; I have given her no weapon that can reach the <lb/>
            mind. Above all, I have taken care that no one should <lb/>
            hold you captive against your will: the way of escape lies <lb/>
            open before you : if you do not choose to fight, you may <lb/>
            fly. For this reason, of all those matters which I have <lb/>
            deemed essential for you, I have made nothing easier for <lb/>
            you than to die. I have set man's life as it were on a <lb/>
            mountain side: it soon slips down.1 Do but watch, and <lb/>
            you will see how short and how ready a path leads to free­ <lb/>
            dom. I have not imposed such long delays upon those who <lb/>
            quit the world as upon those who enter it: were it not so, <lb/>
            fortune would hold a wide dominion over you, if a man <lb/>
            died as slowly as he is born. Let all time, let every place <lb/>
            teach you, how simple it is to renounce nature, and to fling <lb/>
            back her gifts to her : before the altar itself and during <lb/>
            the solemn rites of sacrifice, while life is being prayed for, <lb/>
            learn how to die. Fat oxen fall dead with a tiny wound; <lb/>
            a blow from a man's hand fells animals of great strength : <lb/>
            the sutures of the neck are severed by a thin blade, and <lb/>
            when the joint which connects the head and neck is cut, all <lb/>
            that great mass falls. The breath of life is not deep seated, <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Walter Scott: " All .... must have felt that but for the <lb/>

          <p>I <lb/>
            MIGHT truly say, Serenus, that there is as wide a dif­ <lb/>
            ference between the Stoics and the other sects of philo­ <lb/>
            sophers as there is between men and women, since each <lb/>
            class contributes an equal share to human society, but the <lb/>
            one is born to command, the other to obey. The other <lb/>
            philosophers deal with us gently and coaxingly, just as our <lb/>
            accustomed family physicians usually do with our bodies, <lb/>
            treating them not by the best and shortest method, but by <lb/>
            that which we allow them to employ; whereas the Stoics <lb/>
            adopt a manly course, and do not care about its appearing <lb/>
            attractive to those who are entering upon it, but that it <lb/>
            should as quickly as possible take us out of the world, and <lb/>
            lead us to that lofty eminence which is so far beyond the <lb/>
            scope of any missile weapon that it is above the reach of <lb/>
            Fortune herself. " But the way by which we are asked to <lb/>
            climb is steep and uneven." What then ? Can heights be <lb/>
            reached by a level path ? Yet they are not so sheer and <lb/>
            precipitous as some think. It is only the first part that <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            has rocks and cliffs and no apparent outlet, just as many <lb/>
            hills seen from a long way off appear abruptly steep and <lb/>
            joined together, because the distance deceives our sight, <lb/>
            and then, as we draw nearer, those very hills which our <lb/>
            mistaken eyes had made into one gradually unfold them­ <lb/>
            selves, those parts which seemed precipitous from 'afar <lb/>
            assume a gently sloping outline. When just now mention <lb/>
            was made of Marcus Cato, you whose mind revolts at <lb/>
            injustice were indignant at Cato's own age having so little <lb/>
            understood him, at its having allotted a place below <lb/>
            Vatinius to one who towered above both Caesar and Pom­ <lb/>
            peius; it seemed shameful to you, that when he spoke <lb/>
            against some law in the Forum his toga was torn from him, <lb/>
            and that he was hustled through the hands of a mutinous <lb/>
            mob from the Rostra as far as the arch of Fabius, enduring <lb/>
            all the bad language, spitting, and other insults of the <lb/>
            frantic rabble.</p>
          <p>II. I then answered, that you had good cause to be <lb/>
            anxious on behalf of the commonwealth, which Publius <lb/>
            Clodins on the one side, Vatinius and all the greatest <lb/>
            scoundrels on the other, were putting up for sale, and, car­ <lb/>
            ried away by their blind covetousness, did not understand <lb/>
            that when they sold it they themselves were sold with it; <lb/>
            I bade you have no fears on behalf of Cato himself, <lb/>
            because the wise man can neither receive injury nor insult, <lb/>
            and it is more certain that the immortal gods have given <lb/>
            Cato as a pattern of a wise man to us, than that they gave <lb/>
            Ulysses or Hercules to the earlier ages; for these our <lb/>
            Stoics have declared were wise men, unconquered by <lb/>
            labours, despisers of pleasure, and superior to all terrors. <lb/>
            Cato did not slay wild beasts, whose pursuit belongs to <lb/>
            huntsmen and countrymen, nor did he exterminate fabu­ <lb/>
            lous creatures with fire and sword, or live in times when it <lb/>
            was possible to believe that the heavens could be supported <lb/>
            on the shoulders of one man. In an age which had thrown <pb n="24"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            off its belief in antiquated superstitions, and had carried ma­ <lb/>
            terial knowledge to its highest point, he had to struggle <lb/>
            against that many-beaded monster, ambition, against that <lb/>
            boundless lust for power which the whole world divided <lb/>
            among three men could not satisfy. He alone withstood the <lb/>
            vices of a worn-out State, sinking into ruin through its own <lb/>
            bulk; he upheld the falling commonwealth as far as it <lb/>
            could be upheld by one man's hand, until at last his sup­ <lb/>
            port was withdrawn, and he shared the crash which he <lb/>
            had so long averted, and perished together with that from <lb/>
            which it was impious to separate him—for Cato did not <lb/>
            outlive freedom, nor did freedom outlive Cato. Think you <lb/>
            that the people could do any wrong to such a man when <lb/>
            they tore away his praetorship or his toga ? when they be­ <lb/>
            spattered his sacred head with the rinsings of their mouths ? <lb/>
            The wise man is safe, and no injury or insult can touch <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>III. I think I see your excited and boiling temper. You <lb/>
            are preparing to exclaim: " These are the things which <lb/>
            take away all weight from your maxims; you promise great <lb/>
            matters, such as I should not even wish for, let alone <lb/>
            believe to be possible, and then, after all your brave words, <lb/>
            though you say that the wise man is not poor, you admit <lb/>
            that he often is in want of servants, shelter, and food. <lb/>
            You say that the wise man is not mad, yet you admit that <lb/>
            he sometimes loses his reason, talks nonsense, and is driven <lb/>
            to the wildest actions by the stress of his disorder. When <lb/>
            you say that the wise man cannot be a slave, you do not <lb/>
            deny that he will be sold, carry out orders, and perform <lb/>
            menial services at the bidding of his master; so, for all <lb/>
            your proud looks, you come down to the level of every <lb/>
            one else, and merely call things by different names. <lb/>
            Consequently, I suspect that something of this kind lurks <lb/>
            behind this maxim, which at first sight appears so beauti­ <lb/>
            ful and noble, ' that the wise man can neither receive <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            injury nor insult.' It makes a great deal of difference <lb/>
            whether you declare that the wise man is beyond feeling <lb/>
            resentment, or beyond receiving injury; for if you say that <lb/>
            he will bear it calmly, he has no special privilege in that, <lb/>
            for he has developed a very common quality, and one <lb/>
            which is learned by long endurance of wrong itself, namely, <lb/>
            patience. If you declare that he can never receive an <lb/>
            injury, that is, that no one will attempt to do him one, then <lb/>
            I will throw up all my occupations in life and become a <lb/>
            Stoic."</p>
          <p>It has not been my object to decorate the wise man with <lb/>
            mere imaginary verbal honours, but to raise him to a posi­ <lb/>
            tion where no injury will be permitted to reach him. <lb/>
            " What ? will there be no one to tease him, to try to wrong <lb/>
            him ? " There is nothing on earth so sacred as not to be <lb/>
            liable to sacrilege; yet holy things exist on high none the <lb/>
            less because there are men who strike at a greatness which <lb/>
            is far above themselves, though with no hope of reaching it. <lb/>
            The invulnerable is not that which is never struck, but <lb/>
            that which is never wounded. In this class I will show <lb/>
            you the wise man. Can we doubt that the strength <lb/>
            which is never overcome in fight is more to be relied on <lb/>
            than that which is never challenged, seeing that untested <lb/>
            power is untrustworthy, whereas that solidity which hurls <lb/>
            back all attacks is deservedly regarded as the most trust­ <lb/>
            worthy of all p In like manner yon may know that the <lb/>
            wise man, if no injury hurts him, is of a higher type than <lb/>
            if none is offered to him, and I should call him a brave <lb/>
            man whom war does not subdue and the violence of the <lb/>
            enemy does not alarm, not him who enjoys luxurious ease <lb/>
            amid a slothful people. I say, then, that such a wise man <lb/>
            is invulnerable against all injury; it matters not, therefore, <lb/>
            how many darts be hurled at him, since he can be pierced <lb/>
            by none of them. Just as the hardness of some stones is <lb/>
            impervious to steel, and adamant can neither be cut, <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            broken, or ground, but blunts all instruments used upon <lb/>
            it; just as some things cannot be destroyed by fire, but <lb/>
            when encircled by flame still retain their hardness and <lb/>
            shape; just as some tall projecting cliffs break the waves <lb/>
            of the sea, and though lashed by them through many <lb/>
            centuries, yet show no traces of their rage; even so the <lb/>
            mind of the wise man is firm, and gathers so much strength, <lb/>
            that it is as safe from injury as any of those things which <lb/>
            I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>IV. " What then ? Will there be no one who will try to <lb/>
            do an injury to the wise man? " Yes, some one will try, but <lb/>
            the injury will not reach him; for he is separated from the <lb/>
            contact of his inferiors by so wide a distance that no evil <lb/>
            impulse can retain its power of harm until it reaches him. <lb/>
            Even when powerful men, raised to positions of high <lb/>
            authority, and strong in the obedience of their dependents, <lb/>
            strive to injure him, all their darts fall as far short of his <lb/>
            wisdom as those which are shot upwards by bowstrings or <lb/>
            catapults, which, although they rise so high as to pass out <lb/>
            of sight, yet fall back again without reaching the heavens. <lb/>
            Why, do you suppose that when that stupid king1 <lb/>
            clouded the daylight with the multitude of his darts, that <lb/>
            any arrow of them all went into the sun ? or that when he <lb/>
            flung his chains into the deep, that he was able to reach <lb/>
            Neptune ? Just as sacred things escape from the hands of <lb/>
            men, and no injury is done to the godhead by those who <lb/>
            destroy temples and melt down images, so whoever at­ <lb/>
            tempts to treat the wise man with impertinence, insolence, <lb/>
            or scorn, does so in vain. " It would be better," say you, <lb/>
            " if no one wished to do so." You are expressing a wish <lb/>
            that the whole human race were inoffensive, which may <lb/>
            hardly be; moreover, those who would gain by such wrongs <lb/>
            not being done are those who would do them, not he who <lb/>
            could not suffer from them even if they were done; nay, I <note type="footnote">1 Xerxes. </note> <pb n="27"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            know not whether wisdom is not best displayed by calm­ <lb/>
            ness in the midst of annoyances, just as the greatest proof <lb/>
            of a general's strength in arms and men consists in his quiet­ <lb/>
            ness and confidence in the midst of an enemy's country.</p>
          <p>V. If you think fit, my Serenus, let us distinguish be­ <lb/>
            tween injury and insult. The former is naturally the <lb/>
            more grievous, the latter less important, and grievous only <lb/>
            to the thin-skinned, since it angers men but does not <lb/>
            wound them. Yet such is the weakness of men's minds, <lb/>
            that many think that there is nothing more bitter than <lb/>
            insult; thus you will find slaves who prefer to be flogged <lb/>
            to being slapped, and who think stripes and death more <lb/>
            endurable than insulting words. To such a pitch of ab­ <lb/>
            surdity have we come that we suffer not only from pain, <lb/>
            but from the idea of pain, like children, who are terror- <lb/>
            stricken by darkness, misshapen masks, and distorted <lb/>
            faces, and whose tears flow at hearing names unpleasing to <lb/>
            their ears, at the movement of our fingers, and other <lb/>
            things which they ignorantly shrink from with a sort of <lb/>
            mistaken spasm. The object which injury proposes to <lb/>
            itself is to do evil to some one. Now wisdom leaves no <lb/>
            room for evil; to it, the only evil is baseness, which cannot <lb/>
            enter into the place already occupied by virtue and honour. <lb/>
            If, therefore, there can be no injury without evil, and no <lb/>
            evil without baseness, and baseness cannot find any place <lb/>
            with a man who is already filled with honour, it follows <lb/>
            that no injury can reach the wise man; for if injury be <lb/>
            the endurance of some evil, and the wise man can endure <lb/>
            no evil, it follows that no injury takes effect upon the wise <lb/>
            man. All injury implies a making less of that which it <lb/>
            affects, and no one can sustain an injury without some loss <lb/>
            either of his dignity, or of some part of his body, or of <lb/>
            some of the things external to ourselves; but the wise man <lb/>
            can lose nothing. He has invested everything in himself, <lb/>
            has entrusted nothing to fortune, has his property in safety, <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            and is content with virtue, which does not need casual <lb/>
            accessories, and therefore can neither be increased or dimi­ <lb/>
            nished ; for virtue, as having attained to the highest posi­ <lb/>
            tion, has no room for addition to herself, and fortune <lb/>
            can take nothing away save what she gave. Now fortune <lb/>
            does not give virtue; therefore she does not take it away. <lb/>
            Virtue is free, inviolable, not to be moved, not to be shaken, <lb/>
            and so hardened against misfortunes that she cannot be <lb/>
            bent, let alone overcome by them. She looks unfalteringly <lb/>
            on while tortures are being prepared for her; she makes no <lb/>
            change of countenance, whether misery or pleasure be <lb/>
            offered to her. The wise man therefore can lose nothing <lb/>
            of whose loss he will be sensible, for he is the property of <lb/>
            virtue alone, from whom he never can be taken away. He <lb/>
            enjoys all other things at the good pleasure of fortune; <lb/>
            but who is grieved at the loss of what is not his own ? If <lb/>
            injury can hurt none of those things which are the peculiar <lb/>
            property of the wise man, because while his virtue is safe <lb/>
            they are safe, then it is impossible that an injury should be <lb/>
            done to a wise man. Demetrius, who was surnamed <lb/>
            Poliorcetes, took Megara, and the philosopher Stilbo, when <lb/>
            asked by him whether he had lost anything, answered, " No, <lb/>
            I carry all my property about me." Yet his inheritance had <lb/>
            been given up to pillage, his daughters had been outraged <lb/>
            by the enemy, his country had fallen under a foreign <lb/>
            dominion, and it was the king, enthroned on high, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by the spears of his victorious troops, who put <lb/>
            this question to him ; yet he struck the victory out of the <lb/>
            king's hands, and proved that, though the city was taken, <lb/>
            he himself was not only unconquered but unharmed, for he <lb/>
            bore with him those true goods which no one can lay <lb/>
            hands upon. What was being plundered and carried away <lb/>
            hither and thither he did not consider to be his own, but <lb/>
            to be merely things which come and go at the caprice of <lb/>
            fortune; therefore he had not loved them as his own, for <pb n="29"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            the possession of all things which come from without is <lb/>
            slippery and insecure.</p>
          <p>VI. Consider now, whether any thief, or false accuser, <lb/>
            or headstrong neighbour, or rich man enjoying the power <lb/>
            conferred by a childless old age, could do any injury to this <lb/>
            man, from whom neither war nor an enemy whose profes­ <lb/>
            sion was the noble art of battering city walls could take <lb/>
            away anything. Amid the flash of swords on all sides, <lb/>
            and the riot of the plundering soldiery, amid the flames <lb/>
            and blood and ruin of the fallen city, amid the crash of <lb/>
            temples falling upon their gods, one man was at peace. <lb/>
            You need not therefore account that a reckless boast, <lb/>
            for which I will give you a surety, if my words goes for <lb/>
            nothing. Indeed, you would hardly believe so much con­ <lb/>
            stancy or such greatness of mind to belong to any man• <lb/>
            but here a man comes forward to prove that you have no <lb/>
            reason for doubting that one who is but of human birth <lb/>
            can raise himself above human necessities, can tranquilly <lb/>
            behold pains, losses, diseases, wounds, and great natural <lb/>
            convulsions roaring around him, can bear adversity with <lb/>
            calm and prosperity with moderation, neither yielding to <lb/>
            the former nor trusting to the latter, that he can remain <lb/>
            the same amid all varieties of fortune, and think nothing <lb/>
            to be his own save himself, and himself too only as regards <lb/>
            his better part. " Behold," says he, " I am here to prove <lb/>
            to you that although, under the direction of that destroyer <lb/>
            of so many cities, walls may be shaken by the stroke of the <lb/>
            ram, lofty towers may be suddenly brought low by gal­ <lb/>
            leries and hidden mines, and mounds arise so high as to <lb/>
            rival the highest citadel, yet that no siege engines can be <lb/>
            discovered which can shake a well-established mind. I <lb/>
            have just crept from amid the ruins of my house, and with <lb/>
            conflagrations blazing all around I have escaped from the <lb/>
            flames through blood. What fate has befallen my daugh­ <lb/>
            ters, whether a worse one than that of their country, I <pb n="30"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            know not. Alone and elderly, and seeing everything around <lb/>
            me in the hands of the enemy, still I declare that my pro­ <lb/>
            perty is whole and untouched. I have, I hold whatever of <lb/>
            mine I have ever had. There is no reason for you to sup­ <lb/>
            pose me conquered and yourself my conqueror. It is <lb/>
            your fortune which has overcome mine. As for those <lb/>
            fleeting possessions which change their owners, I know not <lb/>
            where they are; what belongs to myself is with me, and <lb/>
            ever will be. I see rich men who have lost their estates; <lb/>
            lustful men who have lost their loves, the courtesans whom <lb/>
            they cherished at the cost of much shame; ambitious men <lb/>
            who have lost the senate, the law courts, the places set <lb/>
            apart for the public display of men's vices; usurers who <lb/>
            have lost their account-books, in which avarice vainly en­ <lb/>
            joyed. an unreal wealth; but I possess everything whole <lb/>
            and uninjured. Leave me, and go and ask those who are <lb/>
            weeping and lamenting over the loss of their money, who <lb/>
            are offering their bare breasts to drawn swords in its <lb/>
            defence, or who are fleeing from the enemy with weighty <lb/>
            pockets." See then, Serenus, that the perfect man, full of <lb/>
            human and divine virtues, can lose nothing ; his goods are <lb/>
            surrounded by strong and impassable walls. You'cannot <lb/>
            compare with them the walls of Babylon, which Alexander <lb/>
            entered, nor the fortifications of Carthage and Numantia, <lb/>
            won by one and the same hand,1 nor the Capitol and citadel <lb/>
            of Rome, which are branded with the marks of the victors' <lb/>
            insults ; the ramparts which protect the wise man are safe <lb/>
            from fire and hostile invasion; they afford no passage; they <lb/>
            are lofty, impregnable, divine.</p>
          <p>VII. You have no cause for saying, as you are wont to <lb/>
            do, that this wise man of ours2 is nowhere to be found; we <lb/>
            do not invent him as an unreal glory of the human race, or <lb/>
            conceive a mighty shadow of an untruth, but we have dis­ <lb/>
            played and will display him just as we sketch him, though <note type="footnote"> 1 Scipio. </note><note type="footnote">2 The Stoics. </note> <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            he may perhaps be uncommon, and only one appears at <lb/>
            long intervals ; for what is great and transcends the common <lb/>
            ordinary type is not often produced ; but this very Marcus <lb/>
            Cato himself, the mention of whom started this discussion, <lb/>
            was a man who I fancy even surpassed our model. More­ <lb/>
            over, that which hurts must be stronger than that which is <lb/>
            hurt. Now wickedness is not stronger than virtue; therefore <lb/>
            the wise man cannot be hurt. Only the bad attempt to <lb/>
            injure the good. Good men are at peace among themselves; <lb/>
            bad ones are equally mischievous to the good and to one <lb/>
            another. If a man cannot be hurt by one weaker than <lb/>
            himself, and a bad man be weaker than a good one, and <lb/>
            the good have no injury to dread, except from one unlike <lb/>
            themselves; then, no injury takes effect upon the wise man; <lb/>
            for by this time I need not remind you that no one save <lb/>
            the wise man is good.</p>
          <p>" If," says our adversary, " Socrates was unjustly <lb/>
            condemned, he received an injury." At this point it <lb/>
            is needful for us to bear in mind that it is possible <lb/>
            for some one to do an injury to me, and yet for me not to <lb/>
            receive it, as if any one were to steal something from my <lb/>
            country-house and leave it in my town-house, that man <lb/>
            would commit a theft, yet I should lose nothing. A man <lb/>
            may become mischievous, and yet do no actual mischief: <lb/>
            if a man lies with his own wife as if she were a stranger, <lb/>
            he will commit adultery, but his wife will not; if a man <lb/>
            gives me poison and the poison lose its strength when <lb/>
            mixed with food, that man, by administering the poison, <lb/>
            has made himself a criminal, even though he has done no <lb/>
            hurt. A man is no less a brigand because his sword <lb/>
            becomes entangled in his victim's clothes and misses its <lb/>
            mark. All crimes, as far as concerns their criminality, are <lb/>
            completed before the actual deed is accomplished. Some <lb/>
            crimes are of such a nature and bound by such conditions <lb/>
            that the first part can take place without the second, <pb n="32"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            though the second cannot take place without the first. I <lb/>
            will endeavour to explain these words : I can move my <lb/>
            feet and yet not run; but I cannot run without moving <lb/>
            my feet. I can be in the water without swimming; but if <lb/>
            I swim, I cannot help being in the water. The matter of <lb/>
            which we are treating is of this character: if I have re­ <lb/>
            ceived an injury, it is necessary that some one must have <lb/>
            done it to me; but if an injury has been done me, it is not <lb/>
            necessary that I should have received one; for many cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances may intervene to avert the injury, as, for <lb/>
            example, some chance may strike the hand that is aiming <lb/>
            at us, and the dart, after it has been thrown, may swerve <lb/>
            aside. So injuries of all kinds may by certain circumstances <lb/>
            be thrown back and intercepted in mid-course, so that they <lb/>
            may be done and yet not received.</p>
          <p>VIII. Moreover, justice can suffer nothing unjust, because <lb/>
            contraries cannot co-exist; but an injury can only be done <lb/>
            unjustly, therefore an injury cannot be done to the wise <lb/>
            man. Nor need you wonder at no one being able to do him <lb/>
            an injury; for no one can do him any good service either. <lb/>
            The wise man lacks nothing which he can accept by way <lb/>
            of a present, and the bad man can bestow nothing that is <lb/>
            worthy of the wise man's acceptance ; for he must possess <lb/>
            it before he can bestow it, and he possesses nothing which <lb/>
            the wise man would rejoice to have handed over to him. <lb/>
            Consequently, no one can do either harm or good to the <lb/>
            wise man, because divine things neither want help nor are <lb/>
            capable of being hurt; and the wise man is near, indeed <lb/>
            very near to the gods, being like a god in every respect <lb/>
            save that he is mortal. As he presses forward and makes <lb/>
            his way towards the life that is sublime, well-ordered, <lb/>
            without fear, proceeding in a regular and harmonious <lb/>
            course, tranquil, beneficent, made for the good of mankind, <lb/>
            useful both to itself and to others, he will neither long nor <lb/>
            weep for anything that is grovelling. He who, trusting to <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            reason, passes through human affairs with "godlike mind, <lb/>
            has no quarter from which he can receive injury. Do you <lb/>
            suppose that I mean merely from no man ? He cannot <lb/>
            receive an injury even from fortune, which, whenever she <lb/>
            contends with virtue, always retires beaten. If we accept <lb/>
            with an undisturbed and tranquil mind that greatest terror <lb/>
            of all, beyond which the angry laws and the most cruel <lb/>
            masters have nothing to threaten us with, in which <lb/>
            fortune's dominion is contained—if we know that death is <lb/>
            not an evil, and therefore is not an injury either, we shall <lb/>
            much more easily endure the other things, such as losses, <lb/>
            pains, disgraces, changes of abode, bereavements, and <lb/>
            partings, which do not overwhelm the wise man even if <lb/>
            they all befall him at once, much less does he grieve at <lb/>
            them when they assail him separately. And if he bears <lb/>
            the injuries of fortune calmly, how much more will he bear <lb/>
            those of powerful men, whom he knows to be the hands of <lb/>
            fortune.</p>
          <p>IX. He therefore endures everything in the same spirit <lb/>
            with which he endures the cold of winter and the severities <lb/>
            of climate, fevers, diseases, and other chance accidents, nor <lb/>
            does he entertain so high an opinion of any man as to <lb/>
            suppose that he acts of set purpose, which belongs to <lb/>
            the wise man alone. All other men have no plans, but <lb/>
            only plots and deceits and irregular impulses of mind, <lb/>
            which he reckons the same as pure accident; now, what <lb/>
            depends upon pure accident cannot rage around us de­ <lb/>
            signedly. He reflects, also, that the largest sources of <lb/>
            injury are to be found in those things by means of which <lb/>
            danger is sought for against us, as, for example, by a <lb/>
            suborned accuser, or a false charge, or by the stirring up <lb/>
            against us of the anger of great men, and the other forms <lb/>
            of the brigandage of civilized life. Another common type <lb/>
            of injury is when a man loses some profit or prize for which <lb/>
            he has long been angling, when an inheritance which he <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            has spent great pains to render his own is left to some one <lb/>
            else, or the favour of some noble house, through which he <lb/>
            makes great gain, is taken from him. The wise man <lb/>
            escapes all this, since he knows not what it is to live for <lb/>
            hope or for fear. Add to this, that no one receives an <lb/>
            injury unmoved, but is disturbed by the feeling of it. <lb/>
            Now, the man free from mistakes has no disturbance; <lb/>
            he is master of himself, enjoying a deep and tranquil <lb/>
            repose of mind; for if an injury reaches him it moves and <lb/>
            rouses him. But the wise man is without anger, which is <lb/>
            caused by the appearance of injury, and he could not be <lb/>
            free from anger unless he were also free from injury, which <lb/>
            he knows cannot be done to him; hence it is that he is so <lb/>
            upright and cheerful, hence he is elate with constant joy. <lb/>
            So far, however, is he from shrinking from the encounter <lb/>
            either of circumstances or of men, that he makes use of <lb/>
            injury itself to make trial of himself and test his own <lb/>
            -virtue. Let us, I beseech you, show favour to this thesis <lb/>
            and listen with impartial ears and minds while the wise man <lb/>
            is being made exempt from injury; for nothing is thereby <lb/>
            taken away from your insolence, your greediest lusts, <lb/>
            your blind rashness and pride; it is without prejudice to <lb/>
            your vices that this freedom is sought for the wise man ; <lb/>
            we do not strive to prevent your doing an injury, but <lb/>
            to enable him to sink all injuries beneath himself and protect <lb/>
            himself from them by his own greatness of mind. So in <lb/>
            the sacred games many have won the victory by patiently <lb/>
            enduring the blows of their adversaries and so wearying <lb/>
            them out. Think that the wise man belongs to this class, <lb/>
            that of men who, by long and faithful practice, have acquired <lb/>
            strength to endure and tire out all the violence of their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>X. Since we have now discussed the first part of our <lb/>
            subject, let us pass on to the second, in which we will <lb/>
            prove by arguments, some of which are our own, but <pb n="35"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            which for the most part are Stoic commonplaces, that the <lb/>
            wise man cannot be insulted. There is a lesser form of <lb/>
            injury, which we must complain of rather than avenge, <lb/>
            which the laws also have considered not to deserve any <lb/>
            special punishment. This passion is produced by a mean­ <lb/>
            ness of mind which shrinks at any act or deed which treats <lb/>
            it with disrespect. " He did not admit me to his house <lb/>
            to-day, although he admitted others; he either turned <lb/>
            haughtily away or openly laughed when I spoke;" or, "he <lb/>
            placed me at dinner, not on the middle couch (the place of <lb/>
            honour), but on the lowest one and other matters of the <lb/>
            same sort, which I can call nothing but the whinings of a <lb/>
            queasy spirit. These matters chiefly affect the luxuriously­ <lb/>
            nurtured and prosperous; for those who are pressed by <lb/>
            worse evils have no time to notice such things as these. <lb/>
            Through excessive idleness, dispositions naturally weak <lb/>
            and womanish and prone to indulge in fancies through want <lb/>
            of real injuries are disturbed at these things, the greater <lb/>
            part of which arise from misunderstanding. He therefore <lb/>
            who is affected by insult shows that he possesses neither <lb/>
            sense nor trustfulness; for he considers it certain that he <lb/>
            is scorned, and this vexation affects him with a certain <lb/>
            sense of degradation, as he effaces himself and takes a lower <lb/>
            room; whereas the wise man is scorned by no one, for he <lb/>
            knows his own greatness, gives himself to understand that <lb/>
            he allows no one to have such power over him, and as for <lb/>
            all of what I should not so much call distress as uneasiness <lb/>
            of mind, he does not overcome it, but never so much as <lb/>
            feels it. Some other things strike the wise man, though <lb/>
            they may not shake his principles, such as bodily pain and <lb/>
            weakness, the loss of friends and children, and the ruin of <lb/>
            his country in war-time. I do not say that the wise man <lb/>
            does not feel these, for we do not ascribe to him the hard­ <lb/>
            ness of stone or iron; there is no virtue but is conscious of <lb/>
            its own endurance. What then does he ? He receives some <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            blows, but when he has received them he rises superior to <lb/>
            them, heals them, and brings them to an end; these more <lb/>
            trivial things he does not even feel, nor does he make use <lb/>
            of his accustomed fortitude in the endurance of evil against <lb/>
            them, but either takes no notice of them or considers them <lb/>
            to deserve to be laughed at.</p>
          <p>XI. Besides this, as most insults proceed from those who <lb/>
            are haughty and arrogant and bear their prosperity ill, he <lb/>
            has something wherewith to repel this haughty passion, <lb/>
            namely, that noblest of all the virtues, magnanimity, which <lb/>
            passes over everything of that kind as like unreal apparitions <lb/>
            in dreams and visions of the night, which have nothing in <lb/>
            them substantial or true. At the same time he reflects <lb/>
            that all men are too low to venture to look down upon <lb/>
            what is so far above them. The Latin word contumelia is <lb/>
            derived from the word contempt, because no one does that <lb/>
            injury to another unless he regards him with contempt; <lb/>
            and no one can treat his elders and betters with contempt, <lb/>
            even though he does what contemptuous persons are wont <lb/>
            to do; for children strike their parents' faces, infants <lb/>
            rumple and tear their mother's hair, and spit upon her and <lb/>
            expose what should be covered before her, and do not <lb/>
            shrink from using dirty language; yet we do not call any <lb/>
            of these things contemptuous. And why ? Because he who <lb/>
            does it is not able to show contempt. For the same reason <lb/>
            the scurrilous raillery of our slaves against their masters <lb/>
            amuses us, as their boldness only gains licence to exercise <lb/>
            itself at the expense of the guests if they begin with the <lb/>
            master; and the more contemptible and the more an object <lb/>
            of derision each one of them is, the greater licence he gives <lb/>
            his tongue. Some buy forward slave-boys for this purpose, <lb/>
            cultivate their scurrility and send them to school that they <lb/>
            may vent premeditated libels, which we do not call insults, <lb/>
            but smart sayings ; yet what madness, at one time to be <lb/>
            amused and at another to be affronted by the same thing, <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            and to call a phrase an outrage when spoken by a friend, <lb/>
            and an amusing piece of raillery when used by a slave­ <lb/>
            boy!</p>
          <p>XII. In the same spirit in which we deal with boys, the <lb/>
            wise man deals with all those whose childhood still endures <lb/>
            after their youth is past and their hair is grey. What do <lb/>
            men profit by age when their mind has all the faults of <lb/>
            childhood and their defects are intensified by time ? when <lb/>
            they differ from children only in the size and appearance <lb/>
            of their bodies, and are just as unsteady and capricious, <lb/>
            eager for pleasure without discrimination, timorous and <lb/>
            quiet through fear rather than through natural disposition? <lb/>
            One cannot say that such men differ from children because <lb/>
            the latter are greedy for knuckle-bones and nuts and <lb/>
            coppers, while the former are greedy for gold and silver <lb/>
            and cities; because the latter play amongst themselves at <lb/>
            being magistrates, and imitate the purple-edged robe of <lb/>
            state, the lictors' axes, and the judgment-seat, while the <lb/>
            former play with the same things in earnest in the Campus <lb/>
            Martius and the courts of justice; because the latter pile <lb/>
            up the sand an the seashore into the likeness of houses, <lb/>
            and the former, with an air of being engaged in important <lb/>
            business, employ themselves in piling up stones and walls <lb/>
            and roofs until they have turned what was intended for the <lb/>
            protection of the body into a danger to it ? Children and <lb/>
            those more advanced in age both make the same mistake, <lb/>
            but the latter deal with different and more important <lb/>
            things ; the wise man, therefore, is quite justified in treat­ <lb/>
            ing the affronts which he receives from such men as jokes: <lb/>
            and sometimes he corrects them, as he would children, by <lb/>
            pain and punishment, not because he has received an injury, <lb/>
            but because they have done one and in order that they <lb/>
            may do so no more. Thus we break in animals with stripes, <lb/>
            yet we are not angry with them when they refuse to carry <lb/>
            their rider, but curb them in order that pain may overcome <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            their obstinacy. Now, therefore, you know the answer to <lb/>
            the question which was put to us, " Why, if the wise man <lb/>
            receives neither injury nor insult, he punishes those who do <lb/>
            these things ? " He does not revenge himself, but corrects <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>XIII. What, then, is there to prevent your believing this <lb/>
            strength of mind to belong to the wise man, when you can <lb/>
            see the same thing existing in others, though not from the <lb/>
            same cause ?-for what physician is angry with a crazy <lb/>
            patient ? who takes to heart the curses of a fever-stricken <lb/>
            one who is denied cold water ? The wise man retains <lb/>
            in his dealings with all men this same habit of mind which <lb/>
            the physician adopts in dealing with his patients, whose <lb/>
            parts of shame he does not scorn to handle should they <lb/>
            need treatment, nor yet to look at their solid and liquid <lb/>
            evacuations, nor to endure their reproaches when frenzied <lb/>
            by disease. The wise man knows that all those who strut <lb/>
            about in purple-edged togas,' healthy and embrowned, are <lb/>
            brain-sick people, whom he regards as sick and full of <lb/>
            follies. He is not, therefore, angry, should they in their <lb/>
            sickness presume to bear themselves somewhat impertinently <lb/>
            towards their physician, and in the same spirit as that in <lb/>
            which he sets no value upon their titles of honour, he will <lb/>
            set but little value upon their acts of disrespect to himself. <lb/>
            He will not rise in his own esteem if a beggar pays his <lb/>
            court to him, and he will not think it an affront if one of <lb/>
            the dregs of the people does not return his greeting. So <lb/>
            also he will not admire himself even if many rich men <lb/>
            admire him; for he knows that they differ in no respect <lb/>
            from beggars-nay, are even more wretched than they; for <note type="footnote"> 1 Seneca here speaks of men wearing the toga as officials, contrasted <lb/>
            with the mass of Roman citizens, among whom the wearing of the toga <lb/>
            was already falling into disuse in the time of Augustus. See Macrob., <lb/>
            " Sat.," vi. 5 extr., and Suetonius, " Life of Octavius," 40, where the <lb/>
            author mentions that Augustus used sarcastically to apply the verse, <lb/>
            Virg., ' ÆEn.,' i. 282, to the Romans of his day. </note> <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            beggars want but a little, whereas rich men want a great <lb/>
            deal. Again, he will not be moved if the King of the <lb/>
            Medes, or Attains, King of Asia, passes by him in silence <lb/>
            with a scornful air when he offers his greeting; for he <lb/>
            knows that such a man's position has nothing to render it <lb/>
            more enviable than that of the man whose duty it is in some <lb/>
            great household to keep the sick and mad servants in order. <lb/>
            Shall I be put out if one of those who do business at the <lb/>
            temple of Castor, buying and selling worthless slaves, does <lb/>
            not return my salute, a man whose shops are crowded with <lb/>
            throngs of the worst of bondmen ? I trow not; for what <lb/>
            good can there be in a man who owns none but bad men ? <lb/>
            As the wise man is indifferent to the courtesy or incivility <lb/>
            of such a man, so is he to that of a king. "You own," <lb/>
            says he, " the Parthians and Bactrians, but they are men <lb/>
            whom you keep in order by fear, they are people whose <lb/>
            possession forbids you to unstring the bow, they are fierce <lb/>
            enemies, on sale, and eagerly looking out for a new master." <lb/>
            He will not, then, be moved by an insult from any man <lb/>
            for though all men differ one from another, yet the wise <lb/>
            man regards them all as alike on account of their equal <lb/>
            folly ; for should he once lower himself to the point of <lb/>
            being affected by either injury or insult, he could never <lb/>
            feel safe afterwards, and safety is the especial advantage <lb/>
            of the wise man, and he will not be guilty of showing <lb/>
            respect to the man who has done him an injury by admitting <lb/>
            that he has received one, because it necessarily follows <lb/>
            that he who is disquieted at any one's scorn would value <lb/>
            that person's admiration.</p>
          <p>XIV. Such madness possesses some men that they <lb/>
            imagine it possible for an affront to be put upon them by a <lb/>
            woman. What matters it who she may be, how many <lb/>
            slaves bear her litter, how heavily her ears are laden, how <lb/>
            soft her seat? she is always the same thoughtless crea­ <lb/>
            ture, and unless she possesses acquired knowledge and <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            much learning, she is fierce and passionate in her desires. <lb/>
            Some are annoyed at being jostled by a heater of curling­ <lb/>
            tongs, and call the reluctance of a great man's porter to <lb/>
            open the door, the pride of his nomenclator,1 or the disdain­ <lb/>
            fulness of his chamberlain, insults. 0 ! what laughter is <lb/>
            to be got out of such things, with what amusement the <lb/>
            mind may be filled when it contrasts the frantic follies of <lb/>
            others with its own peace ! " How then ? will the wise man <lb/>
            not approach doors which are kept by a surly porter ? " Nay, <lb/>
            if any need calls him thither, he will make trial of him, how­ <lb/>
            ever fierce he may be, will tame him as one tames a dog by <lb/>
            offering it food, and will not be enraged at having to expend <lb/>
            entrance-money, reflecting that on certain bridges also one <lb/>
            has to pay toll; in like fashion he will pay his fee to who­ <lb/>
            ever farms this revenue of letting in visitors, for he knows <lb/>
            that men are wont to buy whatever is offered for sale.2 A man <lb/>
            shows a poor spirit if he is pleased with himself for having <lb/>
            answered the porter cavalierly, broken his staff, forced his <lb/>
            way into his master's presence, and demanded a whipping <lb/>
            for him. He who strives with a man makes himself that <lb/>
            man's rival, and must be on equal terms with him before <lb/>
            he can overcome him. But what will the wise man do when <lb/>
            he receives a cuff ? He will do as Cato did when he was <lb/>
            struck in the face; he did not flare up and revenge the <lb/>
            outrage, he did not even pardon it, but ignored it, showing <lb/>
            more magnanimity in not acknowledging it than if he had <lb/>
            forgiven it. We will not dwell long upon this point; for <lb/>
            who is there who knows not that none of those things <lb/>
            which are thought to be good or evil are looked upon by <lb/>
            the wise man and by mankind in general in the same <lb/>
            manner ? He does not regard what all men think low or <lb/>
            wretched; he does not follow the people's track, but as the <note type="footnote"> 1 See note, " De Beneficiis," vi. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gertz reads ' decet emere venalia,' ' there is no harm in buying <lb/>
            what is for sale.' </note> <pb n="41"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            stars move in a path opposite to that of the earth, so he <lb/>
            proceeds contrary to the prejudices of all.</p>
          <p>XV. Cease then to say, " Will not the wise man, then, <lb/>
            receive an injury if he be beaten, if his eye be knocked out ? <lb/>
            will he not receive an insult if he be hooted through the <lb/>
            Forum by the foul voices of ruffians ? if at a court banquet he <lb/>
            be bidden to leave the table and eat with slaves appointed <lb/>
            to degrading duties ? if he be forced to endure anything <lb/>
            else that can be thought of that would gall a high spirit ?" <lb/>
            However many or however severe these crosses may be, <lb/>
            they will all be of the same kind; and if small ones do not <lb/>
            affect him, neither will greater ones; if a few do not affect <lb/>
            him, neither will more. It is from your own weakness that <lb/>
            you form your idea of his colossal mind, and when you have <lb/>
            thought how much you yourselves could endure to suffer, <lb/>
            you place the limit of the wise man's endurance a little way <lb/>
            beyond that. But his virtue has placed him in another <lb/>
            region of the universe which has nothing-in common with <lb/>
            you. Seek out sufferings and all things hard to be borne, <lb/>
            repulsive to be heard or seen; he will not be overwhelmed <lb/>
            by their combination, and will bear all just as he bears each <lb/>
            one of them. He who says that the wise man can bear this <lb/>
            and cannot bear that, and restrains his magnanimity <lb/>
            within certain limits, does wrong; for Fortune overcomes <lb/>
            us unless she is entirely overcome. Think not that this is <lb/>
            mere Stoic austerity. Epicurus, whom you adopt as the <lb/>
            patron of your laziness, and who, you imagine, always <lb/>
            taught what was soft and slothful and conducive to plea­ <lb/>
            sure, said, "Fortune seldom stands in a wise man's way." <lb/>
            How near he came to a manly sentiment! Do thou dare <lb/>
            to speak more boldly, and clear her out of the way altoge­ <lb/>
            ther ! This is the house of the wise man—narrow, un­ <lb/>
            adorned, without bustle and splendour, the threshold <lb/>
            guarded by no porters who marshal the crowd of visitors <lb/>
            with a haughtiness proportionate to their bribes-but For- <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            tune cannot cross this open and unguarded threshold. She <lb/>
            knows that there is no room for her where there is nothing <lb/>
            of hers.</p>
          <p>XVI. Now if even Epicurus, who made more conces­ <lb/>
            sions to the body than any one, takes a spirited tone with <lb/>
            regard to injuries, what can appear beyond belief or <lb/>
            beyond the scope of human nature amongst us Stoics ? He <lb/>
            says that injuries may be endured by the wise man, we say <lb/>
            that they do not exist for him. Nor is there any reason <lb/>
            why you should declare this to be repugnant to nature. <lb/>
            We do not deny that it is an unpleasant thing to be beaten <lb/>
            or struck, or to lose one of our limbs, but we say that none <lb/>
            of these things are injuries. We do not take away from <lb/>
            them the feeling of pain, but the name of "injury," which <lb/>
            cannot be received while our virtue is unimpaired. We <lb/>
            shall see which of the two is nearest the truth; each of <lb/>
            them agree in despising injury. You ask what difference <lb/>
            there is between them ? All that there is between two <lb/>
            very brave gladiators, one-of whom conceals his wound and <lb/>
            holds his ground, while the other turns round to the shout­ <lb/>
            ing populace, gives them to understand that his wound is <lb/>
            nothing, and does not permit them to interfere on his behalf. <lb/>
            You need not think that it is any great thing about which <lb/>
            we differ; the whole gist of the matter, that which alone <lb/>
            concerns you, is what both schools of philosophy urge you <lb/>
            to do, namely, to despise injuries and insults, which I may <lb/>
            call the shadows and outlines of injuries, to despise which <lb/>
            does not need a wise man, but merely a sensible one, who <lb/>
            can say to himself, " Do these things befall me deservedly <lb/>
            or undeservedly ? If deservedly, it is not an insult, but a <lb/>
            judicial sentence; if undeservedly, then he who does injus­ <lb/>
            tice ought to blush, not I. And what is this which is called <lb/>
            an insult ? Some one has made a joke about the baldness <lb/>
            of my head, the weakness of my eyes, the thinness of my <lb/>
            legs, the shortness of my stature; what insult is there in <pb n="43"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            telling me that which every one sees? We laugh when <lb/>
            tête-à-tête at the same thing at which we are indignant <lb/>
            when it is said before a crowd, and we do not allow others <lb/>
            the privilege of saying what we ourselves are wont to say <lb/>
            about ourselves; we are amused at decorous jests, but are <lb/>
            angry if they are carried too far."</p>
          <p>XVII. Chrysippus says that a man was enraged because <lb/>
            some one called him a sea-sheep; we have seen Fidus Cor­ <lb/>
            nelius, the son-in-law of Ovidius Naso, weeping in the <lb/>
            Senate-house because Corbulo called him a plucked ostrich; <lb/>
            his command of his countenance did not fail him at other <lb/>
            abusive charges, which damaged his character and way of <lb/>
            life; at this ridiculous saying he burst into tears. So <lb/>
            deplorable is the weakness of men's minds when reason no <lb/>
            longer guides them. What of our taking offence if any one <lb/>
            imitates our talk, our walk, or apes any defect of our person <lb/>
            or our pronunciation ? as if they would become more noto­ <lb/>
            rious by another's imitation than by our doing them our­ <lb/>
            selves. Some are unwilling to hear about their age and <lb/>
            grey hairs, and all the rest of what men pray to arrive at. <lb/>
            The reproach of poverty agonizes some men, and whoever <lb/>
            conceals it makes it a reproach to himself; and therefore if <lb/>
            you of your own accord are the first to acknowledge it, you <lb/>
            cut the ground from under the feet of those who would sneer <lb/>
            and politely insult you; no one is laughed at who begins <lb/>
            by laughing at himself. Tradition tells us that Vatinius, <lb/>
            a man born both to be laughed at and hated, was a <lb/>
            witty and clever jester. He made many jokes about his <lb/>
            feet and his short neck, and thus escaped the sarcasms of <lb/>
            Cicero above all, and of his other enemies, of whom he had <lb/>
            more than he had diseases. If he, who through constant <lb/>
            abuse had forgotten how to blush, could do this by sheer <lb/>
            brazenness, why should not he who has made some progress <lb/>
            in the education of a gentleman and the study of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy ? Besides, it is a sort of revenge to spoil a man's <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            enjoyment of the insult he has offered to us ; such men say, <lb/>
            " Dear me, I suppose he did not understand it." Thus the <lb/>
            success of an insult lies in the sensitiveness and rage of the <lb/>
            victim; hereafter the insulter will sometimes meet his <lb/>
            match ; some one will be found to revenge you also.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Gaius Caesar, among the other vices with which <lb/>
            he overflowed, was possessed by a strange insolent passion <lb/>
            for marking every one with some note of ridicule, he himself <lb/>
            being the most tempting subject for derision; so ugly was <lb/>
            the paleness which proved him mad, so savage the glare of <lb/>
            the eyes which lurked under his old woman's brow, so <lb/>
            hideous his misshapen head, bald and dotted about with a <lb/>
            few cherished hairs; besides the neck set thick with bristles, <lb/>
            his thin legs, his monstrous feet. It would be endless were <lb/>
            I to mention all the insults which he heaped upon his <lb/>
            parents and ancestors, and people of every class of life. I <lb/>
            will mention those which brought him to ruin. An especial <lb/>
            friend of his was Asiaticus Valerius, a proud-spirited man <lb/>
            and one hardly likely to put up with another's insults <lb/>
            quietly. At a drinking bout, that is, a public assembly, <lb/>
            Gains, at the top of his voice, reproached this man with the <lb/>
            way his wife behaved in bed. Good gods ! that a man <lb/>
            should hear that the emperor knew this, and that he, the <lb/>
            emperor, should describe his adultery and his disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment to the lady's husband, I do not say to a man of <lb/>
            consular rank and his own friend. Chaerea, on the other <lb/>
            hand, the military tribune, had a voice not befitting his <lb/>
            prowess, feeble in sound, and somewhat suspicious unless <lb/>
            you knew his achievements. When he asked for the <lb/>
            watchword Gains at one time gave him " Venus," and at <lb/>
            another " Priapus," and by various means reproached the <lb/>
            man-at-arms with effeminate vice; while he himself was <lb/>
            dressed in transparent clothes, wearing sandals and jewel­ <lb/>
            lery. Thus he forced him to use his sword, that he might not <lb/>
            have to ask for the watchword oftener; it was Chaerea who <pb n="45"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            first of all the conspirators raised his hand, who cut through <lb/>
            the middle of Caligula's neck with one blow. After that, <lb/>
            many swords, belonging to men who had public or private <lb/>
            injuries to avenge, were thrust into his body, but he first <lb/>
            showed himself a man who seemed least like one. The <lb/>
            same Gains construed everything as an insult (since those <lb/>
            who are most eager to offer affronts are least able to endure <lb/>
            them). He was angry with Herennius Macer for having <lb/>
            greeted him as Gaius—nor did the chief centurion of triarii <lb/>
            get off scot-free for having saluted him as Caligula ; having <lb/>
            been born in the camp and brought up as the child of the <lb/>
            legions, he had been wont to be called by this name, nor <lb/>
            was there any by which he was better known to the troops, <lb/>
            but by this time he held " Caligula " to be a reproach and <lb/>
            a dishonour. Let wounded spirits, then, console them­ <lb/>
            selves with this reflexion, that, even though our easy <lb/>
            temper may have neglected to revenge itself, nevertheless <lb/>
            that there will be some one who will punish the imperti­ <lb/>
            nent, proud, and insulting man, for these are vices which he <lb/>
            never confines to one victim or one single offensive act.. <lb/>
            Let us look at the examples of those men whose endurance <lb/>
            we admire, as, for instance, that of Socrates, who took in <lb/>
            good part the published and acted jibes of the comedians <lb/>
            upon himself, and laughed no less than he did when he was <lb/>
            drenched with dirty water by his wife Xanthippe. Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes was reproached with his mother being a barbarian <lb/>
            and a Thracian; he answered that the mother of the gods, <lb/>
            too, came from Mount Ida.</p>
          <p>XIX. We ought not to engage in quarrels and wrangling; <lb/>
            we ought to betake ourselves far away and to disregard <lb/>
            everything of this kind which thoughtless people do (indeed <lb/>
            thoughtless people alone do it), and to set equal value upon <lb/>
            the honours and the reproaches of the mob ; we ought not <lb/>
            to be hurt by the one or to be pleased by the other. Other­ <lb/>
            wise we shall neglect many essential points, shall desert our <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            duty both to the state and in private life through excessive <lb/>
            fear of insults or weariness of them, and sometimes we <lb/>
            shall even miss what would do us good, while tortured by <lb/>
            this womanish pain at hearing something not to our mind. <lb/>
            Sometimes, too, when enraged with powerful men we shall <lb/>
            expose this failing by our reckless freedom of speech; yet <lb/>
            it is not freedom to suffer nothing—we are mistaken- <lb/>
            freedom consists in raising one's mind superior to injuries <lb/>
            and becoming a person whose pleasures come from himself <lb/>
            alone, in separating oneself from external circumstances <lb/>
            that one may not have to lead a disturbed life in fear of the <lb/>
            laughter and tongues of all men; for if any man can offer an in­ <lb/>
            sult, who is there who cannot ? The wise man and the would­ <lb/>
            be wise man will apply different remedies to this; for it is only <lb/>
            those whose philosophical education is incomplete, and who <lb/>
            still guide themselves by public opinion, who would suppose <lb/>
            that they ought to spend their lives in the midst of insults <lb/>
            and injuries; yet all things happen in a more endurable <lb/>
            fashion to men who are prepared for them. The nobler a <lb/>
            man is by birth, by reputation, or by inheritance, the more <lb/>
            bravely he should bear himself, remembering that the <lb/>
            tallest men stand in the front rank in battle. As for <lb/>
            insults, offensive language, marks of disgrace, and such-like <lb/>
            disfigurements, he ought to bear them as he would bear <lb/>
            the shouts of the enemy, and darts or stones flung from a <lb/>
            distance, which rattle upon his helmet without causing a <lb/>
            wound; while he should look upon injuries as wounds, <lb/>
            some received on his armour and others on his body, which <lb/>
            he endures without falling or even leaving his place in the <lb/>
            ranks. Even though you be hard pressed and violently <lb/>
            attacked by the enemy, still it is base to give way; hold <lb/>
            the post assigned to you by nature. You ask, what this <lb/>
            post is ? it is that of being a man. The wise man has <lb/>
            another help, of the opposite kind to this; you are hard at <lb/>
            work, while he has already won the victory. Do not <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            quarrel with your own good advantage, and, until you <lb/>
            shall have made your way to the truth, keep alive this hope <lb/>
            in your minds, be willing to receive the news of a better <lb/>
            life, and encourage it by your admiration and your prayers; <lb/>
            it is to the interest of the commonwealth of mankind that <lb/>
            there should be some one who is unconquered, some one <lb/>
            against whom fortune has no power.</p><pb n="48"/>

          <p>YOU have demanded of me, Novatus, that I should write <lb/>
            how anger may be soothed, and it appears to me that <lb/>
            you are right in feeling especial fear of this passion, which <lb/>
            is above all others hideous and wild: for the others have <lb/>
            some alloy of peace and quiet, but this consists wholly in <lb/>
            action and the impulse of grief, raging with an utterly <lb/>
            inhuman lust for arms, blood and tortures, careless of <lb/>
            itself provided it hurts another, rushing upon the very <lb/>
            point of the sword, and greedy for revenge even when it <lb/>
            drags the avenger to ruin with itself. Some of the wisest <lb/>
            of men have in consequence of this called anger a short <lb/>
            madness: for it is equally devoid of self control, regardless, <lb/>
            of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately engrossed in <lb/>
            whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice, excited <lb/>
            by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and <lb/>
            just, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to <lb/>
            pieces upon the very thing which it crushes. That you may <lb/>
            know that they whom anger possesses are not sane, look at. <lb/>
            their appearance; for as there are distinct symptoms which <lb/>
            mark madmen, such as a bold and menacing air, a gloomy <pb n="49"/>

            brow, a stern face, a hurried walk, restless hands, changed <lb/>
            colour, quick and strongly-drawn breathing ; the signs of <lb/>
            angry men, too, are the same : their eyes blaze and sparkle, <lb/>
            their whole face is a deep red with the blood which boils <lb/>
            up from the bottom of their heart, their lips quiver, their <lb/>
            teeth are set, their hair bristles and stands on end, their <lb/>
            breath is laboured and hissing, their joints crack as they <lb/>
            twist them about, they groan, bellow, and burst into scarcely <lb/>
            intelligible talk, they often clap their hands together and <lb/>
            stamp on the ground with their feet, and their whole body <lb/>
            is highly-strung and plays those tricks which mark a dis­ <lb/>
            traught mind, so as to furnish an ugly and shocking picture <lb/>
            of self-perversion and excitement. You cannot tell whether <lb/>
            this vice is more execrable or more disgusting. Other vices <lb/>
            can be concealed and cherished in secret; anger shows <lb/>
            itself openly and appears in the countenance, and the greater <lb/>
            it is, the more plainly it boils forth. Do you not see how <lb/>
            in all animals certain signs appear before they proceed to <lb/>
            mischief, and how their entire bodies put off their usual <lb/>
            quiet appearance and stir up their ferocity ? Boars foam <lb/>
            at the mouth and sharpen their teeth by rubbing them <lb/>
            against trees, bulls toss their horns in the air and scatter <lb/>
            the sand with blows of their feet, lions growl, the necks of <lb/>
            enraged snakes swell, mad dogs have a sullen look-there <lb/>
            is no animal so hateful and venomous by nature that it <lb/>
            does not, when seized by anger, show additional fierceness. <lb/>
            I know well that the other passions, can hardly be concealed, <lb/>
            and that lust, fear, and boldness give signs of their presence <lb/>
            and may be discovered beforehand, for there is no one of <lb/>
            the stronger passions that does not affect the countenance : <lb/>
            what then is the difference between them and anger ? <lb/>
            Why, that the other passions are visible, but that this is <lb/>
            conspicuous.</p>

            accusations and counter-accusations, sacking of cities, ruin <lb/>
            of whole peoples, the persons of princes sold into slavery <lb/>
            by auction, torches applied to roofs, and fires not merely <lb/>
            confined within city-walls but making whole tracts of <lb/>
            country glow with hostile flame. See the foundations of <lb/>
            the most celebrated cities hardly now to be discerned; <lb/>
            they were ruined by anger. See deserts extending for many <lb/>
            miles without an inhabitant : they have been desolated <lb/>
            by anger. See all the chiefs whom tradition mentions as <lb/>
            instances of ill fate; anger stabbed one of them in his <lb/>
            bed, struck down another, though he was protected by the <lb/>
            sacred rights of hospitality, tore another to pieces in the <lb/>
            very home of the laws and in sight of the crowded forum, <lb/>
            bade one shed his own blood by the parricide hand of his <lb/>
            son, another to have his royal throat cut by the hand of a <lb/>
            slave, another to stretch out his limbs on the cross : and <lb/>
            hitherto I am speaking merely of individual cases. What, <lb/>
            if you were to pass from the consideration of those single <lb/>
            men against whom anger has broken out to view whole <lb/>
            assemblies cut down by the sword, the people butchered <lb/>
            by the soldiery let loose upon it, and whole nations con­ <lb/>
            demned to death in one common ruin ... as though by <note type="footnote"> 1 Here a leaf or more has been lost, including the fragment cited in <lb/>
            Lactantius, De ira dei, 17" Ira est cupiditas," &amp;c. The entire passage <lb/>
            is :—" But the Stoics did not perceive that there is a difference between <lb/>
            right and wrong; that there is just and unjust anger: and as they <lb/>
            could find no remedy for it, they wished to extirpate it. The Peripatetics, <lb/>
            on the other hand, declared that it ought not to be destroyed, but re­ <lb/>
            strained. These I have sufficiently answered in the sixth book of my <lb/>
            I Institutiones.' It is clear that the philosophers did not comprehend <lb/>
            the reason of anger, from the definitions of it which Seneca has enu­ <lb/>
            merated in the books ' On Anger' which he has written. ' Anger,' he <lb/>
            says, ' is the desire of avenging an injury.' Others, as Posidonius <lb/>
            says, call it ' a desire to punish one by whom you think that you have <lb/>
            been unjustly injured.' Some have defined it thus, ' Anger is an impulse </note> <pb n="51"/>

            men who either freed themselves from our charge or <lb/>
            despised our authority? Why, wherefore is the people <lb/>
            angry with gladiators, and so unjust as to think itself <lb/>
            wronged if they do not die cheerfully ? It thinks itself <lb/>
            scorned, and by looks, gestures, and excitement turns itself <lb/>
            from a mere spectator into an adversary. Everything of <lb/>
            this sort is not anger, but the semblance of anger, like <lb/>
            that of boys who want to beat the ground when they have <lb/>
            fallen upon it, and who often do not even know why they <lb/>
            are angry, but are merely angry without any reason or <lb/>
            having received any injury, yet not without some semblance <lb/>
            of injury received, or without some wish to exact a penalty <lb/>
            for it. Thus they are deceived by the likeness of blows, and <lb/>
            are appeased by the pretended tears of those who deprecate <lb/>
            their wrath, and thus an unreal grief is healed by an unreal <lb/>
            revenge.</p>
          <p>III. "We often are angry," says our adversary, " not <lb/>
            with men who have hurt us, but with men who are going <lb/>
            to hurt us : so you may be sure that anger is not born of <lb/>
            injury." It is true that we are angry with those who are <lb/>
            going to hurt us, but they do already hurt us in intention, <lb/>
            and one who is going to do an injury is already doing it. <lb/>
            " The weakest of men," argues he, " are often angry with <lb/>
            the most powerful: so you may be sure that anger is not <lb/>
            a desire to punish their antagonist-for men do not desire <lb/>
            to punish him when they cannot hope to do so." In the <lb/>
            first place, I spoke of a desire to inflict punishment, not a <lb/>
            power to do so: now men desire even what they cannot <lb/>
            obtain. In the next place, no one is so low in station as <lb/>
            not to be able to hope to inflict punishment even upon <lb/>
            the greatest of men: we all are powerful for mischief. <note type="footnote"> of the mind to injure him who either has injured you or has sought to <lb/>
            injure you.' Aristotle's definition differs but little from our own. He <lb/>
            says, ' that anger is a desire to repay suffering,'" etc. </note> <pb n="52"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            Aristotle's definition differs little from mine: for he declares <lb/>
            anger to be a desire to repay suffering. It would be a long <lb/>
            task to examine the differences between his definition and <lb/>
            mine : it may be urged against both of them that wild <lb/>
            beasts become angry without being excited by injury, and <lb/>
            without any idea of punishing others or requiting them <lb/>
            with pain : for, even though they do these things, these <lb/>
            are not what they aim at doing. We must admit, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that neither wild beasts nor any other creature except <lb/>
            man is subject to anger : for, whilst anger is the foe of <lb/>
            reason, it nevertheless does not arise in any place where <lb/>
            reason cannot dwell. Wild beasts have impulses, fury, <lb/>
            cruelty, combativeness : they have not anger any more than <lb/>
            they have luxury: yet they indulge in some pleasures with <lb/>
            less self-control than human beings. Do not believe the <lb/>
            poet who says: <lb/>
            " The boar his wrath forgets, the stag forgets the hounds, <lb/>
            The bear forgets how 'midst the herd he leaped with frantic bounds." 1 <lb/>
            When he speaks of beasts being angry he means that they <lb/>
            are excited, roused up: for indeed they know no more how <lb/>
            to be angry than they know how to pardon. Dumb <lb/>
            creatures have not human feelings, but have certain im­ <lb/>
            pulses which resemble them : for if it were not so, if they <lb/>
            could feel love and hate, they would likewise be capable of <lb/>
            friendship and enmity, of disagreement and agreement. <lb/>
            Some traces of these qualities exist even in them, though <lb/>
            properly all of them, whether good or bad, belong to the <lb/>
            human breast alone. To no creature besides man has <lb/>
            been given wisdom, foresight, industry, and reflexion. To <lb/>
            animals not only human virtues but even human vices are <lb/>
            forbidden: their whole constitution, mental and bodily, <lb/>
            is unlike that of human beings: in them the royal2 and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ovid, " Met." vi. 545-6. </note><note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἡγεμονικὸν</foreign> of the Stoics. </note> <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            leading principle is drawn from another source, as, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, they possess a voice, yet not a clear one, bat indis­ <lb/>
            tinct and incapable of forming words : a tongue, but one <lb/>
            which is fettered and not sufficiently nimble for complex <lb/>
            movements: so, too, they possess intellect, the greatest <lb/>
            attribute of all, but in a rough and inexact condition. It <lb/>
            is, consequently, able to grasp those visions and semblances <lb/>
            which rouse it to action, but only in a cloudy and indis­ <lb/>
            tinct fashion. It follows from this that their impulses and <lb/>
            outbreaks are violent, and that they do not feel fear, anxieties, <lb/>
            grief, or anger, but some semblances of these feelings: <lb/>
            wherefore they quickly drop them and adopt the converse <lb/>
            of them : they graze after showing the most vehement rage <lb/>
            and terror, and after frantic bellowing and plunging they <lb/>
            straightway sink into quiet sleep.</p>
          <p>IV. What anger is has been sufficiently explained. The <lb/>
            difference between it and irascibility is evident: it is the <lb/>
            same as that between a drunken man and a drunkard ; <lb/>
            between a frightened man and a coward. It is possible <lb/>
            for an angry man not to be irascible ; an irascible man may <lb/>
            sometimes not be angry. I shall omit the other varieties <lb/>
            of anger, which the Greeks distinguish by various names, <lb/>
            because we have no distinctive words for them in our lan­ <lb/>
            guage, although we call men bitter, and harsh, and also <lb/>
            peevish, frantic, clamorous, surly, and fierce : all of which <lb/>
            are different forms of irascibility. Among these you may <lb/>
            class sulkiness, a refined form of irascibility; for there are <lb/>
            some sorts of anger which go no further than noise, while <lb/>
            some are as lasting as they are common: some are fierce <lb/>
            in deed, but inclined to be sparing of words : some expend <lb/>
            themselves in bitter words and curses: some do not go <lb/>
            beyond complaining and turning one's back: some are <lb/>
            great, deep-seated, and brood within a man : there are a <lb/>
            thousand other forms of a multiform evil.</p>
          <p>V. We have now finished our enquiry as to what anger <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            is, whether it exists in any other creature besides man, what <lb/>
            the difference is between it and irascibility, and how many <lb/>
            forms it possesses. Let us now enquire whether anger be <lb/>
            in accordance with nature, and whether it be useful and <lb/>
            worth entertaining in some measure.</p>
          <p>Whether it be according to nature will become evident <lb/>
            if we consider man's nature, than which what is more <lb/>
            gentle while it is in its proper condition ? Yet what <lb/>
            is more cruel than anger ? What is more affectionate <lb/>
            to others than man ? Yet what is more savage against <lb/>
            them than anger ? Mankind is born for mutual assis­ <lb/>
            tance, anger for mutual ruin: the former loves society, the <lb/>
            latter estrangement. The one loves to do good, the other <lb/>
            to do harm ; the one to help even strangers, the other to <lb/>
            attack even its dearest friends. The one is ready even to <lb/>
            sacrifice itself for the good of others, the other to plunge <lb/>
            into peril provided it drags others with it. Who, then, <lb/>
            can be more ignorant of nature than he who classes this <lb/>
            cruel and hurtful vice as belonging to her best and most, <lb/>
            polished work ? Anger, as we have said, is eager to punish; <lb/>
            and that such a desire should exist in man's peaceful breast <lb/>
            is least of all according to his nature; for human life is. <lb/>
            founded on benefits and harmony, and is bound together into <lb/>
            an alliance for the common help of all, not by terror, but <lb/>
            by love towards one another.</p>
          <p>VI. "What, then ? Is not correction sometimes neces­ <lb/>
            sary ? " Of course it is; but with discretion, not with anger <lb/>
            for it does not injure, but heals under the guise of injury. <lb/>
            We char crooked spearshafts to straighten them, and force­ <lb/>
            them by driving in wedges, not in order to break them, <lb/>
            but to take the bends out of them; and, in like manner, by <lb/>
            applying pain to the body or mind we correct dispositions. <lb/>
            which have been rendered crooked by vice. So the phy­ <lb/>
            sician at first, when dealing with slight disorders, tries not to <lb/>
            make much change in his patient's daily habits, to regulate <pb n="55"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            his food, drink, and exercise, and to improve his health <lb/>
            merely by altering the order in which he takes them. The <lb/>
            next step is to see whether an alteration in their amount <lb/>
            will be of service. If neither alteration of the order or of <lb/>
            the amount is of use, he cuts off some and reduces others. <lb/>
            If even this does not answer, he forbids food, and dis­ <lb/>
            burdens the body by fasting. If milder remedies have <lb/>
            proved useless he opens a vein; if the extremities are <lb/>
            injuring the body and infecting it with disease he lays his <lb/>
            hands upon the limbs; yet none of his treatment is con­ <lb/>
            sidered harsh if its result is to give health. Similarly, it <lb/>
            is the duty of the chief administrator of the laws, or the <lb/>
            ruler of a state, to correct ill-disposed men, as long as he <lb/>
            is able, with words, and even with gentle ones, that he may <lb/>
            persuade them to do what they ought, inspire them with a <lb/>
            love of honour and justice, and cause them to hate vice <lb/>
            and set store upon virtue. He must then pass on to severer <lb/>
            language, still confining himself to advising and reprimand­ <lb/>
            ing ; last of all he must betake himself to punishments, <lb/>
            yet still making them slight and temporary. He ought to <lb/>
            assign extreme punishments only to extreme crimes, that <lb/>
            no one may die unless it be even to the criminal's own <lb/>
            advantage that he should die. He will differ from the <lb/>
            physician in one point alone; for whereas physicians render <lb/>
            it easy to die for those to whom they cannot grant the boon <lb/>
            of life, he will drive the condemned out of life with ig­ <lb/>
            nominy and disgrace, not because he takes pleasure in any <lb/>
            man's being punished, for the wise man is far from such <lb/>
            inhuman ferocity, but that they may be a warning to all <lb/>
            men, and that, since they would not be useful when alive, <lb/>
            the state may at any rate profit by their death. Man's <lb/>
            nature is not, therefore, desirous of inflicting punishment; <lb/>
            neither, therefore, is anger in accordance with man's nature, <lb/>
            because that is desirous of inflicting punishment. I will also <lb/>
            adduce Plato's argument-for what harm is there in using <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            other men's arguments, so far as they are on our side ? <lb/>
            " A good man," says he, " does not do any hurt: it is only <lb/>
            punishment which hurts. Punishment, therefore, does not <lb/>
            accord with a good man: wherefore anger does not do so <lb/>
            either, because punishment and anger accord one with <lb/>
            another. If a good man takes no pleasure in punishment, <lb/>
            he will also take no pleasure in that state of mind to which <lb/>
            punishment gives pleasure: consequently anger is not <lb/>
            natural to man."</p>
          <p>VII. May it not be that, although anger be not natural, <lb/>
            it may be right to adopt it, because it often proves useful ? <lb/>
            It rouses the spirit and excites it; and courage does nothing <lb/>
            grand in war without it, unless its flame be supplied from <lb/>
            this source; this is the goad which stirs up bold men and <lb/>
            sends them to encounter perils. Some therefore consider it <lb/>
            to be best to control anger, not to banish it utterly, but to <lb/>
            cut off its extravagances, and force it to keep within useful <lb/>
            bounds, so as to retain that part of it without which action <lb/>
            will become languid and all strength and activity of mind <lb/>
            will die away.</p>
          <p>In the first place, it is easier to banish dangerous passions <lb/>
            than to rule them; it is easier not to admit them than to <lb/>
            keep them in order when admitted ; for when they have <lb/>
            established themselves in possession of the mind they are <lb/>
            more powerful than the lawful ruler, and will in no wise <lb/>
            permit themselves to be weakened or abridged. In the next <lb/>
            place, Reason herself, who holds the reins, is only strong <lb/>
            while she remains apart from the passions; if she mixes <lb/>
            and befouls herself with them she becomes no longer able <lb/>
            to restrain those whom she might once have cleared out of <lb/>
            her path; for the mind, when once excited and shaken up, <lb/>
            goes whither the passions drive it. There are certain things <lb/>
            whose beginnings lie in our own power, but which, when <lb/>
            developed, drag us along by their own force and leave us <lb/>
            no retreat. Those who have flung themselves over a preci- <pb n="57"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII. ] </note> <lb/>
            pice have no control over their movements, nor can they <lb/>
            stop or slacken their pace when once started, for their own <lb/>
            headlong and irremediable rashness has left no room for <lb/>
            either reflexion or remorse, and they cannot help going <lb/>
            to lengths which they might have avoided. So, also, the <lb/>
            mind, when it has abandoned itself to anger, love, or any <lb/>
            other passion, is unable to check itself : its own weight and <lb/>
            the downward tendency of vices must needs carry the man <lb/>
            off and hurl him into the lowest depth.</p>
          <p>VIII. The best plan is to reject straightway the first in­ <lb/>
            centives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take <lb/>
            care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to <lb/>
            carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy <lb/>
            condition, because reason goes for nothing when once pas­ <lb/>
            sion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own <lb/>
            free will been given a certain authority, it will for the future <lb/>
            do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. <lb/>
            The enemy, I repeat, must be met and driven back at the <lb/>
            outermost frontier-line : for when he has once entered the <lb/>
            city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set <lb/>
            bounds to his victory. The mind does not stand apart and <lb/>
            view its passions from without, so as not to permit them to <lb/>
            advance further than they ought, but it is itself changed <lb/>
            into a passion, and is therefore unable to check what once <lb/>
            was useful and wholesome strength, now that it has become <lb/>
            degenerate and misapplied: for passion and reason, as I <lb/>
            said before, have not distinct and separate provinces, but <lb/>
            consist of the changes of the mind itself for better or for <lb/>
            worse. How then can reason recover itself when it is <lb/>
            conquered and held down by vices, when it has given way <lb/>
            to anger ? or how can it extricate itself from a confused <lb/>
            mixture, the greater part of which consists of the lower <lb/>
            qualities ? " But," argues our adversary, 11 some men when <lb/>
            in anger control themselves." Do they so far control them­ <lb/>
            selves that they do nothing which anger dictates, or some- <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            what ? If they do nothing thereof, it becomes evident that <lb/>
            anger is not essential to the conduct of affairs, although <lb/>
            your sect advocated it as possessing greater strength than <lb/>
            reason ..... Finally, I ask, is anger stronger or weaker <lb/>
            than reason ? If stronger, how can reason impose any <lb/>
            check upon it, since it is only the less powerful that obey : <lb/>
            if weaker, then reason is competent to effect its ends <lb/>
            without anger, and does not need the help of a less power­ <lb/>
            ful quality. " But some angry men remain consistent and <lb/>
            control themselves." When do they do so ? It is when <lb/>
            their anger is disappearing and leaving them of its own <lb/>
            accord, not when it was red-hot, for then it was more <lb/>
            powerful than they. " What then? do not men, even in the <lb/>
            height of their anger, sometimes let their enemies go whole <lb/>
            and unhurt, and refrain from injuring them p " They do : <lb/>
            but when do they do so ? It is when one passion over­ <lb/>
            powers another, and either fear or greed gets the upper <lb/>
            hand for a while. On such occasions, it is not thanks to <lb/>
            reason that anger is stilled, but owing to an untrustworthy <lb/>
            and fleeting truce between the passions.</p>
          <p>IX. In the next place, anger has nothing useful in itself, <lb/>
            and does not rouse up the mind to warlike deeds : for a <lb/>
            virtue, being self-sufficient, never needs the assistance of a. <lb/>
            vice: whenever it needs an impetuous effort, it does not <lb/>
            become angry, but rises to the occasion, and excites or soothes <lb/>
            itself as far as it deems requisite, just as the machines which <lb/>
            hurl darts may be twisted to a greater or lesser degree of <lb/>
            tension at the manager's pleasure. "Anger," says Aris­ <lb/>
            totle, " is necessary, nor can any fight be won without it, <lb/>
            unless it fills the mind, and kindles up the spirit. It must, <lb/>
            however, be made use of, not as a general, but as a soldier." <lb/>
            Now this is untrue; for if it listens to reason and follows <lb/>
            whither reason leads, it is no longer anger, whose charac­ <lb/>
            teristic is obstinacy: if, again, it. is disobedient and will <lb/>
            not be quiet when ordered, but is carried away by its own <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="margin"> X.] </note> <lb/>
            wilful and headstrong spirit, it is then as useless an aid to <lb/>
            the mind as a soldier who disregards the sounding of the <lb/>
            retreat would be to a general. If, therefore, anger allows <lb/>
            limits to be imposed upon it, it must be called by some other <lb/>
            name, and ceases to be anger, which I understand to be un­ <lb/>
            bridled and unmanageable : and if it does not allow limits <lb/>
            to be imposed upon it, it is harmful and not to be counted <lb/>
            among aids: wherefore either anger is not anger, or it is <lb/>
            useless : for if any man demands the infliction of punish­ <lb/>
            ment, not because he is eager for the punishment itself, but <lb/>
            because it is right to inflict it, he ought not to be counted <lb/>
            as an angry man : that will be the useful soldier, who <lb/>
            knows how to obey orders : the passions cannot obey any <lb/>
            more than they can command.</p>
          <p>X. For this cause reason will never call to its aid blind <lb/>
            and fierce impulses, over whom she herself possesses no <lb/>
            authority, and which she never can restrain save by setting <lb/>
            against them similar and equally powerful passions, as for <lb/>
            example, fear against anger, anger against sloth, greed <lb/>
            against timidity. May virtue never come to such a pass, that <lb/>
            reason should fly for aid to vices ! The mind can find no <lb/>
            safe repose there, it must needs be shaken and tempest- <lb/>
            tossed if it be safe only because of its own defects, if it can­ <lb/>
            not be brave without anger, diligent without greed, quiet <lb/>
            without fear : such is the despotism under which a man <lb/>
            must live if he becomes the slave of a passion. Are you <lb/>
            not ashamed to put virtues under the patronage of vices ? <lb/>
            Then, too, reason ceases to have any power if she can do <lb/>
            nothing without passion, and begins to be equal and like <lb/>
            unto passion; for what difference is there between them if <lb/>
            passion without reason be as rash as reason without passion <lb/>
            is helpless ? They are both on the same level, if one cannot <lb/>
            exist without the other. Yet who could endure that pas­ <lb/>
            sion should be made equal to reason ? " Then," says our <lb/>
            adversary, " passion is useful, provided it be moderate." <pb n="60"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            Nay, only if it be useful by nature : but if it be disobedient <lb/>
            -to authority and reason, all that we gain by its moderation is <lb/>
            that the less there is of it, the less harm it does : wherefore <lb/>
            -a moderate passion is nothing but a moderate evil.</p>
          <p>XI. " But," argues he, " against our enemies anger is <lb/>
            necessary." In no case is it less necessary; since our attacks <lb/>
            ought not to be disorderly, but regulated and under con­ <lb/>
            trol. What, indeed, is it except anger, so ruinous to itself, <lb/>
            that overthrows barbarians, who have so much more <lb/>
            bodily strength than we, and are so much better able to <lb/>
            -endure fatigue ? Gladiators, too, protect themselves by <lb/>
            skill, but expose themselves to wounds when they are <lb/>
            angry. Moreover, of what use is anger, when the same <lb/>
            end can be arrived at by reason ? Do you suppose that <lb/>
            a hunter is angry with the beasts he kills ? Yet he meets <lb/>
            them when they attack him, and follows them when they <lb/>
            flee from him, all of which is managed by reason without <lb/>
            anger. When so many thousands of Cimbri and Teutones <lb/>
            poured over the Alps, what was it that caused them to <lb/>
            perish so completely, that no messenger, only common <lb/>
            rumour, carried the news of that great defeat to their <lb/>
            homes, except that with them anger stood in the place <lb/>
            of courage ? and anger, although sometimes it overthrows <lb/>
            and breaks to pieces whatever it meets, yet is more often <lb/>
            its own destruction. Who can be braver than the Germans ? <lb/>
            who charge more boldly ? who have more love of arms, <lb/>
            among which they are born and bred, for which alone <lb/>
            they care, to the neglect of everything else ? Who can be <lb/>
            more hardened to undergo every hardship, since a large part <lb/>
            of them have no store of clothing for the body, no shelter <lb/>
            from the continual rigour of the climate : yet Spaniards <lb/>
            and Gauls, and even the unwarlike races of Asia and <lb/>
            Syria cut them down before the main legion comes <lb/>
            within sight, nothing but their own irascibility expos. <lb/>
            ing them to death. Give but intelligence to those <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            minds, and discipline to those bodies of theirs, which <lb/>
            now are ignorant of vicious refinements, luxury, and <lb/>
            wealth,-to say nothing more, we should certainly be. <lb/>
            obliged to go back to the ancient Roman habits of life. <lb/>
            By what did Fabius restore the shattered forces of the. <lb/>
            state, except by knowing how to delay and spin out time,. <lb/>
            which angry men know not how to do ? The empire, which <lb/>
            then was at its last gasp, would have perished if Fabius <lb/>
            had been as daring as anger urged him to be : but he took <lb/>
            thought about the condition of affairs, and after counting­ <lb/>
            his force, no part of which could be lost without everything <lb/>
            being lost with it, he laid aside thoughts of grief and re­ <lb/>
            venge, turning his sole attention to what was profitable. <lb/>
            and to making the most of his opportunities, and conquered <lb/>
            his anger before he conquered Hannibal. What did Scipio <lb/>
            do ? Did he not leave behind Hannibal and the Car­ <lb/>
            thaginian army, and all with whom he had a right to be­ <lb/>
            angry, and carry over the war into Africa with such de­ <lb/>
            liberation that he made his enemies think him luxurious <lb/>
            and lazy ? What did the second Scipio do ? Did he not, <lb/>
            remain a long, long time before Numantia, and bear with <lb/>
            calmness the reproach to himself and to his country that <lb/>
            Numantia took longer to conquer than Carthage ? By­ <lb/>
            blockading and investing his enemies, he brought them to. <lb/>
            such straits that they perished by their own swords. <lb/>
            Anger, therefore, is not useful even in wars or battles: for­ <lb/>
            it is prone to rashness, and while trying to bring others <lb/>
            into danger, does not guard itself against danger. The most <lb/>
            trustworthy virtue is that which long and carefully considers, <lb/>
            itself, controls itself, and slowly and deliberately brings <lb/>
            itself to the front.</p>
          <p>XII. " What, then," asks our adversary, " is a good man <lb/>
            not to be angry if he sees his father murdered or his. <lb/>
            mother outraged ? " No, he will not be angry, but will <lb/>
            avenge them, or protect them. Why do you fear that, <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            filial piety will not prove a sufficient spur to him even <lb/>
            without anger You may as well say-" What then? <lb/>
            When a good man sees his father or his son being cut <lb/>
            down, I suppose he will not weep or faint," as we see women <lb/>
            do whenever any trifling rumour of danger reaches them. <lb/>
            The good man will do his duty without disturbance or <lb/>
            fear, and be will perform the duty of a good man, so <lb/>
            as to do nothing unworthy of a man. My father will <lb/>
            be murdered: then I will defend him: he has been slain, <lb/>
            then I will avenge him, not because I am grieved, but <lb/>
            because it is my duty. " Good men are made angry <lb/>
            by injuries done to their friends." When you say this, <lb/>
            Theophrastus, you seek to throw discredit upon more <lb/>
            manly maxims; you leave the judge and appeal to the <lb/>
            mob : because every one is angry when such things befall <lb/>
            his own friends, you suppose that men will decide that it is <lb/>
            their duty to do what they do : for as a rule every man con­ <lb/>
            siders a passion which he recognises to be a righteous one. <lb/>
            But he does the same thing if the hot water is not ready <lb/>
            for his drink, if a glass be broken, or his shoe splashed <lb/>
            with mud. It is not filial piety, but weakness of mind that <lb/>
            produces this anger, as children weep when they lose their <lb/>
            parents, just as they do when they lose their toys. To feel <lb/>
            anger on behalf of one's friends does not show a loving, <lb/>
            but a weak mind: it is admirable and worthy conduct to <lb/>
            stand forth as the defender of one's parents, children, <lb/>
            friends, and countrymen, at the call of duty itself, acting <lb/>
            of one's own free will, forming a deliberate judgment, and <lb/>
            looking forward to the future, not in an impulsive, frenzied <lb/>
            fashion. No passion is more eager for revenge than anger, <lb/>
            and for that very reason it is unapt to obtain it: being <lb/>
            over hasty and frantic, like almost all desires, it hinders <lb/>
            itself in the attainment of its own object, and therefore <lb/>
            has never been useful either in peace or war: for it makes <lb/>
            peace like war, and when in arms forgets that Mars belongs <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII. ] </note> <lb/>
            to neither side, and falls into the power of the enemy, <lb/>
            because it is not in its own. In the next place, vices ought <lb/>
            not to be received into common use because on some occa­ <lb/>
            sions they have effected somewhat: for so also fevers are <lb/>
            good for certain kinds of ill-health, but nevertheless it is <lb/>
            better to be altogether free from them: it is a hateful <lb/>
            mode of cure to owe one's health to disease. Similarly, <lb/>
            although anger, like poison, or falling headlong, or being <lb/>
            shipwrecked, may have unexpectedly done good, yet it <lb/>
            ought not on that account to be classed as wholesome, for <lb/>
            poisons have often proved good for the health.</p>
          <p>XIII. Moreover, qualities which we ought to possess <lb/>
            become better and more desirable the more extensive they <lb/>
            are: if justice is a good thing, no one will say that it <lb/>
            would be better if any part were subtracted from it; if <lb/>
            bravery is a good thing, no one would wish it to be in any <lb/>
            way curtailed: consequently the greater anger is, the <lb/>
            better it is, for who ever objected to a good thing being <lb/>
            increased ? But it is not expedient that anger should be <lb/>
            increased: therefore it is not expedient that it should exist <lb/>
            at all, for that which grows bad by increase cannot be a <lb/>
            good thing. "Anger is useful," says our adversary, " because <lb/>
            it makes men more ready to fight." According to that <lb/>
            mode of reasoning, then, drunkenness also is a good thing, <lb/>
            for it makes men insolent and daring, and many use their <lb/>
            weapons better when the worse for liquor: nay, according <lb/>
            to that reasoning, also, you may call frenzy and madness <lb/>
            essential to strength, because madness often makes men <lb/>
            stronger. Why, does not fear often by the rule of contraries <lb/>
            make men bolder, and does not the terror of death rouse <lb/>
            up even arrant cowards to join battle ? Yet anger, drunken­ <lb/>
            ness, fear, and the like, are base and temporary incite­ <lb/>
            ments to action, and can furnish no arms to virtue, which <lb/>
            has no need of vices, although they may at times be of <lb/>
            some little assistance to sluggish and cowardly minds. <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            No man becomes braver through anger, except one who <lb/>
            without anger would not have been brave at all: anger <lb/>
            does not therefore come to assist courage, but to take its <lb/>
            place. What are we to say to the argument that, if anger <lb/>
            were a good thing It would attach itself to all the best <lb/>
            men ? Yet the most irascible of creatures are infants, old <lb/>
            men, and sick people. Every weakling is naturally prone <lb/>
            to complaint.</p>
          <p>XIV. It is impossible, says Theophrastus, for a good <lb/>
            man not to be angry with bad men. By this reasoning, <lb/>
            the better a man is, the more irascible he will be : yet will <lb/>
            he not rather be more tranquil, more free from passions, <lb/>
            and hating no one : indeed, what reason has he for hating <lb/>
            sinners, since it is error that leads them into such crimes ? <lb/>
            now it does not become a sensible man to hate the erring, <lb/>
            since if so he will hate himself: let him think how many <lb/>
            things he does contrary to good morals, how much of <lb/>
            what he has done stands in need of pardon, and he will <lb/>
            soon become angry with himself also, for no righteous <lb/>
            judge pronounces a different judgment in his own case and <lb/>
            in that of others. No one, I affirm, will be found who can <lb/>
            acquit himself. Every one when he calls himself innocent <lb/>
            looks rather to external witnesses than to his own con­ <lb/>
            science. How much more philanthropic it is to deal with <lb/>
            the erring in a gentle and fatherly spirit, and to call them <lb/>
            into the right course instead of hunting them down ? When <lb/>
            a man is wandering about our fields because he has lost his <lb/>
            way, it is better to place him on the right path than to <lb/>
            drive him away.</p>
          <p>XV. The sinner ought, therefore, to be corrected both <lb/>
            by warning and by force, both by gentle and harsh means, <lb/>
            and may be made a better man both towards himself and <lb/>
            others by chastisement, but not by anger: for who is angry <lb/>
            with the patient whose wounds he is tending ? " But they <lb/>
            cannot be corrected, and there is nothing in them that is <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVI. ] </note> <lb/>
            gentle or that admits of good hope." Then let them be <lb/>
            removed from mortal society, if they are likely to deprave <lb/>
            every one with whom they come in contact, and let them <lb/>
            cease to be bad men in the only way in which they can: <lb/>
            yet let this be done without hatred: for what reason have <lb/>
            I for hating the man to whom I am doing the greatest <lb/>
            good, since I am rescuing him from himself ? Does a <lb/>
            man hate his own limbs when he cuts them off ? That is <lb/>
            not an act of anger, but a lamentable method of healing. <lb/>
            We knock mad dogs on the head, we slaughter fierce and <lb/>
            savage bulls, and we doom scabby sheep to the knife, lest <lb/>
            they should infect our flocks : we destroy monstrous births, <lb/>
            and we also drown our children if they are born weakly or <lb/>
            unnaturally formed; to separate what is useless from what <lb/>
            is sound is an act, not of anger, but of reason. Nothing <lb/>
            becomes one who inflicts punishment less than anger, <lb/>
            because the punishment has all the more power to work <lb/>
            reformation if the sentence be pronounced with deliberate <lb/>
            judgment. This is why Socrates said to the slave, "I <lb/>
            would strike you, were I not angry." He put off the cor­ <lb/>
            rection of the slave to a calmer season; at the moment, he <lb/>
            corrected himself. Who can boast that he has his passions <lb/>
            under control, when Socrates did not dare to trust himself <lb/>
            to his anger ?</p>
          <p>XVI. We do not, therefore, need an angry chastiser <lb/>
            to punish the' erring and wicked: for since anger is a <lb/>
            crime of the mind, it is not right that sins should be <lb/>
            punished by sin. " What! am I not to be angry with a <lb/>
            robber, or a poisoner?" No: for I am not angry with <lb/>
            myself when I bleed myself. I apply all kinds of punish­ <lb/>
            ment as remedies. You are as yet only in the first stage of <lb/>
            error, and do not go wrong seriously, although you do so <lb/>
            often : then I will try to amend you by a reprimand given <lb/>
            first in private and then in public.l You, again, have gone <note type="footnote"> 1 The gospel rule, Matt. xviii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>

            too far to be restored to virtue by words alone ; you must <lb/>
            be kept in order by disgrace. For the next, some stronger <lb/>
            measure is required, something that he can feel must be <lb/>
            branded upon him ; you, sir, shall be sent into exile and to <lb/>
            a desert place. The next man's thorough villany needs <lb/>
            harsher remedies: chains and public imprisonment must <lb/>
            be applied to him. You, lastly, have an incurably vicious <lb/>
            mind, and add crime to crime: you have come to such a <lb/>
            pass, that you are not influenced by the arguments which <lb/>
            are never wanting to recommend evil, but sin itself is to <lb/>
            you a sufficient reason for sinning: you have so steeped <lb/>
            your whole heart in wickedness, that wickedness cannot <lb/>
            be taken from you without bringing your heart with it. <lb/>
            Wretched man ! you have long sought to die; we will do <lb/>
            you good service, we will take away that madness from <lb/>
            which you suffer, and to you who have so long lived a misery <lb/>
            to yourself and to others, we will give the only good thing <lb/>
            which remains, that is, death. Why should I be angry with <lb/>
            a man just when I am doing him good : sometimes the truest <lb/>
            form of compassion is to put a man to death. If I were a <lb/>
            skilled and learned physician, and were to enter a hospital, <lb/>
            or a rich1 man's house, I should not have prescribed the <lb/>
            same treatment for all the patients who were suffering <lb/>
            from various diseases. I see different kinds of vice in <lb/>
            the vast number of different minds, and am called in to <lb/>
            heal the whole body of citizens : let us seek for the re­ <lb/>
            medies proper for each disease. This man may be cured <lb/>
            by his own sense of honour, that one by travel, that one <lb/>
            by pain, that one by want, that one by the sword. If, <lb/>
            therefore, it becomes my duty as a magistrate to put on <lb/>
            black2 robes, and summon an assembly by the sound of a <note type="footnote"> 1 Divitis (where there might be an army of slaves). </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Lorsque le Preteur devoit prononeer la sentence d'un coupable, il <lb/>

            sternly, yet not angrily. Even when I command a criminal <lb/>
            to be beheaded,, when I sew a parricide up in a sack, when <lb/>
            I send a man to be punished by military law, when I fling <lb/>

            be free from anger, aDd shall look and feel just as though <lb/>
            I were crushing snakes and other venomous creatures. <lb/>
            " Anger is necessary to enable us to punish." What ? do <lb/>
            you think that the law is angry with men whom it does not <lb/>
            know, whom it has never seen, who it hopes will never <lb/>
            exist ? We ought, therefore, to adopt the law's frame of <lb/>
            mind, which does not become angry, but merely defines <lb/>
            offences : for, if it is right for a good man to be angry at <lb/>
            wicked crimes; it will also be right for him to be moved <lb/>
            with envy at the prosperity of wicked men : what, indeed, <lb/>
            is more scandalous than that in some cases the very men, <lb/>
            for whose deserts no fortune could be found bad enough, <lb/>
            should flourish and actually be the spoiled children of suc­ <lb/>
            cess ? Yet he will see their affluence without envy, just as <lb/>
            he sees their crimes without anger: a good judge condemns <lb/>
            wrongful acts, but does not hate them. " What then ? <lb/>
            when the wise man is dealing with something of this kind, <lb/>
            will his mind not be affected by it and become excited be­ <lb/>
            yond its usual wont ? " I admit that it will: he will <lb/>
            experience a slight and trifling emotion ; for, as Zeno says, <lb/>
            " Even in the mind of the wise man, a scar remains after <lb/>
            the wound is quite healed." He will, therefore, feel certain <lb/>
            hints and semblances of passions; but he will be free from <lb/>
            the passions themselves.</p>
          <p>XVII. Aristotle says that" certain passions, if one makes <lb/>
            a proper use of them, act as arms " : which would be true <lb/>
            if, like weapons of war, they could be taken up or laid <lb/>
            aside at the pleasure of their wielder. These arms, which <lb/>
            Aristotle assigns to virtue, fight of their own accord, <lb/>
            do not wait to be seized by the hand, and possess a man <lb/>
            instead of being possessed by him. We have no need of <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            external weapons, nature has equipped us sufficiently <lb/>
            by giving us reason. She has bestowed this weapon upon <lb/>
            us, which is strong, imperishable, and obedient to our will, <lb/>
            not uncertain or capable of being turned against its master. <lb/>
            Reason suffices by itself not merely to take thought for the <lb/>
            future, but to manage our affairs :1 what, then, can be more <lb/>
            foolish than for reason to beg anger for protection, that is, <lb/>
            for what is certain to beg of what is uncertain ? what is <lb/>
            trustworthy of what is faithless ? what is whole of what is <lb/>
            sick ? What, indeed ? since reason is far more powerful <lb/>
            by itself even in performing those operations in which the <lb/>
            help of anger seems especially needful: for when reason <lb/>
            has decided that a particular thing should be done, she <lb/>
            perseveres in doing it; not being able to find anything <lb/>
            better than herself to exchange with. She, therefore, <lb/>
            abides by her purpose when it has once been formed; <lb/>
            whereas anger is often overcome by pity : for it possesses <lb/>
            no firm strength, but merely swells like an empty bladder, <lb/>
            and makes a violent beginning, just like the winds which <lb/>
            rise from the earth and are caused by rivers and marshes, <lb/>
            which blow furiously without any continuance: anger <lb/>
            begins with a mighty rush, and then falls away, becoming <lb/>
            fatigued too soon: that which but lately thought of nothing <lb/>
            but cruelty and novel forms of torture, is become quite <lb/>
            softened and gentle when the time comes for punishment <lb/>
            to be inflicted. Passion soon cools, whereas reason is <lb/>
            always consistent: yet even in cases where anger has con­ <lb/>
            tinued to burn, it often happens that although there may <lb/>
            be many who deserve to die, yet after the death of two or <lb/>
            three it ceases to slay. Its first onset is fierce, just as the <lb/>
            teeth of snakes when first roused from their lair are <lb/>
            venomous, but become harmless after repeated bites have <lb/>
            exhausted their poison. Consequently those who are <note type="footnote"> 1 I. e. not only for counsel but for action. </note> <pb n="70"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            equally guilty are not equally punished, and often he who <lb/>
            has done less is punished more, because he fell in the way <lb/>
            of anger when it was fresher. It is altogether irregular; <lb/>
            at one time it runs into undue excess, at another it falls <lb/>
            short of its duty : for it indulges its own feelings and gives <lb/>
            sentence according to its caprices, will not listen to evidence, <lb/>
            allows the defence no opportunity of being heard, clings to <lb/>
            what it has wrongly assumed, and will not suffer its opinion <lb/>
            to be wrested from it, even when it is a mistaken one.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Reason gives each side time to plead; moreover, <lb/>
            she herself demands adjournment, that she may have sum­ <lb/>
            cient scope for the discovery of the truth; whereas anger <lb/>
            is in a hurry: reason wishes to give a just decision ; anger <lb/>
            wishes its decision to be thought just: reason looks no <lb/>
            further than the matter in hand; anger is excited by <lb/>
            empty matters hovering on the outskirts of the case : it is <lb/>
            irritated by anything approaching to a confident demeanour, <lb/>
            a loud voice, an unrestrained speech, dainty apparel, high­ <lb/>
            flown pleading, or popularity with the public. It often <lb/>
            condemns a man because it dislikes his patron; it loves and <lb/>
            maintains error even when truth is staring it in the face. <lb/>
            It hates to be proved wrong, and thinks it more honour­ <lb/>
            able to persevere in a mistaken line of conduct than to <lb/>
            retract it. I remember Gnaeus Piso, a man who was free <lb/>
            from many vices, yet of a perverse disposition, and one <lb/>
            who mistook harshness for consistency. In his anger he <lb/>
            ordered a soldier to be led off to execution because he had <lb/>
            returned from furlough without his comrade, as though <lb/>
            he must have murdered him if he could not show him. <lb/>
            When the man asked for time for search, he would not <lb/>
            grant it: the condemned man was brought outside the <lb/>
            rampart, and was just offering his neck to the axe, when <lb/>
            suddenly there appeared his comrade who was thought to be <lb/>
            slain. Hereupon the centurion in charge of the execution <lb/>
            bade the guardsman sheathe his sword, and led the condemned <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            man back to Piso, to restore to him the innocence which <lb/>
            Fortune had restored to the soldier. They were led into his <lb/>
            presence by their fellow soldiers amid the great joy of the <lb/>
            whole camp, embracing one another and accompanied by a <lb/>
            vast crowd. Piso mounted the tribunal in a fury and ordered <lb/>
            them both to be executed, both him who had not murdered <lb/>
            and him who had not been slain. What could be more un­ <lb/>
            worthy than this ? Because one was proved to be innocent, <lb/>
            two perished. Piso even added a third: for he actually <lb/>
            ordered the centurion, who had brought back the con­ <lb/>
            demned man, to be put to death. Three men were set up <lb/>
            to die in the same place because one was innocent. 0, how <lb/>
            clever is anger at inventing reasons for its frenzy! "You," <lb/>
            it says, " I order to be executed, because you have been con­ <lb/>
            demned to death : you, because you have been the cause of <lb/>
            your comrade's condemnation, and you, because when ordered <lb/>
            to put him to, death you disobeyed your general." He dis­ <lb/>
            covered the means of charging them with three crimes, <lb/>
            because he could find no crime in them.</p>
          <p>XIX. Irascibility, I say, has this fault-it is loth to be <lb/>
            ruled : it is angry with the truth itself, if it comes to light <lb/>
            against its will: it assails those whom it has marked for its <lb/>
            victims with shouting and riotous noise and gesticulation of <lb/>
            the entire body, together with reproaches and curses. Not <lb/>
            thus does reason act: but if it must be so, she silently and <lb/>
            quietly wipes out whole households, destroys entire families <lb/>
            of the enemies of the state, together with their wives and <lb/>
            children, throws down'their very dwellings, levels them with <lb/>
            the ground, and roots out the names of those who are the <lb/>
            foes of liberty. This she does without grinding her teeth or <lb/>
            shaking her head, or doing anything unbecoming to a judge, <lb/>
            whose countenance ought to be especially calm and composed <lb/>
            at the time when he is pronouncing an important sentence. <lb/>
            "What need is there," asks Hieronymus, " for you to bite <lb/>
            your own lips when you want to strike some one ? " What <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            would he have said, had he seen a proconsul leap down <lb/>
            from the tribunal, snatch the fasces from the lictor, and <lb/>
            tear his own clothes because those of others were not torn <lb/>
            as fast as he wished. Why need you upset the table, <lb/>
            throw down the drinking cups, knock yourself against the <lb/>
            columns, tear your hair, smite your thigh and your breast ? <lb/>
            How vehement do you suppose anger to be, if it thus turns <lb/>
            back upon itself, because it cannot find vent on another as <lb/>
            fast as it wishes? Such men, therefore, are held back by the <lb/>
            bystanders and are begged to become reconciled with them­ <lb/>
            selves. But he who while freefrom anger assigns to each man <lb/>
            the penalty which he deserves, does none of these things. <lb/>
            He often lets a man go after detecting his crime, if his peni­ <lb/>
            tence for what he has done gives good hope for the future, <lb/>
            if he perceives that the man's wickedness is not deeply <lb/>
            rooted in his mind, but is only, as the saying is, skin­ <lb/>
            deep. He will grant impunity in cases where it will hurt <lb/>
            neither the receiver nor the giver. In some cases he <lb/>
            will punish great crimes more leniently than lesser ones, <lb/>
            if the former were the result of momentary impulse, not of <lb/>
            cruelty, while the latter were instinct with secret, under­ <lb/>
            hand, long-practised craftiness. The same fault, committed <lb/>
            by two separate men, will not be visited by him with the <lb/>
            same penalty, if the one was guilty of it through careless­ <lb/>
            ness, the other with a premeditated intention of doing mis­ <lb/>
            chief. In all dealing with crime he will remember that <lb/>
            the one form of punishment is meant to make bad men <lb/>
            better, and the other to put them out of the way. In either <lb/>
            case he will look to the future, not to the past: for, as <lb/>
            Plato says, " no wise man punishes any one because he has <lb/>
            sinned, but that he may sin no more : for what is past <lb/>
            cannot be recalled, but what is to come may be checked." <lb/>
            Those, too, whom he wishes to make examples of the ill <lb/>
            success of wickedness, he executes publicly, not merely in <lb/>
            order that they themselves may die, but that by dying they <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            may deter others from doing likewise. You see how free <lb/>
            from any mental disturbance a man ought to be who has <lb/>
            to weigh and consider all this, when he deals with a matter <lb/>
            which ought to be handled with the utmost care, I mean, <lb/>
            the power of life and death. The sword of justice is ill­ <lb/>
            placed in the hands of an angry man.</p>
          <p>XX. Neither ought it to be believed that anger con­ <lb/>
            tributes anything to magnanimity: what it gives is not <lb/>
            magnanimity but vain glory. The increase which disease <lb/>
            produces in bodies swollen with morbid humours is <lb/>
            not healthy growth, but bloated corpulence. All those <lb/>
            whose madness raises them above human considerations, <lb/>
            believe themselves to be inspired with high and sublime <lb/>
            ideas ; but there is no solid ground beneath, and what is <lb/>
            built without foundation is liable to collapse in ruin. <lb/>
            Anger has no ground to stand upon, and does not rise <lb/>
            from a firm and enduring foundation, but is a windy, empty <lb/>
            quality, as far removed from true magnanimity as fool­ <lb/>
            hardiness from courage, boastfulness from confidence, <lb/>
            gloom from austerity, cruelty from strictness. There is, I <lb/>
            say, a great difference between a lofty and a proud mind : <lb/>
            anger brings about nothing grand or beautiful. On the <lb/>
            other hand, to be constantly irritated seems to me to be <lb/>
            the part of a languid and unhappy mind, conscious of its <lb/>
            own feebleness, like folk with diseased bodies covered with <lb/>
            sores, who cry out at the lightest touch. Anger, therefore, <lb/>
            is a vice which for the most part affects women and <lb/>
            children. " Yet it affects men also." Because many men, <lb/>
            too, have womanish or childish intellects. " But what are we <lb/>
            to say? do not some words fall from angry men which appear <lb/>
            to flow from a great mind ? " Yes, to those who know not <lb/>
            what true greatness is : as, for example, that foul and <lb/>
            hateful saying, " Let, them hate me, provided they fear me," <lb/>
            which you may be sure was written in Sulla's time. I <lb/>
            know not which was the worse of the two things he wished <pb n="74"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. III. </note> <lb/>
            for, that he might be hated or that he might be feared. It <lb/>
            occurs to his mind that some day people will curse him, <lb/>
            plot against him, crush him : what prayer does he add to <lb/>
            this ? May all the gods curse him-for discovering a <lb/>
            cure for hate so worthy of it. " Let them hate." How ? <lb/>
            " Provided they obey me ? " No ! "Provided they ap­ <lb/>
            prove of me ? " No! How then ? "Provided they fear <lb/>
            me! " I would not even be loved upon such terms. Do <lb/>
            you imagine that this was a very spirited saying ? You <lb/>
            are wrong: this is not greatness, but monstrosity. You <lb/>
            should not believe the words of angry men, whose speech is <lb/>
            very loud and menacing, while their mind within them is <lb/>
            as timid as possible: nor need you suppose that the most <lb/>
            eloquent of men, Titus Livius, was right in describing <lb/>
            somebody as being " of a great rather than a good dispo­ <lb/>
            sition." The things cannot be separated : he must either <lb/>
            be good or else he cannot be great, because I take great­ <lb/>
            ness of mind to mean that it is unshaken, sound throughout, <lb/>
            firm and uniform to its very foundation; such as cannot <lb/>
            exist in evil dispositions. Such dispositions may be ter­ <lb/>
            rible, frantic, and destructive, but cannot possess greatness; <lb/>
            because greatness rests upon goodness, and owes its strength <lb/>
            to it. " Yet by speech, action, and all outward show they <lb/>
            will make one think them great." True, they will say <lb/>
            something which you may think shows a great spirit, like <lb/>
            Gaius Caesar, who when angry with heaven because it inter­ <lb/>
            fered with his ballet-dancers, whom he imitated more <lb/>
            carefully than he attended to them when they acted, and <lb/>
            because it frightened his revels by its thunders, surely <lb/>
            ill-directed,l challenged Jove to fight, and that to the death, <lb/>
            shouting the Homeric verse :­ <lb/>
            " Carry me off; or I will carry thee! " <note type="footnote"> 1 Prorsus parum certis (i.e., the thunderbolts missed their aim in not <lb/>
            striking him dead). </note> <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="margin"> CR. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            How great was his madness ! He must have believed <lb/>
            either that he could not be hurt even by Jupiter himself, or <lb/>
            that he could hurt even Jupiter itself. I imagine that this <lb/>
            saying of his had no small weight in nerving the minds of the <lb/>
            conspirators for their task : for it seemed to be the height. <lb/>
            of endurance to bear one who could not bear Jupiter.</p>
          <p>XXI. There is therefore nothing great or noble in anger,, <lb/>
            even when it seems to be powerful and to contemn both <lb/>
            gods and men alike. Any one who thinks that anger- <lb/>
            produces greatness of mind, would think that luxury <lb/>
            produces it: such a man wishes to rest on ivory, to be­ <lb/>
            clothed with purple, and roofed with gold; to remove- <lb/>
            lands, embank seas, hasten the course of rivers, suspend <lb/>
            woods in the air. He would think that avarice shows <lb/>
            greatness of mind: for the avaricious man broods over <lb/>
            heaps of gold and silver, treats whole provinces as merely <lb/>
            fields on his estate, and has larger tracts of country under <lb/>
            the charge of single bailiffs than those which consuls once <lb/>
            drew lots to administer. He would think that lust shows <lb/>
            greatness of mind: for the lustful man swims across: <lb/>
            straits, castrates troops of boys, and puts himself within <lb/>
            reach of the swords of injured husbands with complete scorn <lb/>
            of death. Ambition, too, he would think shows greatness. <lb/>
            of mind : for the ambitious man is not content with office <lb/>
            once a year, but, if possible, would fill the calendar of <lb/>
            dignities with his name alone, and cover the whole world <lb/>
            with his titles. It matters nothing to what heights or <lb/>
            lengths these passions may proceed : they are narrow, piti­ <lb/>
            able, grovelling. Virtue alone is lofty and sublime, nor is <lb/>
            anything great which is not at the same time tranquil.</p><pb n="76"/>

          </ab>
          <p>MY first book, Novatus, had a more abundant subject: <lb/>
            for carriages roll easily down hill :1 now we <lb/>
            must proceed to drier matters. The question before us <lb/>
            is whether anger arises from deliberate choice or from <lb/>
            impulse, that is, whether it acts of its own accord or like <lb/>
            the greater part of those passions which spring up within <lb/>
            us without our knowledge. It is necessary for our debate <lb/>
            to stoop to the consideration of these matters, in order that <lb/>
            it may afterwards be able to rise to loftier themes; for <lb/>
            likewise in our bodies the parts which are first set in order <lb/>
            are the bones, sinews, and joints, which are by no means <lb/>
            fair to see, albeit they are the foundation of onr frame and <lb/>
            essential to its life: next to them come the parts of which <lb/>
            all beauty of face and appearance consists; and after these, <lb/>
            colour, which above all else charms the eye, is applied last <lb/>
            of all, when the rest of the body is complete. There is no <lb/>
            doubt that anger is roused by the appearance of an injury <note type="footnote"> 1 " Vehiculorum ridicule Koch," says Gertz, justly, "vitiorum makes <lb/>
            excellent sense."—J. E. B. M. </note> <pb n="77"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            being done : but the question before us is, whether anger <lb/>
            straightway follows the appearance, and springs up without <lb/>
            assistance from the mind, or whether it is roused with the <lb/>
            sympathy of the mind. Our (the Stoics') opinion is, that anger <lb/>
            can venture upon nothing by itself, without the approval of <lb/>
            mind: for to conceive the idea of a wrong having been <lb/>
            done, to long to avenge it, and to join the two propositions, <lb/>
            that we ought not to have been injured and that it is our <lb/>
            duty to avenge our injuries, cannot belong to a mere im­ <lb/>
            pulse which is excited without our consent. That impulse <lb/>
            is a simple act; this is a complex one, and composed of <lb/>
            several parts. The man understands something to have <lb/>
            happened : he becomes indignant thereat: he condemns <lb/>
            the deed; and he avenges it. All these things cannot be <lb/>
            done without his mind agreeing to those matters which <lb/>
            touched him.</p>
          <p>II. Whither, say you, does this inquiry tend That <lb/>
            we may know what anger is : for if it springs up against <lb/>
            our will, it never will yield to reason : because all the <lb/>
            motions which take place without our volition are beyond <lb/>
            our control and unavoidable, such as shivering when cold <lb/>
            water is poured over us, or shrinking when we are touched <lb/>
            in certain places. Men's hair rises up at bad news, their <lb/>
            faces blush at indecent words, and they are seized with <lb/>
            dizziness when looking down a precipice; and as it is not <lb/>
            in our power to prevent any of these things, no reasoning <lb/>
            can prevent their taking place. But anger can be put to <lb/>
            flight by wise maxims ; for it is a voluntary defect of the <lb/>
            mind, and not one of those things which are evolved by <lb/>
            the conditions of human life, and which, therefore, may <lb/>
            happen even to the wisest of us. Among these and in the <lb/>
            first place must be ranked that thrill of the mind which <lb/>
            seizes us at the thought of wrongdoing. We feel this even <lb/>
            when witnessing the mimic scenes of the stage, or when <lb/>
            reading about things that happened long ago. We often <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            feel angry with Clod ills for banishing Cicero, and with <lb/>
            Antonius for murdering him. Who is not indignant with <lb/>
            the wars of Marius, the proscriptions of Sulla? who is not <lb/>
            enraged against Theodotus and Achillas and the boy king <lb/>
            who dared to commit a more than boyish crime ? 1 Some­ <lb/>
            times songs excite us, and quickened rhythm and the <lb/>
            martial noise of trumpets ; so, too, shocking pictures and <lb/>
            the dreadful sight of tortures, however well deserved, affect <lb/>
            our minds. Hence it is that we smile when others are <lb/>
            smiling, that a crowd of mourners makes us sad, and that <lb/>
            we take a glowing interest in another's battles ; all of <lb/>
            which feelings are not anger, any more than that which <lb/>
            clouds our brow at the sight of a stage shipwreck is sad­ <lb/>
            ness, or what we feel, when we read how Hannibal after <lb/>
            Cannae beset the walls of Rome, can be called fear. All <lb/>
            these are emotions of minds which are loth to be moved, <lb/>
            and are not passions, but rudiments which may grow into <lb/>
            passions. So, too, a soldier starts at the sound of a <lb/>
            trumpet, although he may be dressed as a civilian and in <lb/>
            the midst of a profound peace, and camp horses prick up <lb/>
            their ears at the clash of arms. It is said that Alexander, <lb/>
            when Xenophantus was singing, laid his hand upon his <lb/>
            weapons.</p>
          <p>III. None of these things which casually influence the <lb/>
            mind deserve to be called passions: the mind, if I may so <lb/>
            express it, rather suffers passions to act upon itself than <lb/>
            forms them. A passion, therefore, consists not in being <lb/>
            affected by the sights which are presented to us, but in <lb/>
            giving way to our feelings and following up these chance <lb/>
            promptings : for whoever imagines that paleness, bursting <lb/>
            into tears, lustful feelings, deep sighs, sudden flashes of <lb/>
            the eyes, and so forth, are signs of passion and betray the <note type="footnote"> 1 The murder of Pompeius, B.C. 48. Achillas and Theodotus acted <lb/>
            under the nominal orders of Ptolemy XII., Cleopatra's brother, then <lb/>
            about seventeen years of age. </note> <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            state of the mind, is mistaken, and does not understand that <lb/>
            these are merely impulses of the body. Consequently, the <lb/>
            bravest of men often turns pale while he is putting on his <lb/>
            armour; when the signal for battle is given, the knees of <lb/>
            the boldest soldier shake for a moment; the heart even of <lb/>
            a great general leaps into his mouth just before the lines <lb/>
            clash together, and the hands and feet even of the most <lb/>
            eloquent orator grow stiff and cold while he is preparing <lb/>
            to begin his speech. Anger must not merely move, but <lb/>
            break out of bounds, being an impulse: now, no impulse <lb/>
            can take place without the consent of the mind: for it <lb/>
            cannot be that we should deal with revenge and punish­ <lb/>
            ment without the mind being cognisant of them. A man <lb/>
            may think himself injured, may wish to avenge his wrongs, <lb/>
            and then may be persuaded by some reason or other to <lb/>
            give up his intention and calm down : I do not call that <lb/>
            anger, it is an emotion of the mind which is under the <lb/>
            control of reason. Anger is that which goes beyond <lb/>
            reason and carries her away with it: wherefore the first <lb/>
            confusion of a man's mind when struck by what seems an <lb/>
            injury is no more anger than the apparent injury itself : it <lb/>
            is the subsequent mad rush, which not only receives the <lb/>
            impression of the apparent injury, but acts upon it as true, <lb/>
            that is anger, being an exciting of the mind to revenge, <lb/>
            which proceeds from choice and deliberate resolve. There <lb/>
            never has been any doubt that fear produces flight, and <lb/>
            anger a rush forward; consider, therefore, whether you <lb/>
            suppose that anything can be either sought or avoided <lb/>
            without the participation of the mind.</p>
          <p>IV. Furthermore, that you may know in what manner <lb/>
            passions begin and swell and gain spirit, learn that the first <lb/>
            emotion is involuntary, and is, as it were, a preparation for <lb/>
            a passion, and a threatening of one. The next is combined <lb/>
            with a wish, though not an obstinate one, as, for example,</p>
          <p>It is my duty to avenge myself, because I have been in- <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            jared," or " It is right that this man should be punished, <lb/>
            because he has committed a crime." The third emotion is <lb/>
            already beyond our control, because it overrides reason, and <lb/>
            wishes to avenge itself, not if it be its duty, but whether <lb/>
            or no. We are not able by means of reason to escape from <lb/>
            that first impression on the mind, any more than we can <lb/>
            escape from those things which we have mentioned as oc­ <lb/>
            curring to the body: we cannot prevent other people's yawns <lb/>
            temping us to yawn :1 we cannot help winking when fingers <lb/>
            are suddenly darted at our eyes. Reason is unable to over­ <lb/>
            come these habits, which perhaps might be weakened by <lb/>
            practice and constant watchfulness: they differ from an <lb/>
            emotion which is brought into existence and brought to an <lb/>
            end by a deliberate mental act.</p>
          <p>V. We must also enquire whether those whose cruelty <lb/>
            knows no bounds, and who delight in shedding human <lb/>
            blood, are angry when they kill people from whom they <lb/>
            have received no injury, and who they themselves do not <lb/>
            think have done them any injury; such as were Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus or Phalaris. This is not anger, it is ferocity : for it <lb/>
            does not do hurt because it has received injury: but is <lb/>
            even willing to receive injury, provided it may do hurt. <lb/>
            It does not long to inflict stripes and mangle bodies to <lb/>
            avenge its wrongs, but for its own pleasure. What then <lb/>
            are we to say ? This evil takes its rise from anger ; for <lb/>
            anger, after it has by long use and indulgence made a man <lb/>
            forget mercy, and driven all feelings of human fellowship <lb/>
            from his mind, passes finally into cruelty. Such men <lb/>
            therefore laugh, rejoice, enjoy themselves greatly, and are­ <lb/>
            as unlike as possible in countenance to angry men, since- <lb/>
            cruelty is their relaxation. It is said that when Hannibal <lb/>
            saw a trench full of human blood, he exclaimed, " 0, what <note type="footnote"> 1 See " De Clem." ii. 6, 4,1 emended many years ago <foreign xml:lang="grc">ένὸς χανόντος <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            a beauteous sight! " How much more beautiful would he <lb/>
            have thought it, if it had filled a river or a lake ? Why <lb/>
            should we wonder that you should be charmed with this <lb/>
            sight above all others, you who were born in bloodshed and <lb/>
            brought up amid slaughter from a child ? Fortune will <lb/>
            follow you and favour your cruelty for twenty years, and <lb/>
            will display to you everywhere the sight that you love. <lb/>
            You will behold it both at Trasumene and at Cannæ, and <lb/>
            lastly at your own city of Carthage. Volesus, who not <lb/>
            long ago, under the Emperor Augustus, was proconsul of <lb/>
            Asia Minor, after he had one day beheaded three hundred <lb/>
            persons, strutted out among the corpses with a haughty <lb/>
            air, as though he had performed some grand and notable <lb/>
            exploit, and exclaimed in Greek, " What a kingly action ! " <lb/>
            What would this man have done, had he been really a. <lb/>
            king ? This was not anger, but a greater and an incurable <lb/>
            disease.</p>
          <p>VI. " Virtue," argues our adversary, " ought to be angry <lb/>
            with what is base, just as she approves of what is honour­ <lb/>
            able." What should we think if he said that virtue ought <lb/>
            to be both mean and great; yet this is what he means, <lb/>
            when he wants her to be raised and lowered, because joy at <lb/>
            a good action is grand and glorious, while anger at <lb/>
            another's sin is base and befits a narrow mind : and virtue <lb/>
            will never be guilty of imitating vice while she is repressing <lb/>
            it; she considers anger to deserve punishment for it­ <lb/>
            self, since it often is even more criminal than the faults <lb/>
            which which it is angry. To rejoice and be glad is the <lb/>
            proper and natural function of virtue : it is as much be­ <lb/>
            neath her dignity to be angry, as to mourn : now, sorrow is <lb/>
            the companion of anger, and all anger ends in sorrow, either <lb/>
            from remorse or from failure. Secondly, if it be the. part of <lb/>
            the wise man to be angry with sins, he will be more angry <lb/>
            the greater they are, and will often be angry: from which it <lb/>
            follows that the wise man will not only be angry but iras- <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK.IV. </note> <lb/>
            cible. Yet if we do not believe that great and frequent <lb/>
            anger can find any place in the wise man's mind, why <lb/>
            should we not set him altogether free from this passion ? <lb/>
            for there can be no limit, if he ought to be angry in pro­ <lb/>
            portion to what every man does: because he will either be <lb/>
            unjust if he is equally angry at unequal crimes, or he will <lb/>
            be the most irascible of men, if he blazes into wrath as <lb/>
            often as crimes deserve his anger.</p>
          <p>VII. What, too, can be more unworthy of the wise man, <lb/>
            than that his passions should depend upon the wickedness <lb/>
            of others ? If so, the great Socrates will no longer be able <lb/>
            to return home with the same expression of countenance <lb/>
            with which he set out. Moreover, if it be the duty of the <lb/>
            wise man to be angry at base deeds, and to be excited and <lb/>
            saddened at crimes, then is there nothing more unhappy <lb/>
            than the wise man, for all his life will be spent in anger <lb/>
            and grief. What moment will there be at which he will <lb/>
            not see something deserving of blame ? whenever he leaves <lb/>
            his house, he will be obliged to walk among men who are <lb/>
            criminals, misers, spendthrifts, profligates, and who are happy <lb/>
            in being so: he can turn his eyes in no direction without <lb/>
            their finding something to shock them. He will faint, if <lb/>
            he demands anger from himself as often as reason calls for <lb/>
            it. All these thousands who are hurrying to the law courts <lb/>
            at break of day, how base are their causes, and how much <lb/>
            baser their advocates P One impugns his father's will, <lb/>
            when he would have done better to deserve it; another <lb/>
            appears as the accuser of his mother ; a third comes to in­ <lb/>
            form against a man for committing the very crime of which <lb/>
            he himself is yet more notoriously guilty. The judge, too, <lb/>
            is chosen to condemn men for doing what he himself has <lb/>
            done, and the audience takes the wrong side, led astray by <lb/>
            the fine voice of the pleader.</p>
          <p>VIII. Why need I dwell upon individual cases ? Be <lb/>
            assured, when you see the Forum crowded with a multitude, <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            the Saepta1 swarming with people, or the great Circus, in <lb/>
            which the greater part of the people find room to show <lb/>
            themselves at once, that among them there are as many <lb/>
            vices as there are men. Among those whom you see in <lb/>
            the garb of peace there is no peace : for a small profit any <lb/>
            one of them will attempt the ruin of another: no one can <lb/>
            gain anything save by another's loss. They hate the for­ <lb/>
            tunate and despise the unfortunate: they grudgingly endure <lb/>
            the great, and oppress the small: they are fired by divers <lb/>
            lusts : they would wreck everything for the sake of a little. <lb/>
            pleasure or plunder : they live as though they were in a <lb/>
            school of gladiators, fighting with the same people with <lb/>
            whom they live: it is like a society of wild beasts, save <lb/>
            that beasts are tame with one another, and refrain from <lb/>
            biting their own species, whereas men tear one another, <lb/>
            and gorge themselves upon one another. They differ from <lb/>
            dumb animals in this alone, that the latter are tame with <lb/>
            those who feed them, whereas the rage of the former preys <lb/>
            on those very persons by whom they were brought up.</p>
          <p>IX. The wise man will never cease to be angry, if he <lb/>
            once begins, so full is every place of vices and crimes. <lb/>
            More evil is done than can be healed by punishment: men <lb/>
            seem engaged in a vast race of wickedness. Every day <lb/>
            there is greater eagerness to sin, less modesty. Throwing <lb/>
            aside all reverence for what is better and more just, lust <lb/>
            rushes whithersoever it thinks fit, and crimes are no longer <lb/>
            committed by stealth, they take place before our eyes, and <lb/>
            wickedness has become so general and gained such a footing <lb/>
            in everyone's breast that innocence is no longer rare, but <lb/>
            no longer exists. Do men break the law singly, or a few <lb/>
            -at a time ? Nay, they rise in all quarters at once, as though <lb/>
            obeying some universal signal, to wipe out the boundaries <lb/>
            of right and wrong. <note type="footnote"> 1 The voting-place in the Campus Martius. </note> <pb n="84"/>

            three of our present Jaw-courts would not suffice to deal <lb/>
            with. If you want the wise man to be as angry as the <lb/>

            angry, but must go mad with rage.</p>
          <p>X. You will rather think that we should not be <lb/>
            angry with people's faults; for what shall we say of <lb/>
            one who is angry with those who stumble in the dark, <lb/>
            or with deaf people who cannot hear his orders, or with <lb/>
            children, because they forget their duty and interest <lb/>
            themselves in the games and silly'jokes of their com­ <lb/>
            panions ? What shall we say if you choose to be angry <note type="footnote"> 1 Ovid, Metamorphoses, i., 144, sqq. The same lines are quoted in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            with weaklings for being sick, for growing old, or becoming <lb/>
            fatigued ? Among the other misfortunes of humanity is <lb/>
            this, that men's intellects are confused, and they not only <lb/>
            cannot help going wrong, but love to go wrong. To avoid <lb/>
            being angry with individuals, you must pardon the whole <lb/>
            mass, you must grant forgiveness to the entire human race. <lb/>
            If you are angry with young and old men because they do <lb/>
            wrong, you will be angry with infants also, for they soon <lb/>
            will do wrong. Does any one become angry with children, <lb/>
            who are too young to comprehend distinctions ? Yet, to. <lb/>
            be a human being is a greater and a better excuse than to <lb/>
            be a child. Thus are we born, as creatures liable to as <lb/>
            many disorders of the mind as of the body; not dull and <lb/>
            slow-witted, but making a bad use of our keenness of wit, <lb/>
            and leading one another into vice by our example. He <lb/>
            who follows others who have started before him on the <lb/>
            wrong road is surely excusable for having wandered onl the <lb/>
            highway. A general's severity may be shown in the case <lb/>
            of individual deserters; but where a whole army deserts, <lb/>
            it must needs be pardoned. What is it that puts a stop to <lb/>
            the wise man's anger ? It is the number of sinners. He <lb/>
            perceives how unjust and how dangerous it is to be angry <lb/>
            with vices which all men share. Heraclitus, whenever he <lb/>
            came out of doors and beheld around him such a number <lb/>
            of men who were living wretchedly, nay, rather perishing <lb/>
            wretchedly, used to weep : he pitied all those who met him <lb/>
            joyous and happy. He was of a gentle but too weak dispo­ <lb/>
            sition : and he himself was one of those for whom he ought to <lb/>
            have wept. Democritus, on the other hand, is said never to <lb/>
            have appeared in public without laughing; so little did men's <lb/>
            serious occupations appear serious to him. What room is <lb/>
            there for anger ? Everything ought either to move us to <lb/>
            tears or to laughter. The wise man will not be angry with <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e., he can plead that he kept the beaten track. </note> <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            sinners. Why not ? Because be knows that no one is born <lb/>
            wise, but becomes so: he knows that very few wise men <lb/>
            are produced in any age, because he thoroughly under­ <lb/>
            stands the circumstances of human life. Now, no sane man <lb/>
            is angry with nature: for what should we say if a man chose <lb/>
            to be surprised that fruit did not hang on the thickets of a <lb/>
            forest, or to wonder at bushes and thorns not being covered <lb/>
            with some useful berry? No one is angry when nature <lb/>
            excuses a defect. The wise man, therefore, being tranquil, <lb/>
            and dealing candidly with mistakes, not an enemy to but an <lb/>
            improver of sinners, will go abroad every day in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing frame of mind :—" Many men will meet me who are <lb/>
            drunkards, lustful, ungrateful, greedy, and excited by the <lb/>
            frenzy of ambition." He will view all these as benignly as <lb/>
            a physician does his patients. When a man's ship leaks <lb/>
            freely through its opened seams, does he become angry with <lb/>
            the sailors or the ship itself ? No; instead of that, he <lb/>
            tries to remedy it: he shuts out some water, bales out <lb/>
            some other, closes all the holes that he can see, and by <lb/>
            ceaseless labour counteracts those which are out of sight <lb/>
            and which, let water into the hold; nor does he relax his <lb/>
            efforts because as much water as he pumps out runs in <lb/>
            again. We need a long-breathed struggle against per­ <lb/>
            manent and prolific evils; not, indeed, to quell them, but <lb/>
            merely to prevent their overpowering us.</p>
          <p>XI. " Anger," says our opponent, " is useful, because it <lb/>
            avoids contempt, and because it frightens bad men." Now, <lb/>
            in the first place, if anger is strong in proportion to its <lb/>
            threats, it is hateful for the same reason that it is terrible : <lb/>
            and it is more dangerous to be hated than to be despised. <lb/>
            If, again, it is without strength, it is much more exposed <lb/>
            to contempt, and cannot avoid ridicule: for what is more <lb/>
            flat than anger when it breaks out into meaningless ravings ? <lb/>
            Moreover, because some things are somewhat terrible, they <lb/>
            are not on that account desirable: nor does wisdom wish it <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            to be said of the wise man, as it is of a wild beast, that the <lb/>
            fear which he inspires is as a weapon to him. Why, do <lb/>
            we not fear fever, gout, consuming ulcers ? and is there, <lb/>
            for that reason, any good in them ? nay; on the other <lb/>
            hand, they are all despised and thought to be foul and base, <lb/>
            and are for this very reason feared. So, too, anger is in <lb/>
            itself hideous and by no means to be feared; yet it is feared <lb/>
            by many, just as a hideous mask is feared by children. How <lb/>
            can we answer the fact that terror always works back to <lb/>
            him who inspired it, and that no one is feared who is him­ <lb/>
            self at peace ? At this point it is well that you should <lb/>
            remember that verse of Laberius, which, when pronounced <lb/>
            in the theatre during the height of the civil war, caught <lb/>
            the fancy of the whole people as though it expressed the <lb/>
            national feeling :­ <lb/>
            "He must fear many, whom so many fear." <lb/>
            Thus has nature ordained, that whatever becomes great by <lb/>
            causing fear to others is not free from fear itself. How <lb/>
            disturbed lions are at the faintest noises ! How excited <lb/>
            those fiercest of beasts become at strange shadows, voices, <lb/>
            or smells ! Whatever is a terror to others, fears for itself. <lb/>
            There can be no reason, therefore, for any wise man to wish <lb/>
            to be feared, and no one need think that anger is anything <lb/>
            great because it strikes terror, since even the most despicable <lb/>
            things are feared, as, for example, noxious vermin whose <lb/>
            bite is venomous: and since a string set with feathers <lb/>
            stops the largest herds of wild beasts and guides them into <lb/>
            traps, it is no wonder that from its effect it should be <lb/>
            named a " Scarer." 1 Foolish creatures are frightened by <lb/>
            foolish things : the movement of chariots and the sight of <lb/>
            their wheels turning round drives lions back into their <lb/>
            cage: elephants are frightened at the cries of pigs: and so <lb/>
            also we fear anger just as children fear the dark, or wild <note type="footnote"> 1 De Clem. i. 12, 5. </note> <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            beasts fear red feathers : it has in itself nothing solid or <lb/>
            valiant, but it affects feeble minds.</p>
          <p>XII. "Wickedness," says our adversary, " must be re­ <lb/>
            moved from the system of nature, if you wish to remove <lb/>
            anger: neither of which things can be done." In the first <lb/>
            place, it is possible for a man not to be cold, although accord­ <lb/>
            in- to the system of nature it may be winter-time, nor yet <lb/>
            to suffer from heat, although it be summer according to the <lb/>
            almanac. He may be protected against the inclement time <lb/>
            of the year by dwelling in a favoured spot, or he may have <lb/>
            so trained his body to endurance that it feels neither heat nor <lb/>
            cold. Next, reverse this saying:—You must remove anger <lb/>
            from your mind before you can take virtue into the same, <lb/>
            because vices and virtues cannot combine, and none can <lb/>
            at the same time be both an angry man and a good man, <lb/>
            any more than he can be both sick and well. " It is not <lb/>
            possible," says he, " to remove anger altogether from the <lb/>
            mind, nor does human nature admit of it." Yet there is <lb/>
            nothing so hard and difficult that the mind of man cannot <lb/>
            overcome it, and with which unremitting study will not <lb/>
            render him familiar, nor are there any passions so fierce <lb/>
            and independent that they cannot be tamed by discipline. <lb/>
            The mind can carry out whatever orders it gives itself: <lb/>
            some have succeeded in never smiling: some have for­ <lb/>
            bidden themselves wine, sexual intercourse, or even drink <lb/>
            of all kinds. Some, who are satisfied with short hours of <lb/>
            rest, have learned to watch for long periods without weari­ <lb/>
            ness. Men have learned to run upon the thinnest ropes <lb/>
            even when slanting, to carry huge burdens, scarcely within <lb/>
            the compass of human strength, or to dive to enormous <lb/>
            depths and suffer themselves to remain under the sea <lb/>
            without any chance of drawing breath. There are a <lb/>
            thousand other instances in which application has con­ <lb/>
            quered all obstacles, and proved that nothing which the <lb/>
            mind has set itself to endure is difficult. The men whom I <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            have just mentioned gain either no reward or one that is . <lb/>
            unworthy of their unwearied application ; for what great <lb/>
            thing does a man gain by applying his intellect to walking <lb/>
            upon a tight rope ? or to placing great burdens upon his <lb/>
            shoulders? or to keeping sleep from his eyes ? or to <lb/>
            reaching the bottom of the sea? and yet their patient <lb/>
            labour brings all these things to pass for a trifling reward. <lb/>
            Shall not we then call in the aid of patience, we whom <lb/>
            such a prize awaits, the unbroken calm of a happy life ? <lb/>
            How great a blessing is it to escape from anger, that chief <lb/>
            of all evils, and therewith from frenzy, ferocity, cruelty, and <lb/>
            madness, its attendants ?</p>
          <p>XIII. There is no reason why we should seek to defend <lb/>
            such a passion as this or excuse its excesses by declaring it <lb/>
            to be either useful or unavoidable. What vice, indeed, is <lb/>
            without its defenders ? yet this is no reason why you should <lb/>
            declare anger to be ineradicable. The evils from which we <lb/>
            suffer are curable, and since we were born with a natural <lb/>
            bias towards good, nature herself will help us if we try to <lb/>
            amend our lives. Nor is the path to virtue steep and <lb/>
            rough, as some think it to be: it may be reached on <lb/>
            level ground. This is no untrue tale which I come to <lb/>
            tell you: the road to happiness is easy; do you only <lb/>
            enter upon it with good luck and the good help of the <lb/>
            gods themselves. It is much harder to do what you are <lb/>
            doing. What is more restful than a mind at peace, and <lb/>
            what more toilsome than anger ? What is more at leisure <lb/>
            than clemency, what fuller of business than cruelty ? <lb/>
            Modesty keeps holiday while vice is overwhelmed with <lb/>
            work. In fine, the culture of any of the virtues is easy, <lb/>
            while vices require a great expense. Anger ought to be <lb/>
            removed from our minds: even those who say that it <lb/>
            ought to be kept low admit this to some extent: let it be <lb/>
            got rid of altogether; there is nothing to be gained by it. <lb/>
            Without it we can more easily and more justly put an end <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK.IV. </note> <lb/>
            to crime, punish bad men, and amend their lives. The <lb/>
            wise man will do his duty in all things without the help of <lb/>
            any evil passion, and will use no auxiliaries which require <lb/>
            watching narrowly lest they get beyond his control.</p>
          <p>XIV. Anger, then, must never become a habit with us, <lb/>
            but we may sometimes affect to be angry when we wish to <lb/>
            rouse up the dull minds of those whom we address, just as <lb/>
            we rouse up horses who are slow at starting with goads <lb/>
            and firebrands. We must sometimes apply fear to persons <lb/>
            upon whom reason makes no impression : yet to be angry <lb/>
            is of no more use than to grieve or to be afraid. " What ? <lb/>
            do not circumstances arise which provoke us to anger ? <lb/>
            Yes: but at those times above all others we ought to choke <lb/>
            down our wrath. Nor is it difficult to conquer our spirit, <lb/>
            seeing that athletes, who devote their whole attention <lb/>
            to the basest parts of themselves, nevertheless are able to <lb/>
            endure blows and pain, in order to exhaust the strength of <lb/>
            the striker, and do not strike when anger bids them, but <lb/>
            when opportunity invites them. It is said that Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            the most celebrated trainer for gymnastic contests, used <lb/>
            habitually to impress upon his pupils not to lose their <lb/>
            tempers : for anger spoils their science, and thinks only <lb/>
            how it can hurt: so that often reason counsels patience <lb/>
            while anger counsels revenge, and we, who might have <lb/>
            survived our first misfortunes, are exposed to worse ones. <lb/>
            Some have been driven into exile by their impatience of <lb/>
            a single contemptuous word, have been plunged into <lb/>
            the deepest miseries because they would not endure the <lb/>
            most trifling wrong in silence, and have brought upon <lb/>
            themselves the yoke of slavery because they were too proud <lb/>
            to give up the least part of their entire liberty.</p>
          <p>XV. " That you may be sure," says our opponent, " that <lb/>
            anger has in it something noble, pray look at the free <lb/>
            nations, such as the Germans and Scythians, who are <lb/>
            especially prone to anger." The reason of this is that stout <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            and daring intellects are liable to anger before they are <lb/>
            tamed by discipline; for some passions engraft themselves <lb/>
            upon the better class of dispositions only, just as good land, <lb/>
            even when waste, grows strong brushwood, and the trees <lb/>
            are tall which stand upon a fertile soil. In like manner, <lb/>
            dispositions which are naturally bold produce irritability, <lb/>
            and, being hot and fiery, have no mean or trivial qualities, <lb/>
            but their energy is misdirected, as happens with all those <lb/>
            who without training come to the front by their natural <lb/>
            advantages alone, whose minds, unless they be brought <lb/>
            under control, degenerate from a courageous temper into <lb/>
            habits of rashness and reckless daring. " What ? are not <lb/>
            milder spirits linked with gentler vices, such as tenderness <lb/>
            of heart, love, and bashfulness ? " Yes, and therefore I can <lb/>
            often point out to you a good disposition by its own faults: <lb/>
            yet their being the proofs of a superior nature does not pre­ <lb/>
            vent their being vices. Moreover, all those nations which <lb/>
            are free because they are wild, like lions or wolves, cannot <lb/>
            command any more than they can obey: for the strength <lb/>
            of their intellect is not civilized, but fierce and unmanage­ <lb/>
            able : now, no one is able to rule unless he is also able to <lb/>
            be ruled. Consequently, the empire of the world has <lb/>
            almost always remained in the hands of those nations <lb/>
            who enjoy a milder climate. Those who dwell near the <lb/>
            frozen north have uncivilized tempers­ <lb/>
            " Just on the model of their native skies," <lb/>
            as the poet has it.</p>
          <p>XVI. Those animals, urges our opponent, are held to be <lb/>
            the most generous who have large capacity for anger.. He <lb/>
            is mistaken when he holds up creatures who act from <lb/>
            impulse instead of reason as patterns for men to follow, <lb/>
            because in man reason takes the place of impulse. Yet <lb/>
            even with animals, all do not alike profit by the same <lb/>
            thing. Anger is of use to lions, timidity to stags, boldness <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            to hawks, flight to doves. What if I declare that it is not <lb/>
            even true that the best animals are the most prone to <lb/>
            anger ? I may suppose that wild beasts, who gain their <lb/>
            food by rapine, are better the angrier they are; but I <lb/>
            should praise oxen and horses who obey the rein for their <lb/>
            patience. What reason, however, have you for referring <lb/>
            mankind to such wretched models, when you have the <lb/>
            universe and God, whom he alone of animals imitates <lb/>
            because he alone comprehends Him ? " The most irritable <lb/>
            men," says he, " are thought to be the most straightfor­ <lb/>
            ward of all." Yes, because they are compared with swindlers <lb/>
            and sharpers, and appear to be simple because they are out­ <lb/>
            spoken. I should not call such men simple, but heedless. <lb/>
            We give this title of " simple" to all fools, gluttons, <lb/>
            spendthrifts, and men whose vices lie on the surface.</p>
          <p>XVII. "An orator," says our opponent, "sometimes <lb/>
            speaks better when he is angry." Not so, but when he <lb/>
            pretends to be angry: for so also actors bring down the <lb/>
            house by their playing, not when they are really angry, <lb/>
            but when they act the angry man well: and in like <lb/>
            manner, in addressing a jury or a popular assembly, or in <lb/>
            any other position in which the minds of others have to be <lb/>
            influenced at our pleasure, we must ourselves pretend to <lb/>
            feel anger, fear, or pity before we can make others feel <lb/>
            them, and often the pretence of passion will do what the <lb/>
            passion itself could not have done. " The mind which <lb/>
            does not feel anger," says he, " is feeble." True, if it has <lb/>
            nothing stronger than anger to support it. A man ought <lb/>
            to be neither robber nor victim, neither tender-hearted nor <lb/>
            cruel. The former belongs to an over-weak mind, the <lb/>
            latter to an over-hard one. Let the wise man be moderate, <lb/>
            and when things have to be done somewhat briskly, let <lb/>
            him call force, not anger, to his aid.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Now that we have discussed the questions pro­ <lb/>
            pounded concerning anger, let us pass on to the considera- <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            tion of its remedies. These, I imagine, are two-fold : the <lb/>
            one class preventing our becoming angry, the other pre-, <lb/>
            venting our doing wrong when we are angry. As with the <lb/>
            body we adopt a certain regimen to keep ourselves in <lb/>
            health, and use different rules to bring back health when <lb/>
            lost, so likewise we must repel anger in one fashion and <lb/>
            quench it in another. That we may avoid, it, certain <lb/>
            general rules of conduct which apply to all men's lives <lb/>
            must be impressed upon us. We may divide these into such <lb/>
            as are of use during the education of the young and in <lb/>
            after-life.</p>
          <p>Education ought to be carried on with the greatest and <lb/>
            most salutary assiduity: for it is easy to mould minds <lb/>
            while they are still tender, but it is difficult to uproot vicea <lb/>
            which have grown up with ourselves.</p>
          <p>XIX. A hot mind is naturally the most prone to anger : <lb/>
            for as there are four elements,1 consisting of fire, air, <lb/>
            earth, and water, so there are powers corresponding and <lb/>
            equivalent to each of these, namely, hot, cold, dry, and <lb/>
            moist. Now the mixture of the elements is the cause of- <lb/>
            the diversities of lands and of animals, of bodies and of­ <lb/>
            character, and our dispositions incline to one or the other­ <lb/>
            of these according as the strength of each element prevails, <lb/>
            in us. Hence it is that we call some regions wet or dry, <lb/>
            warm or cold. The same distinctions apply likewise to. <lb/>
            animals and mankind; it makes a great difference how <lb/>
            much moisture or heat a man contains; his character will <lb/>
            partake of whichever element has the largest share in him.. <lb/>
            A warm temper of mind will make men prone to anger ; <lb/>
            for fire is full of movement and vigour; a mixture of: <note type="footnote">1 Compare Shakespeare, " Julius Caesar," Act v. Sc. 5:­ <lb/>
            " His life was gentle, and the elements <lb/>
            So mixed in him, that nature might stand up <lb/>
            And say to all the world, this was a man!" <lb/>
            See Mr. Aldis Wright's note upon the passage. </note> <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            coldness makes men cowards, for cold is sluggish and <lb/>
            contracted. Because of this, some of our Stoics think <lb/>
            that anger is excited in our breasts by the boiling of the <lb/>
            blood round the heart: indeed, that place is assigned to <lb/>
            anger for no other reason than because the breast is the <lb/>
            warmest part of the whole body. Those who have more <lb/>
            moisture in them become angry by slow degrees, because <lb/>
            they have no heat ready at hand, but it has to be obtained <lb/>
            by movement; wherefore the anger of women and children <lb/>
            is sharp rather than strong, and arises on lighter provoca­ <lb/>
            tion. At dry times of life anger is violent and powerful, <lb/>
            yet without increase, and adding little to itself, because as <lb/>
            heat dies away cold takes its place. Old men are testy <lb/>
            and full of complaints, as also are sick people and con­ <lb/>
            valescents, and all whose store of heat has been con­ <lb/>
            sumed by weariness or loss of blood. Those who are <lb/>
            wasted by thirst or hunger are in the same condition, as <lb/>
            also are those whose frame is naturally bloodless and faints <lb/>
            from want of generous diet. Wine kindles anger, because <lb/>
            it increases heat; according to each man's disposition, <lb/>
            some fly into a passion when they are heavily drunk, some <lb/>
            when they are slightly drunk: nor is there any other reason <lb/>
            than this why yellow-haired, ruddy-complexioned people <lb/>
            should be excessively passionate, seeing that they are <lb/>
            naturally of the colour which others put on during anger; <lb/>
            for their blood is hot and easily set in motion.</p>
          <p>XX. But just as nature makes some men prone to <lb/>
            anger, so there are many other causes which have the same <lb/>
            power as nature. Some are brought into this condition by <lb/>
            disease or bodily injury, others by hard work, long watch­ <lb/>
            ing, nights of anxiety, ardent longings, and love : and every­ <lb/>
            thing else which is hurtful to the body or the spirit inclines <lb/>
            the distempered mind to find fault. All these, however, are <lb/>
            but the beginning and causes of anger. Habit of mind <lb/>
            has very great power, and, if it be harsh, increases the <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            disorder. As for nature, it is difficult to alter it, nor may <lb/>
            we change the mixture of the elements which was formed <lb/>
            once for all at our birth: yet knowledge will be so <lb/>
            far of service, that we should keep wine out of the <lb/>
            reach of hot-tempered men, which Plato thinks ought <lb/>
            also to be forbidden to boys, so that fire be not made <lb/>
            fiercer. Neither should such men be over-fed: for if <lb/>
            so, their bodies will swell, and their minds will swell <lb/>
            with them. Such men ought to take exercise, stopping <lb/>
            short, however, of fatigue, in order that their natural heat <lb/>
            may be abated, but not exhausted, and their excess of fiery <lb/>
            spirit may be worked off. Games also will be useful: for <lb/>
            moderate pleasure relieves the mind and brings it to a <lb/>
            proper balance. With those temperaments which incline <lb/>
            to moisture, or dryness and stiffness, there is no danger of <lb/>
            anger, but there is fear of greater vices, such as cowardice, <lb/>
            moroseness, despair, and suspiciousness: such dispositions <lb/>
            therefore ought to be softened, comforted, and restored to <lb/>
            cheerfulness: and since we must make use of different <lb/>
            remedies for anger and for sullenness, and these two vices <lb/>
            require not only unlike, but absolutely opposite modes of <lb/>
            treatment, let us always attack that one of them which is <lb/>
            gaining the mastery.</p>
          <p>XXI. It is, I assure you, of the greatest service to boys <lb/>
            that they should be soundly brought up, yet to regulate <lb/>
            their education is difficult, because it is our duty to be <lb/>
            careful neither to cherish a habit of anger in them, nor to <lb/>
            blunt the edge of their spirit. This needs careful watching, <lb/>
            for both qualities, both those which are to be encouraged, <lb/>
            and those which are to be checked, are fed by the same <lb/>
            things; and even a careful watcher may be deceived by <lb/>
            their likeness. A boy's spirit is increased by freedom and <lb/>
            depressed by slavery : it rises when praised, and is led to <lb/>
            conceive great expectations of itself: yet this same treatment <lb/>
            produces arrogance and quickness of temper: we must <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            therefore guide him between these two extremes, using the <lb/>
            curb at one time and the spur at another. He must undergo <lb/>
            no servile or degrading treatment; he never must beg <lb/>
            abjectly for anything, nor must he gain anything by <lb/>
            begging ; let him rather receive it for his own sake, for his <lb/>
            past good behaviour, or for his promises of future good <lb/>
            conduct. In contests with his comrades we ought not to <lb/>
            allow him to become sulky or fly into a passion: let us <lb/>
            see that he be on friendly terms with those whom he con­ <lb/>
            tends with, so that in the struggle itself he may learn to <lb/>
            wish not to hurt his antagonist but to conquer him : when­ <lb/>
            ever he has gained the day or done something praiseworthy, <lb/>
            we should allow him to enjoy his victory, but not to rush <lb/>
            into transports of delight: for joy leads to exultation, and <lb/>
            exultation leads to swaggering and excessive self-esteem. <lb/>
            We ought to allow him some relaxation, yet not yield him up <lb/>
            to laziness and sloth, and we ought to keep him far beyond <lb/>
            the reach of luxury, for nothing makes children more prone <lb/>
            to anger than a soft and fond bringing-up, so that the more <lb/>
            only children are indulged, and the more liberty is given to <lb/>
            orphans, the more they are corrupted. He to whom nothing <lb/>
            is ever denied, will not be able to endure a rebuff, whose <lb/>
            anxious mother always wipes away his. tears, whose paeda­ <lb/>
            gogus is made to pay for his shortcomings. Do you not <lb/>
            observe how a man's anger becomes more violent as he <lb/>
            rises in station ? This shows itself especially in those who are <lb/>
            rich and noble, or in great place, when the favouring gale <lb/>
            has roused all the most empty and trivial passions of their <lb/>
            minds. Prosperity fosters anger, when a man's proud ears <lb/>
            are surrounded by a mob of flatterers, saying, " That man <lb/>
            answer you ! you do not act according to your dignity, you <lb/>
            lower yourself." And so forth, with all the language which <lb/>
            can hardly be resisted even by healthy and originally well- <note type="footnote"> 1 Paedagogus was a slave who accompanied a boy to school, &amp;c., to <lb/>
            keep him out of mischief; he did not teach him anything. </note> <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            principled minds. Flattery, then, must be kept well out <lb/>
            of the way of children. Let a child hear the truth, and <lb/>
            sometimes fear it: let him always reverence it. Let him rise <lb/>
            in the presence of his elders. Let him obtain nothing by fly­ <lb/>
            ing into a passion : let him be given when he is quiet what <lb/>
            was refused him when he cried for it: let him behold, but not <lb/>
            make use of his father's wealth : let him be reproved for <lb/>
            what he does wrong. It will be advantageous to furnish <lb/>
            boys with even-tempered teachers and paedagogi: what <lb/>
            is soft and unformed clings to what is near, and takes <lb/>
            its shape: the habits of young men reproduce those of their <lb/>
            nurses and paedagogi. Once, a boy who was brought up in <lb/>
            Plato's house went home to his parents, and, on seeing his <lb/>
            father shouting with passion, said, "I never saw any one <lb/>
            at Plato's house act like that." I doubt not that he learned <lb/>
            to imitate his father sooner than he learned to imitate Plato. <lb/>
            Above all, let his food be scanty, his dress not costly, and <lb/>
            of the same fashion as that of his comrades : if you begin <lb/>
            by putting him on a level with many others, he will not be <lb/>
            angry when some one is compared with him.</p>
          <p>XXII. These precepts, however, apply to our children: <lb/>
            in ourselves the accident of birth and our education no <lb/>
            longer admits of either mistakes or advice ; we must deal <lb/>
            with what follows. Now we ought to fight against the <lb/>
            first causes of evil: the cause of anger is the belief that we <lb/>
            are injured; this belief, therefore, should not be lightly <lb/>
            entertained. We ought not to fly into a rage even when <lb/>
            the injury appears to be open and distinct: for some false <lb/>
            things bear the semblance of truth. We should always <lb/>
            allow some time to elapse, for time discloses the truth. <lb/>
            Let not our ears be easily lent to calumnious talk: let us <lb/>
            know and be on our guard against this fault of human <lb/>
            nature, that we are willing to believe what we are unwilling <lb/>
            to listen to, and that we become angry before we have <lb/>
            formed our opinion. What shall I say ? we are influenced <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            not merely by calumnies but by suspicions, and at the very <lb/>
            look and smile of others we may fly into a rage with inno­ <lb/>
            cent persons because we put the worst construction <lb/>
            upon it. We ought, therefore, to plead the cause of the <lb/>
            absent against ourselves, and to keep our anger in abey­ <lb/>
            ance : for a punishment which has been postponed may <lb/>
            yet be inflicted, but when once inflicted cannot be recalled.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Every one knows the story of the tyrannicide <lb/>
            who, being caught before he had accomplished his task, and <lb/>
            being tortured by Hippias to make him betray his accom­ <lb/>
            plices, named the friends of the tyrant who stood around, <lb/>
            and every one to whom he knew the tyrant's safety was <lb/>
            especially dear. As the tyrant ordered each man to be <lb/>
            slain as he was named, at last the man, being asked if any <lb/>
            one else remained, said, " You remain alone, for I have left <lb/>
            no one else alive to whom you are dear." Anger had made <lb/>
            the tyrant lend his assistance to the tyrant-slayer, and cut <lb/>
            down his guards with his own sword. How far more <lb/>
            spirited was Alexander, who after reading his mother's <lb/>
            letter warning him to beware of poison from his physician <lb/>
            Philip, nevertheless drank undismayed the medicine <lb/>
            which Philip gave him! He felt more confidence in <lb/>
            his friend : he deserved that his friend should be inno­ <lb/>
            cent, and deserved that his conduct should make him inno­ <lb/>
            cent. I praise Alexander's doing this all the more because <lb/>
            he was above all men prone to anger; but the rarer <lb/>
            moderation is among kings, the more it deserves to be <lb/>
            praised. The great Gains Caesar, who proved such a <lb/>
            merciful conqueror in the civil war, did the same thing; <lb/>
            he burned a packet of letters addressed to Gnaeus Pom­ <lb/>
            peius by persons who had been thought to be either <lb/>
            neutrals or on the other side. Though he was never violent <lb/>
            in his anger, yet he preferred to put it out of his power to <lb/>
            be angry: he thought that the kindest way to pardon each <lb/>
            of them was not to know what his offence had been.</p><pb n="99"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. XXV.] </note> XXIV. Readiness to believe what we hear causes very <lb/>
            great mischief; we ought often not even to listen, because <lb/>
            in some cases it is better to be deceived than to suspect <lb/>
            deceit. We ought to free our minds of suspicion and mis­ <lb/>
            trust, those most untrustworthy causes of anger. " This <lb/>
            man's greeting was far from civil; that one would not <lb/>
            receive my kiss; one cut short a story I had begun to tell; <lb/>
            another did not ask me to dinner; another seemed to view <lb/>
            me with aversion." Suspicion will never lack grounds : <lb/>
            what we want is straightforwardness, and a kindly inter­ <lb/>
            pretation of things. Let us believe nothing unless it forces <lb/>
            itself upon our sight and is unmistakable, and let us <lb/>
            reprove ourselves for being too ready to believe, as often <lb/>
            as our suspicions prove to be groundless: for this dis­ <lb/>
            cipline will render us habitually slow to believe what we <lb/>
            hear.</p>
          <p>XXV. Another consequence of this will be, that we <lb/>
            shall not be exasperated by the slightest and most con­ <lb/>
            temptible trifles. It is mere madness to be put out of <lb/>
            temper because a slave is not quick, because the water we <lb/>
            are going to drink is lukewarm, or because our couch is <lb/>
            disarranged or our table carelessly laid. A man must be <lb/>
            in a miserably bad state of health if he shrinks from a <lb/>
            gentle breath of wind; his eyes must be diseased if they are <lb/>
            distressed by the sight of white clothing; he must be <lb/>
            broken down with debauchery if he feels pain at seeing <lb/>
            another man work. It is said that there was one Mindy­ <lb/>
            rides, a citizen of Sybaris, who one day seeing a man <lb/>
            digging and vigorously brandishing a mattock, complained <lb/>
            that the sight made him weary, and forbade the man to <lb/>
            work where he could see him. The same man complained <lb/>
            that he had suffered from the rose-leaves upon which he <lb/>
            lay being folded double. When pleasures have corrupted <lb/>
            both the body and the mind, nothing seems endurable, not <lb/>
            indeed because it is hard, but because he who has to bear it <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            is soft: for why should, we be driven to frenzy by any one's <lb/>
            coughing and sneezing, or by a fly not being driven away <lb/>
            with sufficient care, or by a dog's hanging about us, or a <lb/>
            key dropping from a careless servant's hand ? Will one <lb/>
            whose ears are agonised by the noise of a bench being <lb/>
            dragged along the floor be able to endure with unruffled <lb/>
            mind the rude language of party strife, and the abuse <lb/>
            which speakers in the forum or the senate house heap upon <lb/>
            their opponents ? Will he who is angry with his slave for <lb/>
            icing his drink badly, be able to endure hunger, or the <lb/>
            thirst of a long march in summer ? Nothing, therefore, <lb/>
            nourishes anger more than excessive and dissatisfied luxury: <lb/>
            the mind ought to be hardened by rough treatment, so as <lb/>
            not to feel any blow that is not severe.</p>
          <p>XXVI. We are angry, either with those who can, or <lb/>
            with those who cannot do us an injury. To the latter class <lb/>
            belong some inanimate things, such as a book, which we <lb/>
            often throw away when it is written in letters too small for <lb/>
            us to read, or tear up when it is full of mistakes, or clothes <lb/>
            which we destroy because we do not like them. How <lb/>
            foolish to be angry with such things as these, which neither <lb/>
            deserve nor feel our anger ! " But of course it is their <lb/>
            makers who really affront us." I answer that, in the first <lb/>
            place, we often become angry before making this distinc­ <lb/>
            tion clear in our minds, and secondly, perhaps even the <lb/>
            makers might put forward some reasonable excuses : one <lb/>
            of them, it may be, could not make them any better than <lb/>
            he did, and it is not through any disrespect to you that he <lb/>
            was unskilled in his trade: 'another may have done his <lb/>
            work so without any intention of insulting you: and, finally, <lb/>
            what can be more crazy than to discharge upon things the <lb/>
            ill-feeling which one has accumulated against persons ? Yet <lb/>
            as it is the act of a madman to be angry with inanimate <lb/>
            objects, so also is it to be angry with dumb animals, which <lb/>
            can do us no wrong because they are not able to form a <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVII.] </note> <lb/>
            purpose; and we cannot call anything a wrong unless it be <lb/>
            done intentionally. They are, therefore, able to hurt us, <lb/>
            just as a sword or a stone may do so, but they are not able <lb/>
            to do us a wrong. Yet some men think themselves insulted <lb/>
            when the same horses which are docile with one rider are <lb/>
            restive with another, as though it were through their <lb/>
            deliberate choice, and not through habit and cleverness of <lb/>
            handling that some horses are more easily managed by <lb/>
            some men than by others. And as it is foolish to be angry <lb/>
            with them, so it is to be angry with children, and with <lb/>
            men who have little more sense than children: for all <lb/>
            these sins, before a just judge, ignorance would be as <lb/>
            effective an excuse as innocence.</p>
          <p>XXVII. There are some things which are unable to <lb/>
            hurt us, and whose power is exclusively beneficial and <lb/>
            salutary, as, for example, the immortal gods, who neither <lb/>
            wish nor are able to do harm : for their temperament is <lb/>
            naturally gentle and tranquil, and no more likely to wrong <lb/>
            others than to wrong themselves. Foolish people who know <lb/>
            not the truth hold them answerable for storms at sea, <lb/>
            excessive rain, and long winters, whereas all the while <lb/>
            these phenomena by which we suffer or profit take place <lb/>
            without any reference whatever to us : it is not for our <lb/>
            sake that the universe causes summer and winter to <lb/>
            succeed one another; these have a law of their own, <lb/>
            according to which their divine functions are performed. <lb/>
            We think too much of ourselves, when we imagine that we <lb/>
            are worthy to have such prodigious revolutions effected <lb/>
            for our sake : so, then, none of these things take place in <lb/>
            order to do us an injury, nay, on the contrary, they all tend <lb/>
            to our benefit. I have said that there are some things <lb/>
            which cannot hurt us, and some which would not. To <lb/>
            the latter class belong good men in authority, good <lb/>
            parents, teachers, and judges, whose punishments ought <lb/>
            to be submitted to by us in the same spirit in which we <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            undergo the surgeon's knife, abstinence from food, and <lb/>
            such like things which hurt us for our benefit. Suppose <lb/>
            that we are being punished ; let us think not only of what <lb/>
            we suffer, but of what we have done : let us sit in judgement <lb/>
            on our past life. Provided we are willing to tell ourselves <lb/>
            the truth, we shall certainly decide that our crimes deserve <lb/>
            a harder measure than they have received.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. If we desire to be impartial judges of all that <lb/>
            takes place, we must first convince ourselves of this, that <lb/>
            no one of us is faultless: for it is from this that most of <lb/>
            our indignation proceeds. "I have not sinned, I have <lb/>
            done no wrong." Say, rather, you do not admit that you <lb/>
            have done any wrong. We are infuriated at being reproved, <lb/>
            either by reprimand or actual chastisement, although we <lb/>
            are sinning at that very time, by adding insolence and <lb/>
            obstinacy to our wrong-doings. Who is there that can <lb/>
            declare himself to have broken no laws ? Even if there be <lb/>
            such a man, what a stinted innocence it is, merely to be in­ <lb/>
            nocent by the letter of the law. How much further do the <lb/>
            rules of duty extend than those of the law ! how many <lb/>
            things which are not to be found in the statute book, are <lb/>
            demanded by filial feeling, kindness, generosity, equity, <lb/>
            and honour ? Yet we are not able to warrant ourselves even <lb/>
            to come under that first narrowest definition of innocence : <lb/>
            we have done what was wrong, thought what was wrong, <lb/>
            wished for what was wrong, and encouraged what was <lb/>
            wrong: in some cases we have only remained innocent <lb/>
            because we did not succeed. When we think of this, let <lb/>
            us deal more justly with sinners, and believe that those who <lb/>
            scold us are right: in any case let us not be angry with <lb/>
            ourselves (for with whom shall we not be angry, if we are <lb/>
            angry even with our own selves ?), and least of all with the <lb/>
            gods: for whatever we suffer befalls us not by any ordinance <lb/>
            of theirs but of the common law of all flesh. " But diseases <lb/>
            and pains attack us." Well, people who live in a crazy <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            dwelling must have some way of escape from it. Some <lb/>
            one will be said to have spoken ill of you: think <lb/>
            whether you did not first speak ill of him: think of how <lb/>
            many persons you have yourself spoken ill. Let us not, I <lb/>
            say, suppose that others are doing us a wrong, but are re­ <lb/>
            paying one which we have done them, that some are acting <lb/>
            with good intentions, some under compulsion, some in <lb/>
            ignorance, and let us believe that even he who does so inten­ <lb/>
            tionally and knowingly did not wrong us merely for the <lb/>
            sake of wronging us, but was led into doing so by the <lb/>
            attraction of saying something witty, or did whatever he <lb/>
            did, not out of any spite against us, but because he himself <lb/>
            could not succeed unless he pushed us back. We are <lb/>
            often offended by flattery even while it is being lavished <lb/>
            upon us : yet whoever recalls to his mind how often he <lb/>
            himself has been the victim of undeserved suspicion, how <lb/>
            often fortune has given his true service an appearance of <lb/>
            wrong-doing, how many persons he has begun by hating <lb/>
            and ended by loving, will be able to keep himself from <lb/>
            becoming angry straightway, especially if he silently says <lb/>
            to himself when each offence is committed: "I have done <lb/>
            this very thing myself." Where, however, will you find so <lb/>
            impartial a judge ? The same man who lusts after every­ <lb/>
            one's wife, and thinks that a woman's belonging to some­ <lb/>
            one else is a sufficient reason for adoring her, will not allow <lb/>
            any one else to look at his own wife. No man expects such <lb/>
            exact fidelity as a traitor: the perjurer himself takes ven­ <lb/>
            geance of him who breaks his word : the pettifogging lawyer <lb/>
            is most indignant at an action being brought against him : <lb/>
            the man who is reckless of his own chastity cannot endure <lb/>
            any attempt upon that of his slaves. We have other men's <lb/>
            vices before our eyes, and our own behind our backs : hence <lb/>
            it is that a father, who is worse than his son, blames the <lb/>
            latter for giving extravagant feasts,1 and disapproves of <note type="footnote"> 1 Tempestiva, beginning before the usual hour. </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            the least sign of luxury in another, although he was wont <lb/>
            to set no bounds to it in his own case ; hence it is that <lb/>
            despots are angry with homicides, and thefts are punished <lb/>
            by those who despoil temples. A great part of mankind <lb/>
            is not angry with sins, but with sinners. Regard to our <lb/>
            own selves1 will make us more moderate, if we inquire of <lb/>
            ourselves :-have we ever committed any crime of this sort ? <lb/>
            have we ever fallen into this kind of error ? is it for our <lb/>
            interest that we should condemn this conduct ?</p>
          <p>XXIX. The greatest remedy for anger is delay: beg <lb/>
            anger to grant you this at the first, not in order that it may <lb/>
            pardon the offence, but that it may form a right judgment <lb/>
            about it: if it delays, it will come to an end. Do not <lb/>
            attempt to quell it all at once, for its first impulses are <lb/>
            fierce; by plucking away its parts we shall remove the <lb/>
            whole. We are made angry by some things which we <lb/>
            learn at second-hand, and by some which we ourselves <lb/>
            hear or see. Now, we ought to be slow to believe what <lb/>
            is told us. Many tell lies in order to deceive us, and <lb/>
            many because they are themselves deceived. Some seek <lb/>
            to win our favour by false accusations, and invent wrongs <lb/>
            in order that they may appear angry at our having <lb/>
            suffered them. One man lies out of spite, that he may set <lb/>
            trusting friends at variance; some because they are sus­ <lb/>
            picious,2 and wish to see sport, and watch from a safe dis­ <lb/>
            tance those whom they have set by the ears. If you were <lb/>
            about to give sentence in court about ever so small a sum <lb/>
            of money, you would take nothing as proved without a wit­ <lb/>
            ness, and a witness would count for nothing except on his <lb/>
            oath. You would allow both sides to be heard: you would <lb/>
            allow them time: you would not despatch the matter at one <lb/>
            sitting, because the oftener it is handled the more distinctly <lb/>
            the truth appears. And do you condemn your friend off- <note type="footnote"> 1 Fear of self-condemnation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Lipsius conjectures supprocax, mischievous. </note> <pb n="105"/>

            hand ? Are you angry with him before you hear his story, <lb/>
            before you have cross-examined him, before he can know <lb/>
            either who is his accuser or with what he is charged. Why <lb/>
            then, just now, in the case which you just tried, did you <lb/>
            hear what was said on both sides ? This very man who has <lb/>
            informed against your friend, will say no more if he be <lb/>
            obliged to prove what he says. "You need not," says he, <lb/>
            " bring me forward as a witness ; if I am brought forward <lb/>
            I shall deny what I have said; unless you excuse me from <lb/>
            appearing I shall never tell you anything." At the same <lb/>
            time he spurs you on and withdraws himself from the strife <lb/>
            and battle. The man who will tell you nothing save in <lb/>
            secret hardly tells you anything at all. What can be more <lb/>
            unjust than to believe in secret, and to be angry openly ?</p>
          <p>XXX. Some offences we ourselves witness: in these cases <lb/>
            let us examine the disposition and purpose of the offender. <lb/>
            Perhaps he is a child ; let us pardon his youth, he knows <lb/>
            not whether he is doing wrong : or he is a father; he has <lb/>
            either rendered such great services, as to have won the <lb/>
            right even to wrong us—or perhaps this very act which <lb/>
            offends us is his chief merit: or a woman; well, she <lb/>
            made a mistake. The man did it because he was ordered <lb/>
            to do it. Who but an unjust person can be angry with <lb/>
            what is done under compulsion ? You had hurt him : well, <lb/>
            there is no wrong in suffering the pain which you have been <lb/>
            the first to inflict. Suppose that your opponent is a judge; <lb/>
            then you ought to take his opinion rather than your own : <lb/>
            or that he is a king; then, if he punishes the guilty, yield <lb/>
            to him because he is just, and if he punishes the innocent, <lb/>
            yield to him because he is powerful. Suppose that it is a <lb/>
            dumb animal or as stupid as a dumb animal: then, if you <lb/>
            are angry with it, you will make yourself like it. Sup­ <lb/>
            pose that it is a disease or a misfortune ; it will take less <lb/>
            effect upon you if you bear it quietly : or that it is a god ; <lb/>
            then you waste your time by being angry with him as much <pb n="106"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            as if you prayed him to be angry with some one else. Is it <lb/>
            a good man who has wronged you ? do not believe it: is it a <lb/>
            bad one ? do not be surprised at this ; he will pay to some <lb/>
            one else the penalty which he owes' to you-indeed, by his <lb/>
            sin he has already punished himself.</p>
          <p>XXXI. There are, as I have stated, two cases which <lb/>
            produce anger: first, when we appear to have received an <lb/>
            injury, about which enough has been said, and, secondly, <lb/>
            when we appear to have been treated unjustly : this must <lb/>
            now be discussed. Men think some things unjust because <lb/>
            they ought not to suffer them, and some because they did not <lb/>
            expect to suffer them : we think what is unexpected is be­ <lb/>
            neath our deserts. Consequently, we are especially excited <lb/>
            at what befalls us contrary to our hope and expectation: and <lb/>
            this is why we are irritated at the smallest trifles in our own <lb/>
            domestic affairs, and why we call our friends' carelessness <lb/>
            deliberate injury. How is it, then, asks our opponent, that <lb/>
            we are angered by the injuries inflicted by our enemies ? It <lb/>
            is because we did not expect those particular injuries, or, at <lb/>
            any rate, not on so extensive a scale. This is caused by our <lb/>
            excessive self-love: we think that we ought to remain unin­ <lb/>
            jured even by our enemies: every man bears within his breast <lb/>
            the mind of a despot, and is willing to commit excesses, <lb/>
            but unwilling to submit to them. Thus it is either ignorance <lb/>
            or arrogance that makes us angry: ignorance of common <lb/>
            facts; for what is there to wonder at in bad men committing <lb/>
            evil deeds ? what novelty is there in your enemy hurting you, <lb/>
            your friend quarrelling with you, your son going wrong, or <lb/>
            your servant doing amiss ? Fabius was wont to say that <lb/>
            the most shameful excuse a general could make was " I did <lb/>
            not think." I think it the most shameful excuse that a man <lb/>
            can make. Think of everything, expect everything : even <lb/>
            with men of good character something queer will crop up: <lb/>
            human nature produces minds that are treacherous, ungrate­ <lb/>
            ful, greedy, and impious: when you are considering what any <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXI.] </note> <lb/>
            man's morals may be, think what those of mankind are. <lb/>
            When you are especially enjoying yourself, be especially on <lb/>
            your guard : when everything seems to you to be peaceful, <lb/>
            be sure that mischief is not absent, but only asleep. Always <lb/>
            believe that something will occur to offend you. A pilot <lb/>
            never spreads all his canvas abroad so confidently as not to <lb/>
            keep his tackle for shortening sail ready for use. Think, <lb/>
            above all, how base and hateful is the power of doing mis­ <lb/>
            chief, and how unnatural in man, by whose kindness even <lb/>
            fierce animals are rendered tame. See how bulls yield their <lb/>
            necks to the yoke, how elephants 1 allow boys and women <lb/>
            to dance on their backs unhurt, how snakes glide harmlessly <lb/>
            over our bosoms and among our drinking-cups, how within <lb/>
            their dens bears and lions submit to be handled with com­ <lb/>
            placent mouths, and wild beasts fawn upon their master: let <lb/>
            us blush to have exchanged habits with wild beasts. It is a <lb/>
            crime to injure one's country: so it is, therefore, to injure any <lb/>
            of our countrymen, for he is a part of our country; if the <lb/>
            whole be sacred, the parts must be sacred too. Therefore it <lb/>
            is also a crime to injure any man: for he is your fellow- <lb/>
            citizen in a larger state. What, if the hands were to wish to <lb/>
            hurt the feet ? or the eyes to hurt the hands ? As all the <lb/>
            limbs act in unison, because it is the interest of the whole <lb/>
            body to keep each one of them safe, so men should spare one <lb/>
            another, because they are born for society. The bond of <lb/>
            society, however, cannot exist unless it guards and loves all <lb/>
            its members. We should not even destroy vipers and water- <lb/>
            snakes and other creatures whose teeth and claws are dan­ <lb/>
            gerous, if we were able to tame them as we do other animals, <lb/>
            or to prevent their being a peril to us : neither ought we, <lb/>
            therefore, to hurt a man because he has done wrong, but lest <lb/>
            he should do wrong, and our punishment should always <lb/>
            look to the future, and never to the past, because it is in­ <lb/>
            flicted in a spirit of precaution, not of anger: for if every- <note type="footnote"> I I have adopted the transposition of Haase and Koch. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            one who has a crooked and vicious disposition were to be <lb/>
            punished, no one would escape punishment.</p>
          <p>XXXII. " But anger possesses a certain pleasure of its <lb/>
            own, and it is sweet to pay back the pain you have suffered." <lb/>
            Not at all; it is not honourable to requite injuries by <lb/>
            injuries, in the same way as it is to repay benefits by <lb/>
            benefits. In the latter case it is a shame to be conquered; <lb/>
            in the former it is a shame to conquer. Revenge and <lb/>
            retaliation are words which men use and even think to be <lb/>
            righteous, yet they do not greatly differ from wrong-doing, <lb/>
            except in the order in which they are done: he who <lb/>
            renders pain for pain has more excuse for his sin ; that is all. <lb/>
            Some one who did not know Marcus Cato struck him in the <lb/>
            public bath in his ignorance, for who would knowingly <lb/>
            have done him an injury ? Afterwards when he was <lb/>
            apologizing, Cato replied, " I do not remember being <lb/>
            struck." He thought it better to ignore the insult than to <lb/>
            revenge it. You ask, " Did no harm befall that man for his <lb/>
            insolence ?" No, but rather much good; he made the <lb/>
            acquaintance of Cato. It is the part of a great mind to <lb/>
            despise wrongs done to it; the most contemptuous form of <lb/>
            revenge is not to deem one's adversary worth taking ven­ <lb/>
            geance upon. Many have taken small injuries much more <lb/>
            seriously to heart than they need, by revenging them: that <lb/>
            man is great and noble who like a large wild animal hears <lb/>
            unmoved the tiny curs that bark at him. ■</p>
          <p>XXXIII. " We are treated," says our opponent, " with <lb/>
            more respect if we revenge our injuries." If we make use <lb/>
            of revenge merely as a remedy, let us use it without anger, <lb/>
            and not regard revenge as pleasant, but as useful: yet <lb/>
            often it is better to pretend not to have received an injury <lb/>
            than to avenge it. The wrongs of the powerful must not <lb/>
            only be borne, but borne with a cheerful countenance: they <lb/>
            will repeat the wrong if they think they have inflicted it. <lb/>
            This is the worst trait of minds rendered arrogant by <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            prosperity, they hate those whom they have injured. <lb/>
            Every one knows the saying of the old courtier, who, when <lb/>
            some one asked him how he had achieved the rare distinc­ <lb/>
            tion of living at court till he reached old age, replied, " By <lb/>
            receiving wrongs and returning thanks for them." It is <lb/>
            often so far from expedient to avenge our wrongs, that it <lb/>
            will not do even to admit them. Gaius Caesar, offended at <lb/>
            the smart clothes and well-dressed hair of the son of Pastor, <lb/>
            a distinguished Roman knight, sent him to prison. When <lb/>
            the father begged that his son might suffer no harm, Caius, <lb/>
            as if reminded by this to put him to death, ordered him to <lb/>
            be executed, yet, in order to mitigate his brutality to the <lb/>
            father, invited him that very day to dinner. Pastor came <lb/>
            with a countenance which betrayed no illwill. Caesar <lb/>
            pledged him in a glass of wine, and set a man to watch <lb/>
            him. The wretched creature went through his part, feeling <lb/>
            as though he were drinking his son's blood : the emperor <lb/>
            sent him some perfume and a garland, and gave orders to <lb/>
            watch whether he used them: he did so. On the very day <lb/>
            on which he had buried, nay, on which he had not even <lb/>
            buried his son, he sat down as one of a hundred guests, <lb/>
            and, old and gouty as he was, drank to an extent which <lb/>
            would have been hardly decent on a child's birthday; he <lb/>
            shed no tear the while; he did not permit his grief to <lb/>
            betray itself by the slightest sign; he dined just as though <lb/>
            his entreaties had-gained his son's life. You ask me why <lb/>
            he did so ? he had another son. What did Priam do in <lb/>
            the Iliad ? Did he not conceal his wrath and embrace the <lb/>
            knees of Achilles ? did he not raise to his lips that death- <lb/>
            dealing hand, stained with the blood of his son, and sup <lb/>
            with his slayer ? True! but there were no perfumes and <lb/>
            garlands, and his fierce enemy encouraged him with many <lb/>
            soothing words to eat, not to drain huge goblets with a <lb/>
            guard standing over him to see that he did it. Had he <lb/>
            only feared for himself, the father would have treated the <pb n="110"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            tyrant with scorn: but love for his son quenched his <lb/>
            anger: he deserved the emperor's permission to leave the <lb/>
            banquet and gather up the bones of his son: but, <lb/>
            meanwhile, that kindly and polite youth the emperor <lb/>
            would not even permit him to do this, but tormented the <lb/>
            old man with frequent invitations to drink, advising him <lb/>
            thereby to lighten his sorrows. He, on the other hand, <lb/>
            appeared to be in good spirits, and to have forgotten what <lb/>
            had been done that day : he would have lost his second <lb/>
            son had he proved an unacceptable guest to the murderer <lb/>
            of his eldest.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. We must, therefore, refrain from anger, <lb/>
            whether he who provokes us be on a level with ourselves, <lb/>
            or above us, or below us. A contest with one's equal is of <lb/>
            uncertain issue, with one's superior is folly, and with one's <lb/>
            inferior is contemptible. It is the part of a mean and <lb/>
            wretched man to turn and bite one's biter: even mice and <lb/>
            ants show their teeth if you put your hand to them, <lb/>
            and all feeble creatures think that they are hurt if they are <lb/>
            touched. It will make us milder tempered to call to mind <lb/>
            any services which he with whom we are angry may have <lb/>
            done us, and to let his deserts balance his offence. Let us <lb/>
            also reflect, how much credit the tale of our forgiveness <lb/>
            will confer upon us, how many men may be made into <lb/>
            valuable friends by forgiveness. One of the lessons which <lb/>
            Sulla's cruelty teaches us is not to be angry with the <lb/>
            children of our enemies, whether they be public or private; <lb/>
            for he drove the sons of the proscribed into exile. Nothing <lb/>
            is more unjust than that any one should inherit the quarrels <lb/>
            of his father. Whenever we are loth to pardon any one, <lb/>
            let us think whether it would be to our advantage that all <lb/>
            men should be inexorable. He who refuses to pardon, how <lb/>
            often has he begged it for himself ? how often has he <lb/>
            grovelled at the feet of those whom he spurns from his <lb/>
            own ? How can we gain more glory than by turning anger <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXV.] </note> <lb/>
            into friendship ? what more faithful allies has the Roman <lb/>
            people than those who have been its most unyielding <lb/>
            enemies ? where would the empire be to-day, had not a <lb/>
            wise foresight united the conquered and the conquerors ? <lb/>
            If any one is angry with you, meet his anger by returning <lb/>
            benefits for it: a quarrel which is only taken up on one <lb/>
            side falls to the ground: it takes two men to fight. But1 <lb/>
            suppose that there is an angry struggle on both sides, even <lb/>
            then, he is the better man who first gives way; the winner is <lb/>
            the real loser. He struck you; well then, do you fall back: <lb/>
            if you strike him in turn you will give him both an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity and an excuse for striking you again: you will not be <lb/>
            able to withdraw yourself from the struggle when you please.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Does any one wish to strike his enemy so hard, <lb/>
            as to leave his own hand in the wound, and not to be able <lb/>
            to recover his balance after the blow ? yet such a weapon is <lb/>
            anger: it is scarcely possible to draw it back. We are careful <lb/>
            to choose for ourselves light weapons, handy and manage­ <lb/>
            able swords: shall we not avoid these clumsy, unwieldy,2 <lb/>
            and never-to-be-recalled impulses of the mind ? The only <lb/>
            swiftness of which men approve is that which, when <lb/>
            bidden, checks itself and proceeds no further, and which <lb/>
            can be guided, and reduced from a run to a walk: we know <lb/>
            that the sinews are diseased when they move against our <lb/>
            will. A man must be either aged or weakly who runs <lb/>
            when he wants to walk : let us think that those are the <lb/>
            most powerful and the soundest operations of our minds, <lb/>
            which act under our own control, not at their own caprice. <lb/>
            Nothing, however, will be of so much service as to con­ <lb/>
            sider, first, the hideousness, and, secondly, the danger of <lb/>
            anger. No passion bears a more troubled aspect: it befouls <lb/>
            the fairest face, makes fierce the expression which before <lb/>
            was peaceful. From the angry "all grace has fled; " <note type="footnote"> 1 I adopt Vahlen's reading. See his Preface, p. viii., ed. Jenae, 1879. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I read onerosos with Vahlen. See his Preface, p. viii., ed. Jenae, 1879. </note> <pb n="112"/>

            though their clothing may be fashionable, they will trail it <lb/>
            on the ground and take no heed of their appearance; <lb/>
            though their hair be smoothed down in a comely manner <lb/>
            by nature or art, yet it will bristle up in sympathy with <lb/>
            their mind. The veins become swollen, the breast will be <lb/>
            shaken by quick breathing, the man's neck will be swelled <lb/>
            as he roars forth his frantic talk : then, too, his limbs will <lb/>
            tremble, his hands will be restless, his whole body will sway <lb/>
            hither and thither. What, think you, must be the state of <lb/>
            his mind within him, when its appearance without is so <lb/>
            shocking ? how far more dreadful a countenance he bears <lb/>
            within his own breast, how far keener pride, how much <lb/>
            more violent rage, which will burst him unless it finds <lb/>
            some vent? Let us paint anger looking like those who <lb/>
            are dripping with the blood of foemen or savage beasts, or <lb/>
            those who are just about to slaughter them-like those <lb/>
            monsters of the nether world fabled by the poet to be girt <lb/>
            with serpents and breathing flame, when they sally forth <lb/>
            from hell, most frightful to behold, in order that they may <lb/>
            kindle wars, stir up strife between nations, and overthrow <lb/>
            peace ; let us paint her eyes glowing with fire, her voice <lb/>
            hissing, roaring, grating, and making worse sounds if worse <lb/>
            there be, while she brandishes weapons in both hands, for <lb/>
            she cares not to protect herself, gloomy, stained with blood, <lb/>
            covered with scars and livid with her own blows, reeling <lb/>
            like a maniac, wrapped in a thick cloud, dashing hither <lb/>
            and thither, spreading desolation and panic, loathed by <lb/>
            every one and by herself above all, willing, if otherwise she <lb/>
            cannot hurt her foe, to overthrow alike earth, sea, and <lb/>
            heaven, harmful and hateful at the same time. Or, if we are <lb/>
            to see her, let her be such as our poets have described her­ <lb/>
            " There with her blood-stained scourge Bellona fights, <lb/>
            And Discord in her riven robe delights," 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The lines are from Virgil, Æn. viii. 702, but are inaccurately <lb/>
            quoted. </note> <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            or, if possible, let some even more dreadful aspect be <lb/>
            invented for this dreadful passion.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Some angry people, as Sextius remarks, have <lb/>
            been benefited by looking at the glass: they have been <lb/>
            struck by so great an alteration in their own appearance: <lb/>
            they have been, as it were, brought into their own presence <lb/>
            and have not recognized themselves: yet how small a part <lb/>
            of the real hideousness of anger did that reflected image in <lb/>
            the mirror reproduce? Could the mind be displayed or <lb/>
            made to appear through any substance, we should be <lb/>
            confounded when we beheld how black and stained, how <lb/>
            agitated, distorted, and swollen it looked : even at present <lb/>
            it is very ugly when seen through all the screens of blood, <lb/>
            bones, and so forth : what would it be, were it displayed <lb/>
            uncovered ? You say, that you do not believe that any one <lb/>
            was ever scared out of anger by a mirror : and why not ? <lb/>
            Because when he came to the mirror to change his mind, <lb/>
            he had changed it already: to angry men no face looks <lb/>
            fairer than one that is fierce and savage and such as they <lb/>
            wish to look like. We ought rather to consider, how many <lb/>
            men anger itself has injured. Some in their excessive heat <lb/>
            have burst their veins; some by straining their voices be­ <lb/>
            yond their strength have vomited blood, or have injured <lb/>
            their sight by too violently injecting humours into their <lb/>
            eyes, and have fallen sick when the fit passed off. No way <lb/>
            leads more swiftly to madness : many have, consequently, <lb/>
            remained always in the frenzy of anger, and, having once <lb/>
            lost their reason, have never recovered it. Ajax was driven <lb/>
            mad by anger, and driven to suicide by madness. Men, <lb/>
            frantic with rage, call upon heaven to slay their children, <lb/>
            to reduce themselves to poverty, and to ruin their houses, <lb/>
            and yet declare that they are not either angry or insane, <lb/>
            Enemies to their best friends, dangerous to their nearest <lb/>
            and dearest, regardless of the laws save where they injure, <lb/>
            swayed by the smallest trifles, unwilling to lend their ears <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IV. </note> <lb/>
            to the advice or the services of their friends, they do every­ <lb/>
            thing by main force, and are ready either to fight with <lb/>
            their swords or to throw themselves upon them, for the <lb/>
            greatest of all evils, and one which surpasses all vices, has <lb/>
            gained possession of them. Other passions gain a footing <lb/>
            in the mind by slow degrees: anger's conquest is sudden <lb/>
            and complete, and, moreover, it makes all other passions <lb/>
            subservient to itself. It conquers the warmest love : men <lb/>
            have thrust swords through the bodies of those whom they <lb/>
            loved, and have slain those in whose arms they have lain. <lb/>
            Avarice, that sternest and most rigid of passions, is trampled <lb/>
            underfoot by anger, which forces it to squander its care­ <lb/>
            fully collected wealth and set fire to its house and all its <lb/>
            property in one heap. Why, has not even the ambitious <lb/>
            man been known to fling away the most highly valued <lb/>
            ensigns of rank, and to refuse high office when it was <lb/>
            offered to him ? There is no passion over which anger <lb/>
            does not bear absolute rule.</p>

          <p>w <lb/>
            E will now, my Novatus, attempt to do that which <lb/>
            you so especially long to do, that is, to drive out <lb/>
            anger from our minds, or at all events to curb it and <lb/>
            restrain its impulses. This may sometimes be done openly <lb/>
            and without concealment, when we are only suffering from <lb/>
            a slight attack of this mischief, and at other times it must <lb/>
            be done secretly, when our anger is excessively hot, and when <lb/>
            every obstacle thrown in its way increases it and makes it <lb/>
            blaze higher. It is important to know how great and how <lb/>
            fresh its strength may be, and whether it can be driven for­ <lb/>
            cibly back and suppressed, or whether we must give way to <lb/>
            it until its first storm blow over, lest it sweep away with it <lb/>
            our remedies themselves. We must deal with each case <lb/>
            according to each man's character: some yield to entreaties, <lb/>
            others are rendered arrogant and masterful by submission: <lb/>
            we may frighten some men out of their anger, while some <lb/>
            may be turned from their purpose by reproaches, some by <lb/>
            acknowledging oneself to be in the wrong, some by shame, <lb/>
            and some by delay, a tardy remedy for a hasty disorder, <lb/>
            which we ought only to use when all others have failed : <pb n="116"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BR. V. </note> <lb/>
            for other passions admit of having their case put off, and <lb/>
            may be healed at a later time; but the eager and self­ <lb/>
            destructive violence of anger does not grow up by slow <lb/>
            degrees, but reaches its full height as soon as it begins. <lb/>
            Nor does it, like other vices, merely disturb men's minds, <lb/>
            but it takes them away, and torments them till they are <lb/>
            incapable of restraining themselves and eager for the <lb/>
            common ruin of all men, nor does it rage merely against <lb/>
            its object, but against every obstacle which it encounters <lb/>
            on its way. The other vices move our minds; anger <lb/>
            hurls them headlong. If we are not able to withstand our <lb/>
            passions, yet at any rate our passions ought to stand firm : <lb/>
            but anger grows more and more powerful, like lightning <lb/>
            flashes or hurricanes, or any other things which cannot stop <lb/>
            themselves because they do not proceed along, but fall <lb/>
            from above. Other vices affect our judgment, anger <lb/>
            affects our sanity: others come in mild attacks and grow <lb/>
            unnoticed, but men's minds plunge abruptly into anger. <lb/>
            There is no passion that is more frantic, more destructive <lb/>
            to its own self; it is arrogant if successful, and frantic if <lb/>
            it fails. Even when defeated it does not grow weary, but <lb/>
            if chance places its foe beyond its reach, it turns its teeth <lb/>
            against itself. Its intensity is in no way regulated by its <lb/>
            origin : for it rises to the greatest heights from the most <lb/>
            trivial beginnings.</p>
          <p>II. It passes over no time of life; no race of men is exempt <lb/>
            from it: some nations have been saved from the knowledge <lb/>
            of luxury by the blessing of poverty; some through their <lb/>
            active and wandering habits have escaped from sloth; those <lb/>
            whose manners are unpolished and whose life is rustic <lb/>
            know not chicanery and fraud and all the evils to which <lb/>
            the courts of law give birth : but there is no race which is <lb/>
            not excited by anger, which is equally powerful with <lb/>
            Greeks and barbarians, and is just as ruinous among law­ <lb/>
            abiding folk as among those whose only law is that of the <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            stronger. Finally, the other passions seize upon individuals; <lb/>
            anger is the only one which sometimes possesses a whole <lb/>
            state. No entire people ever fell madly in love with a <lb/>
            woman, nor did any nation ever set its affections altogether <lb/>
            upon gain and profit. Ambition attacks single individuals; <lb/>
            ungovernable rage is the only passion that affects nations. <lb/>
            People often fly into a passion by troops; men and women, <lb/>
            old men and boys, princes and populace all act alike, and <lb/>
            the whole multitude, after being excited by a very few words, <lb/>
            outdoes even its exciter : men betake themselves straight­ <lb/>
            way to fire and sword, and proclaim a war against their <lb/>
            neighbours or wage one against their countrymen. Whole <lb/>
            houses are burned with the entire families which they <lb/>
            contain, and he who but lately was honoured for his <lb/>
            popular eloquence now finds that his speech moves people <lb/>
            to rage. Legions aim their darts at their commander ; the <lb/>
            whole populace quarrels with the nobles; the senate, without <lb/>
            waiting for troops to be levied or appointing a general, <lb/>
            hastily chooses leaders, for its anger chases well-born men <lb/>
            through the houses of Rome, and puts them to death with <lb/>
            its own hand. Ambassadors are outraged, the law of <lb/>
            nations violated, and an unnatural madness seizes the state. <lb/>
            Without allowing time for the general excitement to sub­ <lb/>
            side, fleets are straightway launched and. laden with a <lb/>
            hastily enrolled soldiery. Without organization, without <lb/>
            taking any auspices, the populace rushes into the field guided <lb/>
            only by its own anger, snatches up whatever comes first to <lb/>
            hand by way of arms, and then atones by a great defeat for <lb/>
            the reckless audacity of its anger. This is usually the <lb/>
            fate of savage nations when they plunge into war: as soon <lb/>
            as their easily excited minds are roused by the appearance <lb/>
            of wrong having been done them, they straightway hasten <lb/>
            forth, and, guided only by their wounded feelings, fall like <lb/>
            an avalanche upon our legions, without either discipline, <lb/>
            fear, or precaution, and wilfully seeking for danger. They <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            delight in- being struck, in pressing forward to meet the <lb/>
            blow, writhing their bodies along the weapon, and perishing <lb/>
            by a wound which they themselves make.</p>
          <p>III. " No doubt," you say, " anger is very powerful and <lb/>
            ruinous : point out, therefore, how it may be cured." Yet, <lb/>
            as I stated in my former books, Aristotle stands forth in <lb/>
            defence of anger, and forbids it to be uprooted, saying that <lb/>
            it is the spur of virtue, and that when it is taken away, our <lb/>
            minds become weaponless, and slow to attempt great <lb/>
            exploits. It is therefore essential to prove its unseemliness <lb/>
            and ferocity, and to place distinctly before our eyes how <lb/>
            monstrous a thing it is that one man should rage against <lb/>
            another, with what frantic violence he rushes to destroy alike <lb/>
            himself and his foe, and overthrows those very things whose <lb/>
            fall he himself must share. What, then ? can any one call <lb/>
            this man sane, who, as though caught up by a hurricane, <lb/>
            does not go but is driven, and is the slave of a senseless <lb/>
            disorder ? He does not commit to another the duty of <lb/>
            revenging him, but himself exacts it, raging alike in thought <lb/>
            and deed, butchering those who are dearest to him, and for <lb/>
            whose loss he himself will ere long weep. Will any one give <lb/>
            this passion as an assistant and companion to virtue, <lb/>
            although it disturbs calm reason, without which virtue can <lb/>
            do nothing ? The strength which a sick man owes to a <lb/>
            paroxysm of disease is neither lasting nor wholesome, and <lb/>
            is strong only to its own destruction. You need not, there­ <lb/>
            fore, imagine that I am wasting time over a useless task in <lb/>
            defaming anger, as though men had not made up their <lb/>
            minds about it, when there is some one, and he, too, an <lb/>
            illustrious philosopher, who assigns it services to perform, <lb/>
            and speaks of it as useful and supplying energy for battles, <lb/>
            for the management of business, and indeed for everything <lb/>
            which requires to be conducted with spirit. Lest it should <lb/>
            delude any one into thinking that on certain occasions and <lb/>
            in certain positions it may be useful, we must show its <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            unbridled and frenzied madness, we must restore to it its <lb/>
            attributes, the rack, the cord, the dungeon, and the cross, <lb/>
            the fires lighted round men's buried bodies, the hook 1 that <lb/>
            drags both living men and corpses, the different kinds of <lb/>
            fetters, and of punishments, the mutilations of limbs, the <lb/>
            branding of the forehead, the dens of savage beasts. Anger <lb/>
            should be represented as standing among these her instru­ <lb/>
            ments, growling in an ominous and terrible fashion, herself <lb/>
            more shocking than any of the means by which she gives <lb/>
            vent to her fury.</p>
          <p>IV. There may be some doubt about the others, but at <lb/>
            any rate no passion has a worse look. We have described <lb/>
            the angry man's appearance in our former books, how sharp <lb/>
            and keen he looks, at one time pale as his blood is driven <lb/>
            inwards and backwards, at another with all the heat and fire <lb/>
            of his body directed to his face, making it reddish-coloured <lb/>
            as if stained with blood, his eyes now restless and starting <lb/>
            out of his head, now set motionless in one fixed gaze. Add <lb/>
            to this his teeth, which gnash against one another, as though <lb/>
            he wished to eat somebody, with exactly the sound of a wild <lb/>
            boar sharpening his tusks: add also the cracking of his <lb/>
            joints, the involuntary wringing of his hands, the frequent <lb/>
            slaps he deals himself on the chest, his hurried breathing <lb/>
            and deep-drawn sighs, his reeling body, his abrupt broken <lb/>
            speech, and his trembling lips, which sometimes he draws <lb/>
            tight as he hisses some curse through them. By Hercules, <lb/>
            no wild beast, neither when tortured by hunger, or with a <lb/>
            weapon struck through its vitals, not even when it gathers <lb/>
            its last breath to bite its slayer, looks so shocking as a man <lb/>
            raging with anger. Listen, if you have leisure, to his words <note type="footnote"> 1 The hook alluded to was fastened to the neck of condemned criminals, <lb/>
            and by it they were dragged to the Tiber. Also the bodies of dead <lb/>
            gladiators were thus dragged out of the arena. The hook by which the <lb/>
            dead bull is drawn away at a modern Spanish bull-fight is probably a <lb/>
            survival of this custom. </note> <pb n="120"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            and threats: how dreadful is the language of his agonized <lb/>
            mind! Would not every man wish to lay aside anger <lb/>
            when he sees that it begins by injuring himself ? When <lb/>
            men employ anger as the most powerful of agents, consider <lb/>
            it to be a proof of power, and reckon a speedy revenge <lb/>
            among the greatest blessings of great prosperity, would you <lb/>
            not wish me to warn them that he who is the slave of his <lb/>
            own anger is not powerful, nor even free ? Would you not <lb/>
            wish me to warn all the more industrious and circumspect <lb/>
            of men, that while other evil passions assail the base, anger <lb/>
            gradually obtains dominion over the minds even of learned <lb/>
            and in other respects sensible men ? So true is that, that <lb/>
            some declare anger to be a proof of straight-forwardness, <lb/>
            and it is commonly believed that the best-natured people are <lb/>
            prone to it.</p>
          <p>V. You ask me, whither does all this tend ? To prove, <lb/>
            I answer, that no one should imagine himself to be safe <lb/>
            from anger, seeing that it rouses up even those who are <lb/>
            naturally gentle and quiet to commit savage and violent <lb/>
            acts. As strength of body and assiduous care of the health <lb/>
            avail nothing against a pestilence, which attacks the strong <lb/>
            and weak alike, so also steady and good-humoured people <lb/>
            are just as liable to attacks of anger as those of unsettled <lb/>
            character, and in the case of the former it is both more to. <lb/>
            be ashamed of and more to be feared, because it makes a <lb/>
            greater alteration in their habits. Now as the first thing <lb/>
            is not to be angry, the second to lay aside our anger, and <lb/>
            the third to be able to heal the anger of others as well as <lb/>
            our own, I will set forth first how we may avoid falling <lb/>
            into anger; next, how we may set ourselves free from it, <lb/>
            and, lastly, how we may restrain an angry man, appease his <lb/>
            wrath, and bring him back to his right mind.</p>
          <p>We shall succeed in avoiding anger, if from time to <lb/>
            time we lay before our minds all the vices connected with <lb/>
            anger, and estimate it at its real value: it must be prose- <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            cuted before us and convicted : its evils must be thoroughly <lb/>
            investigated and exposed. That we may see what it is, let <lb/>
            it be compared with the worst vices. Avarice scrapes <lb/>
            together and amasses riches for some better man to use : <lb/>
            anger spends money ; few can indulge in it for nothing. <lb/>
            How many slaves an angry master drives to run away or <lb/>
            to commit suicide ! how much more he loses by his anger <lb/>
            than the value of what he originally became angry about! <lb/>
            Anger brings grief to a father, divorce to a husband, hatred <lb/>
            to a magistrate, failure to a candidate for office. It is <lb/>
            worse than luxury, because luxury enjoys its own pleasure, <lb/>
            while anger enjoys another's pain. It is worse than either <lb/>
            spitefulness or envy; for they wish that some one may <lb/>
            become unhappy, while anger wishes to make him so : they <lb/>
            are pleased when evil befalls one by accident, but anger <lb/>
            cannot wait upon Fortune; it desires to injure its victim <lb/>
            personally, and is not satisfied merely with his being in­ <lb/>
            jured. Nothing is more dangerous than jealousy : it is <lb/>
            produced by anger. Nothing is more ruinous than war: <lb/>
            it is the outcome of powerful men's anger; and even the <lb/>
            anger of humble private persons, though without arms or <lb/>
            armies, is nevertheless war. Moreover, even if we pass <lb/>
            over its immediate consequences, such as heavy losses, <lb/>
            treacherous plots, and the constant anxiety produced by <lb/>
            strife, anger pays a penalty at the same moment that it <lb/>
            exacts one: it forswears human feelings. The latter urge <lb/>
            us to love, anger urges us to hatred: the latter bid us do <lb/>
            men good, anger bids us do them harm. Add to this that, <lb/>
            although its rage arises from an excessive self-respect and <lb/>
            appears to show high spirit, it really is contemptible and <lb/>
            mean : for a man must be inferior to one by whom he <lb/>
            thinks himself despised, whereas the truly great mind, <lb/>
            which takes a true estimate of its own value, does not <lb/>
            revenge an insult because it does not feel it. As weapons <lb/>
            rebound from a hard surface, and solid substances hurt <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            those who strike them, so also no insult can make a really <lb/>
            great mind sensible of its presence, being weaker than that <lb/>
            against which it is aimed. How far more glorious is it to <lb/>
            throw back all wrongs and insults from oneself, like one <lb/>
            wearing armour of proof against all weapons, for revenge <lb/>
            is an admission that we have been hurt. That cannot be a <lb/>
            great mind which is disturbed by injury. He who has <lb/>
            hurt you must be either stronger or weaker than yourself. <lb/>
            If he be weaker, spare him : if he be stronger, spare yourself.</p>
          <p>VI. There is no greater proof of magnanimity than that <lb/>
            nothing which befalls you should be able to move you to <lb/>
            anger. The higher region of the universe, being more <lb/>
            excellently ordered and near to the stars, is never gathered <lb/>
            into clouds, driven about by storms, or whirled round by <lb/>
            cyclones: it is free from all disturbance: the lightnings <lb/>
            flash in the region below it. In like manner a lofty mind, <lb/>
            always placid and dwelling in a serene atmosphere, re­ <lb/>
            straining within itself all the impulses from which anger <lb/>
            springs, is modest, commands respect, and remains calm <lb/>
            and collected : none of which qualities will you find in an <lb/>
            angry man : for who, when under the influence of grief and <lb/>
            rage, does not first get rid of bashfulness ? who, when <lb/>
            excited and confused and about to attack some one, does, <lb/>
            not fling away any habits of shamefacedness he may have <lb/>
            possessed ? what angry man attends to the number or <lb/>
            routine of his duties ? who uses moderate language ? who <lb/>
            keeps any part of his body quiet ? who can guide himself <lb/>
            when in full career ? We shall find much profit in that <lb/>
            sound maxim of Democritus which defines peace of mind <lb/>
            to consist in not labouring much, or too much for our <lb/>
            strength, either in public or private matters. A man's day, <lb/>
            if he is engaged in many various occupations, never passes <lb/>
            so happily that no man or no thing should give rise to some <lb/>
            offence which makes the mind ripe for anger. Just as <lb/>
            when one hurries through the crowded parts of the city <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            one cannot help jostling many people, and one cannot help <lb/>
            slipping at one place, being hindered at another, and <lb/>
            splashed at another, so when one's life is spent in dis­ <lb/>
            connected pursuits and wanderings, one must meet with <lb/>
            many troubles and many accusations. One man deceives <lb/>
            our hopes, another delays their fulfilment, another destroys <lb/>
            them: our projects do not proceed according to our <lb/>
            intention. No one is so favoured by Fortune as to find her <lb/>
            always on his side if he tempts her often: and from this <lb/>
            it follows that he who sees several enterprises turn out <lb/>
            contrary to his wishes becomes dissatisfied with both men <lb/>
            and things, and on the slightest provocation flies into a <lb/>
            rage with people, with undertakings, with places, with <lb/>
            fortune, or with himself. In order, therefore, that the <lb/>
            mind may be at peace, it ought not to be hurried hither and <lb/>
            thither, nor, as I said before, wearied by labour at great <lb/>
            matters, or matters whose attainment is beyond its strength. <lb/>
            It is easy to fit one's shoulder to a light burden, and to <lb/>
            shift it from one side to the other without dropping it: <lb/>
            but we have difficulty in bearing the burdens which others' <lb/>
            hands lay upon us, and when overweighted by them we <lb/>
            fling them off upon our neighbours. Even when we do <lb/>
            stand upright under our load, we nevertheless reel beneath <lb/>
            a weight which is beyond our strength.</p>
          <p>VII. Be assured that the same rule applies both to public <lb/>
            and private life: simple and manageable undertakings pro­ <lb/>
            ceed according to the pleasure of the person in charge of <lb/>
            them, but enormous ones, beyond his capacity to manage, <lb/>
            are not easily undertaken. When he has got them to ad­ <lb/>
            minister, they hinder him, and press hard upon him, and just <lb/>
            as he thinks that success is within his grasp, they collapse, <lb/>
            and carry him with them : thus it comes about that a man's <lb/>
            wishes are often disappointed if he does not apply himself to <lb/>
            easy tasks, yet wishes that the tasks which he undertakes <lb/>
            may be easy. Whenever you would attempt anything, first <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            form an estimate both of your own powers, of the extent of <lb/>
            the matter which you are undertaking, and of the means by <lb/>
            which you are to accomplish it: for if you have to abandon <lb/>
            your work when it is half done, the disappointment will sour <lb/>
            your temper. In such cases, it makes a difference whether one <lb/>
            is of an ardent or of a cold and unenterprising temperament: <lb/>
            for failure will rouse a generous spirit to anger, and will move <lb/>
            a sluggish and dull one to sorrow. Let our undertakings, <lb/>
            therefore, be neither petty nor yet presumptuous and reck­ <lb/>
            less : let our hopes not range far from home : let us attempt <lb/>
            nothing which if we succeed will make us astonished at our <lb/>
            success.</p>
          <p>VIII. Since we know not how to endure an injury, let us <lb/>
            take care not to receive one: we should live with the quietest <lb/>
            and easiest-tempered persons, not with anxious or with <lb/>
            sullen ones: for our own habits are copied from those with <lb/>
            whom we associate, and just as some bodily diseases are com­ <lb/>
            municated by touch, so also the mind transfers its vices to <lb/>
            its neighbours. A drunkard leads even those who reproach <lb/>
            him to grow fond of wine: profligate society will, if per­ <lb/>
            mitted, impair the morals even of robust-minded men : ava­ <lb/>
            rice infects those nearest it with its poison. Virtues do the <lb/>
            same thing in the opposite direction, and improve all those <lb/>
            with whom they are brought in contact: it is as good for one <lb/>
            of unsettled principles to associate with better men than <lb/>
            himself as for an invalid to live in a warm country with a <lb/>
            healthy climate. You will understand how much may be <lb/>
            effected this way, if you observe how even wild beasts grow <lb/>
            tame by dwelling among us, and how no animal, however <lb/>
            ferocious, continues to be wild, if it has long been accustomed <lb/>
            to human companionship: all its savageness becomes <lb/>
            softened, and amid peaceful scenes is gradually forgotten. <lb/>
            We must add to this, that the man who lives with quiet people <lb/>
            is not only improved by their example, but also by the fact <lb/>
            that he finds no reason for anger and does not practise his <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            vice: it will, therefore, be his duty to avoid all those who he <lb/>
            knows will excite his anger. You ask, who these are: many <lb/>
            will bring about the same thing by various means ; a proud <lb/>
            man will offend you by his disdain, a talkative man by his <lb/>
            abuse, an impudent man by his insults, a spiteful man by his <lb/>
            malice, a quarrelsome man by his wrangling, a braggart and <lb/>
            liar by his vain-gloriousness: you will not endure to be <lb/>
            feared by a suspicious man, conquered by an obstinate one, <lb/>
            or scorned by an ultra-refined one : Choose straightforward, <lb/>
            good-natured, steady people, who will not provoke your <lb/>
            wrath, and will bear with it. Those whose dispositions are <lb/>
            yielding, polite and suave, will be of even greater service, <lb/>
            provided they do not flatter, for excessive obsequiousness <lb/>
            irritates bad-tempered men. One of my own friends was a <lb/>
            good man indeed, but too prone to anger, and it was as <lb/>
            dangerous to flatter him as to curse him. Caelius the orator, <lb/>
            it is well known, was the worst-tempered man possible. It <lb/>
            is said that once he was dining in his own chamber with an <lb/>
            especially long-suffering client, but had great difficulty when <lb/>
            thrown thus into a man's society to avoid quarrelling with <lb/>
            him. The other thought it best to agree to whatever he said, <lb/>
            and to play second fiddle, but Caelius could not bear his <lb/>
            obsequious agreement, and exclaimed, " Do contradict me in <lb/>
            something, that there may be two of us!" Yet even he, who <lb/>
            was angry at not being angry, soon recovered his temper, <lb/>
            because he had no one to fight with. If, then, we are conscious <lb/>
            of an irascible disposition, let us especially choose for our <lb/>
            friends those who will look and speak as we do : they will <lb/>
            pamper us and lead us into a bad habit of listening to nothing <lb/>
            that does not please us, but it will be good to give our anger <lb/>
            respite and repose. Even those who are naturally crabbed <lb/>
            and wild will yield to caresses: no creature continues either <lb/>
            angry or frightened if you pat him. Whenever a controversy <lb/>
            seems likely to be longer or more keenly disputed than usual, <lb/>
            let us check its first beginnings, before it gathers strength. <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            A dispute nourishes itself as it proceeds, and takes hold of <lb/>
            those who plunge too deeply into it: it is easier to stand <lb/>
            aloof than to extricate oneself from a struggle.</p>
          <p>IX. Irascible men ought not to meddle with the more <lb/>
            serious class of occupations, or, at any rate, ought to stop <lb/>
            short of weariness in the pursuit of them; their mind ought <lb/>
            not to be engaged upon hard subjects, but handed over to <lb/>
            pleasing arts: let it be softened by reading poetry, and in­ <lb/>
            terested by legendary history: let it be treated with luxury <lb/>
            and refinement. Pythagoras used to calm his troubled spirit <lb/>
            by playing upon the lyre: and who does not know that trum­ <lb/>
            pets and clarions are irritants, just as some airs are lulla­ <lb/>
            bies and soothe the mind ? Green is good for wearied eyes, <lb/>
            and some colours are grateful to weak sight, while the <lb/>
            brightness of others is painful to it. In the same way cheer­ <lb/>
            ful pursuits soothe unhealthy minds. We must avoid law <lb/>
            courts, pleadings, verdicts, and everything else that aggra­ <lb/>
            vates our fault, and we ought no less to avoid bodily weari­ <lb/>
            ness ; for it exhausts all that is quiet and gentle in us, and <lb/>
            rouses bitterness. For this reason those who cannot trust <lb/>
            their digestion, when they are about to transact business of <lb/>
            importance always allay their bile with food, for it is pecu­ <lb/>
            liarly irritated by fatigue, either because it draws the vital <lb/>
            heat into the middle of the body, and injures the blood and <lb/>
            stops its circulation by the clogging of the veins, or else be­ <lb/>
            cause the worn-out and weakened body reacts upon the mind: <lb/>
            this is certainly the reason why those who are broken by ill- <lb/>
            health or age are more irascible than other men. Hunger <lb/>
            also and thirst should be avoided for the same reason; they <lb/>
            exasperate and irritate men's minds : it is an old saying that <lb/>
            " a weary man is quarrelsome " : and so also is a hungry or <lb/>
            a thirsty man, or one who is suffering from any cause what­ <lb/>
            ever : for just as sores pain one at the slightest touch, and <lb/>
            afterwards even at the fear of being touched, so an unsound <lb/>
            mind takes offence at the slightest things, so that even a <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            greeting, a letter, a speech, or a question, provokes some <lb/>
            men to anger.</p>
          <p>X. That which is diseased can never bear to be handled <lb/>
            without complaining: it is best, therefore, to apply remedies <lb/>
            to oneself as soon as we feel that anything is wrong, to allow <lb/>
            oneself as little licence as possible in speech, and to restrain <lb/>
            one's impetuosity : now it is easy to detect the first growth <lb/>
            of our passions: the symptoms precede the disorder. Just <lb/>
            as the signs of storms and rain come before the storms them­ <lb/>
            selves, so there are certain forerunners of anger, love, and <lb/>
            all the storms which torment our minds. Those who suffer <lb/>
            from epilepsy know that the fit is coming on if their ex­ <lb/>
            tremities become cold, their sight fails, their sinews tremble, <lb/>
            their memory deserts them, and their head swims : they <lb/>
            accordingly check the growing disorder by applying the <lb/>
            usual remedies: they try to prevent the loss of their senses <lb/>
            by smelling or tasting some drug; they battle against cold <lb/>
            and stiffness of limbs by hot fomentations; or, if all remedies <lb/>
            fail, they retire apart, and faint where no one sees them fall. <lb/>
            It is useful for a man to understand his disease, and to break <lb/>
            its strength before it becomes developed. Let us see what <lb/>
            it is that especially irritates us. Some men take offence at <lb/>
            insulting words, others at deeds: one wishes his pedigree, <lb/>
            another his person, to be treated with respect. This man <lb/>
            wishes to be considered especially fashionable, that man to <lb/>
            be thought especially learned: one cannot bear pride, another <lb/>
            cannot bear obstinacy. One thinks it beneath him to be <lb/>
            angry with his slaves, another is cruel at home, but gentle <lb/>
            abroad. One imagines that he is proposed for office because <lb/>
            he is unpopular, another thinks himself insulted because he <lb/>
            is not proposed. People do not all take offence in the same <lb/>
            way; you ought then to know what your own weak point is, <lb/>
            that you may guard it with especial care.</p>
          <p>XI. It is better not to see or to hear everything: many <lb/>
            causes of offence may pass by us, most of which are disre- <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            garded by the man who ignores them. Would you not be <lb/>
            irascible ? then be not inquisitive. He who seeks to know <lb/>
            what is said about him, who digs up spiteful tales even if <lb/>
            they were told in secret, is himself the destroyer of his own <lb/>
            peace of mind. Some stories may be so construed as to <lb/>
            appear to be insults : wherefore it is best to put some aside, <lb/>
            to laugh at others, and to pardon others. There are many <lb/>
            ways in which anger may be checked; most things may be <lb/>
            turned into jest. It is said that Socrates when he was given <lb/>
            a box on the ear, merely said that it was a pity a man could <lb/>
            not tell when he ought to wear his helmet out walking. It <lb/>
            does not so much matter how an injury is done, as how it <lb/>
            is borne ; and I do not see how moderation can be hard to <lb/>
            practise, when I know that even despots, though success and <lb/>
            impunity combine to swell their pride, have sometimes re­ <lb/>
            strained their natural ferocity. At any rate, tradition informs <lb/>
            us that once, when a guest in his cups bitterly reproached <lb/>
            Pisistratus, the despot of Athens, for his cruelty, many of <lb/>
            those present offered to lay hands on the traitor, and one <lb/>
            said one thing and one another to kindle his wrath, he bore <lb/>
            it coolly, and replied to those who were egging him on, that <lb/>
            he was no more angry with the man than he should be with <lb/>
            one who ran against him blindfold.</p>
          <p>XII. A large part of mankind manufacture their own <lb/>
            grievances either by entertaining unfounded suspicions or <lb/>
            by exaggerating trifles. Anger often comes to us, but we <lb/>
            often go to it. It ought never to be sent for: even when it <lb/>
            falls in our way it ought to be flung aside. No one says to <lb/>
            himself, " I myself have done or might have done this very <lb/>
            thing which I am angry with another for doing." No one con - <lb/>
            siders the intention of the doer, but merely the thing done : <lb/>
            yet we ought to think about him, and whether he did it <lb/>
            intentionally or accidentally, under compulsion or under a <lb/>
            mistake, whether he did it out of hatred for us, or to gain <lb/>
            something for himself, whether he did it to please himself <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            or to serve a friend. In some cases the age, in others the <lb/>
            worldly fortunes of the culprit may render it humane or ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous to bear with him and put up with what he has <lb/>
            done. Let us put ourselves in the place of him with whom <lb/>
            we are angry: at present an overweening conceit of our own <lb/>
            importance makes us prone to anger, and we are quite willing <lb/>
            to do to others what we cannot endure should be done to our­ <lb/>
            selves. No one will postpone his anger: yet delay is the best <lb/>
            remedy for it, because it allows its first glow to subside, and <lb/>
            gives time for the cloud which darkens the mind either to <lb/>
            disperse or at any rate to become less dense. Of these wrongs <lb/>
            which drive you frantic, some will grow lighter after an inter­ <lb/>
            val, not of a day, but even of an hour: some will vanish alto­ <lb/>
            gether. Even if you gain nothing by your adjournment, still <lb/>
            what you do after it will appear to be the result of mature <lb/>
            deliberation, not of anger. If you want to find out the truth <lb/>
            about anything, commit the task to time : nothing. can be <lb/>
            accurately discerned at a time of disturbance. Plato, when <lb/>
            angry with his slave, could not prevail upon himself to wait, <lb/>
            but straightway ordered him to take off his shirt and present <lb/>
            his shoulders to the blows which he meant to give him with <lb/>
            his own hand : then, when he perceived that he was angry, <lb/>
            he stopped the hand which he had raised in the air, and <lb/>
            stood like one in act to strike. Being asked by a friend who <lb/>
            happened to come in, what he was doing, he answered: " I <lb/>
            am making an angry man expiate his crime." He retained <lb/>
            the posture of one about to give way to passion, as if struck <lb/>
            with astonishment at its being so degrading to a philosopher, <lb/>
            forgetting the slave, because he had found another still more <lb/>
            deserving of punishment. He therefore denied himself the <lb/>
            exercise of authority over his own household, and once, being <lb/>
            rather angry at some fault, said, " Speusippus, will you <lb/>
            please to correct that slave with stripes; for I am in a rage." <lb/>
            He would not strike him, for the very reason for which <lb/>
            another man would have struck him. " I am in a rage," said <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            he; "I should beat him more than I ought: I should take <lb/>
            more pleasure than I ought in doing so: let not that slave <lb/>
            fall into the power of one who is not in his own power." <lb/>
            Can any one wish to grant the power of revenge to an angry <lb/>
            man, when Plato himself gave up his own right to exercise it? <lb/>
            While you are angry, you ought not to be allowed to do any­ <lb/>
            thing. " Why ?" do you ask ? Because when you are angry <lb/>
            there is nothing that you do not wish to be allowed to do.</p>
          <p>XIII. Fight hard with yourself and if you cannot conquer <lb/>
            anger, do not let it conquer you: you have begun to get the <lb/>
            better of it if it does not show itself, if it is not given vent <lb/>
            Let us conceal its symptoms, and as far as possible keep it <lb/>
            secret and hidden. It will give us great trouble to do this, <lb/>
            for it is eager to burst forth, to kindle our eyes and to <lb/>
            transform our face; but if we allow it to show itself in our <lb/>
            outward appearance, it is our master. Let it rather be <lb/>
            locked in the innermost recesses of our breast, and be borne <lb/>
            by us, not bear us: nay, let us replace all its symptoms by <lb/>
            their opposites; let us make our countenance more com­ <lb/>
            posed than usual, our voice milder, our step slower. Our <lb/>
            inward thoughts gradually become influenced by our out­ <lb/>
            ward demeanour. With Socrates it was a sign of anger <lb/>
            when he lowered his voice, and became sparing of speech; <lb/>
            it was evident at such times that he was exercising restraint <lb/>
            over himself. His friends, consequently, used to detect <lb/>
            him acting thus, and convict him of being angry; nor was <lb/>
            he displeased at being charged with concealment of anger; <lb/>
            indeed, how could he help being glad that many men should <lb/>
            perceive his anger, yet that none should feel it F they would, <lb/>
            however, have felt it had not he granted to his friends the <lb/>
            same right of criticizing his own conduct which he himself <lb/>
            assumed over theirs. How much more needful is it for us <lb/>
            to do this P let us beg all our best friends to give us their <lb/>
            opinion with the greatest freedom at the very time when <lb/>
            we can bear it least, and never to be compliant with us <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            when we are angry. While we are in our right senses, <lb/>
            while we are under our own control, let us call for help <lb/>
            against so powerful an evil, and one which we regard with <lb/>
            such unjust favour. Those who cannot carry their wine <lb/>
            discreetly, and fear to be betrayed into some rash and inso­ <lb/>
            lent act, give their slaves orders to take them away from <lb/>
            the banquet when they are drunk; those who know by <lb/>
            experience how unreasonable they are when sick give orders <lb/>
            that no one is to obey them when they are in ill health. It <lb/>
            is best to prepare obstacles beforehand for vices which are <lb/>
            known, and above all things so to tranquilize our mind that <lb/>
            it may bear the most sudden and violent shocks either <lb/>
            without feeling anger, or, if anger be provoked by the extent <lb/>
            of some unexpected wrong, that it may bury it deep, and <lb/>
            not betray its wound. That it is possible to do this will <lb/>
            be seen, if I quote a few of an abundance of examples, from <lb/>
            which we may learn both how much evil there is in anger, <lb/>
            when it exercises entire dominion over men in supreme <lb/>
            power, and how completely it can control itself when over­ <lb/>
            awed by fear.</p>
          <p>XIV. King Cambyses was excessively addicted to wine. <lb/>
            Præxaspes was the only one of his closest friends who ad­ <lb/>
            vised him to drink more sparingly, pointing out how <lb/>
            shameful a thing drunkenness was in a king, upon whom <lb/>
            all eyes and. ears were fixed. Cambyses answered, " That <lb/>
            you may know that I never lose command of myself, I will <lb/>
            presently prove to you that both my eyes and my hands are <lb/>
            fit for service after I have been drinking.'-' Hereupon he <lb/>
            drank more freely than usual, using larger cups, and when. <lb/>
            heavy and besotted with wine ordered his reprover's son to <lb/>
            go beyond the threshold and stand there with his left hand <lb/>
            raised above his head; then he bent his bow and pierced <lb/>
            the youth's heart, at which he had said that he aimed. He <note type="footnote"> 1 Hdt. iii. 34, 35. </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            then had his breast cut open, showed the arrow sticking <lb/>
            exactly into the heart, and, looking at the boy's father, <lb/>
            asked whether his hand was not steady enough. He replied, <lb/>
            that Apollo himself could not have taken better aim. God <lb/>
            confound such a man, a slave in mind, if not in station! <lb/>
            He actually praised an act which he ought not to have en­ <lb/>
            dured to witness. He thought that the breast of his son <lb/>
            being torn assunder, and his heart quivering with its <lb/>
            wound, gave him an opportunity of making a compli­ <lb/>
            mentary speech. He ought to have raised a dispute with <lb/>
            him about his success, and have called for another shot, <lb/>
            that the king might be pleased to prove upon the person <lb/>
            of the father that his hand was even steadier than when he <lb/>
            shot the son. What a savage king ! what a worthy mark <lb/>
            for all his follower's arrows ! Yet though we curse him <lb/>
            for making his banquet end in cruelty and death, still it <lb/>
            was worse to praise that arrow-shot than to shoot it. We <lb/>
            shall see hereafter how a father ought to bear himself <lb/>
            when standing over the corpse of his son, whose murder he <lb/>
            had both caused and witnessed: the matter which we are <lb/>
            now discussing, has been proved, I mean, that anger can <lb/>
            be suppressed. He did not curse the king, he did not so <lb/>
            much as let fall a single inauspicious word, though he felt <lb/>
            his own heart as deeply wounded as that of his son. He <lb/>
            may be said to have done well in choking down his words ; <lb/>
            for though he might have spoken as an angry man, yet he <lb/>
            could not have expressed what he felt as a father. He may, <lb/>
            I repeat, be thought to have behaved with greater wisdom <lb/>
            on that occasion than when he tried to regulate the drink <lb/>
            of one who was better employed in drinking wine than in <lb/>
            drinking blood, and who granted men peace while his hands <lb/>
            were busy with the winecup. He, therefore, added one <lb/>
            more to the number of those who have shown to their <lb/>
            bitter cost how little kings care for their friends' good <lb/>
            advice.</p><pb n="133"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> XV. I have no doubt that Harpagns must have given <lb/>
            some such advice to the king of the Persians and of him­ <lb/>
            self, in anger at which the king placed Harpagns,'s own <lb/>
            children before him on the dinner-table for him to eat, and <lb/>
            asked him from time to time, whether he liked the seasoning. <lb/>
            Then, when he saw that he was satiated with his own misery, <lb/>
            he ordered their heads to be brought to him, and asked him <lb/>
            how he liked his entertainment. The wretched man did <lb/>
            not lose his readiness of speech; his face did not change. <lb/>
            "Every kind of dinner," said he, " is pleasant at the king's <lb/>
            table." What did he gain by this obsequiousness ? He <lb/>
            avoided being invited a second time to dinner, to eat what <lb/>
            was left of them. I do not forbid a father to blame the <lb/>
            act of his king, or to seek for some revenge worthy of so <lb/>
            bloodthirsty a monster, but in the meanwhile I gather <lb/>
            from the tale this fact, that even the anger which arises <lb/>
            from unheard of outrages can be concealed, and forced <lb/>
            into using language which is the very reverse of its mean­ <lb/>
            ing. This way of curbing anger is necessary, at least for <lb/>
            those who have chosen this sort of life and who are ad­ <lb/>
            mitted to dine at a king's table ; this is how they must eat <lb/>
            and drink, this is how they must answer, and how they <lb/>
            must laugh at their own deaths. Whether life is worth <lb/>
            having at such a price, we shall see hereafter; that is <lb/>
            another question. Let us not console so sorry a crew, or <lb/>
            encourage them to submit to the orders of their butchers; <lb/>
            let us point out that however slavish a man's condition <lb/>
            may be, there is always a path to liberty open to him, un­ <lb/>
            less his mind be diseased. It is a man's own fault if he <lb/>
            suffers, when by putting an end to himself he can put an <lb/>
            end to his misery. To him whose king aimed arrows at <lb/>
            the breasts of his friends, and to him whose master gorged <lb/>
            fathers with the hearts of their children, I would say <lb/>
            " Madman, why do you groan P for what are you waiting ? <lb/>
            for some enemy to avenge you by the destruction of your <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            entire nation, or for some powerful king to arrive from a <lb/>
            distant land ? Wherever you turn your eyes you may see <lb/>
            an end to your woes. Do you see that precipice ? down <lb/>
            that lies the road to liberty; do you see that sea that <lb/>
            river ? that well ? Liberty sits at the bottom of them. Do <lb/>
            you see that tree ? stunted, blighted, dried up though it <lb/>
            be, yet liberty hangs from its branches. Do you see your <lb/>
            own throat, your own neck, your own heart ? they are so <lb/>
            many ways of escape from slavery. Are these modes which <lb/>
            I point out too laborious, and needing much strength and <lb/>
            courage? do you ask what path leads to liberty? I <lb/>
            answer, any vein 1 in your body.</p>
          <p>XVI. As long, however, as we find nothing in our life <lb/>
            so unbearable as to drive us to suicide, let us, in whatever <lb/>
            position we may be, set anger far from us : it is destructive <lb/>
            to those who are its slaves. All its rage turns to its own <lb/>
            misery, and authority becomes all the more irksome the <lb/>
            more obstinately it is resisted. It is like a wild animal <lb/>
            whose struggles only pull the noose by which it is caught <lb/>
            tighter ; or like birds who, while Hurriedly trying to shake <lb/>
            themselves free, smear birdlime on to all their feathers. <lb/>
            No yoke is so grievous as not to hurt him who struggles <lb/>
            against it more than him who yields to it: the only way to <lb/>
            alleviate great evils is to endure them and to submit to do <lb/>
            what they compel. This control of our passions, and espe. <lb/>
            daily of this mad and unbridled passion of anger, is useful <lb/>
            to subjects, but still more useful to kings. All is lost when <lb/>
            a man's position enables him to carry out whatever anger <lb/>
            prompts him to do; nor can power long endure if it be <lb/>
            exercised to the injury of many, for it becomes endangered <lb/>
            as soon as common fear draws together those who bewail <lb/>
            themselves separately. Many kings, therefore, have fallen <lb/>
            victims, some to single individuals, others to entire peoples, <note type="footnote"> 1 Seneca's own death, by opening his veins, gives a melancholy in­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            who have been forced by general indignation to make one <lb/>
            man the minister of their wrath. Yet many kings have <lb/>
            indulged their anger as though it were a privilege of <lb/>
            royalty, like Darius, who, after the dethronement of the <lb/>
            Magian, was the first ruler of the Persians and of the <lb/>
            greater part of the East: for when he declared war1 <lb/>
            against the Scythians who bordered on the empire of the <lb/>
            East, Oeobazus, an aged noble, begged that one of his three <lb/>
            sons might be left at home to comfort his father, and that <lb/>
            the king might be satisfied with the services of two of <lb/>
            them. Darius promised him more than he asked for, say­ <lb/>
            ing that he would allow all three to remain at home, and <lb/>
            flung their dead bodies before their father's eyes. He <lb/>
            would have been harsh, had he taken them all to the war <lb/>
            with him. How much more good-natured was Xerxes,2 <lb/>
            who, when Pythias, the father of five sons, begged for one <lb/>
            to be excused from service, permitted him to choose which <lb/>
            he wished for. He then tore the son whom the father had <lb/>
            chosen into two halves, placed one on each side of the <lb/>
            road, and, as it were, purified his army by means of this <lb/>
            propitiatory victim. He therefore had the end which he <lb/>
            deserved, being defeated, and his army scattered far and <lb/>
            wide in utter rout, while he in the midst of it walked <lb/>
            among the corpses of his soldiers, seeing on all sides the <lb/>
            signs of his own overthrow.</p>
          <p>XVII. So ferocious in their anger were those kings <lb/>
            who had no learning, no tincture of polite literature: now <lb/>
            I will show you King Alexander (the Great), fresh from <lb/>
            the lap of Aristotle, who with his own hand while at table <lb/>
            stabbed Clitus, his dearest friend, who had been brought <lb/>
            up with him, because he did not flatter him enough, and <lb/>
            was too slow in transforming himself from a free man and <lb/>
            a Macedonian into a Persian slave. Indeed he shut up <note type="footnote"> 1 Hdt. iv. 84. </note><note type="footnote">2 Hdt. vii. 38, 39. </note> <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK V. </note> <lb/>
            Lysimachus,1 who was no less his friend than Clitus, in a <lb/>
            cage with a lion; yet did this make Lysimachus, who <lb/>
            escaped by some happy chance from the lion's teeth, any <lb/>
            gentler when he became a king ? Why, he mutilated his <lb/>
            own friend, Telesphorus the Rhodian, cutting off his nose <lb/>
            and ears, and kept him for a long while in a den, like <lb/>
            some new and strange animal, after the hideousness of his <lb/>
            hacked and disfigured face had made him no longer appear <lb/>
            to be human, assisted by Starvation and the squalid filth <lb/>
            of a body left to wallow in its own dung ! Besides this, <lb/>
            his hands and knees, which the narrowness of his abode <lb/>
            forced him to use instead of his feet, became hard and <lb/>
            callous, while his sides were covered with sores by rubbing <lb/>
            against the walls, so that his appearance was no less shock­ <lb/>
            ing than frightful, and his punishment turned him into so <lb/>
            monstrous a creature that he was not even pitied. Yet, <lb/>
            however unlike a man he was who suffered this, even more <lb/>
            unlike was he who inflicted it.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Would to heaven that such savagery had con­ <lb/>
            tented itself with foreign examples, and that barbarity in <lb/>
            anger and punishment had not been imported with other <lb/>
            outlandish vices into our Roman manners! Marcus <lb/>
            Marius, to whom the people erected a statue in every <lb/>
            street, to whom they made offerings of incense and wine, <lb/>
            had, by the command of Lucius Sulla, his legs broken, his <lb/>
            eyes pulled out, his hands cut off, and his whole body <lb/>
            gradually torn to pieces limb by limb, as if Sulla killed <lb/>
            him as many times as he wounded him. Who was it <lb/>
            who carried out Sulla's orders ? who but Catiline, already <lb/>
            practising his hands in every sort of wickedness ? He <lb/>
            tore him to pieces before the tomb of Quintus Catulus, an <lb/>
            unwelcome burden to the ashes of that gentlest of men, <lb/>
            above which one who was no doubt a criminal, yet never- <note type="footnote"> 1 Pluto Dem. 27. </note> <pb n="137"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            theless the idol of the people, and who was not undeserv­ <lb/>
            ing of love, although men loved him beyond all reason, was <lb/>
            forced to shed his blood drop by drop. Though Marius <lb/>
            deserved such tortures, yet it was worthy of Sulla to order <lb/>
            them, and of Catiline to execute them; but it was un­ <lb/>
            worthy of the State to be stabbed by the swords of her <lb/>
            enemy and her avenger alike. Why do I pry into ancient <lb/>
            history ? quite lately Gaius Caesar flogged and tortured <lb/>
            Sextus Papinius, whose father was a consular, Betilienus <lb/>
            Bassus, his own quaestor, and several others, both senators <lb/>
            and knights, on the same day, not to carry out any judicial <lb/>
            inquiry, but merely to amuse himself. Indeed, so impa­ <lb/>
            tient was he of any delay in receiving the pleasure which <lb/>
            his monstrous cruelty never delayed in asking, that when <lb/>
            walking with some ladies and senators in his mother's <lb/>
            gardens, along the walk between the colonnade and the <lb/>
            river, he struck off some of their heads by lamplight. <lb/>
            What did he fear ? what public or private danger could <lb/>
            one night threaten him with ? how very small a favour it <lb/>
            would have been to wait until morning, and not to kill the <lb/>
            Roman people's senators in his slippers ?</p>
          <p>XIX. It is to the purpose that we should know how <lb/>
            haughtily his cruelty was exercised, although some one <lb/>
            might suppose that we are wandering from the subject <lb/>
            and embarking on a digression ; but this digression is <lb/>
            itself connected with unusual outbursts of anger. He beat <lb/>
            senators with rods ; he did it so often that he made men <lb/>
            able to say, " It is the custom." He tortured them <lb/>
            with all the most dismal engines in the world, with the <lb/>
            cord, the boots, the rack, the fire, and the sight of his own <lb/>
            face. Even to this we may answer, " To tear three sena­ <lb/>
            tors to pieces with stripes and fire like criminal slaves was <lb/>
            no such great crime for one who had thoughts of butcher­ <lb/>
            ing the entire Senate, who was wont to wish that the <lb/>
            Roman people had but one neck, that he might concentrate <pb n="138"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            into one day and one blow all the wickedness which he <lb/>
            divided among so many places and times. Was there ever <lb/>
            anything so unheard-of as an execution in the night-time ? <lb/>
            Highway robbery seeks for the shelter of darkness, but the <lb/>
            more public an execution is, the more power it has as an <lb/>
            example and lesson. Here I shall be met by: "This, <lb/>
            which you are so surprised at, was the daily habit of that <lb/>
            monster; this was what he lived for, watched for, sat up <lb/>
            at night for." Certainly one could find no one else who <lb/>
            would have ordered all those whom he condemned to death <lb/>
            to have their mouths closed by a sponge being fastened in <lb/>
            them, that they might not have the power even of uttering <lb/>
            a sound. What dying man was ever forbidden to groan ? <lb/>
            He feared that the last agony might find too free a voice, <lb/>
            that he might hear what would displease him. He knew, <lb/>
            moreover, that there were countless crimes, with which <lb/>
            none but a dying man would dare to reproach him. When <lb/>
            sponges were not forthcoming, he ordered the wretched <lb/>
            men's clothes to be torn up, and the rags stuffed into their <lb/>
            mouths. What savagery was this ? Let a man draw his <lb/>
            last breath : give room for his soul to escape through: let <lb/>
            it not be forced to leave the body through a wound. It <lb/>
            becomes tedious to add to this that in the same night he <lb/>
            sent centurions to the houses of the executed men and <lb/>
            made an end of their fathers also, that is to say; being a <lb/>
            compassionate-minded man, he set them free from sorrow: <lb/>
            for it is not my intention to describe the ferocity of Grains, <lb/>
            but the ferocity of anger, which does not merely vent its <lb/>
            rage upon individuals, but rends in pieces whole nations, <lb/>
            and even lashes cities, rivers, and things which have no sense <lb/>
            of pain.</p>
          <p>XX. Thus, the king of the Persians cut off the noses of <lb/>
            a whole nation in Syria, wherefore the place is called Rhino­ <lb/>
            colura. Do you think that he was merciful, because he did <lb/>
            not cut their heads off altogether ? no, he was delighted at <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            having invented a new kind of punishment. Something <lb/>
            of the same kind would have befallen the Æthiopians,1 who <lb/>
            on account of their prodigiously long lives are called Macro­ <lb/>
            biotae; for, because they did not receive slavery with hands <lb/>
            uplifted to heaven in thankfulness, and sent an embassy <lb/>
            which used independent, or what kings call insulting <lb/>
            language, Cambyses became wild with rage, and, without <lb/>
            any store of provisions, or any knowledge of the roads, <lb/>
            started with all his fighting men through an arid and track­ <lb/>
            less waste, where during the first day's march the neces­ <lb/>
            saries of life failed, and the country itself furnished nothing, <lb/>
            being barren and uncultivated, and untrodden by the foot <lb/>
            of man. At first the tenderest parts of leaves and shoots <lb/>
            of trees relieved their hunger, then hides softened by fire, <lb/>
            and anything else that their extremity drove them to use <lb/>
            as food. When as they proceeded neither roots nor herbs <lb/>
            were to be found in the sand, and they found a wilderness <lb/>
            destitute even of animal life, they chose each tenth man by <lb/>
            lot and made of him a meal which was more cruel than <lb/>
            hunger. Rage still drove the king madly forwards, until <lb/>
            after he had lost one part of his army and eaten another <lb/>
            he began to fear that he also might be called upon to draw <lb/>
            the lot for his life; then at last he gave the order for <lb/>
            retreat. Yet all the while his well-bred hawks were not <lb/>
            sacrificed, and the means of feasting were carried for him <lb/>
            on camels, while his soldiers were drawing lots for who <lb/>
            should miserably perish, and who should yet more miser­ <lb/>
            ably live.</p>
          <p>XXI. This man was angry with an unknown and inof­ <lb/>
            fensive nation, which nevertheless was able to feel his <lb/>
            wrath; but Cyrus 2 was angry with a river. When hurry­ <lb/>
            ing to besiege Babylon, since in making war it is above all <lb/>
            things important to seize one's opportunity, he tried to ford <lb/>
            the wide-spread river Gyndes, which it is hardly safe to <note type="footnote"> 1 Hdt. iii. 17, sqq. </note><note type="footnote">2 Hdt. i. 189, 190. </note> <pb n="140"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            attempt even when the river has been dried np by the <lb/>
            summer heat and is at its lowest. Here one of the white <lb/>
            horses which drew the royal chariot was washed away, and <lb/>
            his loss moved the king to such violent rage, that he swore <lb/>
            to reduce the river which had carried off his royal retinue <lb/>
            to so low an ebb that even women should walk across <lb/>
            it and trample upon it. He thereupon devoted all the <lb/>
            resources of his army to this object, and remained working <lb/>
            until by cutting one hundred and eighty channels across <lb/>
            the bed of the river he divided it into three hundred and <lb/>
            sixty brooks, and left the bed dry, the waters flowing <lb/>
            through other channels. Thus he lost time, which is very <lb/>
            important in great operations, and lost, also, the soldiers' <lb/>
            courage, which was broken by useless labour, and the oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of falling upon his enemy unprepared, while he was <lb/>
            waging against the river the war which he had declared <lb/>
            against his foes. This frenzy, for what else can you call it, <lb/>
            has befallen Romans also, for G. Caesar destroyed a most <lb/>
            beautiful villa at Herculaneum because his mother was <lb/>
            once imprisoned in it, and has thus made the place noto­ <lb/>
            rious by its misfortune ; for while it stood, we used to sail <lb/>
            past it without noticing it, but now people inquire why it is <lb/>
            in ruins.</p>
          <p>XXII. These should be regarded as examples to be <lb/>
            avoided, and what I am about to relate, on the contrary, <lb/>
            to be followed, being examples of gentle and lenient con­ <lb/>
            duct in men who both had reasons for anger and power to <lb/>
            avenge themselves. What could have been easier than for <lb/>
            Antigonus to order those two common soldiers to be exe­ <lb/>
            cuted who leaned against their king's tent while doing <lb/>
            what all men especially love to do, and run the greatest <lb/>
            danger by doing, I mean while they spoke evil of their <lb/>
            king. Antigonus heard all they said, as was likely, since <lb/>
            there was only a piece of cloth between the speakers and <lb/>
            the listener, who gently raised it, and said " Go a little <pb n="141"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            further off, for fear the king should hear you." He also on <lb/>
            one night, hearing some of his soldiers invoking every­ <lb/>
            thing that was evil upon their king for having brought <lb/>
            them along that road and into that impassable mud, went <lb/>
            to those who were in the greatest difficulties, and having <lb/>
            extricated them without their knowing who was their <lb/>
            helper, said, " Now curse Antigonus, by whose fault you <lb/>
            have fallen into this trouble, but bless the man who has <lb/>
            brought you out of this slough." This same Antigonus <lb/>
            bore the abuse of his enemies as good-naturedly as that of <lb/>
            his countrymen; thus when he was besieging some Greeks <lb/>
            in a little fort, and they, despising their enemy through <lb/>
            their confidence in the strength of their position, cut many <lb/>
            jokes upon the ugliness of Antigonus, at one time mocking <lb/>
            him for his shortness of stature, at another for his broken <lb/>
            nose, he answered, " I rejoice, and expect some good for­ <lb/>
            tune because I have a Silenus in my camp." After he had <lb/>
            conquered these witty folk by hunger, his treatment of <lb/>
            them was to form regiments of those who were fit for ser­ <lb/>
            vice, and sell the rest by public auction; nor would he, said <lb/>
            he, have done this had it not been better that men who had <lb/>
            such evil tongues should be under the control of a master.</p>
          <p>XXIII. This man's grandson1 was Alexander, who used <lb/>
            to hurl his lance at his guests, who, of the two friends <lb/>
            which I have mentioned above, exposed one to the rage of <lb/>
            a wild beast, and the other to his own; yet of these two <lb/>
            men, he who was exposed to the lion survived. He did not <lb/>
            derive this vice from his grandfather, nor even from his <lb/>
            father; for it was an especial virtue of Philip's to endure <lb/>
            insults patiently, and was a great safeguard of his kingdom. <lb/>
            Demochares, who was surnamed Parrhesiastes on account <lb/>
            of his unbridled and impudent tongue, came on an embassy <lb/>
            to him with other ambassadors from Athens. After gra- <note type="footnote"> 1 A mistake: Antigonus (Monophthalmus) was one of Alexander's <lb/>
            generals. </note> <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            ciously listening to what they had to say, Philip said to <lb/>
            them, " Tell me, what can I do that will please the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians ? " Demochares took him up, and answered, " Hang <lb/>
            yourself." All the bystanders expressed their indignation <lb/>
            at so brutal an answer, but Philip bade them be silent, and <lb/>
            let this Thersites depart safe and sound. " But do you," <lb/>
            said he, " you other ambassadors, tell the Athenians that <lb/>
            those who say such things are much more arrogant than <lb/>
            those who hear them without revenging themselves."</p>
          <p>The late Emperor Augustus also did and said many <lb/>
            memorable things, which prove that he was not under the <lb/>
            dominion of anger. Timagenes, the historical writer, made <lb/>
            some remarks upon him, his wife, and his whole family: <lb/>
            nor did his jests fall to the ground, for nothing spreads <lb/>
            more widely or is more in people's mouths than reckless <lb/>
            wit. Caesar often warned him to be less audacious in his <lb/>
            talk, and as he continued to offend, forbade him his house. <lb/>
            Timagenes after this passed the later years of his life as <lb/>
            the guest of Asinius Pollio, and was the favourite of the <lb/>
            whole city: the closing of Caesar's door did not close any <lb/>
            other door against him. He read aloud the history which <lb/>
            he wrote after this, but burned the books which contained <lb/>
            the doings of Augustus Caesar. He was at enmity with <lb/>
            Caesar, but yet no one feared to be his friend, no one shrank <lb/>
            from him as though he were blasted by lightning: although <lb/>
            he fell from so high a place, yet some one was found to <lb/>
            catch him in his lap. Caesar, I say, bore this with patience, <lb/>
            and was not even irritated by the historian's having laid <lb/>
            violent hands upon his own glories and acts: he never <lb/>
            complained of the man who afforded his enemy shelter, but <lb/>
            merely said to Asinius Pollio " You are keeping a wild <lb/>
            beast: " then, when the other would have excused his con­ <lb/>
            duct, lie stopped him, and said Enjoy, my Pollio, enjoy <lb/>
            his friendship." When Pollio said, " If you order me, <lb/>
            Caesar, I will straightway forbid him my house," he <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXV.] </note> <lb/>
            answered, " Do you think that I am likely to do this, after <lb/>
            having made you friends again ? " for formerly Pollio had <lb/>
            been angry with Timagenes, and ceased to be angry with <lb/>
            him for no other reason than that Caesar began to be so.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Let every one, then, say to himself, whenever he <lb/>
            is provoked, " Am I more powerful than Philip ? yet he <lb/>
            allowed a man to curse him with impunity. Have I more <lb/>
            authority in my own house than the Emperor Augustus <lb/>
            possessed throughout the world ? yet he was satisfied with <lb/>
            leaving the society of his maligner. Why should I make <lb/>
            my slave atone by stripes and manacles for having an­ <lb/>
            swered me too loudly or having put on a stubborn look, <lb/>
            or muttered something which I did not catch F Who am <lb/>
            I, that it should be a crime to shock my ears ? Many men <lb/>
            have forgiven their enemies: shall I not forgive men for <lb/>
            being lazy, careless, and gossipping? " We ought to plead <lb/>
            age as an excuse for children, sex for women, freedom for <lb/>
            a stranger, familiarity for a house-servant. Is this his first <lb/>
            offence? think how long he has been acceptable. Has <lb/>
            he often done wrong, and in many other cases ? then let us <lb/>
            continue to bear what we have borne so long. Is he a <lb/>
            friend ? then he did not intend to do it. Is he an enemy ? <lb/>
            then in doing it he did his duty. If he be a sensible man, <lb/>
            let us believe his excuses; if a fool, let us grant him <lb/>
            pardon; whatever he may be, let us say to ourselves on his <lb/>
            behalf, that even the wisest of men are often in fault, that <lb/>
            no one is so alert that his carefulness never betrays itself, <lb/>
            that no one is of so ripe a judgment that his serious mind <lb/>
            cannot be goaded by circumstances into some hotheaded <lb/>
            action, that, in fine, no one, however much he may fear to <lb/>
            give offence, can help doing so even while he tries to <lb/>
            avoid it.</p>
          <p>XXV. As it is a consolation to a humble man in trouble <lb/>
            that the greatest are subject to reverses of fortune, and a <lb/>
            man weeps more calmly over his dead son in the corner of <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            his hovel if he. sees a piteous 1 funeral proceed out of the <lb/>
            palace as well; so one bears injury or insult more calmly if <lb/>
            one remembers that no power is so great as to be above <lb/>
            the reach of harm. Indeed, if even the wisest do wrong, <lb/>
            who cannot plead a good excuse for his faults ? Let us <lb/>
            look back upon our own youth, and think how often we <lb/>
            then were too slothful in our duty, too impudent in our <lb/>
            speech, too intemperate in our cups. Is any one angry ? <lb/>
            then let us give him enough time to reflect upon what he <lb/>
            has done, and he will correct his own self. But suppose <lb/>
            he ought to pay the penalty of his deeds: well, that is no <lb/>
            reason why we should act as he does. It canot be doubted <lb/>
            that he who regards his tormentor with contempt raises <lb/>
            himself above the common herd and looks down upon <lb/>
            them from a loftier position: it is the property of true <lb/>
            magnanimity not to feel the blows which it may receive. So <lb/>
            does a huge wild beast turn slowly and gaze at yelping curs: <lb/>
            so does the wave dash in vain against a great cliff. The man <lb/>
            who is not angry remains unshaken by injury : he who is <lb/>
            angry has been moved by it. He, however, whom I have <lb/>
            described as being placed too high for any mischief to <lb/>
            reach him, holds as it were the highest good in his arms : he <lb/>
            can reply, not only to any man, but to fortune herself: " Do <lb/>
            what you will, you are too feeble to disturb my serenity: <lb/>
            this is forbidden by reason, to whom I have entrusted the <lb/>
            guidance of my life: to become angry would do me more <lb/>
            harm than your violence can do me. ' More harm ?' say <lb/>
            you. Yes, certainly: I know how much injury you have <lb/>
            done me, but I cannot tell to what excesses anger might <lb/>
            not carry me."</p>
          <p>XXVI. You say, " I cannot endure it: injuries are hard <lb/>
            to bear." You lie; for how can any one not be able to bear <lb/>
            injury, if he can bear to be angry? Besides, what you <note type="footnote"> 1 Acerbum = <foreign xml:lang="grc">άωρον</foreign> ; the funeral of one who has been cut off in the flower <lb/>
            of his youth. </note> <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            intend to do is to endure both injury and anger. Why do <lb/>
            you bear with the delirium of a sick man, or the ravings of <lb/>
            a madman, or the impudent blows of a child ? Because, of <lb/>
            course, they evidently do not know what they are doing: <lb/>
            if a man be not responsible for his actions, what does it <lb/>
            matter by what malady he became so: the plea of ignorance <lb/>
            holds equally good in every case. "What then ?" say you, <lb/>
            "shall he not be punished ? " He will be, even supposing that <lb/>
            you do not wish it: for the greatest punishment for having <lb/>
            done harm is the sense of having done it, and no one is <lb/>
            more severely punished than he who is given over to the <lb/>
            punishment of remorse. In the next place, we ought to con­ <lb/>
            sider the whole state of mankind, in order to pass a just <lb/>
            judgment on all the occurrences of life: for it is unjust <lb/>
            to blame individuals for a vice which is common to all. <lb/>
            The colour of an Æthiop is not remarkable amongs this own <lb/>
            people, nor is any man in Germany ashamed of red hair rolled <lb/>
            into a knot. You cannot call anything peculiar or disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful in a particular man if it is the general characteristic of his <lb/>
            nation. Now, the cases which I have quoted are defended <lb/>
            only by the usage of one out-of-the-way quarter of the world: <lb/>
            see now, how far more deserving of pardon those crimes <lb/>
            are which are spread abroad among all mankind. We all <lb/>
            are hasty and careless, we all are untrustworthy, dissatis­ <lb/>
            fied, and ambitious: nay, why do I try to hide our common <lb/>
            wickedness by a too partial description ? we all are bad. <lb/>
            Every one of us therefore will find in his own breast the <lb/>
            vice which he blames in another. Why do you remark how <lb/>
            pale this man, or how lean that man is ? there is a general <lb/>
            pestilence. Let us therefore be more gentle one to another: <lb/>
            we are bad men, living among bad men: there is only one <lb/>
            thing which can afford us peace, and that is to agree to <lb/>
            forgive one another. " This man has already injured me," <lb/>
            say you, " and I have not yet injured him." No, but you <lb/>
            have probably injured some one else, and you will injure <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            him some day.. Do not form your judgment by one hour, <lb/>
            or one day: consider the whole tendency of your mind: <lb/>
            even though you have done no evil, yet you are capable of <lb/>
            doing it.</p>
          <p>XXVII. How far better is it to heal an injury than to <lb/>
            avenge it ? Revenge takes up much time, and throws <lb/>
            itself in the way of many injuries while it is smarting <lb/>
            under one. We all retain our anger longer than we feel <lb/>
            our hurt: how far better it were to take the opposite <lb/>
            course and not meet one mischief by another. Would any <lb/>
            one think himself to be in his perfect mind if he were to <lb/>
            return kicks to a mule or bites to a dog ? " These crea­ <lb/>
            tures," you say, " know not that they are doing wrong." <lb/>
            Then, in the first place, what an unjust judge you must be <lb/>
            if a man has less chance of gaining your forgiveness than a <lb/>
            beast! Secondly, if animals are protected from your anger by <lb/>
            their want of reason, you ought to treat all foolish men in the <lb/>
            like manner: for if a man has that mental darkness which <lb/>
            excuses all the wrong-doings of dumb animals, what dif­ <lb/>
            ference does it make if in other respects he be unlike a <lb/>
            dumb animal? He has sinned. Well, is this the first time, <lb/>
            or will this be the last time ? Why, you should not believe <lb/>
            him even if he said, " Never will I do so again." He will <lb/>
            sin, and another will sin against him, and all his life he <lb/>
            will wallow in wickedness. Savagery must be met by <lb/>
            kindness: we ought to use, to a man in anger, the argu­ <lb/>
            ment which is so effective with one in grief, that is, <lb/>
            " Shall you leave off this at some time, or never ? If you <lb/>
            will do so at some time, how better is it that you should <lb/>
            abandon anger than that anger should abandon you ? Or, <lb/>
            will this excitement never leave you P Do you see to what <lb/>
            an unquiet life you condemn yourself ? for what will be the <lb/>
            life of one who is always swelling with rage ? " Add to <lb/>
            this, that after you have worked yourself up into a rage, <lb/>
            and have from time to time renewed the causes of your <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            excitement, yet your anger will depart from you of its own <lb/>
            accord, and time will sap its strength: how much better <lb/>
            then is it that it should be overcome by you than by itself ?</p>
          <p>XXVIII. If you are angry, you will quarrel first with <lb/>
            this man, and then with that: first with slaves, then with <lb/>
            freedmen: first with parents, then with children: first <lb/>
            with acquaintances, then with strangers: for there are <lb/>
            grounds for anger in every case, unless your mind steps in <lb/>
            and intercedes with you: your frenzy will drag you from <lb/>
            one place to another, and from thence to elsewhere, your <lb/>
            madness will constantly meet with newly-occurring irritants, <lb/>
            and will never depart from you. Tell me, miserable man, <lb/>
            what time you will have for loving ? 0, what good time you <lb/>
            are wasting on an evil thing! How much better it would be <lb/>
            to win friends, and disarm enemies : to serve the state, or <lb/>
            to busy oneself with one's private affairs, rather than to <lb/>
            cast about for what harm yon can do to somebody, what <lb/>
            wound you can inflict either upon his social position, his <lb/>
            fortune, or his person, although you cannot succeed in <lb/>
            doing so without a struggle and risk to yourself, even if <lb/>
            your antagonist be inferior to you. Even supposing that <lb/>
            he were handed over to you in chains, and that you were at <lb/>
            liberty to torture him as much as you please, yet even then <lb/>
            excessive violence in striking a blow often causes us to dislo­ <lb/>
            cate a joint, or entangles a sinew in the teeth which it has <lb/>
            broken. Anger makes many men cripples, or invalids, even <lb/>
            when it meets with an unresisting victim : and besides this, <lb/>
            no creature is so weak that it can be destroyed without any <lb/>
            danger to its destroyer: sometimes grief, sometimes chance, <lb/>
            puts the weakest on a level with the strongest. What <lb/>
            shall we say of the fact that the greater part of the things <lb/>
            which enrage us are insults, not injuries ? It makes a great <lb/>
            difference whether a man thwarts my wishes or merely <lb/>
            fails to carry them out, whether he robs me or does not <lb/>
            give me anything : yet we count it all the same whether a <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            man takes anything from us or refuses to give anything to <lb/>
            us, whether he extinguishes our hope or defers it, whether <lb/>
            his object be to hinder us or to help himself, whether he <lb/>
            acts out of love for some one or out of hatred for us. <lb/>
            Some men are bound to oppose us not only on the ground <lb/>
            of justice, but of honour: one is defending his father, <lb/>
            another his brother, another his country, another his <lb/>
            friend: yet we do not forgive men for doing what we <lb/>
            should blame them for not doing; nay, though one can <lb/>
            hardly believe it, we often think well of an act, and ill of <lb/>
            the man who did it. But, by Hercules, a great and just <lb/>
            man looks with respect at the bravest of his enemies, and <lb/>
            the most obstinate defender of his freedom and his coun­ <lb/>
            try, and wishes that he had such a man for his own coun­ <lb/>
            tryman and soldier.</p>
          <p>XXIX. It is shameful to hate him whom you praise: <lb/>
            but how much more shameful is it to hate a man for some­ <lb/>
            thing for which he deserves to be pitied ? If a prisoner of <lb/>
            war, who has suddenly been reduced to the condition of a <lb/>
            slave, still retains some remnants of liberty, and does not <lb/>
            run nimbly to perform foul and toilsome tasks, if, having <lb/>
            grown slothful by long rest, he cannot run fast enough to <lb/>
            keep pace with his master's horse or carriage, if sleep over­ <lb/>
            powers him when weary with many days and nights of <lb/>
            watching, if he refuses to undertake farm work, or does not <lb/>
            do it heartily when brought away from the idleness of city <lb/>
            service and put to hard labour, we ought to make a dis­ <lb/>
            tinction between whether a man cannot or will not do it: <lb/>
            we should pardon many slaves, if we began to judge them <lb/>
            before we began to be angry with them : as it is, however, <lb/>
            we obey our first impulse, and then, although we may <lb/>
            prove to have been excited about mere trifles, yet we coin­ <lb/>
            tinue to be angry, lest we should seem to have begun to be <lb/>
            angry without cause; and, most unjust of all, the injustice <lb/>
            of our anger makes us persist in it all the more; for we <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXX.] </note> <lb/>
            nurse it and inflame it, as though to be violently angry <lb/>
            proved our anger to be just.</p>
          <p>XXX. How much better is it to observe how trifling, <lb/>
            how inoffensive are the first beginnings of anger ? You <lb/>
            will see that men are subject to the same influences as <lb/>
            dumb animals: we are put out by trumpery, futile matters. <lb/>
            Bulls are excited by red colour, the asp raises its head at a <lb/>
            shadow, bears or lions are irritated at the shaking of a rag, <lb/>
            and all creatures who are naturally fierce and wild are <lb/>
            alarmed at trifles. The same thing befalls men both of <lb/>
            restless and of sluggish disposition; they are seized by <lb/>
            suspicions, sometimes to such an extent that they call <lb/>
            slight benefits injuries: and these form the most common <lb/>
            and certainly the most bitter subject for anger: for we <lb/>
            become angry with our dearest friends for having bestowed <lb/>
            less upon us than we. expected, and less than others have <lb/>
            received from them: yet there is a remedy at hand for both <lb/>
            these grievances. Has he favoured our rival more than <lb/>
            ourselves ? then let us enjoy what we have without making <lb/>
            any comparisons. A man will never be well off to whom it is <lb/>
            a torture to see any one better off than himself. Have I <lb/>
            less than I hoped for ? well, perhaps I hoped for more than <lb/>
            I ought. This it is against which we ought to be espe­ <lb/>
            cially on our guard: from hence arises the most destruc­ <lb/>
            tive anger, sparing nothing, not even the holiest. The <lb/>
            Emperor Julius was not stabbed by so many enemies as by <lb/>
            friends whose insatiable hopes he had not satisfied. He <lb/>
            was willing enough to do so, for no one ever made a more <lb/>
            generous use of victory, of whose fruits he kept nothing <lb/>
            for himself save the power of distributing them ; but how <lb/>
            could he glut such unconscionable appetites, when each man <lb/>
            coveted as much as any one man could possess ? This was <lb/>
            why he saw his fellow-soldiers standing round his chair <lb/>
            with drawn swords, Tillius Cimber, though he had a <lb/>
            short time before been the keenest defender of his party, <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            and others who only became Pompeians after Pompeius was <lb/>
            dead. This it is which has turned the arms of kings <lb/>
            against them, and made their trustiest followers meditate <lb/>
            the death of him for whom and before whom1 they once <lb/>
            would have been glad to die.</p>
          <p>XXXI. No man is satisfied with his own lot if he fixes his <lb/>
            attention on that of another: and this leads to our being <lb/>
            angry even with the gods, because somebody precedes us, <lb/>
            though we forget of how many we take precedence, and that <lb/>
            when a man envies few people, he must be followed in the <lb/>
            background by a huge crowd of people who envy him. <lb/>
            Yet so churlish is human nature, that, however much men <lb/>
            may have received, they think themselves wronged if they <lb/>
            are able to receive still more. " He gave me the praetorship. <lb/>
            Yes, but I had hoped for the consulship. He bestowed the <lb/>
            twelve axes upon me: true, but he did not make me a <lb/>
            regular 2 consul. He allowed me to give my name to the <lb/>
            year, but he did not help me to the priesthood. I have <lb/>
            been elected a member of the college : but why only of one P <lb/>
            He has bestowed upon me every honour that the state <lb/>
            affords : yes, but he has added nothing to my private for­ <lb/>
            tune. What he gave me he was obliged to give to some­ <lb/>
            body : he brought out nothing from his own pocket." <lb/>
            Rather than speak thus, thank him for what you have <lb/>
            received : wait for the rest, and be thankful that you are not <lb/>
            yet too full to contain more: there is a pleasure in having <lb/>
            something left to hope for. Are you preferred to every <lb/>
            one? then rejoice at holding the first place in the thoughts <lb/>
            of your friend. Or are many others preferred before you ? <lb/>
            then think how many more are below you than there are <note type="footnote"> 1 In point of time. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Consul ordinarius, a regular consul, one who administered in office <lb/>

            above you. Do you ask, what is your greatest fault ? It <lb/>
            is, that you keep your accounts wrongly: you set a high <lb/>
            value upon what you give, and a low one upon what you <lb/>
            receive.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Let different qualities in different people keep <lb/>
            us from quarrelling with them : let us fear to be angry with <lb/>
            some, feel ashamed of being angry with others, and disdain <lb/>
            to be angry with others. We do a fine thing, indeed, when <lb/>
            we send a wretched slave to the workhouse! Why are <lb/>
            we in such a hurry to flog him at once, to break his <lb/>
            legs straightway? we shall not lose our boasted power <lb/>
            if we defer its exercise. Let us wait for the time when <lb/>
            we ourselves can give orders: at present we speak under <lb/>
            constraint from anger. When it has passed away we <lb/>
            shall see what amount of damage has been done; for <lb/>
            this is what we are especially liable to make mistakes <lb/>
            about: we use the sword, and capital punishment, and we <lb/>
            appoint chains, imprisonment, and starvation to punish <lb/>
            a crime which deserves only flogging with a light scourge. <lb/>
            "In what way," say you, "do you bid us look at those <lb/>
            things by which we think ourselves injured, that we may <lb/>
            see how paltry, pitiful, and childish they are ? " Of all <lb/>
            things I would charge you to take to yourself a magnani­ <lb/>
            mous spirit, and behold how low and sordid all these matters <lb/>
            are about which we squabble and run to and fro till we are <lb/>
            out of breath; to any one who entertains any lofty and <lb/>
            magnificent ideas, they are not worthy of a thought.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The greatest hullabaloo is about money: this it <lb/>
            is which wearies out the law-courts, sows strife between father <lb/>
            and son, concocts poisons, and gives swords to murderers <lb/>
            just as to soldiers: it is stained with our blood: on account of <lb/>
            it husbands and wives wrangle all night long, crowds press <lb/>
            round the bench of magistrates, kings rage and plunder, <lb/>
            and overthrow communities which it has taken the labour <lb/>
            of centuries to build, that they may seek for gold and <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            silver in the ashes of their cities. Do you like to look at <lb/>
            your money-bags lying in the corner ? it is for these that <lb/>
            men shout till their eyes start from their heads, that the <lb/>
            law-courts ring with the din of trials, and that jurymen <lb/>
            brought from great distances sit to decide which man's <lb/>
            covetousness is the more equitable. What shall we say if <lb/>
            it be not even for a bag of money, but for a handful of <lb/>
            coppers or a shilling scored up by a slave that some old man, <lb/>
            soon to die without an heir, bursts with rage ? what if <lb/>
            it be an invalid money-lender whose feet are distorted by <lb/>
            the gout, and who can no longer use his hands to count <lb/>
            with, who calls for his interest of one thousandth a month,t <lb/>
            and by his sureties demands his pence even during the <lb/>
            paroxysms of his disease ? If you were to bring to me all <lb/>
            the money from all our mines, which we are at this moment <lb/>
            sinking, if you were'to bring to-night all that is concealed <lb/>
            in hoards, where avarice returns money to the earth from, <lb/>
            whence it came, and pity that it ever was dug out-all that <lb/>
            mass I should not think worthy to cause a wrinkle on the <lb/>
            brow of a good man. What ridicule those things deserve <lb/>
            which bring tears into our eyes !</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Come now, let us enumerate the other causes <lb/>
            of anger: they are food, drink, and the showy apparatus <lb/>
            connected with them, words, insults, disrespectful move­ <lb/>
            ments of the body, suspicions, obstinate cattle, lazy slaves, <lb/>
            and spiteful construction put upon other men's words, <lb/>
            so that even the gift of language to mankind becomes <lb/>
            reckoned among the wrongs of nature. Believe me, the <lb/>
            things which cause us such great heat are trifles, the sort <lb/>
            of things that chilren fight and squabble over : there is <lb/>
            nothing serious, nothing important in all that we do with <lb/>
            such gloomy faces. It is, I repeat, the setting a great value <lb/>
            on trifles that is the cause of your anger and madness. This <note type="footnote"> 1 It seems inconceivable that so small an interest, 1⅕ per cent. per an., <lb/>
            can be meant. </note> <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXV.] </note> <lb/>
            man wanted to rob me of my inheritance, that one has brought <lb/>
            a charge against me before persons1 whom I had long courted <lb/>
            with great expectations, that one has coveted my mistress. <lb/>
            A wish for the same things, which ought to have been a bond <lb/>
            of friendship, becomes a source of quarrels and hatred. A <lb/>
            narrow path causes quarrels among those who pass up and <lb/>
            down it; a wide and broadly spread road may be used by <lb/>
            whole tribes without jostling. Those objects of desire of <lb/>
            yours cause strife and disputes among those who covet the <lb/>
            same things, because they are petty, and cannot be given <lb/>
            to one man without being taken away from another.</p>
          <p>XXXV. You are indignant at being answered back by <lb/>
            your slave, your freedman, your wife, or your client: and <lb/>
            then you complain of the state having lost the freedom <lb/>
            which you have destroyed in your own house : then again <lb/>
            if he is silent when you question him, you call it sullen <lb/>
            obstinacy. Let him both speak and be silent, and laugh <lb/>
            too. " In the presence of his master ? " you ask. Nay, say <lb/>
            rather " in the presence of the house-father." Why do <lb/>
            you shout ? why do you storm ? why do you in the middle <lb/>
            of dinner call for a whip, because the slaves are talking, <lb/>
            because a crowd as large as a public meeting is not as <lb/>
            silent as the wilderness? You have ears, not merely that <lb/>
            you may listen to musical sounds, softly and sweetly drawn <lb/>
            out and harmonized : you ought to hear laughter and weep­ <lb/>
            ing, coaxing and quarrelling, joy and sorrow, the human <lb/>
            voice and the roaring and barking of animals. Miserable <lb/>
            one ! why do you shudder at the noise of a slave, at the <lb/>
            rattling of brass or the banging of a door ? you cannot <lb/>
            help hearing the thunder, however refined you may be. <lb/>
            You may apply these remarks about your ears with equal <lb/>
            truth to your eyes, which are just as dainty, if they <lb/>
            have been badly schooled: they are shocked at stains and <note type="footnote"> 1 Captatis, Madvig. Adv. II. 394. </note> <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            dirt, at silver plate which is not sufficiently bright, or at a <lb/>
            pool whose water is not clear down to the bottom. Those <lb/>
            same eyes which can only endure to see the most variegated <lb/>
            marble, and that which has just been scoured bright, which <lb/>
            will look at no table whose wood is not marked with a net­ <lb/>
            work of veining, and which at home are loth to tread upon <lb/>
            anything that is not more precious than gold, will, when <lb/>
            out of doors, gaze most calmly upon rough and miry paths, <lb/>
            will see unmoved that the greater number of persons that <lb/>
            meet them are shabbily dressed, and that the walls of the <lb/>
            houses are rotten, full of cracks, and uneven. What, then, <lb/>
            can be the reason that they are not distressed out of doors <lb/>
            by sights which would shock them in their own home, un­ <lb/>
            less it be that their temper is placid and long-suffering in <lb/>
            one case, sulky and fault-finding in the other ?</p>
          <p>XXXVI. All our senses should be educated into strength: <lb/>
            they are naturally able to endure much, provided that the <lb/>
            spirit forbears to spoil them. The spirit ought to be <lb/>
            brought up for examination daily. It was the custom of <lb/>
            Sextius when the day was over, and he had betaken him­ <lb/>
            self to rest, to inquire of his spirit: " What bad habit of <lb/>
            yours have you cured to-day F what vice have you checked ? <lb/>
            in what respect are you better? " Anger will cease, and <lb/>
            become more gentle, if it knows that every day it will have <lb/>
            to appear before the judgment seat. What can be more <lb/>
            admirable than this fashion of discussing the whole of the <lb/>
            day's events ? how sweet is the sleep which follows this <lb/>
            self-examination ? how, calm, how sound, and careless is it <lb/>
            when our spirit has either received praise or reprimand, <lb/>
            and when our secret inquisitor and censor has made his <lb/>
            report about our morals ? I make use of this privilege, and <lb/>
            daily plead my cause before myself: when the lamp is taken <lb/>
            out of my sight, and my wife, who knows my habit, has <lb/>
            ceased to talk, I pass the whole day in review before myself, <lb/>
            and repeat all that I have said and done: I conceal nothing <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXVII.] </note> <lb/>
            from myself, and omit nothing : for why-should I be afraid <lb/>
            of any of my shortcomings, when it is in my power to say, <lb/>
            " I pardon you this time: see that you never do that any <lb/>
            more ? In that dispute you spoke too contentiously: do not <lb/>
            for the future argue with ignorant people : those who have <lb/>
            never been taught are unwilling to learn. You repri­ <lb/>
            manded that man with more freedom than you ought, and <lb/>
            consequently you have offended him .instead of amending <lb/>
            his ways : in dealing with other cases of the kind, you <lb/>
            should look carefully, not only to the truth of what you <lb/>
            say, but also whether the person to whom you speak can <lb/>
            bear to be told the truth." A good man delights in re­ <lb/>
            ceiving advice: all the worst men are the most impatient <lb/>
            of guidance.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. At the dinner-table some jokes and sayings <lb/>
            intended to give you pain have been directed against you: <lb/>
            avoid feasting with low people. Those who are not modest <lb/>
            even when sober become much more recklessly impudent <lb/>
            after drinking. You have seen your friend in a rage with <lb/>
            the porter of some lawyer or rich man, because he has sent <lb/>
            him back when about to enter, and you yourself on behalf <lb/>
            of your friend have been in a rage with the meanest of <lb/>
            slaves. Would you then be angry with a chained house­ <lb/>
            dog ? Why, even he, after a long bout of barking, becomes <lb/>
            gentle if you offer him food. So draw back and smile; <lb/>
            for the moment your porter fancies himself to be somebody, <lb/>
            because he guards a door which is beset by a crowd of <lb/>
            litigants; for the moment he who sits within is prosperous <lb/>
            and happy, and thinks that a street-door through which it <lb/>
            is hard to gain entrance is the mark of a rich and powerful <lb/>
            man; he knows not that the hardest door of all to open is <lb/>
            that of the prison. Be prepared to submit to much. Is <lb/>
            any one surprised at being cold in winter ? at being sick at <lb/>
            sea ? or at being jostled in the street ? The mind is strong <lb/>
            enough to bear those evils for which it is prepared. When <pb n="156"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            you are not given a sufficiently distinguished place at table <lb/>
            you have begun to be angry with your fellow-guests, with <lb/>
            your host, and with him who is preferred above you. <lb/>
            Idiot! What difference can it make what part of the <lb/>
            couch you rest upon ? Can a cushion give you honour or <lb/>
            take it away? You have looked askance at somebody <lb/>
            because he has spoken slightingly of your talents ; will you <lb/>
            apply this rule to yourself ? If so, Ennius, whose poetry <lb/>
            you do not care for, would have hated you. Hortensius, if <lb/>
            you had found fault with his speeches, would have quar­ <lb/>
            relIed with you, and Cicero, if you had laughed at his <lb/>
            poetry, would have been your enemy. A candidate for <lb/>
            office, will you resent men's votes ?</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Some one has offered you an insult ? Not <lb/>
            a greater one, probably, than was offered to the Stoic phi­ <lb/>
            losopher Diogenes, in whose face an insolent young man <lb/>
            spat just when he was lecturing upon anger. He bore it <lb/>
            mildly and wisely. " I am not angry," said he, " but I am <lb/>
            not sure that I ought not to be angry." Yet how much <lb/>
            better did our Cato behave ? When he was pleading, one <lb/>
            Lentulus, whom our fathers remember as a demagogue <lb/>
            and passionate man, spat all the phlegm he could muster <lb/>
            upon his forehead. Cato wiped his face, and said, " Len­ <lb/>
            tulus, I shall declare to all the world that men are mis­ <lb/>
            taken when they say that you are wanting in cheek."</p>
          <p>XXXIX. We have now succeeded, my Novatus, in pro­ <lb/>
            perly regulating our own minds: they either do not feel <lb/>
            anger or are above it: let us next see how we may soothe <lb/>
            the wrath of others, for we do not only wish to be whole, <lb/>
            but to heal.</p>
          <p>You should not attempt to allay the first burst of anger <lb/>
            by words : it is deaf and frantic : we must give it scope ; <lb/>
            our remedies will only be effective when it slackens. We <lb/>
            do not meddle with men's eyes when they are swollen, <lb/>
            because we should only irritate their hard stiffness by <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XL.] </note> <lb/>
            touching them, nor do we try to cure other diseases when <lb/>
            at their height: the best treatment in the first stage of <lb/>
            illness is rest. " Of how very little value," say you, " is <lb/>
            your remedy, if it appeases anger which is subsiding of its <lb/>
            own accord ? " In the first place, I answer, it makes it <lb/>
            end quicker: in the next, it prevents a relapse. It can <lb/>
            render harmless even the violent impulse which it dares <lb/>
            not soothe: it will put out of the way all weapons which <lb/>
            might be used for revenge : it will pretend to be angry, in <lb/>
            order that its advice may have more weight as coming <lb/>
            from an assistant and comrade in grief. It will invent <lb/>
            delays, and postpone immediate punishment while a greater <lb/>
            one is being sought for : it will use every artifice to give <lb/>
            the man a respite from his frenzy. If his anger be un­ <lb/>
            usually strong, it will inspire him with some irresistible <lb/>
            feeling of shame or of fear: if weak, it will make use of <lb/>
            conversation on amusing or novel subjects, and by play­ <lb/>
            ing upon his curiosity lead him to forget his passion. We <lb/>
            are told that a physician, who was forced to cure the king's <lb/>
            daughter, and could not without using the knife, conveyed <lb/>
            a lancet to her swollen breast concealed under the sponge <lb/>
            with which he was fomenting it.- The same girl, who would <lb/>
            have shrunk from the remedy if he had applied it openly, <lb/>
            bore the pain because she did not expect it. Some diseases <lb/>
            can only be cured by deceit.</p>
          <p>XL. To one class of men you will say, " Beware, lest <lb/>
            your anger give pleasure to your foes : " to the other, <lb/>
            " Beware lest your greatness of mind and the reputation it <lb/>
            bears among most people for strength become impaired. <lb/>
            I myself, by Hercules, am scandalized at your treatment <lb/>
            and am grieved beyond measure, but we must wait for a <lb/>
            proper opportunity. He shall pay for what he has done; <lb/>
            be well assured of that: when you are able you shall return <lb/>
            it to him with interest." To reprove a man when he is <lb/>
            angry is to add to his anger by being angry oneself. You <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            should approach him in different ways and in a compliant <lb/>
            fashion, unless perchance you be so great a personage that <lb/>
            you can quash his anger, as the Emperor Augustus did <lb/>
            when he was dining with Vedius Pollio.1 One of the slaves <lb/>
            had broken a crystal goblet of his : Vedius ordered him <lb/>
            to be led away to die, and that too in no common fashion : <lb/>
            he ordered him to be thrown to feed the muraenae, some <lb/>
            of which fish, of great size, he kept in a tank. Who would <lb/>
            not think that he did this out of luxury ? but it was out of <lb/>
            cruelty. The boy slipped through the hands of those who <lb/>
            tried to seize him, and flung himself at Caesar's feet in <lb/>
            order to beg fornothing more than that he might die in <lb/>
            some different way, and not be eaten. Caesar was shocked <lb/>
            at this novel form of cruelty, and ordered him to be let go, <lb/>
            and, in his place, all the crystal ware which he saw before <lb/>
            him to be broken, and the tank to be filled up. This <lb/>
            was the proper way for Caesar to reprove his friend : <lb/>
            he made a good use of his power. What are you, that <lb/>
            when at dinner you order men to be put to death, and <lb/>
            mangled by an unheard-of form of torture ? Are a man's <lb/>
            bowels to be torn asunder because your cup is broken ? <lb/>
            You must think a great deal of yourself, if even when <lb/>
            the emperor is present you order men to be executed.</p>
          <p>XLI. If any one's power is so great that he can treat <lb/>
            anger with the tone of a superior let him crush it out of <lb/>
            existence, but only if it be of the kind of which I have just <lb/>
            spoken, fierce, inhuman, bloodthirsty, and incurable save <lb/>
            by fear of something more powerful than itself <lb/>
            .... let us give the mind that peace which is given <lb/>
            by constant meditation upon wholesome maxims, by good <lb/>
            actions, and by a mind directed to the pursuit of honour <lb/>
            alone. Let us set our own conscience fully at rest, but <lb/>
            make no efforts to gain credit for ourselves : so long as we <note type="footnote"> 1 See "On Clemency," i. 18, 2. </note> <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XLII.] </note> <lb/>
            deserve well, let us be satisfied, even if we should be ill spoken <lb/>
            of. " But the common herd admires spirited actions, and <lb/>
            bold men are held in honour, while quiet ones are thought to <lb/>
            be indolent." True, at first sight they may appear to be so : <lb/>
            but as soon as the even tenor of their life proves that this <lb/>
            quietude arises not from dullness but from peace of mind, <lb/>
            then that same populace respects and reverences them. <lb/>
            There is, then, nothing useful in that hideous and destruc­ <lb/>
            tive passion of anger, but on the contrary, every kind of <lb/>
            evil, fire and sword. Anger tramples self-restraint under­ <lb/>
            foot, steeps its hands in slaughter, scatters abroad the <lb/>
            limbs of its children: it leaves no place unsoiled by crime, <lb/>
            it has no thoughts of glory, no fears of disgrace, and when <lb/>
            once anger has hardened into hatred, no amendment is <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>XLII. Let us be free from this evil, let us clear our <lb/>
            minds of it, and extirpate root and branch a passion which <lb/>
            grows again wherever the smallest particle of it finds a <lb/>
            resting-place. Let us not moderate anger, but get rid of <lb/>
            it altogether: what can moderation have to do with an <lb/>
            evil habit? We shall succeed in doing this, if only we <lb/>
            exert ourselves. Nothing will be of greater service than <lb/>
            to bear in mind that we are mortal: let each man say to <lb/>
            himself and to his neighbour, " Why should we, as though <lb/>
            we were born to live for ever, waste our tiny span of life in <lb/>
            declaring anger against any one ? why should days, which <lb/>
            we might spend in honourable enjoyment, be misapplied <lb/>
            in grieving and torturing others ? Life is a matter which <lb/>
            does not admit of waste, and we have no spare time to <lb/>
            throw away. Why do we rush into the fray ? why do we <lb/>
            go out of our way to seek disputes ? why do we, forgetful <lb/>
            of the weakness of our nature, undertake mighty feuds, <lb/>
            and, frail though we be, summon up all our strength to <lb/>
            cut down other men ? Ere long, fever or some other bodily <lb/>
            ailment will make us unable to carry on this warfare of <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. V. </note> <lb/>
            hatred which we so implacably wage: death will soon part <lb/>
            the most vigorous pair of combatants. Why do we make <lb/>
            disturbances and spend our lives in rioting ? fate hangs <lb/>
            over our heads, scores up to our account the days as they <lb/>
            pass, and is ever drawing nearer and nearer. The time <lb/>
            which you have marked for the death of another perhaps <lb/>
            includes your own."</p>
          <p>XLIII. Instead of acting thus, why do you not rather <lb/>
            draw together what there is of your short life, and keep it <lb/>
            peaceful for others and for yourself ? why do you not <lb/>
            rather make yourself beloved by every one while you live, <lb/>
            and regretted by every one when you die ? Why do you <lb/>
            wish to tame that man's pride, because he takes too lofty <lb/>
            a tone with you ? why do you try with all your might to <lb/>
            crush that other who snaps and snarls at you, a low and <lb/>
            contemptible wretch, but spiteful and offensive to his <lb/>
            betters ? Master, why are you angry with your slave ? <lb/>
            Slave, why are you angry with your master ? Client, why <lb/>
            are you angry with your patron ? Patron, why are you <lb/>
            angry with your client ? Wait but a little while. See, <lb/>
            here comes death, who will make you all equals. We <lb/>
            often see at a morning performance in the arena a battle <lb/>
            between a bull and a bear, fastened together, in which the <lb/>
            victor, after he has torn the other to pieces, is himself <lb/>
            slain. We do just the same thing: we worry some one <lb/>
            who is connected with us, although the end of both victor <lb/>
            and vanquished is at hand, and that soon. Let us rather <lb/>
            pass the little remnant of our lives in peace and quiet : <lb/>
            may no one loathe us when we lie dead. A quarrel is <lb/>
            often brought to an end by a cry of " Fire ! " in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood, and the appearance of a wild beast parts the <lb/>
            highwayman from the traveller: men have no leisure to <lb/>
            battle with minor evils when menaced by some overpower­ <lb/>
            ing terror. What have we to do with fighting and ambus­ <lb/>
            cades ? do you want anything more than death to befall <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XLIII.] </note> <lb/>
            him with whom you are angry ? well, even though you sit <lb/>
            quiet, he will be sure to die. You waste your pains : you <lb/>
            want to do what is certain to be done. You say, " I do <lb/>
            not wish necessarily to kill him, but to punish him by exile, <lb/>
            or public disgrace, or loss of property." I can more easily <lb/>
            pardon one who wishes to give his enemy a wound than <lb/>
            one who wishes to give him a blister : for the latter is! not <lb/>
            only bad, but petty-minded. Whether you are thinking of <lb/>
            extreme or slighter punishments, how very short is the <lb/>
            time during which either your victim is tortured or you <lb/>
            enjoy an evil pleasure in another's pain ? This breath <lb/>
            that we hold so dear will soon leave us: in the meantime, <lb/>
            while we draw it, while we live among human beings, let <lb/>
            us practise humanity: let us not be a terror or a danger <lb/>
            to any one. Let us keep our tempers in spite of losses, <lb/>
            wrongs, abuse or sarcasm, and let us endure with magna­ <lb/>
            nimity our shortlived troubles : while we are considering <lb/>
            what is due to ourselves, as the saying is, and worrying <lb/>
            ourselves, death will be upon us. <note type="footnote"> M </note></p>

          <p>D <lb/>
            [D I not know, Marcia, that you have as little of a <lb/>
            woman's weakness of mind as of her other vices, and <lb/>
            that your life was regarded as a pattern of antique virtue, <lb/>
            I should not have dared to combat your grief, which is <lb/>
            one that many men fondly nurse and embrace, nor should <lb/>
            I have conceived the hope of persuading you to hold for­ <lb/>
            tune blameless, having to plead for her at such an unfa­ <lb/>
            vorable time, before so partial a judge, and against such <lb/>
            an odious charge. I derive confidence, however, from <lb/>
            the proved strength of your mind, and your virtue, which <lb/>
            has been proved by. a severe test. All men know how <lb/>
            well you behaved towards your father, whom you loved as <lb/>
            dearly as your children in all respects, save that you did not <lb/>
            wish him to survive you : indeed, for all that I know you <lb/>
            may have wished that also: for great affection ventures to <lb/>
            break some of the golden rules of life. You did all that <lb/>
            lay in your power to avert the death of your father, Aulus <lb/>
            Cremutius Cordus ;1 but when it became clear that, sur­ <lb/>
            rounded as he was by the myrmidons of Sejanus, there <lb/>
            was no other way of escape from slavery, you did not <note type="footnote"> 1 See Merivale's " History of the Romans under the Empire," ch. xlv. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            indeed approve of his resolution, but gave up all attempts <lb/>
            to oppose it; you shed tears openly, and choked down your <lb/>
            sobs, yet did not screen them behind a smiling face; and <lb/>
            you did all this in the present century, when not to be <lb/>
            unnatural towards one's parents is considered the height <lb/>
            of filial affection. When the changes of our times gave <lb/>
            you an opportunity, you restored to the use of man that <lb/>
            genius of your father for which he had suffered, and <lb/>
            made him in real truth immortal by publishing as an <lb/>
            eternal memorial of him those books which that bravest of <lb/>
            men had written with his own blood. You have done a <lb/>
            great service to Roman literature: a large part of Cordus's <lb/>
            books had been burned; a great service to posterity, <lb/>
            who will receive a true account of events, which cost <lb/>
            its author so dear; and a great service to himself, whose <lb/>
            memory flourishes and ever will flourish, as long as men <lb/>
            set any value upon the facts of Roman history, as long <lb/>
            as any one lives who wishes to review the deeds of our <lb/>
            fathers, to know what a true Roman was like-one who still <lb/>
            remained unconquered when all other necks were broken in <lb/>
            to receive the yoke of Sejanus, one who was free in every <lb/>
            thought, feeling, and act. By Hercules, the state would <lb/>
            have sustained a great loss if you had not brought him <lb/>
            forth from the oblivion to which his two splendid qualities, <lb/>
            eloquence and independence, had consigned him: he is now <lb/>
            read, is popular, is received into men's hands and bosoms, <lb/>
            and fears no old age: but as for those who butchered him, <lb/>
            before long men will cease to speak even of their crimes, <lb/>
            the only things by which they are remembered. This <lb/>
            greatness of mind in you has forbidden me to take into <lb/>
            consideration your sex or your face, still clouded by the <lb/>
            sorrow by which so many years ago it was suddenly over-. <lb/>
            cast. See; I shall do nothing underhand, nor try to steal <lb/>
            away your sorrows : I have reminded you of old hurts, and <lb/>
            to prove that your present wound may be healed, I have <pb n="164"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            shown you the scar of one which was equally severe. Let <lb/>
            others use soft measures and caresses; I have determined <lb/>
            to do battle with your grief, and I will dry those weary <lb/>
            and exhausted eyes, which already, to tell you the truth, <lb/>
            are weeping more from habit than from sorrow. I will <lb/>
            effect this cure, if possible, with your goodwill: if you <lb/>
            disapprove of my efforts, or dislike them, then you must <lb/>
            continue to hug and fondle the grief which you have <lb/>
            adopted as the survivor of your son. What, I pray you, is <lb/>
            to be the end of it ? All means have been tried in vain : the <lb/>
            consolations of your friends, who are weary of offering <lb/>
            them, and the influence of great men who are related to <lb/>
            you: literature, a taste which your father enjoyed and <lb/>
            which yon have inherited from him, now finds your ears <lb/>
            closed, and affords you but a futile consolation, which <lb/>
            scarcely engages your thoughts for a moment. Even time <lb/>
            itself, nature's greatest remedy, which quiets the most bitter <lb/>
            grief, loses its power with you alone. Three years -have <lb/>
            already passed, and still your grief has lost none of its first <lb/>
            poignancy, but renews and strengthens itself day by day, <lb/>
            and has now dwelt so long with you that it has acquired a <lb/>
            domicile in your mind, and actually thinks that it would <lb/>
            be base to leave it. All vices sink into our whole being, <lb/>
            if we do not crush them before they gain a footing; and in <lb/>
            like manner these sad, pitiable, and discordant feelings end <lb/>
            by feeding upon their own bitterness, until the unhappy <lb/>
            mind takes a sort of morbid delight in grief. I should <lb/>
            have liked, therefore, to have attempted to effect this cure <lb/>
            in the earliest stages of the disorder, before its force was <lb/>
            fully developed; it might have been checked by milder <lb/>
            remedies, but now that it has been confirmed by time it <lb/>
            cannot be beaten without a hard struggle. In like manner, <lb/>
            wounds heal easily when the blood is fresh upon them: <lb/>
            they can then be cleared out and brought to the surface, <lb/>
            and admit of being probed by the .finger: when disease <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            has turned them into malignant ulcers, their cure is more <lb/>
            difficult. I cannot now influence so strong a grief by polite <lb/>
            and mild measures: it must be broken down by force.</p>
          <p>IT. I am aware that all who wish to give any one advice <lb/>
            begin with precepts, and end with examples: but it is <lb/>
            sometimes useful to alter this fashion, for we must deal <lb/>
            differently with different people. Some are guided by <lb/>
            reason, others must be confronted with authority and the <lb/>
            names of celebrated persons, whose brilliancy dazzles their <lb/>
            mind and destroys their power of free judgment. I will <lb/>
            place before your eyes two of the greatest examples be­ <lb/>
            longing to your sex and your century: one, that of a woman <lb/>
            who allowed herself to be entirely carried away by grief; the <lb/>
            other, one who, though afflicted by a like misfortune, and­ <lb/>
            an even greater loss, yet did not allow her sorrows to reign <lb/>
            over her for a very long time, but quickly restored her <lb/>
            mind to its accustomed frame. Octavia and Livia, the <lb/>
            former Augustus's sister, the latter his wife, both lost their <lb/>
            sons when they were young men, and when they were <lb/>
            certain of succeeding to the throne. Octavia lost Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus, whom both his father-in-law and his uncle had <lb/>
            begun to depend upon, and to place upon his shoulders <lb/>
            the weight of the empire-a young man of keen intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and firm character, frugal and moderate in his <lb/>
            desires to an extent which deserved especial admiration in <lb/>
            one so young and so wealthy, strong to endure labour, <lb/>
            averse to indulgence, and able to bear whatever burden his <lb/>
            uncle might choose to lay, or I may say to pile upon his <lb/>
            shoulders. Augustus had well chosen him as a founda­ <lb/>
            tion, for he would not have given way under any weight, <lb/>
            however excessive. His mother never ceased to weep and <lb/>
            sob during her whole life, never endured to listen to <lb/>
            wholesome advice, never even allowed her thoughts to be <lb/>
            diverted from her sorrow. She remained daring her <lb/>
            whole life just as she was during the funeral, with all the <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            strength of her mind intently fixed upon one subject. I <lb/>
            do not say that she lacked the courage to shake off her <lb/>
            grief, but she refused to be comforted, thought that it <lb/>
            would be a second bereavement to lose her tears, and <lb/>
            would not have any portrait of her darling son, nor allow <lb/>
            any allusion to be made to him. She hated all mothers, <lb/>
            and raged against Livia with especial fury, because it <lb/>
            seemed as though the brilliant prospect once in store for <lb/>
            her own child was now transferred to Livia's son. Passing <lb/>
            all her days in darkened rooms and alone, not conversing <lb/>
            even with her brother, she refused to accept the poems <lb/>
            which were composed in memory of Marcellus, and all the <lb/>
            other honours paid him by literature, and closed her ears <lb/>
            against all consolation. She lived buried and hidden from <lb/>
            view, neglecting her accustomed duties, and actually angry <lb/>
            with the excessive splendour of her brother's prosperity, <lb/>
            in which she shared. Though surrounded by her children <lb/>
            and grandchildren, she would not lay aside her mourning <lb/>
            garb, though by retaining it she seemed to put a slight <lb/>
            upon all her relations, in thinking herself bereaved in spite <lb/>
            of their being alive.</p>
          <p>III. Livia lost her son Drusus, who would have been a <lb/>
            great emperor, and was already a great general: he had <lb/>
            marched far into Germany, and had planted the Roman <lb/>
            standards in places where the very existence of the Romans <lb/>
            was hardly known. He died on the march, his very foes <lb/>
            treating him with respect, observing a reciprocal truce, <lb/>
            and not having the heart to wish for what would do them <lb/>
            most service. In addition to his dying thus in his coun­ <lb/>
            try's service, great sorrow for him was expressed by the <lb/>
            citizens, the provinces, and the whole of Italy, through <lb/>
            which his corpse was attended by the people of the free <lb/>
            towns and colonies, who poured out to perform the last sad <lb/>
            offices to him, till it reached Rome in a procession which <lb/>
            resembled a triumph. His mother was not permitted to <pb n="167"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            receive his last kiss and gather the last fond words from his <lb/>
            dying lips: she followed the relics of her Drusus on their <lb/>
            long journey, though every one of the funeral pyres with <lb/>
            which all Italy was glowing seemed to renew her grief, as <lb/>
            though she had lost him so many times. When, however, <lb/>
            she at last laid him in the tomb, she left her sorrow there <lb/>
            with him, and grieved no more than was becoming to a <lb/>
            Caesar or due to a son. She did not cease to make frequent <lb/>
            mention of the name of her Drusus, to set up his portrait <lb/>
            in all places, both public and private, and to speak of him <lb/>
            and listen while others spoke of him with the greatest plea­ <lb/>
            sure : she lived with his memory; which none can embrace <lb/>
            and consort with who has made it painful to himself.l Choose, <lb/>
            therefore, which of these two examples you think the more <lb/>
            commendable: if you prefer to follow the former, you will <lb/>
            remove yourself from the number of the living; you will <lb/>
            shun the sight both of other people's children and of <lb/>
            your own, and even of him whose loss you deplore; you <lb/>
            will be looked upon by mothers as an omen of evil; you <lb/>
            will refuse to take part in honourable, permissible plea­ <lb/>
            sures, thinking them unbecoming for one so afflicted; you <lb/>
            will be loth to linger above ground, and will be especially <lb/>
            angry with your age, because it will not straightway bring <lb/>
            your life abruptly to an end. I here put the best con­ <lb/>
            struction on what is really most contemptible and foreign <lb/>
            to your character. I mean that yon will show yourself <lb/>
            unwilling to live, and unable to die. If, on the other hand, <lb/>
            showing a milder and better regulated spirit, you try to <lb/>
            follow the example of the latter most exalted lady, you will <lb/>
            not be in misery, nor will you wear your life out with suf­ <lb/>
            fering. Plague on it! what madness this is, to punish <lb/>
            one's self because one is unfortunate, and not to lessen, <lb/>
            but to increase one's ills! You ought to display, in this <note type="footnote"> 1 If it is a pain to dwell upon the thought of lost friends, of course you <lb/>
            do not continually refresh the memory of them by speaking of them. </note> <pb n="168"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            matter also, that decent behaviour and modesty which has <lb/>
            characterised all your life: for there is such a thing as <lb/>
            self-restraint in grief also. You will show more respect for <lb/>
            the youth himself, who well deserves that it should make <lb/>
            you glad to speak and think of him, if you make him able <lb/>
            to meet his mother with a cheerful countenance, even as he <lb/>
            was wont to do when alive.</p>
          <p>IV. I will not invite you to practise the sterner kind of <lb/>
            maxims, nor bid you bear the lot of humanity with more <lb/>
            than human philosophy; neither will I attempt to dry a <lb/>
            mother's eyes on the very day of her son's burial. I will <lb/>
            appear with you before an arbitrator: the matter upon <lb/>
            which we shall join issue is, whether grief ought to be <lb/>
            deep or unceasing. I doubt not that you will prefer the <lb/>
            example of Julia Augusta, who was your intimate friend: <lb/>
            she invites you to follow her method: she, in her first <lb/>
            paroxysm, when grief is especially keen and hard to bear, <lb/>
            betook herself for consolation to Areus, her husband's <lb/>
            teacher in philosophy, and declared that this did her much <lb/>
            good; more good than the thought of the Roman people, <lb/>
            whom she was unwilling to sadden by her mourning; <lb/>
            more than Augustus, who, staggering under the loss of <lb/>
            one of his two chief supporters, ought not to be yet <lb/>
            more bowed down by the sorrow of his relatives; more <lb/>
            even than her son Tiberius, whose affection during that <lb/>
            untimely burial of one for whom whole nations wept <lb/>
            made her feel that she had only lost one member of <lb/>
            her family. This was, I imagine, his introduction to and <lb/>
            grounding in philosophy of a woman peculiarly tenacious <lb/>
            of her own opinion :—" Even to the present day, Julia, as <lb/>
            far as I can ten-and I was your husband's constant com­ <lb/>
            panion, and knew not only what all men were allowed to <lb/>
            know, but all the most secret thoughts of your hearts­ <lb/>
            you have been careful that no one should find anything to <lb/>
            blame in your conduct; not only in matters of importance, <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            but even in trifles you have taken pains to do nothing <lb/>
            which you could wish common fame, that most frank <lb/>
            judge of the acts of princes, to overlook. Nothing, I think, <lb/>
            is more admirable than that those who are in high places <lb/>
            should pardon many shortcomings in others, and have to <lb/>
            ask it for none of their own. So also in this matter of ' <lb/>
            mourning you ought to act up to your maxim of doing <lb/>
            nothing which you could wish undone, or done otherwise.</p>
          <p>V. " In the next place, I pray and beseech you not to be <lb/>
            self-willed and beyond the management of your friends. <lb/>
            You must be aware that none of them know how to behave, <lb/>
            whether to mention Drusus in your presence or not, as they <lb/>
            neither wish to wrong a noble youth by forgetting him, <lb/>
            nor to hurt you by speaking of him. When we leave you <lb/>
            and assemble together by ourselves, we talk freely about <lb/>
            his sayings and doings, treating them with the respect <lb/>
            which they deserve: in your presence deep silence is <lb/>
            observed about him, and thus you lose that greatest of <lb/>
            pleasures, the hearing the praises of your son, which I <lb/>
            doubt not you would be willing to hand down to all future <lb/>
            ages, had you the means of so doing, even at the cost of <lb/>
            your own life. Wherefore endure to listen to, nay, encou­ <lb/>
            rage conversation of which he is the subject, and let your <lb/>
            ears be open to the name and memory of your, son. You <lb/>
            ought not to consider this painful, like those who in such a <lb/>
            case think that part of their misfortune consists in listening <lb/>
            to consolation. As it is, you have altogether run into the <lb/>
            other extreme, and, forgetting the better aspects of your <lb/>
            lot, look only upon its worse side: you pay no attention to <lb/>
            the pleasure you have had in your son's society and your <lb/>
            joyful meetings with him, the sweet caresses of his baby­ <lb/>
            hood, the progress of his education: you fix all your atten­ <lb/>
            tion upon that last scene of all: and to this, as though it <lb/>
            were not shocking enough,'you add every horror you can. <lb/>
            Do not, I implore you, take a perverse pride in appearing <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            the most unhappy of women : and reflect also that there is <lb/>
            no great credit in behaving bravely in times of prosperity, <lb/>
            when life glides easily with a favouring current: neither does <lb/>
            a calm sea and fair wind display the art of the pilot: some <lb/>
            foul weather is wanted to prove his courage. Like him, <lb/>
            then, do not give way, but rather plant yourself firmly, and <lb/>
            endure whatever burden may fall upon you from above, <lb/>
            scared though you may have been at the first roar of the <lb/>
            tempest. There is nothing that fastens such a reproach1 <lb/>
            on Fortune as resignation." After this he points out to <lb/>
            her the son who is yet alive: he points out grandchildren <lb/>
            from the lost one.</p>
          <p>VI. It is your trouble, Marcia, which has been dealt <lb/>
            with here : it is beside your couch of mourning that Areus <lb/>
            has been sitting: change the characters, and it is you <lb/>
            whom he has been consoling. But, on the other hand, <lb/>
            Marcia, suppose that you have sustained a greater loss than <lb/>
            ever mother did before you: see, I am not soothing you or <lb/>
            making light of your misfortune : if fate can be overcome <lb/>
            by tears, let us bring tears to bear upon it: let every day be <lb/>
            passed in mourning, every night be spent in sorrow instead <lb/>
            of sleep : let your breast be torn by your own hands, your <lb/>
            very face attacked by them, and every kind of cruelty be <lb/>
            practised by your grief, if it will profit you. But if the <lb/>
            dead cannot be brought back to life, however much we <lb/>
            may beat our breasts, if destiny remains fixed and im­ <lb/>
            moveable for ever, not to be changed by any sorrow, how­ <lb/>
            ever great, and death does not loose his hold of anything <lb/>
            that he once has taken away, then let our futile grief be <lb/>
            brought to an end. Let us, then, steer our own course, and <lb/>
            no longer allow ourselves to be driven to leeward by the <lb/>
            force of our misfortune. He is a sorry pilot who lets the <lb/>
            waves wring his rudder from his grasp, who leaves the sails <lb/>
            to fly loose, and abandons the ship to the storm: but he who <note type="footnote"> 1 See my note on invidiam, facere alicui in Juv. 15.—J. E. B. MAYOR. </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            boldly grasps the helm and clings to it until the sea closes <lb/>
            over him, deserves praise even though he be shipwrecked.</p>
          <p>VII. " But," say you, " sorrow for the loss of one's own <lb/>
            children is natural." Who denies it? provided it be <lb/>
            reasonable ? for we cannot help feeling a pang, and the <lb/>
            stoutest-hearted of us are cast down not only at the death <lb/>
            of those dearest to us, but even when they leave us on a <lb/>
            journey. Nevertheless, the mourning which public opinion <lb/>
            enjoins is more than nature insists upon. Observe how <lb/>
            intense and yet how brief are the sorrows of dumb animals: <lb/>
            we hear a cow lowing for one or two days, nor do mares <lb/>
            pursue their wild and senseless gallops for longer: wild <lb/>
            beasts after they have tracked their lost cubs throughout <lb/>
            the forest, and often visited their plundered dens, quench <lb/>
            their rage within a short space of time. Birds circle <lb/>
            round their empty nests with loud and piteous cries, yet <lb/>
            almost immediately resume their ordinary flight in silence ; <lb/>
            nor does any creature spend long periods in sorrowing for <lb/>
            the loss of its offspring, except man, who encourages his <lb/>
            own grief, the measure of which depends not upon his <lb/>
            sufferings, but upon his will. You may know that to be <lb/>
            utterly broken down by grief is not natural, by observing <lb/>
            that the same bereavement inflicts a deeper wound upon <lb/>
            women than upon men, upon savages than upon civilised <lb/>
            and cultivated persons, upon the unlearned than upon the <lb/>
            learned: yet those passions which derive their force from <lb/>
            nature are equally powerful in all men : therefore it is <lb/>
            clear that a passion of varying strength cannot be a natural <lb/>
            one. Fire will burn all people equally, male and female, <lb/>
            of every rank and every age : steel will exhibit its cutting <lb/>
            power on all bodies alike: and why ? Because these <lb/>
            things derive their strength from nature, which makes no <lb/>
            distinction of persons. Poverty, grief, and ambition,1 are <note type="footnote"> 1 Koch declares that this cannot be the true reading, and suggests <lb/>
            deminutio, ' degradation.' </note> <pb n="172"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            felt differently by different people, according as they are <lb/>
            influenced by habit: a rooted prejudice about the terrors <lb/>
            of these things, though they are not really to be feared, <lb/>
            makes a man weak and unable to endure them.</p>
          <p>VIII. Moreover, that which depends upon nature is not <lb/>
            weakened by delay, but grief is gradually effaced by time. <lb/>
            However obstinate it may be, though it be daily renewed <lb/>
            and be exasperated by all attempts to soothe it, yet even this <lb/>
            becomes weakened by time, which is the most efficient <lb/>
            means of taming its fierceness. You, Marcia, have still a <lb/>
            mighty sorrow abiding with you, nevertheless it already <lb/>
            appears to have become blunted: it is obstinate and <lb/>
            enduring, but not so acute as it was at first: and this also <lb/>
            will be taken from you piecemeal by succeeding years. <lb/>
            Whenever you are engaged in other pursuits your mind <lb/>
            will be relieved from its burden : at present you keep <lb/>
            watch over yourself to prevent this. Yet there is a great <lb/>
            difference between allowing and forcing yourself to grieve. <lb/>
            How much more in accordance with your cultivated taste <lb/>
            it would be to put an end to your mourning instead of <lb/>
            looking for the end to come, and not to wait for the day <lb/>
            when your sorrow shall cease against your will: dismiss it <lb/>
            of your own accord.</p>
          <p>IX. " Why then," you ask, " do we show such per­ <lb/>
            sistence in mourning for our friends, if it be not nature <lb/>
            that bids us do so ? " It is because we never expect that <lb/>
            any evil will befall ourselves before it comes, we will not <lb/>
            be taught by seeing the misfortunes of others that they are <lb/>
            the common inheritance of all men, but imagine that the <lb/>
            path which we have begun to tread is free from them and <lb/>
            less beset by dangers than that of other people. How <lb/>
            many funerals pass our houses ? yet we do not think of <lb/>
            death. How many untimely deaths ? we think only of our <lb/>
            sou's coming of age, of his service in the army, or of his <lb/>
            succession to his father's estate. How many rich men slid- <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            denly sink into poverty before our very eyes, without its <lb/>
            ever occurring to our minds that our own wealth is exposed <lb/>
            to exactly the same risks ? When, therefore, misfortune <lb/>
            befalls us, we cannot help collapsing all the more com­ <lb/>
            pletely, because we are struck as it were unawares : a blow <lb/>
            which has long been foreseen falls much less heavily upon <lb/>
            us. Do you wish to know how completely exposed you <lb/>
            are to every stroke of fate, and that the same shafts which <lb/>
            have transfixed others are whirling around yourself P then <lb/>
            imagine that you are mounting without sufficient armour <lb/>
            to assault some city wall or some strong and lofty position <lb/>
            manned by a great host, expect a wound, and suppose that <lb/>
            all those stones, arrows, and darts which fill the upper air <lb/>
            are aimed at your body : whenever any one falls at your <lb/>
            side or behind your back, exclaim, " Fortune, you will not <lb/>
            outwit me, or catch me confident and heedless: I know <lb/>
            what you are preparing to do: you have struck down <lb/>
            another, but you aimed at me." Who ever looks upon his <lb/>
            own affairs as though he were at the point of death ? which of <lb/>
            us ever dares to think about banishment, want, or mourning ? <lb/>
            who, if advised to meditate upon these subjects, would not <lb/>
            reject the idea, like an evil omen, and bid it depart from <lb/>
            him and alight on the heads of his enemies, or even on <lb/>
            that of his untimely adviser ? "I never thought it would <lb/>
            happen! " How can you think that anything will not <lb/>
            happen, when you know that it may happen to many men, <lb/>
            and has happened to many ? That is a noble verse, and <lb/>
            worthy of a nobler source than the stage :— <lb/>
            " What one hath suffered may befall us all." <lb/>
            That man has lost. his children : you may lose yours. <lb/>
            That man has been convicted: your innocence is in peril. <lb/>
            We are deceived and weakened by this delusion, when we <lb/>
            suffer what we never foresaw that we possibly could suffer: <lb/>
            but by looking forward to the coming of our sorrows we <lb/>
            take the sting out of them when they come.</p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> X. My Marcia, all these adventitious circumstances <lb/>
            which glitter around us, such as children, office in the <lb/>
            state, wealth, large halls, vestibules crowded with clients <lb/>
            seeking vainly for admittance, a noble name, a well-born <lb/>
            or beautiful wife, and every other thing which depends <lb/>
            entirely upon uncertain and changeful fortune, are but <lb/>
            furniture which is not our own, but entrusted to us on loan : <lb/>
            none of these things are given to us outright: the stage of <lb/>
            our lives is adorned with properties gathered from various <lb/>
            sources, and soon to be returned to their several owners : <lb/>
            some of them will be taken away on the first day, some on <lb/>
            the second, and but few will remain till the end. We <lb/>
            have, therefore, no grounds for regarding ourselves with <lb/>
            complacency, as though the things which surround us were <lb/>
            our own: they are only borrowed: we have the use and <lb/>
            enjoyment of them for a time regulated by the lender, <lb/>
            who controls his own gift: it is our duty always to be <lb/>
            able to lay our hands upon what has been lent us with <lb/>
            no fixed date for its return, and to restore it when called <lb/>
            upon without a murmur: the most detestable kind of <lb/>
            debtor is he who rails at his creditor. Hence all our rela­ <lb/>
            tives, both those who by the order of their birth we hope <lb/>
            will outlive ourselves, and those who themselves most <lb/>
            properly wish to die before us, ought to be loved by us as <lb/>
            persons whom we cannot be sure of having with us for ever, <lb/>
            nor even for long. We ought frequently to remind our­ <lb/>
            selves that we must love the things of this life as we would <lb/>
            what is shortly to leave us, or indeed in the very act of <lb/>
            leaving us. Whatever gift Fortune bestows upon a man, <lb/>
            let him think while he enjoys it, that it will prove as fickle <lb/>
            as the goddess from whom it came. Snatch what pleasure <lb/>
            you can from your children, allow your children in their <lb/>
            turn to take pleasure in your society, and drain every <lb/>
            pleasure to the dregs without any delay. We cannot <lb/>
            reckon on to-night, nay, I have allowed too long a delay, <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            we cannot reckon on this hour: we must make haste: <lb/>
            the enemy presses on behind us : soon that society of yours <lb/>
            will be broken up, that pleasant company will be taken by <lb/>
            assault and dispersed. Pillage is the universal law : uu­ <lb/>
            happy creatures, know you not that life is but a flight ? <lb/>
            If you grieve for the death of your son, the fault lies with <lb/>
            the time when he was born, for at his birth he was told <lb/>
            that death was his doom: it is the law under which he was <lb/>
            born, the fate which has pursued him ever since he left his <lb/>
            mother's womb. We have come under the dominion of <lb/>
            Fortune, and a harsh and unconquerable dominion it is : at <lb/>
            her caprice we must suffer all things whether we deserve <lb/>
            them or not. She maltreats our bodies with anger, insult, <lb/>
            and cruelty: some she burns, the fire being sometimes <lb/>
            applied as a punishment and sometimes as a remedy: some <lb/>
            she imprisons, allowing it to be done at one time by our <lb/>
            enemies, at another by our countrymen : she tosses others <lb/>
            naked on the changeful seas, and after their struggle with <lb/>
            the waves will not even cast them out upon the sand or <lb/>
            the shore, but will entomb them in the belly of some huge <lb/>
            sea-monster : she wears away others to a skeleton by divers <lb/>
            kinds of disease, and keeps them long in suspense between <lb/>
            life and death: she is as capricious in her rewards and <lb/>
            punishments as a fickle, whimsical, and careless mistress is <lb/>
            with those of her slaves.</p>
          <p>XI. Why need we weep over parts of our life P the <lb/>
            whole of it calls for tears : new miseries assail us before we <lb/>
            have freed ourselves from the old ones. You, therefore, <lb/>
            who allow them to trouble you to an unreasonable extent <lb/>
            ought especially to restrain yourselves, and to muster all <lb/>
            the powers of the human breast to combat your fears and your <lb/>
            pains. Moreover, what forgetfulness of your own position <lb/>
            and that of mankind is this ? You were born a mortal, <lb/>
            and you have given birth to mortals : yourself a weak and <lb/>
            fragile body, liable to all diseases, can you have hoped to <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            produce anything strong and lasting from such unstable <lb/>
            materials ? Your son has died : in other words he has <lb/>
            reached that goal towards which those whom you regard as <lb/>
            more fortunate than your offspring are still hastening: <lb/>
            this is the point towards which move at different rates all <lb/>
            the crowds which are squabbling in the law courts, sitting <lb/>
            in the theatres, praying in the temples. Those whom you <lb/>
            love and those whom you despise will both be made equal <lb/>
            in the same ashes. This is the meaning of that command, <lb/>
            KNOW THYSELF, which is written on the shrine of the <lb/>
            Pythian oracle. What is man ? a potter's vessel, to be <lb/>
            broken by the slightest shake or toss : it requires no great <lb/>
            storm to rend you asunder : you fall to pieces wherever <lb/>
            you strike. What is man ? a weakly and frail body, <lb/>
            naked, without any natural protection, dependent on the <lb/>
            help of others, exposed to all the scorn of Fortune ; even <lb/>
            when his muscles are well trained he is the prey and the <lb/>
            food of the first wild beast he meets, formed of weak <lb/>
            and unstable substances, fair in outward feature, but <lb/>
            unable to endure cold, heat, or labour, and yet falling to <lb/>
            ruin if kept in sloth and idleness, fearing his very victuals, <lb/>
            for he is starved if he has them not, and bursts if he has <lb/>
            too much. He cannot be kept safe without anxious care, <lb/>
            his breath only stays in the body on sufferance, and has <lb/>
            no real hold upon it; he starts at every sudden danger, <lb/>
            every loud and unexpected noise that reaches his ears. <lb/>
            Ever a cause of anxiety to ourselves, diseased and useless <lb/>
            as we are, can we be surprised at the death of a creature <lb/>
            which can be killed by a single hiccup ? Is it a great <lb/>
            undertaking to put an end. to us ? why, smells, tastes, <lb/>
            fatigue and want of sleep, food and drink, and the very <lb/>
            necessaries of life, are mortal. Whithersoever he moves he <lb/>
            straightway becomes conscious of his weakness, not being <lb/>
            able to bear all climates, falling sick after drinking strange <lb/>
            water, breathing an air to which he is not accustomed, or <pb n="177"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            from other causes and reasons of the most trifling kind, <lb/>
            frail, sickly, entering upon his life with weeping: yet <lb/>
            nevertheless what a disturbance this despicable creature <lb/>
            makes! what ideas it conceives, forgetting its lowly con­ <lb/>
            dition ! It exercises its mind upon matters which are <lb/>
            immortal and eternal, and arranges the affairs of its grand­ <lb/>
            children and great-grandchildren, while death surprises it <lb/>
            in the midst of its far-reaching schemes, and what we <lb/>
            call old age is but the round of a very few years.</p>
          <p>XII. Supposing that your sorrow has any method at all, <lb/>
            is it your own sufferings or those of him who is gone that <lb/>
            it has in view ? Why do you grieve over your lost son ? is <lb/>
            it because you have received no pleasure from him, or <lb/>
            because you would have received more had he lived longer ? <lb/>
            If you answer that you have received no pleasure from <lb/>
            him you make your loss more endurable: for men miss <lb/>
            less when lost what has given them no enjoyment or glad­ <lb/>
            ness. If, again, you admit that you have received much <lb/>
            pleasure, it is your duty not to complain of that part which <lb/>
            you have lost, but to return thanks for that which you <lb/>
            have enjoyed. His rearing alone ought to have brought <lb/>
            you a sufficient return for your labours, for it can hardly <lb/>
            be that those who take the greatest pains to rear puppies, <lb/>
            birds, and such like paltry objects of amusement derive a <lb/>
            certain pleasure from the sight and touch and fawning <lb/>
            caresses of these dumb creatures, and yet that those who <lb/>
            rear children should not find their reward in doing so. <lb/>
            Thus, even though his industry may have gained nothing <lb/>
            for you, his carefulness may have saved nothing for you, <lb/>
            his foresight may have given you no advice, yet you found <lb/>
            sufficient reward in having owned him and loved him. <lb/>
            "But," say you, "it might have lasted longer." True, but <lb/>
            you have been better dealt with than if you had never had <lb/>
            a son, for, supposing you were given your choice, which is <lb/>
            the better lot, to be happy for a short time or not at all ? <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            .It is better to enjoy pleasures which soon leave us than to <lb/>
            enjoy none at all. Which, again, would you choose ? to <lb/>
            have had one who was a disgrace to you, and who merely <lb/>
            filled the position and owned the name of your son, or one <lb/>
            of such noble character as your son's was ? a youth who <lb/>
            soon grew discreet and dutiful, soon became a husband and <lb/>
            a father, soon became eager for public honours, and soon <lb/>
            obtained the priesthood, winning his way to all these <lb/>
            admirable things with equally admirable speed. It falls <lb/>
            to scarcely any one's lot to enjoy great prosperity, and also <lb/>
            to enjoy it for a long time : only a dull kind of happiness <lb/>
            can last for long and accompany us to the end of our lives. <lb/>
            The immortal gods, who did not intend to give you a son <lb/>
            for long, gave you one who was straightway what another <lb/>
            would have required long training to become. You cannot <lb/>
            even say that you have been specially marked by the gods <lb/>
            for misfortune because you have had no pleasure in your <lb/>
            son. Look at any company of people, whether they be <lb/>
            known to you or not: everywhere you will see some who <lb/>
            have endured greater misfortunes than your own. Great <lb/>
            generals and princes have undergone like bereavements: <lb/>
            mythology tells us that the gods themselves are not <lb/>
            exempt from them, its aim, I suppose, being to lighten <lb/>
            our sorrow at death by the thought that even deities <lb/>
            are subject to it. Look around, I repeat, at every one: <lb/>
            you cannot mention any house so miserable as not to find <lb/>
            comfort in the fact of another being yet more miserable. <lb/>
            I do not, by Hercules, think so ill of your principles as to <lb/>
            suppose that you would bear your sorrow more lightly <lb/>
            were I to show you an enormous company of mourners: <lb/>
            that is a spiteful sort of consolation which we derive from <lb/>
            the number of our fellow-sufferers: nevertheless I will <lb/>
            quote some instances, not indeed in order to teach you that <lb/>
            this often befalls men, for it is absurd to multiply examples <lb/>
            of man's mortality, but to let you know that there have <pb n="179"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            been many who have lightened their misfortunes by patient <lb/>
            endurance of them. I will begin with the luckiest man of <lb/>
            all. Lucius Sulla lost his son, yet this did not impair <lb/>
            either the spitefulness or the brilliant valour which he dis­ <lb/>
            played at the expense of his enemies and his countrymen <lb/>
            alike, nor did it make him appear to have assumed his <lb/>
            well-known title untruly that he did so after his son's <lb/>
            death, fearing neither the hatred of men, by whose <lb/>
            sufferings that excessive prosperity of his was purchased, <lb/>
            nor the ill-will of the gods, to whom it was a reproach that <lb/>
            Bulla should be so truly The Fortunate. What, however, <lb/>
            Sulla's real character was may pass among questions still <lb/>
            undecided: even his enemies will admit that he took up <lb/>
            arms with honour, and laid them aside with honour: his <lb/>
            example proves the point at issue, that an evil which <lb/>
            befalls even the most prosperous cannot be one of the first <lb/>
            magnitude. ,</p>
          <p>XIII. That Greece cannot boast unduly of that father who, <lb/>
            being in the act of offering sacrifice when he heard the news <lb/>
            of his son's death, merely ordered the flute-player to be silent, <lb/>
            and removed the garland from his head, but accomplished <lb/>
            all the rest of the ceremony in due form, is due to a Roman, <lb/>
            Pulvillus the high priest. When he was in the act of <lb/>
            holding the doorpost1 and dedicating the Capitol the news <lb/>
            of his son's death was brought to him. He pretended not <lb/>
            to hear it, and pronounced the form of words proper for <lb/>
            the high priest on such an occasion, without his prayer <lb/>
            being interrupted by a single groan, begging that Jupiter <lb/>
            would show himself gracious, at the very instant that he <lb/>
            heard his son's name mentioned as dead. Do you imagine <lb/>
            that this man's mourning knew no end, if the first day and <lb/>
            the first shock could not drive him, though a father, away <note type="footnote"> 1 This seems to have been part of the ceremony of dedication. <lb/>
            Pulvillus was dedicating the Temple of Jupiter in the Capitol. See <lb/>
            Livy, ii. 8 ; Cic. Pro Domo, paragraph cxxi. I </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            from the public altar of the state, or cause him to mar the <lb/>
            ceremony of dedication by words of ill omen ? Worthy, <lb/>
            indeed, of the most exalted priesthood was he who ceased <lb/>
            not to revere the gods even when they were angry. Yet <lb/>
            he, after he had gone home, filled his eyes with tears, said <lb/>
            a few words of lamentation, and performed the rites with <lb/>
            which it was then customary to honour the dead, resumed <lb/>
            the expression of countenance which he had worn in the <lb/>
            Capitol.</p>
          <p>Paulus,l about the time of his magnificent triumph, in <lb/>
            which he drove Perses in chains before his car, gave two <lb/>
            of his sons to be adopted into other families, and buried <lb/>
            those whom he had kept for himself. What, think you, must <lb/>
            those whom he kept have been, when Scipio was one of those <lb/>
            whom he gave away ? It was not without emotion that <lb/>
            the Roman people looked upon Paulus's empty chariot:2 <lb/>
            nevertheless he made a speech to them, and returned <lb/>
            thanks to the gods for having granted his prayer: for he <lb/>
            had prayed that, if any offering to Nemesis were due in <lb/>
            consequence of the stupendous victory which he had won, <lb/>
            it might be paid at his own expense rather than at that of <lb/>
            his country. Do you see how magnanimously he bore his <lb/>
            loss ? he even congratulated himself on being left childless, <lb/>
            though who had more to suffer by such a change ? he lost <lb/>
            at once his comforters and his helpers. Yet Perses did <lb/>
            not have the pleasure of seeing Paulus look sorrowful.</p>

            series of great men and pick out the unhappy ones, as <lb/>
            though it were not more difficult to find happy ones ? for <lb/>
            how few households have remained possessed of all their <lb/>
            members until the end? what one is there that has not <lb/>
            suffered some loss? Take any one year you please and <lb/>
            name the consuls for it: if you like, that of1 Lucius Bibulus <lb/>
            and Grains Caesar; you will see that, though these colleagues <lb/>
            were each other's bitterest enemies, yet their fortunes <lb/>
            agreed. Lucius Bibulus, a man more remarkable for <lb/>
            goodness than for strength of character, had both his sons <lb/>
            murdered at the same time, and even insulted by the <lb/>
            Egyptian soldiery, so that the agent of his bereavement <lb/>
            was as much a subject for tears as the bereavement itself. <lb/>
            Nevertheless Bibulus, who during the whole of his year <lb/>
            of office had remained hidden in his house, to cast <lb/>
            reproach upon his colleague Caesar on the day follow­ <lb/>
            ing that upon which he heard of both his sons' deaths, <lb/>
            came forth and went through the routine business of his <lb/>
            magistracy. Who could devote less than one day to <lb/>
            mourning for two sons ? Thus soon did he end his mourn­ <lb/>
            ing for his children, although he had mourned a whole <lb/>
            year for his consulship. Gaius Caesar, after having tra­ <lb/>
            versed Britain, and not allowed even the ocean to set <lb/>
            bounds to his successes, heard of the death of his daughter, <lb/>
            which hurried on the crisis of affairs. Already Gnaeus <lb/>
            Pompeius stood before his eyes, a man who would ill <lb/>
            endure that any one besides himself should become a great <lb/>
            power in the state, and one who was likely to place a check <lb/>
            upon his advancement, which he had regarded as onerous <lb/>
            even when each gained by the other's rise: yet within three <lb/>
            days' time he resumed his duties as general, and conquered <lb/>
            his grief as quickly as he was wont to conquer everything <lb/>
            else.</p>
          <p>XV. Why need I remind you of the deaths of the other <note type="footnote"> 1 A. U. C, 695, B.C. 59. </note> <pb n="182"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            Caesars, whom fortune appears to me sometimes to have out­ <lb/>
            raged in order that even by their deaths they might be useful <lb/>
            to mankind, by proving that not even they, although they <lb/>
            were styled " sons of gods," and " fathers of gods to come," <lb/>
            could exercise the same power over their own fortunes which <lb/>
            they did over those of others ? The Emperor Augustus lost <lb/>
            his children and his grandchildren, and after all the <lb/>
            family of Caesar had perished was obliged to prop his <lb/>
            empty house by adopting a son: yet he bore his losses <lb/>
            as bravely as though he were already personally con­ <lb/>
            cerned in the honour of the gods, and as though it were <lb/>
            especially to his interest that no one should complain of <lb/>
            the injustice of Heaven. Tiberius Caesar lost both the <lb/>
            son whom he begot and the son whom he adopted, yet <lb/>
            he himself pronounced a panegyric upon his son from <lb/>
            the Rostra, and stood in full view of the corpse, which <lb/>
            merely had a curtain on one side to prevent the eyes of the <lb/>
            high priest resting upon the dead body, and did not change <lb/>
            his countenance, though all the Romans wept: he gave <lb/>
            Sejanus, who stood by his side, a proof of how patiently he <lb/>
            could endure the loss of his relatives. See you not what <lb/>
            numbers of most eminent men there have been, none of whom <lb/>
            have been spared by this blight which prostrates us all: men, <lb/>
            too, adorned with every grace of character, and every dis­ <lb/>
            tinction that public or private life can confer. It appears <lb/>
            as though this plague moved in a regular orbit, and spread <lb/>
            ruin and desolation among us all without distinction of <lb/>
            persons, all being alike its prey. Bid any number of indi­ <lb/>
            viduals tell you the story of- their lives : you will find that <lb/>
            all have paid some penalty for being born.</p>
          <p>XVI. I know what you will say, " You quote men as, <lb/>
            examples: you forget that it is a woman that you are trying to <lb/>
            console." Yet who would say that nature has dealt grudg­ <lb/>
            ingly with the minds of women, and stunted their virtues ? <lb/>
            Believe me, they have the same intellectual power as men, <pb n="183"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            and the same capacity for honourable and generous action. <lb/>
            If trained to do so, they are just as able to endure sorrow or <lb/>
            labour. Ye good gods, do I say this in that very city in <lb/>
            which Lucretia and Brutus removed the yoke of kings from <lb/>
            the necks of the Romans ? We owe liberty to Brutus, but we <lb/>
            owe Brutus to Lucretia-in which Cloelia, for the sublime <lb/>
            courage with which she scorned both the enemy and the <lb/>
            river, has been almost reckoned as a man. The statue of <lb/>
            Cloelia, mounted on horseback, in that busiest of thorough­ <lb/>
            fares, the Sacred Way, continually reproaches the youth of <lb/>
            the present day, who never mount anything but a cushioned <lb/>
            seat in a carriage, with journeying in such a fashion through <lb/>
            that very city in which we have enrolled even women <lb/>
            among our knights. If you wish me to point out to you <lb/>
            examples of women who have bravely endured the loss of <lb/>
            their children, I shall not go far afield to search for them : <lb/>
            in one family I can quote two Cornelias, one the daughter <lb/>
            of Scipio, and the mother of the Gracchi, who made acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment of the birth of her twelve children by burying <lb/>
            them all: nor was it so hard to do this in the case of the <lb/>
            others, whose birth and death were alike unknown to the <lb/>
            public, but she beheld the murdered and unburied corpses <lb/>
            of both Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus, whom even <lb/>
            those who will not call them good must admit were great <lb/>
            men. Yet to those who tried to console her and called her <lb/>
            unfortunate, she answered, " I shall never cease to call ;my. <lb/>
            self happy, because I am the mother of the Gracchi." <lb/>
            Cornelia, the wife of Livius Drusus, lost by the hands of an <lb/>
            unknown assassin a young son of great distinction, who was <lb/>
            treading in the footsteps of the Gracchi, and was murdered <lb/>
            in his own house just when he had so many bills half way <lb/>
            through the process of becoming law: nevertheless she <lb/>
            bore the untimely and unavenged death of her son with as <lb/>
            .lofty a spirit as he had shown in carrying his laws. Will <lb/>
            you not, Marcia, forgive fortune because she has not re- <pb n="184"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            framed from striking you with the darts with which she <lb/>
            launched at the Scipios, and the mothers and daughters of <lb/>
            the Scipios, and with which she has attacked the Caesars <lb/>
            themselves F Life is full of misfortunes; our path is beset <lb/>
            with them : no one can make a long peace, nay, scarcely an <lb/>
            armistice with fortune. You, Marcia, have borne four <lb/>
            children : now they say that no dart which is hurled into a <lb/>
            close column of soldiers can fail to hit one,-ought you <lb/>
            then to wonder at not having been able to lead along such <lb/>
            a company without exciting the ill-will of Fortune, or suffer­ <lb/>
            ing loss at her hands? "But," say you, "Fortune has <lb/>
            treated me unfairly, for she not only has bereaved me of <lb/>
            my son, but chose my best beloved to deprive me of." Yet <lb/>
            you never can say that you have been wronged, if you <lb/>
            divide the stakes equally with an antagonist who is stronger <lb/>
            than yourself: Fortune has left you two daughters, and <lb/>
            their children: she has not even taken away altogether him <lb/>
            who you now mourn for, forgetful of his elder brother : you <lb/>
            have two daughters by him, who if you support them ill <lb/>
            will prove great burdens, but if well, great comforts to you. <lb/>
            You ought to prevail upon yourself, when you see them, to <lb/>
            let them remind you of your son, and not of your grief. <lb/>
            When a husbandman's trees have either been torn up, roots <lb/>
            and all, by the wind, or broken off short by the force of a <lb/>
            hurricane, he takes care of what is left of their stock, straight­ <lb/>
            way plants seeds or cuttings in the place of those which he <lb/>
            has lost, and in a moment-for time is as swift in repairing <lb/>
            losses as in causing them-more flourishing trees are grow­ <lb/>
            ing than were there before. Take, then, in the place of <lb/>
            your Metilius these his two daughters, and by their two- <lb/>
            fold consolation lighten your single sorrow. True, human <lb/>
            nature is so constituted as to love nothing so much as what <lb/>
            it has lost, and our yearning after those who have been <lb/>
            taken from us makes us judge unfairly of those who are left. <lb/>
            to us: nevertheless, if you choose to reckon up how merci- <pb n="185"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            ful Fortune has been to you even in her anger, you will feel <lb/>
            that you have more than enough to console you. Look at <lb/>
            all your grandchildren, and your two daughters: and say <lb/>
            also, Marcia:—"I should indeed be cast down, if everyone's <lb/>
            fortune followed his deserts, and if no evil ever betel good <lb/>
            men : but as it is I perceive that no distinction is made, and <lb/>
            that the bad and the good are both harassed alike."</p>
          <p>XVII. " Still, it is a sad thing to lose a young man whom <lb/>
            you have brought up, just as he was becoming a defence <lb/>
            and a pride both to his mother and to his country." No <lb/>
            one denies that it is sad: but it is the. common lot of mor­ <lb/>
            tals. You were born to lose others, to be lost, to hope, to <lb/>
            fear, to destroy your own peace and that of others, to fear <lb/>
            and yet to long for death, and, worst of all, never to know <lb/>
            what your real position is. If you were about to journey to <lb/>
            Syracuse, and some one were to say:—" Learn beforehand <lb/>
            all the discomforts, and all the pleasures of your coming <lb/>
            voyage, and then set sail. The sights which you will enjoy <lb/>
            will be as follows : first, you will see the island itself, now <lb/>
            separated from Italy by a narrow strait, but which, we know, <lb/>
            once formed part of the mainland. The sea suddenly broke <lb/>
            through, and <lb/>
            ' Sever'd Sicilia from the western shore.' 1 <lb/>
            Next, as you will be able to sail close to Charybdis, of <lb/>
            which the poets have sung, you will see that greediest of <lb/>
            whirlpools, quite smooth if no south wind be blowing, but <lb/>
            whenever there is a gale from that quarter, sucking down <lb/>
            ships into a huge and deep abyss. You will see the foun­ <lb/>
            tain of Arethusa, so famed in song, with its waters bright <lb/>
            and pellucid to the very bottom, and pouring forth an icy <lb/>
            stream which it either finds on the spot or else plunges it <lb/>
            under ground, conveys it thither as a separate river beneath <lb/>
            so many seas, free from any mixture of less pure water, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Virgo Æ. III. 418. </note> <pb n="186"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            there brings it again to the surface. You will see a harbour <lb/>
            which is more sheltered than all the others in the world, <lb/>
            whether they be natural or improved by human art for the <lb/>
            protection of shipping; so safe, that even the most violent <lb/>
            storms are powerless to disturb it. You will see the place <lb/>
            where the power of Athens was broken, where that natural <lb/>
            prison, hewn deep among precipices of rock, received so <lb/>
            many thousands of captives: you will see the great city <lb/>
            itself, occupying a wider site than many capitals, an ex­ <lb/>
            tremely warm resort in winter, where not a single day <lb/>
            passes without sunshine : but when you have observed all <lb/>
            this, you must remember that the advantages of its winter <lb/>
            climate are counterbalanced by a hot and pestilential <lb/>
            summer: that here will be the tyrant Dionysius, the de­ <lb/>
            stroyer of freedom, of justice, and of law, who is greedy <lb/>
            of power even after conversing with Plato, and of life <lb/>
            even after he has been exiled; that he will burn some, <lb/>
            flog others, and behead others for slight offences; that he <lb/>
            will exercise his lust upon both sexes. You <lb/>
            have now heard all that can attract you thither, all <lb/>
            that can deter you from going: now, then, either set sail <lb/>
            or remain at home!" If, after this declaration, anybody <lb/>
            were to say that he wished to go to Syracuse, he could <lb/>
            blame no one but himself for what betel him there, because <lb/>
            he would not stumble upon it unknowingly, but would have <lb/>
            gone thither fully aware of what was before him. To every­ <lb/>
            one Nature says : " I do not deceive any person. If you <lb/>
            choose to have children, they may be handsome, or they <lb/>
            may be deformed; perhaps they will be born dumb. One <lb/>
            of them may perhaps prove the saviour of his country, or <lb/>
            perhaps its betrayer. You need not despair of their being <lb/>
            raised to such honour that for their sake no one will dare <lb/>
            to speak evil of you: yet remember that they may reach <lb/>
            such a pitch of infamy as themselves to become curses to <lb/>
            you. There is nothing to prevent their performing the <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            last offices for you, and your panegyric being spoten by <lb/>
            your children: but hold yourself prepared nevertheless to <lb/>
            place a son as boy, man, or greybeard, upon the funeral pyre: <lb/>
            for years have nothing to do with the matter, since every <lb/>
            sort of funeral in which a parent buries his child must alike <lb/>
            be untimely.l If you still choose to rear children, after I have <lb/>
            explained these conditions to you, you render yourself in­ <lb/>
            capable of blaming the gods, for they never guaranteed <lb/>
            anything to you.''</p>
          <p>XVIII. You may make this simile apply to your whole <lb/>
            entrance into life. I have explained to you what attractions <lb/>
            and what drawbacks there would be if you were thinking <lb/>
            of going to Syracuse: now suppose that I were to come <lb/>
            and give you advice when you were going to be born. <lb/>
            " You are about," I should say, " to enter a city of which <lb/>
            both gods and men are citizens, a city which contains the <lb/>
            whole universe, which is bound by irrevocable and eternal <lb/>
            laws, and wherein the heavenly bodies run their unwearied <lb/>
            courses: you will see therein innumerable twinkling <lb/>
            stars, and the surf, whose single light pervades every <lb/>
            place, who by his daily course marks the times of day and <lb/>
            night, and by his yearly course makes a more equal <lb/>
            division between summer and winter. You will see his <lb/>
            place taken by night by the moon, who borrows at her <lb/>
            meetings with her brother a gentle and softer light, <lb/>
            and who at one time is invisible, at another hangs full­ <lb/>
            faced above the earth, ever waxing and waning, each <lb/>
            phase unlike the last. You will see five stars, moving <lb/>
            in the opposite direction to the others, stemming the <lb/>
            whirl of the skies towards the West: on the slightest <lb/>
            motions of these depend the fortunes of nations, and <lb/>
            according as the aspect -of the planets is auspicious or <lb/>
            malignant, the greatest empires rise and fall: you will see <lb/>
            with wonder the gathering clouds, the falling showers, the <note type="footnote"> 1 See Mayor's note on Juv. i., and above, c. 16, § 4. </note> <pb n="188"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            zigzag lightning, the crashing together of the heavens. <lb/>
            When, sated with the wonders above, you turn your eyes <lb/>
            towards the earth, they will be met by objects of a <lb/>
            different yet equally admirable aspect: on one side a <lb/>
            boundless expanse of open plains, on another the towering <lb/>
            peaks of lofty and snow-clad mountains: the downward <lb/>
            course of rivers, some streams running eastward, some <lb/>
            westward from the same source: the woods which wave <lb/>
            even on the mountain tops, the vast forests with all the <lb/>
            creatures that dwell therein, and the confused harmony of <lb/>
            the birds: the variously-placed cities, the nations which <lb/>
            natural obstacles keep secluded from the world, some of <lb/>
            whom withdraw themselves to lofty mountains, while <lb/>
            others dwell in fear and trembling on the sloping banks of <lb/>
            rivers: the crops which are assisted by cultivation, and <lb/>
            the trees which bear fruit even without it: the rivers that <lb/>
            flow gently through the meadows, the lovely bays and <lb/>
            shores that curve inwards to form harbours: the countless <lb/>
            islands scattered over the main, which break and spangle <lb/>
            the seas. What of the brilliancy of stones and gems, the <lb/>
            gold that rolls amid the sands of rushing streams, the <lb/>
            heaven-born fires that burst forth from the midst of the <lb/>
            earth and even from the midst of the sea ; the ocean itself, <lb/>
            that binds land to land, dividing the nations by its three­ <lb/>
            fold indentations, and boiling up with mighty rage ? <lb/>
            Swimming upon its waves, making them disturbed and <lb/>
            swelling without wind, you will see animals exceeding the <lb/>
            size of any that belong to the land, some clumsy and <lb/>
            requiring others to guide their movements, some swift and <lb/>
            moving faster than the utmost efforts of rowers, some <lb/>
            of them that drink in the waters and blow them out again <lb/>
            to the great perils of those who sail near them: you will <lb/>
            see here ships seeking for unknown lands: you will see <lb/>
            that man's audacity leaves nothing unattempted, and you <lb/>
            will yourself be both a witness and a sharer in great <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            attempts. You will both learn and teach the arts by <lb/>
            which men's lives are supplied with necessaries, are <lb/>
            adorned, and are ruled : but in this same place there will <lb/>
            be a thousand pestilences fatal to both body and mind, <lb/>
            there will be wars and highway robberies, poisonings and <lb/>
            shipwrecks, extremes of climate and excesses of body, an. <lb/>
            timely griefs for our dearest ones, and death for ourselves, <lb/>
            of which we cannot tell whether it will be easy or by <lb/>
            torture at the hands of the executioner. Now consider and <lb/>
            weigh carefully in your own mind which you would choose. <lb/>
            If you wish to enjoy these blessings you must pass through <lb/>
            these pains. Do you answer that you choose to live P <lb/>
            ' Of course.' Nay, I thought you would not enter upon <lb/>
            that of which the least diminution causes pain. Live, <lb/>
            then, as has been agreed on. You say, "No one has <lb/>
            asked my opinion." Our parents' opinion was taken about <lb/>
            us, when, knowing what the conditions of life are, they <lb/>
            brought us into it.</p>
          <p>XIX. But, to come to topics of consolation, in the first <lb/>
            place consider if you please to what our remedies must be <lb/>
            applied, and next, in what way. It is regret for the <lb/>
            absence of his loved one which causes a mourner to grieve: <lb/>
            yet it is clear that this in itself is bearable enough ; for we <lb/>
            do not weep at their being absent or intending to be absent <lb/>
            during their lifetime, although when they leave our sight <lb/>
            we have no more pleasure in them. What tortures us, <lb/>
            therefore, is an idea. Now every evil is just as great as <lb/>
            we consider it to be: we have, therefore, the remedy <lb/>
            in our own hands. Let us suppose that they are on a <lb/>
            journey, and let us deceive ourselves: we have sent them <lb/>
            away, or, rather, we have sent them on in advance to a <lb/>
            place whither we shall soon follow them.. Besides this, <lb/>
            mourners are wont to suffer from the thought, " I shall <note type="footnote"> 1 Lipsius points out that this idea is borrowed from the comic poet <lb/>
            Antiphanes. See Meineke's " Comic Fragments," p. 3. </note> <pb n="190"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            have no one to protect me, no one to avenge me when I am <lb/>
            scorned." To use a very disreputable but very true mode <lb/>
            of consolation, I may say that in our country the loss of <lb/>
            children bestows more influence than it takes away, and <lb/>
            loneliness, which used to bring the aged to ruin, now <lb/>
            makes them so powerful that some old men have pretended <lb/>
            to pick quarrels with their sons, have disowned their own <lb/>
            children, and have made themselves childless by their own <lb/>
            act. I know what you will say : " My own losses do not <lb/>
            grieve me:" and indeed a man does not deserve to be con­ <lb/>
            soled if he is sorry for his son's death as he would be for <lb/>
            that of a slave, who is capable of seeing anything in his <lb/>
            son beyond his son's self. What then, Marcia, is it that <lb/>
            grieves you ? is it that your son has died, or that he did <lb/>
            not live long P If it be his having died, then you ought <lb/>
            always to have grieved, for you always knew that he would <lb/>
            die. Reflect that the dead suffer no evils, that all those <lb/>
            stories which make us dread the nether world are mere <lb/>
            fables, that he who dies need fear no darkness, no prison, <lb/>
            no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe, no judg­ <lb/>
            ment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is <lb/>
            - such utter freedom that he need fear no more despots. All <lb/>
            that is a phantasy of the poets, who have terrified us with­ <lb/>
            out a cause. Death is a release from and an end of all <lb/>
            pains : beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it restores <lb/>
            us to the peaceful rest in which we la) before we were <lb/>
            born. If any one pities the dead, he ought also to pity <lb/>
            those who have not been born. Death is neither a good <lb/>
            nor a bad thing, for that alone which is something can be <lb/>
            a good or a bad thing: but that which is nothing, and <lb/>
            reduces all things to nothing, does not hand us over to <lb/>
            either fortune, because good and bad require some material <lb/>
            to work upon. Fortune cannot take hold of that which <lb/>
            Nature has let go, nor can a man be unhappy if he is <lb/>
            nothing. Your son has passed beyond the border of the <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            country where men are forced to labour; he has reached <lb/>
            deep and everlasting peace. He feels no fear of want, no <lb/>
            anxiety about his riches, no stings of lust that tears the <lb/>
            heart in guise of pleasure : he knows no envy of another's <lb/>
            - prosperity, he is not crushed by the weight of his own ; <lb/>
            even his chaste ears are not wounded by any ribaldry : he <lb/>
            is menaced by no disaster, either to his country or to <lb/>
            himself. He does not hang, full of anxiety, upon the issue <lb/>
            of events, to reap even greater uncertainty as his reward: <lb/>
            he has at last taken up a position from which nothing can <lb/>
            dislodge him, where nothing can make him afraid.</p>
          <p>XX. 0 how little do men understand their own misery, <lb/>
            that they do not praise and look forward to death as the <lb/>
            best discovery of Nature, whether because it hedges in <lb/>
            happiness, or because it drives away misery: because it <lb/>
            puts an end to the sated weariness of old age, cuts down <lb/>
            youth in its bloom while still full of hope of better things, <lb/>
            or calls home childhood before the harsher stages of life <lb/>
            are reached: it is, the end of all men, a relief to many, a <lb/>
            desire to some, and it treats none so well as those to whom <lb/>
            it comes before they call for it. Death frees the slave <lb/>
            though his master wills it not, it lightens the captive's <lb/>
            chains: it leads out of prison those whom headstrong power <lb/>
            has forbidden to quit it: it points out to exiles, whose <lb/>
            minds and eyes are ever turned towards their own country, <lb/>
            that it makes no difference under what people's soil one lies. <lb/>
            When Fortune has unjustly divided the common stock, <lb/>
            and has given over one man to another, though they were <lb/>
            born with equal rights, Death makes them all equal. <lb/>
            After Death no one acts any more at another's bidding: <lb/>
            in death no man suffers any more from the sense of his <lb/>
            low position. It is open to all: it was, what your <lb/>
            father, Marcia, longed for: it is this, I say, that renders <lb/>
            it no misery to be born, which enables me to face the <lb/>
            threatenings of misfortune, without quailing, and to keep <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            my mind unharmed and able to command itself. I <lb/>
            have a last appeal. I see before me crosses not all <lb/>
            alike, but differently made by different peoples: some <lb/>
            hang a man head downwards, some force a stick upwards <lb/>
            through his groin, some stretch out his arms on a forked <lb/>
            gibbet. I see cords, scourges, and instruments of torture <lb/>
            for each limb and each joint: but I see Death also. There <lb/>
            are bloodthirsty enemies, there are overbearing fellow- <lb/>
            countrymen, but where they are there I see Death also. <lb/>
            Slavery is not grievous if a man can gain his freedom by <lb/>
            one step as soon as he becomes tired of thraldom. Life, <lb/>
            it is thanks to Death that I hold thee so dear. Think <lb/>
            how great a blessing is a timely death, how many have <lb/>
            been injured by living longer than they ought. If sickness <lb/>
            had carried off that glory and support of the empire, <lb/>
            Gnaeus Pompeius, at Naples, he would have died the <lb/>
            undoubted head of the Roman people, but as it was, a short <lb/>
            extension of time cast him down from his pinnacle of <lb/>
            fame: he beheld his legions slaughtered before his eyes: <lb/>
            and what a sad relic of that battle, in which the Senate <lb/>
            formed the first line, was the survival of the general. He <lb/>
            saw his Egyptian butcher, and offered his body, hallowed <lb/>
            by so many victories, to a guardsman's sword, although <lb/>
            even had he been unhurt, he would have regretted his <lb/>
            safety: for what could have been more infamous than that <lb/>
            a Pompeius should owe his life to the clemency of a king ? <lb/>
            If Marcus Cicero had fallen at the time when he avoided <lb/>
            those daggers which Catiline aimed equally at him and at <lb/>
            his country, he might have died as the saviour of the <lb/>
            commonwealth which he had set free: if his death had <lb/>
            even followed upon that of his daughter, he might have <lb/>
            died happy. He would not then have seen swords <lb/>
            drawn for the slaughter of Roman citizens, the goods <lb/>
            of the murdered divided among the murderers, that <lb/>
            men might pay from their own purse the price of their <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXI.] </note> <lb/>
            own blood, the public auction of the consul's spoil in the <lb/>
            civil war, the public letting out of murder to be done, <lb/>
            brigandage, war, pillage, hosts of Catilines. Would it <lb/>
            not have been a good thing for Marcus Cato if the sea <lb/>
            had swallowed him up when he was returning from <lb/>
            Cyprus after sequestrating the king's hereditary posses­ <lb/>
            sions, even if that very money which he was bringing to <lb/>
            pay the soldiers in the civil war had been lost with him ? <lb/>
            He certainly would have been able to boast that no one <lb/>
            would dare to do wrong in the presence of Cato : as it was, <lb/>
            the extension of his life for a very few more years forced <lb/>
            one who was born for personal and political freedom to <lb/>
            flee from Caesar and to become Pompeius's follower. Pre­ <lb/>
            mature death therefore did him no evil: indeed, it put an <lb/>
            end to the power of any evil to hurt him.</p>
          <p>XXI. "Yet," say you, "he perished too soon and un­ <lb/>
            timely." In the first place, suppose that he had lived to <lb/>
            extreme old age: let him continue alive to the extreme <lb/>
            limits of human existence: how much is it after all ? <lb/>
            Born for a very brief space of time, we regard this life as <lb/>
            an inn which we are soon to quit that it may be made <lb/>
            ready for the coming guest. Do I speak of our lives, <lb/>
            which we know roll away incredibly fast ? Reckon up the <lb/>
            centuries of cities : you will find that even those which boast <lb/>
            of their antiquity have not existed for long. All human <lb/>
            works are brief and fleeting; they take up no part whatever <lb/>
            of infinite time. Tried by the standard of the universe, <lb/>
            we regard this earth of ours, with all its cities, nations, <lb/>
            rivers, and sea-board as a mere point: our life occupies <lb/>
            less than a point when compared with all time, the measure <lb/>
            of which exceeds that of the world, for indeed the world is <lb/>
            contained many times in it. Of what importance, then, can <lb/>
            it be to lengthen that which, however much you add to it, <lb/>
            will never be much more than nothing? We can only <lb/>
            make our lives long by one expedient, that is, by being <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            satisfied with their length: you may tell me of long-lived <lb/>
            men, whose length of days has been celebrated by tradi­ <lb/>
            tion, you may assign a hundred and ten years apiece to <lb/>
            them : yet when you allow your mind to conceive the idea <lb/>
            of eternity, there will be no difference between the shortest <lb/>
            and the longest life, if you compare the time during which <lb/>
            any one has been alive with that during which he has not <lb/>
            been alive. In the next place, when he died his life was <lb/>
            complete: he had lived as long as he needed to live: there <lb/>
            was nothing left for him to accomplish. All men do not <lb/>
            grow old at the same age, nor indeed do all animals: some <lb/>
            are wearied out by life at fourteen years of age, and what <lb/>
            is only the first stage of life with man is their extreme <lb/>
            limit of longevity. To each man a varying length of days <lb/>
            has been assigned: no one dies before his time, because he <lb/>
            was not destined to live any longer than he did. Every­ <lb/>
            one's end is fixed, and will always remain where it has <lb/>
            been placed: neither industry nor favour will move it on <lb/>
            any further. Believe, then, that you lost him by advice: <lb/>
            he took all that was his own, <lb/>
            " And reached the goal allotted to his life," <lb/>
            so you need not burden yourself with the thought, " He <lb/>
            might have lived longer." His life has not been cut short, <lb/>
            nor does chance ever cut short our years: every man re­ <lb/>
            ceives as much as was promised to him : the Fates go their <lb/>
            own way, and neither add anything nor take away any­ <lb/>
            thing from what they have once promised. Prayers and <lb/>
            endeavours are all in vain: each man will have as much life <lb/>
            as his first day placed to his credit: from the time when he <lb/>
            first saw the light he has entered on the path that leads to <lb/>
            death, and is drawing nearer to his doom: those same years <lb/>
            which were added to his youth were subtracted from his <lb/>
            life. We all fall into this mistake of supposing that it is <lb/>
            only old men, already in the decline of life, who are drawing <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            near to death, whereas our first infancy, our youth, indeed <lb/>
            every time of life leads thither. The Fates ply their own <lb/>
            work: they take from us the consciousness of our death, <lb/>
            and, the better to conceal its approaches, death lurks under <lb/>
            the very names we give to life: infancy changes into boy­ <lb/>
            hood, maturity swallows up the boy, old age the man: <lb/>
            these stages themselves, if you reckon them properly, are <lb/>
            so many losses.</p>
          <p>XXII. Do you complain, Marcia, that your son did not <lb/>
            live as long as he might have done ? How do you know <lb/>
            that it was to his advantage to live longer ? whether his <lb/>
            interest was not served by this death ? Whom can you <lb/>
            findat the present time whose fortunes are grounded on such <lb/>
            sure foundations that they have nothing to fear in the <lb/>
            future ? All human affairs are evanescent and perishable, <lb/>
            nor is any part of our life so frail and liable to accident as <lb/>
            that which we especially enjoy. We ought, therefore, to <lb/>
            pray for death when our fortune is at its best, because so <lb/>
            great is the uncertainty and turmoil in which we live, that <lb/>
            we can be sure of nothing but what is past. Think of <lb/>
            your son's handsome person, which you had guarded in <lb/>
            perfect purity among all the temptations of a voluptuous <lb/>
            capital. Who could have undertaken to keep that clear of <lb/>
            all diseases, so that it might preserve its beauty of form <lb/>
            unimpaired even to old age ? Think of the many taints <lb/>
            of the mind: for fine dispositions do not always con­ <lb/>
            tinue to their life's end to make good the promise of <lb/>
            their youth, but have often broken down: either ex­ <lb/>
            travagance, all the more shameful for being indulged in <lb/>
            late in life, takes possession of men and makes their well­ <lb/>
            begun lives end in disgrace, or they devote their entire <lb/>
            thoughts to the eating-house and the belly, and they become <lb/>
            interested in nothing save what they shall eat and what <lb/>
            they shall drink. Add to this conflagrations, falling houses, <lb/>
            shipwrecks, the agonizing operations of surgeons, who cut <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            pieces of bone out of men's living bodies, plunge their <lb/>
            whole hands into their entrails, and inflict more than one <lb/>
            kind of pain to effect the cure of shameful diseases. After <lb/>
            these comes exile; your son was not more innocent than <lb/>
            Rutilius: imprisonment; he was not wiser than Socrates : <lb/>
            the piercing of one's breast by a self-inflicted wound; he <lb/>
            was not of holler life than Cato. When you look at these <lb/>
            examples, you will perceive that nature deals very kindly <lb/>
            with those whom she puts speedily in a place of safety <lb/>
            because there awaited them the payment of some such <lb/>
            price as this for their lives. Nothing is so deceptive, <lb/>
            nothing is so treacherous as human life; by Hercules, were <lb/>
            it not given to men before they could form an opinion, no <lb/>
            one would take it. Not to be born, therefore, is the <lb/>
            happiest lot of all, and the nearest thing to this, I imagine, <lb/>
            is that we should soon finish our strife here and be restored <lb/>
            again to our former rest. Recall to your mind that time, <lb/>
            so painful to you, during which Sejanus handed over your <lb/>
            father as a present to his client Satrius Secundus: he was <lb/>
            angry with him about something or other which he had <lb/>
            said with too great freedom, because he was not able to <lb/>
            keep silence and see Sejanus climbing up to take his seat <lb/>
            upon our necks, which would have been bad enough had <lb/>
            he been placed there by his master. He was decreed the <lb/>
            honour of a statue, to be set up in the theatre of Pompeius, <lb/>
            which had been burned down and was being restored by <lb/>
            Caesar. Cordus exclaimed that" Now the theatre was really <lb/>
            destroyed." What then ? should he not burst with spite at <lb/>
            a Sejanus being set up over the ashes of Grnaeus Pompeius, <lb/>
            . at a faithless soldier being commemorated within, the <lb/>
            memorial of a consummate commander ?</p>
          <p>The inscription was put up:1 and those keen-scented <note type="footnote"> 1 This I believe to be the meaning of the text, but Koch reasonably <lb/>
            conjectures that the true reading is " editur subscriptio," " an indict­ <lb/>
            ment was made out against him." See IOn Benefits," iii. 26. </note> <pb n="197"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            hounds whom Sejanus used to feed on human blood, to <lb/>
            make them tame towards himself and fierce to all the <lb/>
            world beside, began to bay around their victim and even <lb/>
            to make premature snaps at him. What was he to do ? <lb/>
            If he chose to live, he must gain the consent of Sejanus ; <lb/>
            if to die, he must gain that of his daughter; and neither of <lb/>
            them could have been persuaded to grant it: he therefore <lb/>
            determined to deceive his daughter, and having taken a <lb/>
            bath in order to weaken himself still further, he retired to <lb/>
            his bed-chamber on the pretence of taking a meal there. <lb/>
            After dismissing his slaves he threw some of the food out <lb/>
            of the window, that he might appear to have eaten .it: then <lb/>
            he took no supper, making the excuse that he had already <lb/>
            had enough food in his chamber. This he continued to do <lb/>
            on the second and the third day: the fourth betrayed his <lb/>
            condition by his bodily weakness; so, embracing you, <lb/>
            "My dearest daughter," said he, " from whom I have <lb/>
            never throughout your whole life concealed aught but this, <lb/>
            I have begun my journey towards death, and have already <lb/>
            travelled half-way thither. You cannot and you ought not <lb/>
            to call me back." So saying he ordered all light to be <lb/>
            excluded from the room and shut himself up in the dark­ <lb/>
            ness. When his determination became known there was a <lb/>
            general feeling of pleasure at the prey being snatched <lb/>
            out of the jaws of those ravening wolves. His prosecutors, <lb/>
            at the instance of Sejanus, went to the judgment-seat of <lb/>
            the consuls, complained that Cordus was dying, and begged <lb/>
            the consuls to interpose to prevent his doing what they <lb/>
            themselves had driven him to do; so true was it that <lb/>
            Cordus appeared to them to be escaping: an important <lb/>
            matter was at stake, namely, whether the accused should <lb/>
            lose the right to die. While this point was being debated, <lb/>
            and the prosecutors were going to attend the court a <lb/>
            second time, he had set himself free from them. Do you <lb/>
            see, Marcia, how suddenly evil days come upon a man ? <pb n="198"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            and do you weep because one of your family could not <lb/>
            avoid dying ? one of your family was within a very little <lb/>
            of not being allowed to die.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Besides the fact that everything that is future <lb/>
            is uncertain, and the only certainty is that it is more likely <lb/>
            to turn out ill than well, our spirits find the path to the <lb/>
            Gods above easiest when it is soon allowed to leave the <lb/>
            society of mankind, because it has then contracted fewest <lb/>
            impurities to weigh it down : if set free before they become <lb/>
            hardened worldlings, before earthly things have sunk too <lb/>
            deep into them, they fly all the more lightly back to the <lb/>
            place from whence they came, and all the more easily wash <lb/>
            away the stains and defilements which they may have con­ <lb/>
            tracted. Great minds never love to linger long in the <lb/>
            body: they are eager to burst its bonds and escape from <lb/>
            it, they chafe at the narrowness of their prison, having <lb/>
            been wont to wander through space, and from aloft in the <lb/>
            upper air to look down with contempt upon human affairs. <lb/>
            Hence it is that Plato declares that the wise man's mind is <lb/>
            entirely given up to death, longs for it, contemplates it, <lb/>
            and through his eagerness for it is always striving after <lb/>
            things which lie beyond this life. Why, Marcia, when you <lb/>
            saw him while yet young displaying the wisdom of age, <lb/>
            with a mind that could rise superior to all sensual enjoy­ <lb/>
            ments, faultless and without a blemish, able to win riches <lb/>
            without greediness, public office without ambition, pleasure <lb/>
            without extravagance, did you suppose it would long be <lb/>
            your lot to keep him safe by your side ? Whatever has <lb/>
            arrived at perfection, is ripe for dissolution. Consummate <lb/>
            virtue flees away and betakes itself out of our sight, and <lb/>
            those things which come to maturity in the first stage of <lb/>
            their being do not wait for the last. The brighter a fire <lb/>
            glows, the sooner it goes out: it lasts longer when it is <lb/>
            made up with bad and slowly burning fuel, and shows a <lb/>
            dull light through a cloud of smoke: its being poorly fed <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            makes it linger all the longer. So also the more brilliant <lb/>
            men's minds, the shorter lived they are: for when there is <lb/>
            no room for further growth, the end is near. Fabianus <lb/>
            tells us, what our parents themselves have seen, that there <lb/>
            was at Rome a boy of gigantic stature, exceeding that of a <lb/>
            man: but he soon died, and every sensible person always <lb/>
            said that he would soon die, for he could not live to reach <lb/>
            the age which he had assumed before it was due. So it is: <lb/>
            too complete maturity is a proof that destruction is near, <lb/>
            and the end approaches when growth is over.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Begin to reckon his age, not by years, but by <lb/>
            virtues: he lived long enough. He was left as a ward in <lb/>
            the care of guardians up to his fourteenth year, and never <lb/>
            passed out of that of his mother: when he had a household <lb/>
            of his own he was loth to leave yours, and continued to <lb/>
            dwell under his mother's roof, though few sons can endure <lb/>
            to live under their father's. Though a youth whose height, <lb/>
            beauty, and vigour of body destined him for the army, yet <lb/>
            he refused to serve, that he might not be separated from <lb/>
            you. Consider, Marcia, how seldom mothers who live in <lb/>
            separate houses see their children: consider how they lose <lb/>
            and pass in anxiety all those years during which they have <lb/>
            sons in the army, and you will see that this time, none of <lb/>
            which you lost, was of considerable extent: he never went <lb/>
            out of your sight: it was under your eyes that he applied <lb/>
            himself to the cultivation of an admirable intellect and one <lb/>
            which would have rivalled that of his grandfather, had it <lb/>
            not been hindered by shyness, which has concealed many <lb/>
            men's accomplishments: though a youth of unusual beauty, <lb/>
            and living among such throngs of women who made it their <lb/>
            business to seduce men, he gratified the wishes of none of <lb/>
            them, and when the effrontery of some led them so far as <lb/>
            actually to tempt him, he blushed as deeply at having <lb/>
            found favour in their eyes as though he had been guilty. <lb/>
            By this holiness of life he caused himself, while yet quite a <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            boy, to be thought worthy of the priesthood, which no <lb/>
            doubt he owed to, his mother's influence; but even his <lb/>
            mother's influence would have had no weight if the candi­ <lb/>
            date for whom it was exerted had been unfit for the post. <lb/>
            Dwell upon these virtues, and nurse your son as it were in <lb/>
            your lap: now he is more at leisure to respond to your <lb/>
            caresses, he has nothing to call him away from you, he <lb/>
            will never be an anxiety or a sorrow to you. You have <lb/>
            grieved at the only grief so good a son could cause you : <lb/>
            all else is beyond the power of fortune to harm, and is full <lb/>
            of pleasure, if only you know how to make use of your son, <lb/>
            if you do but know what his most precious quality was. <lb/>
            It is merely the outward semblance of your son that has <lb/>
            perished, his likeness, and that not a very good one; he <lb/>
            himself is immortal, and is now in a far better state, set <lb/>
            free from the burden of all that was not his own, and left <lb/>
            simply by himself: all this apparatus which you see about <lb/>
            us of bones and sinews, this covering of skin, this face, <lb/>
            these our servants the hands, and all the rest of our environ­ <lb/>
            ment, are but chains and darkness to the soul: they over­ <lb/>
            whelm it, choke it, corrupt it, fill it with false ideas, and <lb/>
            keep it at a distance from its own true sphere: it has to <lb/>
            struggle continually against this burden of the flesh, lest <lb/>
            it be dragged down and sunk by it. It ever strives to <lb/>
            rise up again to the place from whence it was sent down <lb/>
            on earth: there eternal rest awaits it, there it will behold <lb/>
            what is pure and clear, in place of what is foul and turbid.</p>
          <p>XXV. You need not, therefore, hasten to the burial- <lb/>
            place of your son : that which lies there is but the worst <lb/>
            part of him and that which gave him most trouble, only <lb/>
            bones and ashes, which are no more parts of him than <lb/>
            clothes or other coverings of his body. He is complete, <lb/>
            and without leaving any part of himself behind on earth <lb/>
            has taken wing and gone away altogether: he has tarried <lb/>
            a brief space above us while his soul was being cleansed <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            and purified from the vices and rust which all mortal <lb/>
            lives must contract, and from thence he will rise to <lb/>
            the high heavens and join the souls of the blessed : a <lb/>
            saintly company will welcome him thither,—Scipios and <lb/>
            Catos ; and among the rest of those who have held life <lb/>
            cheap and set themselves free, thanks to death, albeit <lb/>
            all there are alike akin, your father, Marcia, will embrace <lb/>
            his grandson as he rejoices in the unwonted light, will <lb/>
            teach him the motion of the stars which are so hear to <lb/>
            them, and introduce him with joy into all the secrets of <lb/>
            nature, not by guesswork but by real knowledge. Even <lb/>
            as a stranger is grateful to one who shows him the way <lb/>
            about an unknown city, so is a searcher after the causes of <lb/>
            what he sees in the heavens to one of his own family who <lb/>
            can explain them to him. He will delight in gazing deep <lb/>
            down upon the earth, for it is a delight to look from aloft <lb/>
            at what one has left below. Bear yourself, therefore, <lb/>
            Marcia, as though you were placed before the eyes of your <lb/>
            father and your son, yet not such as you knew them, but <lb/>
            far loftier beings, placed in a higher sphere. Blush, then, <lb/>
            to do any mean or common action, or to weep for those <lb/>
            your relatives who have been changed for the better. <lb/>
            Free to roam through the open, boundless realms of the <lb/>
            everliving universe, they are not hindered in their course <lb/>
            by intervening seas, lofty mountains, impassable valleys, <lb/>
            or the treacherous flats of the Syrtes : they find a level <lb/>
            path everywhere, are swift and ready of motion, and are <lb/>
            permeated in their turn by the stars and dwell together <lb/>
            with them.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Imagine then, Marcia, that your father, whose <lb/>
            influence over you was as great as yours over your son, no <lb/>
            longer in that frame of mind in which he deplored the <lb/>
            civil wars, or in which he for ever proscribed those who <lb/>
            would have proscribed him, but in a mood as much more <lb/>
            joyful as his abode now is higher than of old, is saying, as <pb n="202"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VI. </note> <lb/>
            he looks down from the height of heaven, " My daughter, <lb/>
            why does this sorrow possess you for so long? why do you <lb/>
            live in such ignorance of the truth, as to think that your <lb/>
            son has been unfairly dealt with because he has returned to <lb/>
            his ancestors in his prime, without decay of body or mind, <lb/>
            leaving his family flourishing ? Do you not know with <lb/>
            what storms Fortune unsettles everything ? how she proves <lb/>
            kind and compliant to none save to those who have the <lb/>
            fewest possible dealings with her ? Need I remind you of <lb/>
            kings who would have been the happiest of mortals had <lb/>
            death sooner withdrawn them from the ruin which was <lb/>
            approaching them ? or of Roman generals, whose greatness, <lb/>
            had but a few years been taken from their lives, would <lb/>
            have wanted nothing to render it complete ? or of men of <lb/>
            the highest distinction and noblest birth who have calmly <lb/>
            offered their necks to the stroke of a soldier's sword ? <lb/>
            Look at your father and your grandfather : the former fell <lb/>
            into the hands of a foreign murderer: I allowed no man <lb/>
            to take any liberties with me, and by abstinence from food <lb/>
            showed that my spirit was as great as my writings had re­ <lb/>
            presented it. Why, then, should that member of our house­ <lb/>
            hold who died most happily of all be mourned in it the <lb/>
            longest ? We have all assembled together, and, not being <lb/>
            plunged in utter darkness, we see that with you on earth <lb/>
            there is nothing to be wished for, nothing grand or magni­ <lb/>
            ficent, but all is mean, sad, anxious, and hardly receives a <lb/>
            fractional part of the clear light in which we dwell. I <lb/>
            need not say that here are no frantic charges of rival <lb/>
            armies, no fleets shattering one another, no parricides, <lb/>
            actual or meditated, no courts where men babble over law­ <lb/>
            suits for days together, here is nothing underhand, all <lb/>
            hearts and minds are open and unveiled, our life is public <lb/>
            and known to all, and that we command a view of all time <lb/>
            and of things to come. I used to take pleasure in com­ <lb/>
            piling the history of what took place in one century among <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            a few people in the most out-of-the-way corner of the <lb/>
            world: here I enjoy the spectacle of all the centuries, the <lb/>
            whole chain of events from age to age as long as years <lb/>
            have been. I may view kingdoms when they rise and <lb/>
            when they fall, and behold the ruin of cities and the new <lb/>
            channels made by the sea. If it will be any consolation to <lb/>
            you in your bereavement to know that it is the common <lb/>
            lot of all, be assured that nothing will continue to stand in <lb/>
            the place in which it now stands, but that time will lay <lb/>
            everything low and bear it away with itself : it will sport, <lb/>
            not only with men-for how small a part are they of the <lb/>
            dominion of Fortune ? — but with districts, provinces, <lb/>
            quarters of the world : it will efface entire mountains, and <lb/>
            in other places will pile new rocks on high : it will dry up <lb/>
            seas, change the course of rivers, destroy the intercourse <lb/>
            of nation with nation, and break up the communion and <lb/>
            fellowship of the human race: in other regions it will <lb/>
            swallow up cities by opening vast chasms in the earth, <lb/>
            will shake them with earthquakes, will breathe forth pesti­ <lb/>
            lence from the nether world, cover all habitable ground <lb/>
            with inundations and destroy every creature in the flooded <lb/>
            world, or burn up all mortals by a huge conflagration. <lb/>
            When the time shall arrive for the world to be brought to <lb/>
            an end, that it may begin its life anew, all the forces of <lb/>
            nature will perish in conflict with one another, the stars <lb/>
            will be dashed together, and all the lights which now gleam <lb/>
            in regular order in various parts of the sky will then blaze <lb/>
            in one fire with all their fuel burning at once. Then we <lb/>
            also, the souls of the blest and the heirs of eternal life, <lb/>
            whenever God thinks fit to reconstruct the universe, when <lb/>
            all things are settling down again, we also, being a small <lb/>
            accessory to the universal wreck,1 shall be changed into our <lb/>
            old elements. Happy is your son, Marcia, in that he already <lb/>
            knows this." <note type="footnote"> 1 Buinae ; Koch's urinae is a misprint. </note> <pb n="204"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            LL men, brother Gallic, wish to live happily, but are <lb/>
            dull at perceiving exactly what it is that makes life <lb/>
            happy: and so far is it from being easy to attain to <lb/>
            happiness that the more eagerly a man struggles to <lb/>
            reach it the further he departs from it, if he takes the <lb/>
            wrong road; for, since this leads in the opposite direction, <lb/>
            his very swiftness carries him all the further away. We <lb/>
            mast therefore first define clearly what it is at which we <lb/>
            aim: next we must consider by what path we may most <lb/>
            speedily reach it, for on our journey itself, provided it be <lb/>
            made in the right direction, we shall learn how much <lb/>
            progress we have made each day, and how much nearer we <lb/>
            are to the goal towards which our natural desires urge us. <lb/>
            But as long as we wander at random, not following any <lb/>
            guide except the shouts and discordant clamours of those <lb/>
            who invite us to proceed in different directions, our short <lb/>
            life will be wasted in useless roamings, even if we labour <lb/>
            both day and night to get a good understanding. Let us not <lb/>
            therefore decide whither we must tend, and by what path, <lb/>
            without the advice of some experienced person who has ex­ <lb/>
            plored the region which we are about to enter, because this <pb n="205"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            journey is not subject to the same conditions as others ; <lb/>
            for in them some distinctly understood track and inquiries <lb/>
            made of the natives make it impossible for us to go wrong, <lb/>
            but here the most beaten and frequented tracks are those <lb/>
            which lead us most astray. Nothing, therefore, is more <lb/>
            important than that we should not, like sheep, follow the <lb/>
            flock that has gone before us, and thus proceed not whither <lb/>
            we ought, but whither the rest are going. Now nothing <lb/>
            gets us into greater troubles than our subservience to <lb/>
            common rumour, and our habit of thinking that those <lb/>
            things are best which are most generally received as such, <lb/>
            of taking many counterfeits for truly good things, and of <lb/>
            living not by reason but by imitation of others. This is <lb/>
            the cause of those great heaps into which men rush till <lb/>
            they are piled one upon another. In a great crush of <lb/>
            people, when the crowd presses upon itself, no one can <lb/>
            fall without drawing some one else down upon him, and <lb/>
            those who go before cause the destruction of those who <lb/>
            follow them. You may .observe the same thing in human <lb/>
            life : no one can merely go wrong by himself, but he must <lb/>
            become both the cause and adviser of another's wrong­ <lb/>
            doing. It is harmful to follow the march of those who go <lb/>
            before us, and since every one had rather believe another <lb/>
            than form his own opinion, we never pass a deliberate <lb/>
            judgment upon life, but some traditional error always <lb/>
            entangles us and brings us to ruin, and we perish because <lb/>
            we follow other men's examples: we should be cured of <lb/>
            this if we were to disengage ourselves from the herd ; but <lb/>
            as it is, the mob is ready to fight against reason in defence <lb/>
            of its own mistake. Consequently the same thing happens <lb/>
            as at elections, where, when the fickle breeze of popular <lb/>
            favour has veered round, those who have been chosen <lb/>
            consuls and praetors are viewed with admiration by the <lb/>
            very men who made them so. That we should all approve <lb/>
            and disapprove of the same things is the end of every <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            decision which is given according to the voice of the <lb/>
            majority.</p>
          <p>II. When we are considering a happy life, you cannot <lb/>
            answer me as though after a division of the House, " This <lb/>
            view has most supporters ; " because for that very reason <lb/>
            it is the worse of the two : matters do not stand so well <lb/>
            with mankind that the majority should prefer the better <lb/>
            course : the more people do a thing the worse it is likely to <lb/>
            be. Let us therefore inquire, not what is most commonly <lb/>
            done, but what is best for us to do, and what will establish <lb/>
            us in the possession of undying happiness, not what is <lb/>
            approved of by the vulgar, the worst possible exponents of <lb/>
            truth. By " the vulgar" I mean both those who wear <lb/>
            woollen cloaks and those who wear crowns; 1 for I do <lb/>
            not regard the colour of the clothes with which they are <lb/>
            covered: I do not trust my eyes to tell me what a man is : <lb/>
            I have a better and more trustworthy light by which I can <lb/>
            distinguish what is true from what is false : let the mind <lb/>
            find out what is good for the mind. If a man ever allows <lb/>
            his mind some breathing space and has leisure for com­ <lb/>
            muning with himself, what truths he will confess to <lb/>
            himself, after having been put to the torture by his own <lb/>
            self! He will say, "Whatever I have hitherto done I <lb/>
            wish were undone : when I think over what I have said, I <lb/>
            envy dumb people: whatever I have longed for seems to <lb/>
            have been what my enemies would pray might befall me : <lb/>
            good heaven, how far more endurable what I have feared <lb/>
            seems to be than what I have lusted after. I have been at <lb/>
            enmity with many men, and have changed my dislike of <lb/>
            them into friendship, if friendship can exist between bad <lb/>
            men: yet I have not yet become reconciled to myself. I <lb/>
            have striven with all my strength to raise myself above the <note type="footnote"> 1 Lipsius's conjecture, "those who are dressed in white as well as <lb/>
            those who are dressed in coloured clothes," alluding to the white robes <lb/>
            of candidates for office, seems reasonable. </note> <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            common herd, and to make myself remarkable for some <lb/>
            talent: what have I effected save to make myself a mark <lb/>
            for the arrows of my enemies, and show those who hate me <lb/>
            where to wound me ? Do you see those who praise your <lb/>
            eloquence, who covet your wealth, who court your favour, <lb/>
            or who vaunt your power ? All these either are, or, which <lb/>
            comes to the same thing, may be your enemies : the <lb/>
            number of those who envy you is as great as that of those <lb/>
            who admire you ; why do I not rather seek for some good <lb/>
            thing which I can use and feel, not one which I can show ? <lb/>
            these good things which men gaze at in wonder, which <lb/>
            they crowd to see, which one points out to another with <lb/>
            speechless admiration, are outwardly brilliant, but within <lb/>
            are miseries to those who possess them."</p>
          <p>III. Let us seek for some blessing, which does not <lb/>
            merely look fine, but is sound and good throughout alike, <lb/>
            and most beautiful in the parts which are least seen: let us <lb/>
            unearth this. It is not far distant from us ; it can be dis­ <lb/>
            covered : all that is necessary is to know whither to stretch <lb/>
            out your hand: but, as it is, we behave as though we were <lb/>
            in the dark, and reach out beyond what'is nearest to us, <lb/>
            striking as we do so against the very things that we want. <lb/>
            However, that I may not draw you into digressions, I will <lb/>
            pass over the opinions of other philosophers, because it <lb/>
            would take a long time to state and confute them all: take <lb/>
            ours. When, however, I say " ours," I do not bind myself <lb/>
            to any one of the chiefs of the Stoic school, for I too have <lb/>
            a right to form my own opinion. I shall, therefore, follow <lb/>
            the authority of some of them, but shall ask some others to <lb/>
            discriminate their meaning :1 perhaps, when after having <note type="footnote"> 1 The Latin words are literally " to divide " their vote, that is, " to <lb/>
            separate things of different kinds comprised in a single vote so that they <lb/>
            might be voted for separately."-ANDREWS. <lb/>
            Séneque fait allusion ici a une coutume pratiquée dans les assemblies <lb/>
            du S6nat; et il nous l'explique lui-même ailleurs d'uu manière très claire: </note> <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            reported all their opinions, I am asked for my own, I shall <lb/>
            impugn none of my predecessors' decisions, and shall say, <lb/>
            " I will also add somewhat to them." Meanwhile I follow <lb/>
            nature, which is a point upon which every one of the Stoic <lb/>
            philosophers are agreed: true wisdom consists in not <lb/>
            departing from nature and in moulding our conduct <lb/>
            according to her laws and model. A happy life, therefore, <lb/>
            is one which is in accordance with its own nature, and <lb/>
            cannot be brought about unless in the first place the mind <lb/>
            be sound and remain so without interruption, and next, be <lb/>
            bold and vigorous, enduring all things with most admirable <lb/>
            courage, suited to the times in which it lives, careful of the <lb/>
            body and its appurtenances, yet not troublesomely careful. <lb/>
            It must also set due value upon all the things which adorn <lb/>
            our lives, without over-estimating any one of them, and <lb/>
            must be able to enjoy the bounty of Fortune without <lb/>
            becoming her slave. You understand without my men­ <lb/>
            tioning it that an unbroken calm and freedom ensue, when <lb/>
            we have driven away all those things which either excite <lb/>
            us or alarm us : for in the place of sensual pleasures and <lb/>
            and those slight perishable matters which are connected <lb/>
            with the basest crimes, we thus gain an immense, un­ <lb/>
            changeable, equable joy, together with peace, calmness and <lb/>
            greatness of mind, and kindliness: for all savageness is a <lb/>
            sign of weakness.</p>
          <p>IV. Our highest good may also be defined otherwise, <lb/>
            that is to say, the same idea may be expressed in different <lb/>
            language. Just as the same army may at one time be <lb/>
            extended more widely, at another contracted into a smaller <lb/>

            strength and loyalty remain unchanged ; so also our defini­ <lb/>
            tion of the highest good may in some cases be expressed <lb/>
            diffusely and at great length, while in others it is put into <lb/>
            a short and concise form. Thus, it will come to the same <lb/>
            thing, if I say " The highest good is a mind which despises <lb/>
            the accidents of fortune, and takes pleasure in virtue " : or, <lb/>
            " It is an unconquerable strength of mind, knowing the <lb/>
            world well, gentle in its dealings, showing great courtesy <lb/>
            and consideration for those with whom it is brought into <lb/>
            contact." Or we may choose to define it by calling that <lb/>
            man happy who knows good and bad only in the form of <lb/>
            good or bad minds: who worships honour, and is satisfied <lb/>
            with his own virtue, who is neither puffed up by good <lb/>
            fortune nor cast down by evil fortune, who knows no other <lb/>
            good than that which he is able to bestow upon himself, whose <lb/>
            real pleasure lies in despising pleasures. If you choose to <lb/>
            pursue this digression further, you can put this same idea <lb/>
            into many other forms, without impairing or weakening <lb/>
            its meaning: for what prevents our saying that a happy <lb/>
            life consists in a mind which is free, upright, undaunted, <lb/>
            and steadfast, beyond the influence of fear or desire, which <lb/>
            thinks nothing good except honour, and nothing bad except <lb/>
            shame, and regards everything else as a mass of mean <lb/>
            details which can neither add anything to nor take any­ <lb/>
            thing away from the happiness of life, but which come and <lb/>
            go without either increasing or diminishing the highest <lb/>
            good ? A man of these principles, whether he will or no, <lb/>
            must be accompanied by a continual cheerfulness, a high <lb/>
            happiness, which comes indeed from on high because he <lb/>
            delights in what he has, and desires no greater pleasures <lb/>
            than those which his home affords. Is he not right in <lb/>
            allowing these to turn the scale against petty, ridiculous, <lb/>
            and shortlived movements of his wretched body ? on the <lb/>
            day on which he becomes proof against pleasure, he also <lb/>
            becomes proof against pain. See, on the other hand, how <note type="footnote"> p </note> <pb n="210"/>

            evil and guilty a slavery the man is forced to serve who is <lb/>
            dominated in turn by pleasures and pains, those most un­ <lb/>
            trustworthy and passionate of masters. We must, there­ <lb/>
            fore, escape from them into freedom. This nothing will <lb/>
            bestow upon us save contempt of Fortune: but if we attain <lb/>
            to this, then there will dawn upon us those invaluable <lb/>
            blessings, the repose of a mind that is at rest in a safe haven, <lb/>
            its lofty imaginings, its great and steady delight at casting <lb/>
            out errors and learning to know the truth, its courtesy, and <lb/>
            its cheerfulness, in all of which we shall take delight, not <lb/>
            regarding them as good things, but as proceeding from the <lb/>
            proper good of man.</p>
          <p>V. Since I have begun to make my definitions without <lb/>
            a too strict adherence to the letter, a man may be called <lb/>
            " happy " who, thanks to reason, has ceased either to hope <lb/>
            or to fear: but rocks also feel neither fear nor sadness, nor <lb/>
            do cattle, yet no one would call those things happy which <lb/>
            cannot comprehend what happiness is. With them you <lb/>
            may class men whose dull nature and want of self-know­ <lb/>
            ledge reduces them to the level of cattle, mere animals: <lb/>
            there is no difference between the one and the other, be­ <lb/>
            cause the latter have no reason, while the former have only <lb/>
            a corrupted form of it, crooked and cunning to their own <lb/>
            hurt. For no one can be styled happy who is beyond the <lb/>
            influence of truth: and consequently a happy life is un­ <lb/>
            changeable, and is founded upon a true and trustworthy dis­ <lb/>
            cernment ; for the mind is uncontaminated and freed from <lb/>
            all evils only when it is able to escape not merely from <lb/>
            wounds but also from scratches, when it will always be able <lb/>
            to maintain the position which it has taken up, and defend <lb/>
            it even against the angry assaults of Fortune: for with <lb/>
            regard to sensual pleasures, though they were to surround <lb/>
            one on every side, and use every means of assault, trying <lb/>
            to win over the mind by caresses and making trial of every <lb/>
            conceivable stratagem to attract either our entire selves or <pb n="211"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            our separate parts, yet what mortal that retains any traces <lb/>
            of human origin would wish to be tickled day and night, and, <lb/>
            neglecting his mind, to devote himself to bodily enjoyments?</p>
          <p>VI. " But," says our adversary, " the mind also will <lb/>
            have pleasures of its own." Let it have them, then, and <lb/>
            let it sit in judgment over luxury and pleasures; let it in­ <lb/>
            dulge itself to the full in all those matters which give <lb/>
            sensual delights: then let it look back upon what it enjoyed <lb/>
            before, and with all those faded sensualities fresh in its <lb/>
            memory let it rejoice and look eagerly forward to those <lb/>
            other pleasures which it experienced long ago, and intends <lb/>
            to experience again, and while the body lies in helpless re­ <lb/>
            pletion in the present, let it send its thoughts onward <lb/>
            towards the future, and take stock of its hopes : all this will <lb/>
            make it appear, in my opinion, yet more wretched, because <lb/>
            it is insanity to choose evil instead of good : now no insane <lb/>
            person can be happy, and no one can be sane if he regards <lb/>
            what is injurious as the highest good and strives to obtain <lb/>
            it. The happy man, therefore, is he who can make a right <lb/>
            judgment in all things: he is happy who in his present <lb/>
            circumstances, whatever they may be, is satisfied and on <lb/>
            friendly terms with the conditions of his life. That man is <lb/>
            happy, whose reason recommends to him the whole posture <lb/>
            of his affairs.</p>
          <p>VII. Even those. very people who declare the highest <lb/>
            good to be in the belly, see what a dishonourable position <lb/>
            they have assigned to it: and therefore they say that plea­ <lb/>
            sure cannot be parted from virtue, and that no one can <lb/>
            either live honourably without living cheerfully, nor yet live <lb/>
            cheerfully without living honourably. I do not see how <lb/>
            these very different matters can have any connexion with <lb/>
            one another. What is there, I pray you, to prevent virtue <lb/>
            existing apart from pleasure ? of course the reason is that <lb/>
            all good things derive their origin from virtue, and there­ <lb/>
            fore even those things which you cherish and seek for <pb n="212"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            come originally from its roots. Yet, if they were entirely <lb/>
            inseparable, we, should not see some things to be pleasant, <lb/>
            but not honourable, and others most honourable indeed, <lb/>
            but hard and only to be attained by suffering. Add <lb/>
            to this, that pleasure visits the basest lives, but virtue <lb/>
            cannot co-exist with an evil life ; yet some unhappy people <lb/>
            are not without pleasure, nay, it is owing to pleasure itself <lb/>
            that they are unhappy; and this could not take place <lb/>
            if pleasure had any connexion with virtue, whereas virtue is <lb/>
            often without pleasure, and never stands in need of it. <lb/>
            Why do you put together two things which are unlike and <lb/>
            even incompatible one with another? virtue is a lofty <lb/>
            quality, sublime, royal, unconquerable, untiring: pleasure <lb/>
            is low, slavish, weakly, perishable; its haunts and homes <lb/>
            are the brothel and the tavern. You will meet virtue in <lb/>
            the temple, the market-place, the senate house, manning <lb/>
            the walls, covered with dust, sunburnt, horny-handed : you <lb/>
            will find pleasure skulking out of sight, seeking for shady <lb/>
            nooks at the public baths, hot chambers, and places which <lb/>
            dread the visits of the aedile, soft, effeminate, reeking of <lb/>
            wine and perfumes, pale or perhaps painted and made up <lb/>
            with cosmetics. The highest good is immortal: it knows <lb/>
            no ending, and does not admit of either satiety or regret: <lb/>
            for a right-thinking mind never alters or becomes hateful <lb/>
            to itself, nor do the best things ever undergo any change: <lb/>
            but pleasure dies at the very moment when it charms us <lb/>
            most: it has no great scope, and therefore it soon cloys and <lb/>
            wearies us, and fades away as soon as its first impulse is <lb/>
            over: indeed, we cannot depend upon anything whose <lb/>
            nature is to change. Consequently it is not even possible <lb/>
            that there should be any solid substance in that which <lb/>
            comes and goes so swiftly, and which perishes by the very <lb/>
            exercise of its own functions, for it arrives at a point at <lb/>
            which it ceases to be, and even while it is beginning always <lb/>
            keeps its end in view.</p><pb n="213"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> VIII. What answer are we to make to the reflexion that <lb/>
            pleasure belongs to good and bad men alike, and that bad <lb/>
            men take as much delight in their shame as good men in <lb/>
            noble things ? This was why the ancients bade us lead the <lb/>
            highest, not the most pleasant life, in order that pleasure <lb/>
            might not be the guide but the companion of a right-think­ <lb/>
            ing and honourable mind; for it is Nature whom we ought <lb/>
            to make our guide: let our reason watch her, and be <lb/>
            advised by her. To live happily, then, is the same thing as <lb/>
            to live according to Nature : what this may be, I will ex­ <lb/>
            plain. If we guard the endowments of the body and the ad­ <lb/>
            vantages of nature with care and fearlessness, as things soon <lb/>
            to depart and given to us only for a day; if we do not fall <lb/>
            under their dominion, nor allow ourselves to become the <lb/>
            slaves of what is no part of our own being; if we assign to <lb/>
            all bodily pleasures and external delights the same position <lb/>
            which is held by auxiliaries and light-armed troops in a <lb/>
            camp; if we make them our servants, not our masters-then <lb/>
            and then only are they of value to our minds. A man <lb/>
            should be unbiassed and not to be conquered by external <lb/>
            things : he ought to admire himself alone, to feel confidence <lb/>
            in his own spirit, and so to order his life as to be ready alike <lb/>
            for good or for bad fortune. Let not his confidence be without <lb/>
            knowledge, nor his knowledge without steadfastness: let <lb/>
            him always abide by what he has once determined, and let <lb/>
            there be no erasure in his doctrines. It will be under­ <lb/>
            stood, even though I append it not, that such a man will be <lb/>
            tranquil and composed in his demeanour, high-minded and <lb/>
            courteous in his actions. Let reason be encouraged by the <lb/>
            senses to seek for the truth, and draw its first princi­ <lb/>
            ples from thence : indeed it has no other base of operations <lb/>
            or place from which to start in pursuit of truth : it must fall <lb/>
            back upon itself. Even the all-embracing. universe and <lb/>
            God who is its guide extends himself forth into outward <lb/>
            things, and yet altogether returns from all sides back to <pb n="214"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            himself. Let our mind do the same thing : when, follow­ <lb/>
            ing its bodily senses it has by means of them sent itself <lb/>
            forth into the things of the outward world, let it remain <lb/>
            still their master and its own. By this means we shall ob­ <lb/>
            tain a strength and an ability which are united and allied <lb/>
            together, and shall derive from it that reason which never <lb/>
            halts between two opinions, nor is dull in forming its percep­ <lb/>
            tions, beliefs, or convictions. Such a mind, when it has <lb/>
            ranged itself in order, made its various parts agree together, <lb/>
            and, if I may so express myself, harmonized them, has <lb/>
            attained to the highest good: for it has nothing evil or <lb/>
            hazardous remaining, nothing to shake it or make it <lb/>
            stumble: it will do everything under the guidance of its <lb/>
            own will, and nothing unexpected will befal it, but what­ <lb/>
            ever may be done by it will turn out well, and that, too, <lb/>
            readily and easily, without the doer having recourse to any <lb/>
            underhand devices: for slow and hesitating action are the <lb/>
            signs of discord and want of settled purpose. You may, <lb/>
            then, boldly declare that the highest good is singleness of <lb/>
            mind: for where agreement and unity are, there must the <lb/>
            virtues be : it is the vices that are at war one with another.</p>
          <p>IX. "But," says our adversary, "you yourself only <lb/>
            practise virtue because you hope to obtain some pleasure <lb/>
            from it." In the first place, even though virtue may afford <lb/>
            us pleasure, still we do not seek after her on that account: <lb/>
            for she does not bestow this, but bestows this to boot, nor <lb/>
            is this the end for which she labours, but her labour wins <lb/>
            this also, although it be directed to another lend. As in a <lb/>
            tilled-field, when ploughed for corn, some flowers are found <lb/>
            amongst it, and yet, though these posies may charm the <lb/>
            eye, all this labour was not spent in order to produce them <lb/>
            -the man who sowed the field had another object in view, <lb/>
            he gained this over and above it-so pleasure is not the <lb/>
            reward or the cause of virtue, but comes in addition to it; <lb/>
            nor do we choose virtue because she gives us pleasure, but <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            she gives us pleasure also if we choose her. The highest good <lb/>
            lies in the act of choosing her, and in the attitude of the <lb/>
            noblest minds, which when once it has fulfilled its function <lb/>
            and established itself within its own limits has attained to <lb/>
            the highest good, and needs nothing more: for there is <lb/>
            nothing outside of the whole, any more than there is anything <lb/>
            beyond the end. You are mistaken, therefore, when you <lb/>
            ask me what it is on account of which I seek after virtue : <lb/>
            for you are seeking for something above the highest. Do <lb/>
            you ask what I seek from virtue ? I answer, Herself: for <lb/>
            shoe has nothing better; she is her own reward. Does this <lb/>
            not appear great enough, when I tell you that the highest <lb/>
            good is an unyielding strength of mind, wisdom, magna­ <lb/>
            nimity, sound judgment, freedom, harmony, beauty ? Do <lb/>
            you still ask me for something greater, of which these may <lb/>
            be regarded as the attributes ? Why do you talk of pleasures <lb/>
            to me ? I am seeking to find what is good for man, not for <lb/>
            his belly; why, cattle and whales have larger ones than he.</p>
          <p>X. " You purposely misunderstand what I say," says he, <lb/>
            " for I too say that no one can live pleasantly unless he <lb/>
            lives honorably also, and this cannot be the case with <lb/>
            dumb animals who measure the extent of their happiness <lb/>
            by that of their food. I loudly and publicly proclaim that <lb/>
            what I call a pleasant life cannot exist without the addition <lb/>
            of virtue." Yet who does not know that the greatest <lb/>
            fools drink the deepest of those pleasures of yours ? or that <lb/>
            vice is full of enjoyments, and that the mind itself suggests <lb/>
            to itself many perverted, vicious forms of pleasure ?-in the <lb/>
            first place arrogance, excessive self-esteem, swaggering pre­ <lb/>
            cedence over other men, a shortsighted, nay, a blind devotion <lb/>
            to his own interests, dissolute luxury, excessive delight <lb/>
            springing from the most trifling and childish causes, and also <lb/>
            talkativeness, pride that takes a pleasure in insulting others, <lb/>
            sloth, and the decay of a dull mind which goes to sleep over <lb/>
            itself. All these are dissipated by virtue, which plucks a <pb n="216"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            man by the ear, and measures the value of pleasures before <lb/>
            she permits them to be used; nor does she set much store <lb/>
            by those which she allows to pass current, for she merely <lb/>
            allows their use, and her cheerfulness is not due to her use <lb/>
            of them, but to her moderation in using them. " Yet <lb/>
            when moderation lessens pleasure, it impairs the highest <lb/>
            good." You devote yourself to pleasures, I check them; <lb/>
            you indulge in pleasure, I use it; you think that it is the <lb/>
            highest good, I do not even think it to be good: for the <lb/>
            sake of pleasure I do nothing, you do everything.</p>
          <p>XI. When I say that I do nothing for the sake of pleasure, <lb/>
            I allude to that wise man, whom alone you admit to be <lb/>
            capable of pleasure : now I do not call a man wise who is <lb/>
            overcome by anything, let alone by pleasure: yet, if engrossed <lb/>
            by pleasure, how will he resist toil, danger, want, and all the <lb/>
            ills which surround and threaten the life of man ? How <lb/>
            will he bear the sight of death or of pain ? How will he <lb/>
            endure the tumult of the world, and make head against so <lb/>
            many most active foes, if he be conquered by so effeminate <lb/>
            an antagonist ? He will do whatever pleasure advises <lb/>
            him : well, do you not see how many things it will advise <lb/>
            him to do ? " It will not," says our adversary, " be able to <lb/>
            give him any bad advice, because it is combined with <lb/>
            virtue ?" Again, do you not see what a poor kind of <lb/>
            highest good that must be which requires a guardian to <lb/>
            ensure its being good at all ? and how is virtue to rule <lb/>
            pleasure if she follows it, seeing that to follow is the duty <lb/>
            of a subordinate, to rule that of a commander? do you put <lb/>
            that which commands in the background ? According to <lb/>
            your school, virtue has the dignified office of preliminary <lb/>
            taster of pleasures. We shall, however, see whether virtue <lb/>
            still remains virtue among those who treat her with such <lb/>
            contempt, for if she leaves her proper station she can no <lb/>
            longer keep her proper name: in the meanwhile, to keep <lb/>
            to the point, I will show you many men beset by pleasures, <pb n="217"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            men upon whom Fortune has showered all her gifts, whom <lb/>
            you must needs admit to be bad men. Look at Nomen­ <lb/>
            tanus and Apicius, who digest all the good things, as they <lb/>
            call them, of the sea and land, and review upon their tables <lb/>
            the whole animal kingdom. Look at them as they lie on <lb/>
            beds of roses gloating over their banquet, delighting their <lb/>
            ears with music, their eyes with exhibitions, their palates <lb/>
            with flavours: their whole bodies are titillated with soft <lb/>
            and soothing applications, and lest even their nostrils should <lb/>
            be idle, the very place in which they solemnize1 the rites of <lb/>
            luxury is scented with various perfumes. You will say <lb/>
            that these men live in the midst of pleasures. Yet they are <lb/>
            ill at ease, because they take pleasure in what is not good.</p>
          <p>XII. " They are ill at ease," replies he, " because many <lb/>
            things arise which distract their thoughts, and their <lb/>
            minds are disquieted by conflicting opinions." I admit <lb/>
            that this is true: still these very men, foolish, inconsistent, <lb/>
            and certain to feel remorse as they are, do nevertheless <lb/>
            receive great pleasure, and we must allow that in so doing <lb/>
            they are as far from feeling any trouble as they are from <lb/>
            forming a right judgment, and that, as is the case with <lb/>
            many people, they are possessed by a merry madness, and <lb/>
            laugh while they rave. The pleasures of wise men, on the <lb/>
            other hand, are mild, decorous, verging on dulness, kept <lb/>
            under restraint and scarcely noticeable, and are neither <lb/>
            invited to come nor received with honour when they come of <lb/>
            their own accord, nor are they welcomed with any delight by <lb/>
            those whom they visit, who mix them up with their lives and <lb/>
            fill up empty spaces with them, like an amusing farce in <lb/>
            the intervals of serious business. Let them no longer, then, <lb/>
            join incongruous matters together, or connect pleasure with <note type="footnote"> 1 Parentatur seems to mean where an offering is made to luxury- <lb/>
            where they sacrifice to luxury. Perfumes were used at funerals. Lipsius <lb/>
            suggests that these feasts were like funerals because the guests were <lb/>
            carried away from them dead drunk. </note> <pb n="218"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            virtue, a mistake whereby they court the worst of men. <lb/>
            The reckless profligate, always in liquor and belching out the <lb/>
            fumes of wine, believes that he lives with virtue, because he <lb/>
            knows that he lives with pleasure, for he hears it said that <lb/>
            pleasure cannot exist apart from virtue; consequently he <lb/>
            dubs his vices with the title of wisdom and parades all that he <lb/>
            ought to conceal. So, men are not encouraged by Epicurus <lb/>
            to run riot, but the vicious hide their excesses in the lap <lb/>
            of philosophy, and flock to the schools in which they hear <lb/>
            the praises of pleasure. They do not consider how sober <lb/>
            and temperate--for so, by Hercules, I believe it to be­ <lb/>
            that " pleasure " of Epicurus is, but they rush at his mere <lb/>
            name, seeking to obtain some protection and cloak for <lb/>
            their vices. They lose, therefore, the one virtue which <lb/>
            their evil life possessed, that of being ashamed of doing <lb/>
            wrong : for. they praise what they used to blush at, and <lb/>
            boast of their vices. Thus modesty can never reassert itself, <lb/>
            when shameful idleness is dignified with an honourable <lb/>
            name. The reason why that praise which your school <lb/>
            lavishes upon pleasure is so hurtful, is because the honour­ <lb/>
            able part of its teaching passes unnoticed, but the degrading <lb/>
            part is seen by all.</p>
          <p>XIII. I myself believe, though my Stoic comrades would <lb/>
            be unwilling to hear me say so, that the teaching of Epi­ <lb/>
            curus was upright and holy, and even, if you examine it <lb/>
            narrowly, stern : for this much talked of pleasure is reduced <lb/>
            to a very narrow compass, and he bids pleasure submit to <lb/>
            the same law which we bid virtue do—I mean, to obey <lb/>
            nature. Luxury, however, is not satisfied with what is <lb/>
            enough for nature. What is the consequence ? Whoever <lb/>
            thinks that happiness consists in lazy sloth, and alterna­ <lb/>
            tions of gluttony and profligacy, requires a good patron <lb/>
            for a bad action, and when he has become an Epicurean, <lb/>
            having been led to do so by the attractive name of that <lb/>
            school, he follows, not the pleasure which he there hears <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            spoken of, but that which he brought thither with him, <lb/>
            and, having learned to think that his vices coincide with <lb/>
            the maxims of that philosophy, he indulges in them no <lb/>
            longer timidly and in dark corners, but boldly in the face <lb/>
            of day. I will not, therefore, like most of our school, say <lb/>
            that the sect of Epicurus is the teacher of crime, but what <lb/>
            I say is: it is ill spoken of, it has a bad reputation, and <lb/>
            yet it does not deserve it. " Who can know this without <lb/>
            having been admitted to its inner mysteries ? " Its very <lb/>
            outside gives opportunity for scandal, and encourages <lb/>
            men's baser desires: it is like a brave man dressed in <lb/>
            a woman's gown : your chastity is assured, your manhood <lb/>
            is safe, your body is submitted to nothing disgraceful, but <lb/>
            your hand holds a drum (like a priest of Cybele). Choose, <lb/>
            then, some honourable superscription for your school, some <lb/>
            writing which shall in itself arouse the mind : that which <lb/>
            at present stands over your door has been invented by the <lb/>
            vices. He who ranges himself on the side of virtue gives <lb/>
            thereby a proof of a noble disposition : he who follows plea­ <lb/>
            sure appears to be weakly, worn out, degrading his man­ <lb/>
            hood, likely to fall into infamous vices unless someone <lb/>
            discriminates his pleasures for him, so that he may know <lb/>
            which remain within the bounds of natural desire, which <lb/>
            are frantic and boundless, and become all the more in­ <lb/>
            satiable the more they are satisfied. But come ! let virtue <lb/>
            lead the way: then every step will be safe. Too much <lb/>
            pleasure is hurtful: but with virtue we need fear no excess <lb/>
            of any kind, because moderation is contained in virtue her­ <lb/>
            self. That which is injured by its own extent cannot be a <lb/>
            good thing: besides, what better guide can there be than <lb/>
            reason for beings endowed with a reasoning nature ? so if <lb/>
            this combination pleases you, if you are willing to proceed <lb/>
            to a happy life thus accompanied, let virtue lead the way, <lb/>
            let pleasure follow and hang about the body like a shadow : <lb/>
            it is the part of a mind incapable of great things to hand <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            over virtue, the highest of all qualities, as a handmaid to <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>-XIV. Let virtue lead the way and bear the standard: <lb/>
            we shall have pleasure for all that, but we shall be her <lb/>
            masters and controllers ; she may win some concessions <lb/>
            from us, but will not force as to do anything. On the <lb/>
            contrary, those who have permitted pleasure to lead the <lb/>
            van, have neither one nor the other : for they lose virtue <lb/>
            altogether, and yet they do not possess pleasure, but are <lb/>
            possessed by it, and are either tortured by its absence or <lb/>
            choked by its excess, being wretched if deserted by it, and <lb/>
            yet more wretched if overwhelmed by it, like those who <lb/>
            are caught in the shoals of the Syrtes and at one time are <lb/>
            left on dry ground and at another tossed on the flowing <lb/>
            waves. This arises from an exaggerated want of self- <lb/>
            control, and a hidden love of evil: for it is dangerous for <lb/>
            one who seeks after evil instead of good to attain his object. <lb/>
            As we hunt wild beasts with toil and peril, and even when ~ <lb/>
            they are caught find them an anxious possession, for they <lb/>
            often tear their keepers to pieces, even so are great plea­ <lb/>
            sures : they turn out to be great evils and take their <lb/>
            owners prisoner. The more numerous and the greater <lb/>
            they are, the more inferior and the slave of more masters <lb/>
            does that man become whom the vulgar call a happy man. I <lb/>
            may even press this analogy further: as the man who tracks <lb/>
            wild animals to their lairs, and who sets great store on­ <lb/>
            " Seeking with snares the wandering brutes to noose," <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            " Making their hounds the spacious glade surround," <lb/>
            that he may follow their tracks, neglects far more desirable <lb/>
            things, and leaves many duties unfulfilled, so he who pur­ <lb/>
            sues pleasure postpones everything to it, disregards that <lb/>
            first essential, liberty, and sacrifices it to his belly; nor does <lb/>
            he buy pleasure for himself, but sells himself to pleasure.</p><pb n="221"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> XV. "But what," asks our adversary, "is there to hinder <lb/>
            virtue and pleasure being combined together, and a highest <lb/>
            good being thus formed, so that honour and pleasure may <lb/>
            be the same thing ? " Because nothing except what is <lb/>
            honourable can form a part of honour, and the highest <lb/>
            good would lose its purity if it were to see within itself any­ <lb/>
            thing unlike its own better part. Even the joy which <lb/>
            arises from virtue, although it be a good thing, yet is not a <lb/>
            part of absolute good, any more than cheerfulness or peace <lb/>
            of mind, which are indeed good things, but which merely <lb/>
            follow the highest good, and do not contribute to its <lb/>
            perfection, although they are generated by the noblest <lb/>
            causes. Whoever on the other hand forms an alliance, and <lb/>
            that, too, a one-sided one, between virtue and pleasure, <lb/>
            clogs whatever strength the one may possess by the weak­ <lb/>
            ness of the other, and sends liberty under the yoke, for <lb/>
            liberty can only remain un conquered as long as she knows <lb/>
            nothing more valuable than herself: for he begins to need <lb/>
            the help of Fortune, which is the most utter slavery : his life <lb/>
            becomes anxious, full of suspicion, timorous, fearful of acci­ <lb/>
            dents, waiting in agony for critical moments of time. You <lb/>
            do not afford virtue a solid immoveable base if you bid it <lb/>
            stand on what is unsteady: and what can be so unsteady <lb/>
            as dependence on mere chance, and the vicissitudes of <lb/>
            the body and of those, things which act on the body? <lb/>
            How can such a man obey God and receive everything <lb/>
            which comes to pass in a cheerful spirit, never com­ <lb/>
            plaining of fate, and putting a good construction upon <lb/>
            everything that befalls him, if he be agitated by the petty <lb/>
            pin-pricks of pleasures and pains ? A man cannot be a <lb/>
            good protector of his country, a good avenger of her wrongs, <lb/>
            or a good defender of his friends, if he be inclined to plea­ <lb/>
            sures. Let the highest good, then, rise to that height from <lb/>
            whence no force can dislodge it, whither neither pain can <lb/>
            ascend, nor hope, nor fear, nor anything else that can <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            impair the authority of the " highest good." Thither virtue <lb/>
            alone can make. her way: by her aid that hill must be <lb/>
            climbed: she will bravely stand her ground and endure <lb/>
            whatever may befal her not only resignedly, but even <lb/>
            willingly: she will know that all hard times come in <lb/>
            obedience to natural laws, and like a good soldier she will <lb/>
            bear wounds, count scars, and when transfixed and dying <lb/>
            will yet adore the general for whom she falls: she will <lb/>
            bear in mind the old maxim " Follow God." On the other <lb/>
            hand, he who grumbles and complains and bemoans himself <lb/>
            is nevertheless forcibly obliged to obey orders, and is <lb/>
            dragged away, however much against his will, to carry <lb/>
            them out: yet what madness is it to be dragged rather <lb/>
            than to follow? as great, by Hercules, as it is folly and <lb/>
            ignorance of one's true position to grieve because one has not <lb/>
            got something or because something has caused us rough <lb/>
            treatment, or to be surprised or indignant at those ills <lb/>
            which befal good men as well as bad ones, I mean diseases, <lb/>
            deaths, illnesses, and the other cross accidents of human <lb/>
            life. Let us bear with magnanimity whatever the system <lb/>
            of the universe makes it needful for us to bear: we are all <lb/>
            bound by this oath: " To bear the ills of mortal life, and to <lb/>
            submit with a good grace to what we cannot avoid." We <lb/>
            have been born into a monarchy: our liberty is to obey God.</p>
          <p>XVI. True happiness, therefore, consists in virtue: and <lb/>
            what will this virtue bid you do p Not to think anything <lb/>
            bad or good which is connected neither with virtue nor with <lb/>
            wickedness: and in the next place, both to endure un­ <lb/>
            moved the assaults of evil, and, as far as is right, to form <lb/>
            a god out of what is good. What reward does she promise <lb/>
            you for this campaign ? an enormous one, and one that <lb/>
            raises you to the level of the gods : you shall be subject to <lb/>
            no restraint and to no want; you shall be free, safe, unhurt; <lb/>
            you shall fail in nothing that you attempt; you shall be de­ <lb/>
            barred from nothing; everything shall turn out according <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            to your wish ; no misfortune shall befal you; nothing shall <lb/>
            happen to you except what you expect and hope for. <lb/>
            " What! does virtue alone suffice to make you happy? " <lb/>
            why, of course, consummate and god-like virtue such as <lb/>
            this not only suffices, but more than suffices : for when <lb/>
            a man is placed beyond the reach of any desire, what can <lb/>
            he possibly lack ? if all that he needs is concentred in him­ <lb/>
            self, how can he require anything from without ? He, <lb/>
            however, who is only on the road to virtue, although <lb/>
            he may have made great progress along it, nevertheless <lb/>
            needs some favour from fortune while he is still struggling <lb/>
            among mere human interests, while he is untying that knot, <lb/>
            and all the bonds which bind him to mortality. What, <lb/>
            then, is the difference between them ? it is. that some are <lb/>
            tied more or less tightly by these bonds, and some have even <lb/>
            tied themselves with them as well; whereas he who has <lb/>
            made progress towards the upper regions and raised him­ <lb/>
            self upwards drags a looser chain, and though not yet free, <lb/>
            is yet as good as free.</p>
          <p>XVII. If, therefore, any one of those dogs who yelp at <lb/>
            philosophy were to say, as- they are wont to do, " Why, <lb/>
            then, do you talk so much more bravely than you live? <lb/>
            why do you check your words in the presence of your <lb/>
            superiors, and consider money to be a necessary implement ? <lb/>
            why are you disturbed when you sustain losses, and weep <lb/>
            on hearing of the death of your wife or your friend ? why <lb/>
            do you pay regard to common rumour, and feel annoyed by <lb/>
            calumnious gossip ? why is your estate more elaborately <lb/>
            kept than its natural use requires ? why do you not dine <lb/>
            according to your own maxims ? why is your furniture <lb/>
            smarter than it need be ? why do you drink wine that is <lb/>
            older than yourself ? why are your grounds laid out ? why <lb/>
            do you plant trees which afford nothing except shade ? why <lb/>
            does your wife wear in her ears the price of a rich man's <lb/>
            'house ? why are your children at school dressed in. costly <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            clothes ? why is it a science to wait upon you at table ? <lb/>
            why is your silver plate not set down anyhow or at ran­ <lb/>
            dom, but skilfully disposed in regular order, with a super­ <lb/>
            intendent to preside over the carving of the viands ? " <lb/>
            Add to this, if you like, the questions " Why do you own <lb/>
            property beyond the seas ? why do you own more than you <lb/>
            know of ? it is a shame to you not to know your slaves by <lb/>
            sight: for you must be very neglectful of them if you only <lb/>
            own a few, or very extravagant if you have too many for <lb/>
            your memory to retain." I will add some reproaches after­ <lb/>
            wards, and will bring more accusations against myself than <lb/>
            you think of: for the present I will make you the follow­ <lb/>
            ing answer. " I am not a wise man, and I will not be one <lb/>
            in order to feed your spite: so do not require me to be on <lb/>
            a level with the best of men, but merely to be better than <lb/>
            the worst: I am satisfied, if every day I take away some­ <lb/>
            thing from my vices and correct my faults. I have not <lb/>
            arrived at perfect soundness of mind, indeed, I never shall <lb/>
            arrive at it: I compound palliatives rather than remedies <lb/>
            for my gout, and am satisfied if it comes at rarer intervals <lb/>
            and does not shoot so painfully. Compared with your feet, <lb/>
            which are lame, I am a racer." I make this speech, not on <lb/>
            my own behalf, for I am steeped in vices of every kind, <lb/>
            but on behalf of one who has made some progress in virtue.</p>
          <p>XVIII. " You talk one way," objects our adversary, <lb/>
            " and live another." You most spiteful of creatures, you <lb/>
            who always show the bitterest hatred to the best of men, <lb/>
            this reproach was flung at Plato, at Epicurus, at Zeno: for <lb/>
            all these declared how they ought to live, not how they did <lb/>
            live., I speak of virtue, not of myself, and when I blame <lb/>
            vices, I blame my own first of all: when I have the power, <lb/>
            I shall live as I ought to do: spite, however deeply steeped <lb/>
            in venom, shall not keep me back from what is best: that <lb/>
            poison itself with which you bespatter others, with which <lb/>
            you choke yourselves, shall not hinder me from continuing <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            to praise that life which I do not, indeed, lead, but which I <lb/>
            know I ought to lead, from loving virtue and from following <lb/>
            after her, albeit a long way behind her and with halting <lb/>
            gait. AID I to expect that evil speaking will respect any­ <lb/>
            thing, seeing that it respected neither Rutilius nor Cato ? <lb/>
            Will any one care about being thought too rich by men for <lb/>
            whom Diogenes the Cynic was not poor enough P That most <lb/>
            energetic philosopher fought against all the desires of the <lb/>
            body, and was poorer even than the other Cynics, in that <lb/>
            besides having given up possessing anything he had also <lb/>
            given up asking for anything : yet they reproached him for <lb/>
            not being sufficiently in want: as though forsooth it were <lb/>
            poverty, not virtue, of which he professed knowledge.</p>
          <p>XIX. They say that Diodorus, the Epicurean philo. <lb/>
            sopher, who within these last few days put an end to his <lb/>
            life with his own hand, did not act according to the <lb/>
            precepts of Epicurus, in cutting his throat: some choose <lb/>
            to regard this act as the result of madness, others of <lb/>
            recklessness; he, meanwhile, happy and filled with the <lb/>
            consciousness of his own goodness, has borne testimony to <lb/>
            himself by his manner of departing from life, has com­ <lb/>
            mended the repose of a life spent at anchor in a safe <lb/>
            harbour, and has said what you do not like to hear, because <lb/>
            you too ought to do it : <lb/>
            "I've lived, I've run the race which Fortune set me." <lb/>
            You argue about the life and death of another, and yelp at <lb/>
            the name of men whom some peculiarly noble quality has <lb/>
            rendered great, just as tiny curs do at the approach of <lb/>
            strangers: for it is to your interest that no one should <lb/>
            appear to be good, as if virtue in another were a reproach <lb/>
            to all your crimes. You enviously compare the glories of <lb/>
            others with your own dirty actions, and do not understand <lb/>
            how greatly to your disadvantage it is to venture to do <lb/>
            so: for if they who follow after virtue be greedy, lustful, <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            and fond of power, what must you be, who hate the very <lb/>
            name of virtue ? You say that no one acts up to his pro­ <lb/>
            fessions, or lives according to the standard which he sets <lb/>
            up in his discourses: what wonder, seeing that the words <lb/>
            which they speak are brave, gigantic, and able to weather <lb/>
            all the storms which wreck mankind, whereas they them­ <lb/>
            selves are struggling to tear themselves away from crosses <lb/>
            into which each one of you is driving his own nail. Yet <lb/>
            men who are crucified hang from one single pole, but these <lb/>
            who punish themselves are divided between as many <lb/>
            crosses as they have lusts, but yet are given to evil speak­ <lb/>
            ing, and are so magnificent in their contempt of the vices of <lb/>
            others that I should suppose that they had none of their <lb/>
            own, were it not that some criminals when on the gibbet <lb/>
            spit upon the spectators.</p>
          <p>XX. " Philosophers do not carry into effect all that they <lb/>
            teach." No ; but they effect much good by their teaching, <lb/>
            by the noble thoughts which they conceive in their minds: <lb/>
            would, indeed, that they could act up to their talk: what <lb/>
            could be happier than they would be ? but in the mean­ <lb/>
            while'you have no right to despise good sayings and hearts <lb/>
            full of good thoughts. Men deserve praise for engaging <lb/>
            in profitable studies, even though they stop short of pro­ <lb/>
            ducing any results. Why need we wonder if those who <lb/>
            begin to climb a steep path do not succeed in ascending <lb/>
            it very high ? yet, if you be a man, look with respect on <lb/>
            those who attempt great things, even though they fall. <lb/>
            It is the act of a generous spirit to proportion its efforts <lb/>
            not to its own strength but to that of human nature, to <lb/>
            entertain lofty aims, and to conceive plans which are too <lb/>
            vast to be carried into execution even by those who are <lb/>
            endowed with gigantic intellects, who appoint for them­ <lb/>
            selves the following rules: " I will look upon death or upon <lb/>
            a comedy with the same expression of countenance : I will <lb/>
            submit to labours, however great they may be, supporting <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            the strength of my body by that of my mind : I will despise <lb/>
            riches when I have them as much as when I have them <lb/>
            not; if they be elsewhere I will not be more gloomy, if they <lb/>
            sparkle around me I will not be more lively than I should <lb/>
            otherwise be : whether Fortune comes or goes I will take <lb/>
            no notice of her: I will view all lands as though they belong <lb/>
            to me, and my own as though they belonged to all man­ <lb/>
            kind : I will so live as to remember that I was born for <lb/>
            others, and will thank Nature on this account: for in what <lb/>
            fashion could she have done better for me ? she has given <lb/>
            me alone to all, and all to me alone. Whatever I may pos­ <lb/>
            sess, I will neither hoard it greedily nor squander it reck­ <lb/>
            lessly. I will think that I have no possessions so real as <lb/>
            those which I have given away to deserving people : I will <lb/>
            not reckon benefits by their magnitude or number, or by <lb/>
            anything except the value set upon them by the receiver : I <lb/>
            never will consider a gift to be a large one if it be bestowed <lb/>
            upon a worthy object. I will do nothing because of public <lb/>
            opinion, but everthing because of conscience : whenever I <lb/>
            do anything alone by myself I will believe that the eyes of <lb/>
            the Roman people are upon me while I do it. In eating <lb/>
            and drinking my object shall be to quench the desires of <lb/>
            Nature, not to fill and empty my belly. I will be agreeable <lb/>
            with my friends, gentle and mild to my foes : I will grant <lb/>
            pardon before I am asked for it, and will meet the wishes <lb/>
            of honourable men half way; I will bear in mind that the <lb/>
            world is my native city, that its governors are the gods, and <lb/>
            that they stand above and around me, criticizing whatever <lb/>
            I do or say. Whenever either Nature demands my breath <lb/>
            again, or reason bids me dismiss it, I will quit this life, <lb/>
            calling all to witness that I have loved a good conscience, <lb/>
            and good pursuits ; that no one's freedom, my own least of <lb/>
            all, has been impaired through me." He who sets up these <lb/>
            as the rules of his life will soar aloft and strive to make his <lb/>
            way to the gods: of a truth, even though he fails, yet he <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            " Fails in a high emprise. "1 <lb/>
            But you, who hate both virtue and those who practise it, <lb/>
            do nothing at which we need be surprised, for sickly lights <lb/>
            cannot bear the sun, nocturnal creatures avoid the bright­ <lb/>
            ness of day, and at its first dawning become bewildered and <lb/>
            all betake themselves to their dens together: creatures that <lb/>
            fear the light hide themselves in crevices. So croak away, <lb/>
            and exercise your miserable tongues in reproaching good <lb/>
            men : open wide your jaws, bite hard: you will break many <lb/>
            teeth before you make any impression.</p>
          <p>XXI. " But how is it that this man studies philosophy <lb/>
            and nevertheless lives the life of a rich man P Why does <lb/>
            he say that wealth ought to be despised and yet possess <lb/>
            it ? that life should be despised, and yet live ? that health <lb/>
            should be despised, and yet guard it with the utmost care, <lb/>
            and wish it to be as good as possible ? Does he consider <lb/>
            banishment to be an empty name, and say, " What evil is <lb/>
            there in changing one country for another ? " and yet, if per­ <lb/>
            mitted, does he not grow old in his native land ? does he <lb/>
            declare that there is no difference between a longer and a <lb/>
            shorter time, and yet, if he be not prevented, lengthen out <lb/>
            his life and flourish in a green old age ? " His answer is, <lb/>
            that these things ought to be despised, not that he should <lb/>
            not possess them, but that he should not possess them <lb/>
            with fear and trembling: he does not drive them away from <lb/>
            him, but when they leave him he follows after them uncon­ <lb/>
            cernedly. Where, indeed, can fortune invest riches more <lb/>
            securely than in a place from whence they can always be <lb/>
            recovered without any squabble with their trustee ? Marcus <lb/>
            Cato, when he was praising -Curius and Coruncanius and <lb/>
            that century in which the possession of a few small silver <lb/>
            coins were an offence which was punished by the Censor, <lb/>
            himself owned four million sesterces; a less fortune, no <note type="footnote"> 1 The quotation is from the epitaph on Phaeton.-See Ovid, Met. II. <lb/>
            327. </note> <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            doubt, than that of Crassus, but larger than of Cato the <lb/>
            Censor. If the amounts be compared, he had outstripped <lb/>
            his great-grandfather further than he himself was outdone <lb/>
            by Crassus, and if still greater riches had fallen to his lot, <lb/>
            he would not have spurned them: for the wise man does <lb/>
            not think himself unworthy of any chance presents: he <lb/>
            does not love riches, but he prefers to have them; he does <lb/>
            not receive them into his spirit, but only into his house: <lb/>
            nor does he cast away from him what he already possesses, <lb/>
            but keeps them, and is willing that his virtue should receive <lb/>
            a larger subject-matter for its exercise.</p>
          <p>XXII. Who can doubt, however, that the wise man, if <lb/>
            he is rich, has a wider field for the development of -his <lb/>
            powers than if he is poor, seeing that in the latter case the <lb/>
            only virtue which he can display is that of neither being <lb/>
            perverted nor crushed by his poverty, whereas if he has <lb/>
            riches, he will have a wide field for the exhibition of tem­ <lb/>
            perance, generosity, laboriousness, methodical arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, and grandeur. The wise man will not despise him­ <lb/>
            self, however short of stature he may be, but nevertheless <lb/>
            he will wish to be tall: even though he be feeble and one­ <lb/>
            eyed he may be in good health, yet he would prefer to <lb/>
            have bodily strength, and that too, while he knows all the <lb/>
            while that he has something which is even more powerful: <lb/>
            he will endure illness, and will hope for good health : for <lb/>
            some things, though they may be trifles compared with the <lb/>
            sum total, and though they may be taken away without <lb/>
            destroying the chief good, yet add somewhat to that con­ <lb/>
            stant cheerfulness which arises from virtue. Riches encou­ <lb/>
            rage and brighten up such a man just as a sailor is de­ <lb/>
            lighted at a favourable wind that bears him on his way, or <lb/>
            as people feel pleasure at a fine day or at a sunny spot in <lb/>
            the cold weather. What wise man, I mean of our school, <lb/>
            whose only good is virtue, can deny that even these matters <lb/>
            which we call neither good nor bad have in themselves a <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            certain value, and that some of them are preferable to <lb/>
            others ? to some of them we show a certain amount of <lb/>
            respect, and to some a great deal. Do not, then, make any <lb/>
            mistake: riches belong to the class of desirable things. <lb/>
            "Why then," say you, "do you laugh at me, since you <lb/>
            place them in the same position that I do?" Do you <lb/>
            wish to know how different the position is in which we <lb/>
            place them ? If my riches leave me, they will carry away <lb/>
            with them nothing except themselves: you will be bewil­ <lb/>
            dered and will seem to be left without yourself if they should <lb/>
            pass away from you : with me riches occupy a certain <lb/>
            place, but with you they occupy the highest place of all. <lb/>
            In fine, my riches belong to me, you belong to your riches.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Cease, then, forbidding philosophers to possess <lb/>
            money: no one has condemned wisdom to poverty. The <lb/>
            philosopher may own ample wealth, but will not own <lb/>
            wealth that which has been torn from another, or which is <lb/>
            stained with another's blood: his must be obtained with­ <lb/>
            out wronging any man, and without its being won by base <lb/>
            means; it must be alike honourably come by and honour­ <lb/>
            ably spent, and must be such as spite alone could shake its <lb/>
            head at. Raise it to whatever figure you please, it will <lb/>
            still be an honourable possession, if, while it includes much <lb/>
            which every man would like to call his own, there be <lb/>
            nothing which any one can say is his own. Such a man <lb/>
            will not forfeit his right to the favour of Fortune, and will <lb/>
            neither boast of his inheritance nor blush for it if it <lb/>
            was honourably acquired: yet he will have something to <lb/>
            boast of, if he throw his house open, let all his country­ <lb/>
            men come among his property, and say, " If any one recog­ <lb/>
            nizes here anything belonging to him, let him take it." <lb/>
            What a great man, how excellently rich will he be, if after <lb/>
            this speech he possesses as much as he had before! I say, <lb/>
            then, that if he can safely and confidently submit his <lb/>
            accounts to the scrutiny of the people, and no one can find <pb n="231"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXIV.] </note> <lb/>
            in them any item upon which he can lay hands, such a man <lb/>
            may boldly and unconcealedly enjoy his riches. The wise <lb/>
            man will not allow a single ill-won penny to cross his <lb/>
            threshold: yet he will not refuse or close his door against <lb/>
            great riches, if they are the gift of fortune and the product <lb/>
            of virtue: what reason has he for grudging them good <lb/>
            quarters: let them come and be his guests: he will neither <lb/>
            brag of them nor hide them away: the one is the part of a <lb/>
            silly, the other of a cowardly and paltry spirit, which, as it <lb/>
            were, muffles up a good thing in its lap. Neither will he, <lb/>
            as I said before, turn them out of his house: for what will <lb/>
            he say ? will he say, " You are useless," or " I do not know <lb/>
            how to use riches ? " As he is capable of performing a <lb/>
            journey upon his own feet, but yet would prefer to mount <lb/>
            a carriage, just so he will be capable of being poor, yet will <lb/>
            wish to be rich; he will own wealth, but will view it as an <lb/>
            uncertain possession which will some day fly away from him. <lb/>
            He will not allow it to be a burden either to himself or to <lb/>
            any one else: he will give it-why do you prick up your <lb/>
            ears ? why do you open your pockets ?-hewill give it either <lb/>
            to good men or to those whom it may make into good men. <lb/>
            He will give it after having taken the utmost pains to <lb/>
            choose those who are fittest to receive it, as becomes one <lb/>
            who bears in mind that he ought to give an account of <lb/>
            what he spends as well as of what he receives. He will give <lb/>
            for good and commendable reasons, for a gift ill bestowed <lb/>
            counts as a shameful loss: he will have an easily opened <lb/>
            pocket, but not one with a hole in it, so that much may be <lb/>
            taken out of it, yet nothing may fall out of it.</p>
          <p>XXIV. He who believes giving to be an easy matter, is <lb/>
            mistaken : it offers very great difficulties, if we bestow our <lb/>
            bounty rationally, and do not scatter it impulsively and at <lb/>
            random. I do this man a service, I requite a good turn done <lb/>
            me by that one: I help this other, because I pity him: <lb/>
            this man, again, I teach to be no fit object for poverty to <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            hold down or degrade. I shall not give some men anything, <lb/>
            although they are in want, because, even if I do give to <lb/>
            them they will still be in want: I shall proffer my bounty <lb/>
            to some, and shall forcibly thrust it upon others: I cannot <lb/>
            be neglecting my own interests while I am doing this : at <lb/>
            no time do I make more people in my debt than when I <lb/>
            am giving things away. " What ? " say you, " do you give <lb/>
            that you may receive again ? " At any rate I do not give <lb/>
            that I may throw my bounty away : what I give should be <lb/>
            so placed that although I cannot ask for its return, yet it <lb/>
            may be given back to me. A benefit should be invested <lb/>
            in the same manner as a treasure buried deep in the <lb/>
            earth, which you would not dig up unless actually <lb/>
            obliged. Why, what opportunities of conferring benefits <lb/>
            the mere house of a rich man affords ? for who considers <lb/>
            generous behaviour due only to those who wear the toga ? <lb/>
            Nature bids me do good to mankind—what difference does <lb/>
            it make whether they be slaves or freemen, free-born or <lb/>
            emancipated, whether their freedom be legally acquired or <lb/>
            betowed by arrangement among friends ? Wherever there <lb/>
            is a human being, there is an opportunity for a benefit: <lb/>
            consequently, money may be distributed even within one's <lb/>
            own threshold, and a field may be found there for the <lb/>
            practice of freehandedness, which is not so called because <lb/>
            it is our duty towards free men, but because it takes its <lb/>
            rise in a free-born mind. In the case of the wise man, this <lb/>
            never falls upon base and unworthy recipients, and never <lb/>
            becomes so exhausted as not, whenever it finds a worthy <lb/>
            object, to flow as if its store was undiminished. You have, <lb/>
            therefore, no grounds for misunderstanding the honourable, <lb/>
            brave, and spirited language which you hear from those <lb/>
            who are studying wisdom : and first of all observe this, <lb/>
            that a student of wisdom is not the same thing as a man <lb/>
            who has made himself perfect in wisdom. The former will <lb/>
            say to you, " In my talk I express the most admirable senti- <pb n="233"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXV.] </note> <lb/>
            meats, yet I am still weltering amid countless ills. You <lb/>
            must not force me to act up to my rules: at the present <lb/>
            time I am forming myself, moulding my character, and <lb/>
            striving to rise myself to the height of a great example. If <lb/>
            I should ever succeed in carrying out all that I have set <lb/>
            myself to accomplish, you may then demand that my words <lb/>
            and deeds should correspond." But he who has reached <lb/>
            the summit of human perfection will deal otherwise with <lb/>
            you, and will say, " In the first place, you have no business <lb/>
            to allow yourself to sit in judgment upon your betters :" <lb/>
            I have already obtained one proof of my righteousness in <lb/>
            having become an object of dislike to bad men: however, <lb/>
            to make you a rational answer, which I grudge to no man, <lb/>
            listen to what I declare, and at what price I value all things. <lb/>
            Riches, I say, are not a good thing; for if they were, they <lb/>
            would make men good: now since that which is found <lb/>
            even among bad men cannot be termed good, I do not <lb/>
            allow them to be called so : nevertheless I admit that they <lb/>
            are desirable and useful and contribute great comforts to <lb/>
            our lives.</p>
          <p>XXV. Learn, then, since we both agree that they are <lb/>
            desirable, what my reason is amongst counting them among <lb/>
            good things, and in what respects I should behave differently <lb/>
            to you if I possessed them. Place me as master in the <lb/>
            house of a very rich man: place me where gold and silver <lb/>
            plate is used for the commonest purposes; I shall not <lb/>
            think more of myself because of things which even though <lb/>
            they are in my house are yet no part of me. Take me <lb/>
            away to the wooden bridge 1 and put me down there among <lb/>
            the beggars: I shall not despise myself because I am <lb/>
            sitting among those who hold out their hands for alms: <lb/>
            for what can the lack of a piece of bread matter to one <note type="footnote"> 1 The " Pons Sublicius," or " pile bridge," was built over the Tiber <lb/>
            by Ancus Martins, one of the early kings of Rome, and was always <lb/>
            kept in repair out of a superstitious feeling. </note> <pb n="234"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            who does not lack the power of dying ? Well, then ? I <lb/>
            prefer the magnificent house to the beggar's bridge. Place <lb/>
            me among magnificent furniture and all the appliances of <lb/>
            luxury: I shall not think myself any happier because my <lb/>
            cloak is soft, because my guests rest upon purple. Change <lb/>
            the scene: I shall be no more miserable if my weary head <lb/>
            rests upon a bundle of hay, if I lie upon a cushion from the <lb/>
            circus, with all the stuffing on the point of coming out <lb/>
            through its patches of threadbare cloth. Well, then ? I <lb/>
            prefer, as far as my feelings go, to show myself in public <lb/>
            dressed in woollen and in robes of office, rather than with <lb/>
            naked or half-covered shoulders: I should like every day's <lb/>
            business to turn out just as I wish it to do, and new con­ <lb/>
            gratulations to be constantly following upon the former <lb/>
            ones : yet I will not pride myself upon this: change all <lb/>
            this good fortune for its opposite, let my spirit be dis­ <lb/>
            tracted by losses, grief, various kinds of attacks: let no <lb/>
            hour pass without some dispute : I shall not on this account, <lb/>
            though beset by the greatest miseries, call myself the most <lb/>
            miserable of beings, nor shall I curse any particular day, <lb/>
            for I have taken care to have no unlucky days. What, then, <lb/>
            is the upshot of all this ? it is that I prefer to have to regulate <lb/>
            joys than to stifle sorrows. The great Socrates would say <lb/>
            the same thing to you. " Make me," he would say, " the <lb/>
            conqueror of all nations: let the voluptuous car of Bacchus <lb/>
            bear me in triumph to Thebes from the rising of the sun : <lb/>
            let the kings of the Persians receive laws from me: yet I <lb/>
            shall feel myself to be a man at the very moment when all <lb/>
            around salute me as a God. Straightway connect this <lb/>
            lofty height with a headlong fall into misfortune: let me <lb/>
            be placed upon a foreign chariot that I may grace the <lb/>
            triumph of a proud and savage conqueror: I will follow <lb/>
            another's car with no more humility than I showed when I <lb/>
            stood in my own. What then ? In spite of all this, I had <lb/>
            rather be a conqueror than a captive. I despise the whole <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            dominion of Fortune, but still, if I were given my choice, I <lb/>
            would choose its better parts. I shall make whatever befals <lb/>
            me become a good thing, but I prefer that what befals me <lb/>
            should be comfortable and pleasant and unlikely to cause <lb/>
            me annoyance : for you need not suppose that any virtue <lb/>
            exists without labour, but some virtues need spurs, while <lb/>
            others need the curb. As we have to check our body on a <lb/>
            downward path, and to urge it to climb a steep one ; so <lb/>
            also the path of some virtues leads down hill, that of others <lb/>
            uphill. Can we doubt that patience, courage, constancy, <lb/>
            and all the other virtues which have to meet strong opposi­ <lb/>
            tion, and to trample Fortune under their feet, are climbing, <lb/>
            struggling, winning their way up a steep ascent ? Why ! <lb/>
            is it not equally evident that generosity, moderation, and <lb/>
            gentleness glide easily downhill ? With the latter we <lb/>
            must hold in our spirit, lest it run away with us : with the <lb/>
            former we must urge and spur it on. We ought, therefore, <lb/>
            to apply these energetic, combative virtues to poverty, and <lb/>
            to riches those other more thrifty ones which trip lightly <lb/>
            along, and merely support their own weight. This being <lb/>
            the distinction between them, I would rather have to deal <lb/>
            with those which I could practise in comparative quiet, <lb/>
            than those of which one can only make trial through blood <lb/>
            and sweat. " Wherefore," says the sage, "I do not talk one <lb/>
            way and live another: but you do not rightly understand <lb/>
            what I say: the sound of my words alone reaches your ears, <lb/>
            you do not try to find out their meaning."</p>
          <p>XXVI. " What difference, then, is there between me, <lb/>
            who am a fool, and you, who are a wise man ? " " All the <lb/>
            difference in the world: for riches are slaves in the house <lb/>
            of a wise man, but masters in that of a fool. You accustom <lb/>
            yourself to them and cling to them as if somebody had pro­ <lb/>
            mised that they should be yours for ever, but a wise man <lb/>
            never thinks so much about poverty as when he is sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by riches. No general ever trusts so implicitly in <pb n="236"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VII. </note> <lb/>
            the maintenance of peace as not to make himself ready for a <lb/>
            war, which, though it may not actually be waged, has <lb/>
            nevertheless been declared; you are rendered over-proud <lb/>
            by a fine house, as though it could never be burned or fall <lb/>
            down, and your heads are turned by riches as though they <lb/>
            were beyond the reach of all dangers and were so great that <lb/>
            Fortune has not sufficient strength to swallow them up. <lb/>
            You sit idly playing with your wealth and do not foresee the <lb/>
            perils in store for it, as savages generally do when besieged, <lb/>
            for, not understanding the use of siege artillery, they look <lb/>
            on idly at the labours of the besiegers and do not under­ <lb/>
            stand the object of the machines which they are putting <lb/>
            together at a distance: and this is exactly what happens <lb/>
            to you: you go to sleep over your property, and never re­ <lb/>
            flect how many misfortunes loom menacingly around you <lb/>
            on all sides, and soon will plunder you of costly spoils, but <lb/>
            if one takes away riches from the wise man, one leaves him <lb/>
            still in possession of all that is his: for he lives happy in <lb/>
            the present, and without fear for the future. The great <lb/>
            Socrates, or any one else who had the same superiority to <lb/>
            and power to withstand the things of this life, would say,' I <lb/>
            have no more fixed principle than that of not altering the <lb/>
            course of my life to suit your prejudices: you may pour <lb/>
            your accustomed talk upon me from all sides : I shall not <lb/>
            think that you are abusing me, but that you are merely <lb/>
            wailing like poor little babies.' " This is what the man will <lb/>
            say who possesses wisdom, whose mind, being free from <lb/>
            vices, bids him reproach others, not because he hates them, <lb/>
            but in order to improve them: and to this he will add, <lb/>
            " Your opinion of me affects me with pain, not for my own <lb/>
            sake but for yours, because to hate perfection and to assail <lb/>
            virtue is in itself a resignation of all hope of doing well. <lb/>
            You do me no harm ; neither do men harm the gods when <lb/>
            they overthrow their altars: but it is clear that your inten­ <lb/>
            tion is an evil one and that you will wish to do harm even <pb n="237"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXV.] </note> <lb/>
            where you are not able. I bear with your prating in the <lb/>
            same spirit in which Jupiter, best and greatest, bears with <lb/>
            the idle tales of the poets, one of whom represents him with <lb/>
            wings, another with horns, another as an adulterer staying <lb/>
            out all night, another is dealing harshly with the gods, <lb/>
            another as unjust to men, another as the seducer of noble <lb/>
            youths whom he carries off by force, and those, too, his own <lb/>
            relatives, another as a parricide and the conqueror of <lb/>
            another's kingdom, and that his father's. The only result <lb/>
            of such tales is that men feel less shame at committing sin <lb/>
            if they believe the gods to be guilty of such actions. But <lb/>
            although this conduct of yours does not hurt me, yet, for <lb/>
            your own sakes, I advise you, respect virtue: believe those <lb/>
            who having long followed her cry aloud that what they <lb/>
            follow is a thing of might, and daily appears mightier. <lb/>
            Reverence her as you would the gods, and reverence <lb/>
            her followers as you would the priests of the gods : and <lb/>
            whenever any mention of sacred writings is made, favete <lb/>
            Unguis, favour us with silence : this word is not derived, as <lb/>
            most people imagine, from favour, but commands silence, <lb/>
            that divine service may be performed without being inter­ <lb/>
            rupted by any words of evil omen. It is much more neces­ <lb/>
            sary that you should be ordered to do this, in order that <lb/>
            whenever utterance is made by that oracle, you may listen <lb/>
            to it with attention and in silence. Whenever any one beats <lb/>
            a sistrum,t pretending to do so by divine command, any <lb/>
            proficient in grazing his own skin covers his arms and <lb/>
            shoulders with blood from light cuts, any one crawls on his <lb/>
            knees howling along the street, or any old man clad in <lb/>
            linen comes forth in daylight with a lamp and laurel branch <lb/>
            and cries out that one of the gods is angry, you crowd <lb/>
            round him and listen to his words, and each increases the <note type="footnote"> 1 Sistrum. A metallic rattle used by the Egyptians in celebrating the <lb/>

            tering he cleansed from shame and rendered more honour­ <lb/>
            able than any senate house, Socrates addresses you, saying: <lb/>
            " What is this madness of yours ? what is this disposition, <lb/>
            at war alike with gods and men, which leads you to calum­ <lb/>
            niate virtue and to outrage holiness with malicious accu­ <lb/>
            sations ? Praise good men, if you are able : if not, pass <lb/>
            them by in silence: if indeed you take pleasure in this <lb/>
            offensive abusiveness, fall foul of one another: for when <lb/>
            you rave against Heaven, I do not say that you commit <lb/>
            sacrilege, but you waste your time. I once afforded Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes with the subject of a jest: since then all the crew of <lb/>
            comic poets have made me a mark for their envenomed <lb/>
            wit: my virtue has been made to shine more brightly by <lb/>
            the very blows which have been aimed at it, for it is to its <lb/>
            advantage to be brought before the public and exposed to <lb/>
            temptation, nor do any people understand its greatness <lb/>
            more than those who by their assaults have made trial of <lb/>
            its strength. The hardness of flint is known to none so <lb/>
            well as to those who strike it. I offer myself to all attacks, <lb/>
            like some lonely rock in a shallow sea, which the waves <lb/>
            .never cease to beat upon from whatever quarter they may <lb/>
            come, but which they cannot thereby move from its place <lb/>
            nor yet wear away, for however many years they may un­ <lb/>
            ceasingly dash against it. Bound upon me, rush upon me, I <lb/>
            will overcome you by enduring your onset: whatever strikes <lb/>
            against that which is firm and unconquerable merely in­ <lb/>
            jures itself by its own violence. Wherefore, seek some <lb/>
            soft and yielding object to pierce with your darts. But <lb/>
            have you leisure to peer into other men's evil deeds and to <lb/>
            sit in judgment upon anybody ? to ask how it is that this <lb/>
            philosopher has so roomy a house, or that one so good a <lb/>
            dinner ? Do you look at other people's pimples while you <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            yourselves are covered with countless ulcers ? This is as <lb/>
            though one who was eaten up by the mange were to point <lb/>
            with scorn at the moles and warts on the bodies of the <lb/>
            handsomest men. Reproach Plato with having sought for <lb/>
            money, reproach Aristotle with having obtained it, Demo­ <lb/>
            critus with having disregarded it, Epicurus with having <lb/>
            spent it: cast Phaedrus and Alcibiades in my own teeth, <lb/>
            you who reach the height of enjoyment whenever you get <lb/>
            an opportunity of imitating our vices! Why do you not <lb/>
            rather cast your eyes around yourselves at the ills which <lb/>
            tear you to pieces on every side, some attacking you from <lb/>
            without, some burning in your own bosoms? However <lb/>
            little you know your own place, mankind has not yet come <lb/>
            to such a pass that you can have leisure to wag your tongues <lb/>
            to the reproach of your betters.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. This you do not understand, and you bear a <lb/>
            countenance which does not befit your condition, like many <lb/>
            men who sit in the circus or the theatre without having <lb/>
            learned that their home is already in mourning : but I, look­ <lb/>
            ing forward from a lofty standpoint, can see what storms are <lb/>
            either threatening you, and will burst in torrents upon you <lb/>
            somewhat later, or are close upon you and on the point of <lb/>
            sweeping'away all that you possess. Why, though you are <lb/>
            hardly aware of it, is there not a whirling hurricane at this <lb/>
            moment spinning round and confusing your minds, making <lb/>
            them seek and avoid the very same things, now raising <lb/>
            them aloft and now dashing them below ? ......"</p>

          <p>.... why do they with great unanimity recommend <lb/>
            vices to us? even though we attempt nothing else that <lb/>
            would do us good, yet retirement in itself will be bene­ <lb/>
            ficial to us : we shall be better men when taken singly­ <lb/>
            and if so, what an advantage it will be to retire into the <lb/>
            society of the best of men, and to choose some example by <lb/>
            which we may guide our lives ! This cannot be done <lb/>
            without leisure: with leisure we can carry out that which <lb/>
            we have once for all decided to be best, when there is no <lb/>
            one to interfere with us and with the help of the mob per­ <lb/>
            vert our as yet feeble judgment: with leisure only can life, <lb/>
            which we distract by aiming at the most incompatible <lb/>
            objects, flow on in a single gentle stream. Indeed, the <lb/>
            worst of our various ills is that we change our very vices, <lb/>
            and so we have not even the advantage of dealing with a <lb/>
            well-known form of evil: we take pleasure first in one and <lb/>
            then in another, and are, besides, troubled by the fact that <lb/>
            our opinions are not only wrong, but lightly formed; we <lb/>
            toss as it were on waves, and clutch at one thing after <lb/>
            another: we let go what we just now sought for, and <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            strive to recover what we have let go. We oscillate be­ <lb/>
            tween desire and remorse, for we depend entirely upon the <lb/>
            opinions of others, and it is that which many people praise <lb/>
            and seek after, not that which deserves to be praised and <lb/>
            sought after, which we consider to be best. Nor do we <lb/>
            take any heed of whether our road be good or bad in <lb/>
            itself, but we value it by the number of footprints upon it, <lb/>
            among which there are none of any who have returned. <lb/>
            You will say to me, " Seneca, what are you doing ? do you <lb/>
            desert your party ? I am sure that our Stoic philosophers <lb/>
            say we must be in motion up to the very end of our life, <lb/>
            we will never cease to labour for the general good, to help <lb/>
            individual people, and when stricken in years to afford <lb/>
            assistance even to our enemies. We are the sect that <lb/>
            gives no discharge for any number of years' service, and <lb/>
            in the words of the most eloquent of poets :­ <lb/>
            ' We wear the helmet when our locks are grey.' 1 <lb/>
            We are they who are so far from indulging in any leisure <lb/>
            until we die, that if circumstances permit it, we do not <lb/>
            allow ourselves to be at leisure even when we are dying. <lb/>
            Why do you preach the maxims of Epicurus in the very <lb/>
            headquarters of Zeno? nay, if you are ashamed of your <lb/>
            party, why do you not go openly altogether over to the <lb/>
            enemy rather than betray your own side ? " I will answer <lb/>
            this question straightway : What more can you wish than <lb/>
            that I should imitate my leaders ? What then follows ? <lb/>
            I shall go whither they lead me, not whither they send <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>II. Now I will prove to yon that I am not deserting the <note type="footnote"> I Virg." Æn." ix. 612. Compare Sir Walter Scott," Lay of the Last <lb/>
            Minstrel," canto iv.:— <lb/>
            " And still, in age, he spurned at rest, <lb/>
            And still his brows the helmet pressed, <lb/>
            Albeit the blanched locks below <lb/>
            Were white as Dinlay's spotless snow," &amp;c. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            -tenets of the Stoics: for they themselves have not de­ <lb/>
            serted them: and yet I should be able to plead a very <lb/>
            good excuse even if I did follow, not their precepts, but their <lb/>
            examples. I shall divide what I am about to say into two <lb/>
            parts: first, that a man may from the very beginning of <lb/>
            his life give himself up entirely to the contemplation of <lb/>
            truth ; secondly, that a man when he has already com­ <lb/>
            pleted his term of service, has the best of rights, that of <lb/>
            his shattered health, to do this, and that he may then <lb/>
            apply his mind to other studies after the manner of the <lb/>
            Vestal virgins, who allot different duties to different years, <lb/>
            first learn how to perform the sacred rites, and when they <lb/>
            have learned them teach others.</p>
          <p>III. I will show that this is approved of by the Stoics also, <lb/>
            not that I have laid any commandment upon myself to do <lb/>
            nothing contrary to the teaching of Zeno and Chrysippus, <lb/>
            but because the matter itself allows me to follow the pre­ <lb/>
            cepts of those men ; for if one always follows the precepts <lb/>
            of one man, one ceases to be a debater and becomes a <lb/>
            partizan. Would that all things were already known, that <lb/>
            truth were unveiled and recognized, and that none of our <lb/>
            doctrines required modification! but as it is we have to <lb/>
            seek for truth in the company of the very men who teach <lb/>
            it. The two sects of Epicureans and Stoics differ widely <lb/>
            in most respects, and on this point among the rest, never­ <lb/>
            theless, each of them consigns us to leisure, although by a <lb/>
            different road. Epicurus says, " The wise man will not <lb/>
            take part in politics, except upon some special occasion ; " <lb/>
            Zeno says, "The wise man will take part in politics, unless <lb/>
            prevented -by some special circumstance." The one makes <lb/>
            it his aim in life to seek for leisure, the other seeks it only <lb/>
            when he has reasons for so doing: but this word "reasons" <lb/>
            has a wide signification. If the state is so rotten as to be <lb/>
            past helping, if evil has entire dominion over it, the wise <lb/>
            man will not labour in vain or waste his strength in un- <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            profitable efforts. Should he be deficient in influence or <lb/>
            bodily strength, if the state refuse to submit to his guidance, <lb/>
            if his health stand in the way, then he will not attempt a <lb/>
            journey for which he is unfit, just as he would not put to <lb/>
            sea in a worn-out ship, or enlist in the army if he were an <lb/>
            invalid. Consequently, one who has not yet suffered either <lb/>
            in health or fortune has the right, before encountering any <lb/>
            storms, to establish himself in safety, and thenceforth to <lb/>
            devote himself to honourable industry and inviolate leisure, <lb/>
            and the service of those virtues which can be practised <lb/>
            even by those who pass the quietest of lives. The duty of <lb/>
            a man is to be useful to his fellow-men ; if possible, to be <lb/>
            useful to many of them; failing this, to be useful to a few ; <lb/>
            failing this, to be useful to his neighbours, and, failing <lb/>
            them, to himself: for when he helps others, he advances <lb/>
            the general interests of mankind. Just as he who makes <lb/>
            himself a worse man does harm not only to himself but to <lb/>
            all those to whom he might have done good if he had made <lb/>
            himself a better one, so he who deserves well of himself <lb/>
            does good to others by the very fact that he is preparing <lb/>
            what will be of service to them.</p>
          <p>IV. Let us grasp the fact that there are two republics, <lb/>
            one vast and truly "public," which contains alike gods and <lb/>
            men, in which we do not take account of this or that nook <lb/>
            of land, but make the boundaries of our state reach as far <lb/>
            as the rays of the sun : and another to which we have been <lb/>
            assigned by the accident of birth. This may be that of <lb/>
            the Athenians or Carthaginians, or of any other city which <lb/>
            does not belong to all men but to some especial ones. <lb/>
            Some men serve both of these states, the greater and the <lb/>
            lesser, at the same time ; some serve only the lesser, some <lb/>
            only the greater. We can serve the greater commonwealth <lb/>
            even when we are at leisure; indeed I am not sure that we <lb/>
            cannot serve it better when we are at leisure to inquire <lb/>
            into what virtue is, and whether it be one or many: <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            whether it be nature or art that makes men good: whether <lb/>
            that which contains the earth and sea and all that in them <lb/>
            is be one, or whether God has placed therein many bodies <lb/>
            of the same species : whether that out of which all things <lb/>
            are made be continuous and solid, or containing interstices <lb/>
            and alternate empty and full spaces : whether God idly <lb/>
            looks on at His handiwork, or directs its course : whether <lb/>
            He is without and around the world, or whether He per­ <lb/>
            vades its entire surface: whether the world be immortal, <lb/>
            or doomed to decay and belonging to the class of things <lb/>
            which are born only for a time ? What service does he who <lb/>
            meditates upon these questions render to God ? He pre­ <lb/>
            vents these His great works having no one to witness them.</p>
          <p>V. We have a habit of saying that the highest good is to <lb/>
            live according to nature: now nature has produced us for <lb/>
            both purposes, for contemplation and for action. Let us <lb/>
            now prove what we said before : nay, who will not think­ <lb/>
            this proved if he bethinks himself how great a passion he <lb/>
            has for discovering the unknown ? how vehemently his <lb/>
            curiosity is roused by every kind of romantic tale. Some <lb/>
            men make long voyages and undergo the toils of journeying <lb/>
            to distant lands for no reward except that of discovering <lb/>
            something hidden and remote. This is what draws people <lb/>
            to public shows, and causes them to pry into everything <lb/>
            that. is closed, to puzzle out everything that is secret, to <lb/>
            clear up points of antiquity, and to listen to tales of the <lb/>
            customs of savage nations. Nature has bestowed upon us <lb/>
            an inquiring disposition, and being well aware of her own <lb/>
            skill and beauty, has produced us to be spectators of her <lb/>
            vast works, because she would lose all the fruits of her <lb/>
            labour if she were to exhibit such vast and noble works of <lb/>
            such complex construction, so bright and beautiful in so <lb/>
            many ways, to solitude alone. That you may be sure that <lb/>
            she wishes to be gazed upon, not merely looked at, see <lb/>
            what a place she has assigned to us : she has placed us in <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            the middle of herself and given us a prospect all around. <lb/>
            She has not only set man erect upon his feet, but also with <lb/>
            a view to making it easy for him to watch the heavens, <lb/>
            she has raised his head on high and connected it with a <lb/>
            pliant neck, in order that he might follow the course of the <lb/>
            stars from their rising to their setting, and move his face <lb/>
            round with the whole heaven. Moreover, by carrying <lb/>
            six constellations across the sky by day, and six by night, <lb/>
            she displays every part of herself in such a manner that by <lb/>
            what she brings before man's eyes she renders him eager <lb/>
            to see the rest also. For we have not beheld all things, <lb/>
            nor yet the true extent of them, but our eyesight does but <lb/>
            open to itself the right path for research, and lay the <lb/>
            foundation, from which out speculations may pass from <lb/>
            what is obvious to what is less known, and find out some­ <lb/>
            thing more ancient than the world itself, from whence <lb/>
            those stars came forth: inquire what was the condition of <lb/>
            the universe before each of its elements were separated <lb/>
            from the general mass : on what principle its confused and <lb/>
            blended parts were divided : who assigned their places to <lb/>
            things, whether it was by their own nature that what was <lb/>
            heavy sunk downwards, and what was light flew upwards, <lb/>
            or whether besides the stress and weight of bodies some <lb/>
            higher power gave laws to each of them : whether that <lb/>
            greatest proof that the spirit of man is divine be true, the <lb/>
            theory, namely, that some parts and as it were sparks of <lb/>
            the stars have fallen down upon earth and stuck there in a <lb/>
            foreign substance. Our thought bursts through the battle- <lb/>
            ments of heaven, and is not satisfied with knowing only <lb/>
            what is shown to us : "I investigate," it says, " that which <lb/>
            lies without the world, whether it be a bottomless abyss, or <lb/>
            whether it also is confined within boundaries of its <lb/>
            own: what the appearance of the things outside may be, <lb/>
            whether they be shapeless and vague, extending equally <lb/>
            in every direction, or whether they also are arranged <pb n="246"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            in a certain kind of order: whether they are connected <lb/>
            with this world of ours, or are widely separated from <lb/>
            it and welter about in empty space: whether they con­ <lb/>
            sist of distinct atoms, of which everything that is and <lb/>
            that is to be, is made, or whether their substance is un­ <lb/>
            interrupted and all of it capable of change: whether the <lb/>
            elements are naturally opposed to one another, or whether <lb/>
            they are not at variance, but work towards the same end <lb/>
            by different means." Since man was born for such specu­ <lb/>
            lations as these, consider how short a time he has been <lb/>
            given for them, even supposing that he makes good his <lb/>
            claims to the whole of it, allows no part of it to be wrested <lb/>
            from him through good nature, or to slip away from him <lb/>
            through carelessness ; though he watches over all his hours <lb/>
            with most miserly care, though he live to the extreme con­ <lb/>
            fines of human existence, and though misfortune take <lb/>
            nothing away from what Nature bestowed upon him, even <lb/>
            then man is too mortal for the comprehension of immortality. <lb/>
            I live according to Nature, therefore, if I give myself <lb/>
            entirely up to her, and if I admire and reverence her. <lb/>
            Nature, however, intended me to do both, to practise both <lb/>
            contemplation and action: and I do both, because even <lb/>
            contemplation is not devoid of action.</p>
          <p>VI. "But," say you, " it makes a difference whether <lb/>
            you adopt the contemplative life for the sake of your own <lb/>
            pleasure, demanding nothing from it save unbroken con­ <lb/>
            templation without any result: for such a life is a sweet one <lb/>
            and has attractions of its own." To this I answer you : It <lb/>
            makes just as much difference in what spirit you lead the <lb/>
            life of a public man, whether you are never at rest, and <lb/>
            never set apart any time during which you may turn your <lb/>
            eyes away from the things of earth to those of Heaven. It <lb/>
            is by no means desirable that one should merely strive to <lb/>
            accumulate property without any love of virtue, or do <lb/>
            nothing but hard work without any cultivation of the <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            intellect, for these things ought to be combined and blended <lb/>
            together ; and, similarly, virtue placed in leisure without <lb/>
            action is but an incomplete and feeble good thing, because <lb/>
            she never displays what she has learned. Who can deny <lb/>
            that she ought to test her progress in actual work, and not <lb/>
            merely think what ought to be done, but also sometimes <lb/>
            use her hands as well as her head, and bring her con­ <lb/>
            ceptions into actual being ? But if the wise man be quite <lb/>
            willing to act thus, if it be the things to be done, not the <lb/>
            man to do them that are wanting, will you not then <lb/>
            allow him to live to himself ? What is the wise man's <lb/>
            purpose in devoting himself to leisure ? He knows that in <lb/>
            leisure as well as in action he will accomplish something by <lb/>
            which he will be of service to posterity. Our school at any <lb/>
            rate declares that Zeno and Chrysippus have done greater <lb/>
            things than they would have done had they been in com­ <lb/>
            mand of armies, or filled high offices, or passed laws: <lb/>
            which latter indeed they did pass, though not for one single <lb/>
            state, but for the whole human race. Howthen can it be <lb/>
            unbecoming to a good man to enjoy a leisure such as this, <lb/>
            by whose means he gives laws to ages to come, and <lb/>
            addresses himself not to a few persons but to all men of all <lb/>
            nations, both now and hereafter ? To sum up the matter, I <lb/>
            ask you whether Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Zeno lived in <lb/>
            accordance with their doctrine ? I am sure that you will <lb/>
            answer that they lived in the manner in which they taught <lb/>
            that men ought to live: yet no one of them governed a <lb/>
            state. " They had not," you reply, "the amount of property <lb/>
            or social position which as a rule enables people to take <lb/>
            part in public affairs." Yet for all that they did not live <lb/>
            an idle life : they found the means of making their retire­ <lb/>
            ment more useful to mankind than the perspirings and <lb/>
            runnings to and fro of other men : wherefore these persons <lb/>
            are thought to have done great things, in spite of their <lb/>
            having done nothing of a public character.</p><pb n="248"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. VIII. </note> VII. Morever, there are three kinds of life, and it is a <lb/>
            stock question which of the three is the best: the first is <lb/>
            devoted to pleasure, the second to contemplation, the third <lb/>
            to action. First, let us lay aside all disputatiousness and <lb/>
            bitterness of feeling, which, as we have stated, causes those <lb/>
            whose paths in life are different to hate one another beyond <lb/>
            all hope of reconciliation, and let us see whether all <lb/>
            these three do not come to the same thing, although under <lb/>
            different names : for neither he who decides for pleasure <lb/>
            is without contemplation, nor is he who gives himself up to <lb/>
            contemplation without pleasure: nor yet is he, whose life <lb/>
            is devoted to action, without contemplation. "It makes," <lb/>
            you say, " all the difference in the world, whether a <lb/>
            thing is one's main object in life, or whether it be merely <lb/>
            an appendage to some other object." I admit that the <lb/>
            difference is considerable, nevertheless the one does not <lb/>
            exist apart from the other: the one man cannot live in <lb/>
            contemplation without action, nor can the other act without <lb/>
            contemplation : and even the third, of whom we all agree <lb/>
            in having a bad opinion, does not approve of passive <lb/>
            pleasure, but of that which he establishes for himself by <lb/>
            means of reason: even this pleasure-seeking sect itself, <lb/>
            therefore, practises action also. Of course it does, since <lb/>
            Epicurus himself says that at times he would abandon <lb/>
            pleasure and actually seek for pain, if he became likely to <lb/>
            be surfeited with pleasure, or if he thought that by enduring <lb/>
            a slight pain he might avoid a greater one. With what <lb/>
            purpose do I state this ? To prove that all men are fond <lb/>
            of contemplation. Some make it the object of their lives : <lb/>
            to us it is an anchorage, but not a harbour.</p>
          <p>VIII. Add to this that, according to the doctrine of <lb/>
            Chrysippus, a man may live at leisure: I do not say that <lb/>
            he ought to endure leisure, but that he ought to choose it. <lb/>
            Our Stoics say that the wise man would not take part in <lb/>
            the government of any state. What difference does it <pb n="249"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            make by what path the wise man arrives at leisure, whether <lb/>
            it be because the state is wanting to him, or he is wanting <lb/>
            to the state ? If the state is to be wanting to all wise <lb/>
            men (and it always will be found wanting by refined <lb/>
            thinkers), I ask you, to what state should the wise man <lb/>
            betake himself ; to that of the Athenians, in which Socrates <lb/>
            is condemned to death, and from which Aristotle goes into <lb/>
            exile lest he should be condemned to death ? where virtues <lb/>
            are borne down by jealousy ? You will tell me that no <lb/>
            wise man would join such a state. Shall then the wise <lb/>
            man go to the commonwealth of the Carthaginians, where <lb/>
            faction never ceases to rage, and liberty is the foe of all <lb/>
            the best men, where justice and goodness are held of no <lb/>
            account, where enemies are treated with inhuman cruelty <lb/>
            and natives are treated like enemies : he will flee from this <lb/>
            state also. If I were to discuss each one separately, I <lb/>
            should not be able to find one which the wise man could <lb/>
            endure, or which could endure the wise man. Now if such <lb/>
            a state as we have dreamed of cannot be found on earth, <lb/>
            it follows that leisure is necessary for every one, because <lb/>
            the one thing which might be preferred to leisure is nowhere <lb/>
            to be found. If any one says that to sail is the best of things, <lb/>
            and then says that we ought not to sail in a sea in which <lb/>
            shipwrecks were common occurrences, and where sudden <lb/>
            storms often arise which drive the pilot back from his <lb/>
            course, I should imagine that this man, while speaking in <lb/>
            praise of sailing, was really forbidding me to unmoor my <lb/>
            ship</p>

          <p>w <lb/>
            HEN I examine myself, Seneca, some vices appear <lb/>
            on the surface, and so that I can lay my hands <lb/>
            upon them, while others are less distinct and harder to <lb/>
            reach, and some are not always present, but recur at in­ <lb/>
            tervals : and these I should call the most troublesome, <lb/>
            being like a roving enemy that assails one when he sees <lb/>
            his opportunity, and who will neither let one stand on one's <lb/>
            guard as in war, nor yet take one's rest without fear as in <lb/>
            peace., The position in which I find myself more especially <lb/>
            (for why should I not tell you the truth as I would to a <lb/>
            physician), is that of neither being thoroughly set free <lb/>
            from the vices which I fear and hate, nor yet quite in <lb/>
            bondage to them : my state of mind, though not the worst <lb/>
            possible, is a particularly discontented and sulky one: I am <lb/>
            neither ill nor well. It is of no use for you. to tell me that <lb/>
            all virtues are weakly at the outset, and that they acquire <lb/>
            strength and solidity by time, for I am well aware that <lb/>
            even those which do but help our outward show, such as <lb/>
            grandeur, a reputation for eloquence, and everything that <lb/>
            appeals to others, gain power by time. Both those which <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            afford us real strength and those which do but trick us out <lb/>
            in a more attractive form, require long years before they <lb/>
            gradually are adapted to us by time. But I fear that <lb/>
            custom, which confirms most things, implants this vice <lb/>
            more and more deeply in me. Long acquaintance with <lb/>
            both good and bad people leads one to esteem them all alike. <lb/>
            What this state of weakness really is, when the mind halts <lb/>
            between two opinions without any strong inclination <lb/>
            towards either good or evil, I shall be better able to show <lb/>
            you piecemeal than all at once. I will tell you what befalls <lb/>
            me, you must find out the name of the disease. I have to <lb/>
            confess the greatest possible love of thrift: I do not care <lb/>
            for a bed with gorgeous hangings, nor for clothes brought <lb/>
            out of a chest, or pressed under weights and made glossy <lb/>
            by frequent manglings, but for common and cheap ones, <lb/>
            that require no care either to keep them or to put them on. <lb/>
            For food I do not want what needs whole troops of servants <lb/>
            to prepare it and admire it, nor what is ordered many days <lb/>
            before and served up by many hands, but something handy <lb/>
            and easily come at, with nothing far-fetched or costly about <lb/>
            it, to be had in every part of the world, burdensome neither <lb/>
            to one's fortune nor one's body, not likely to go out of the <lb/>
            body by the same path by which it came in. I like1 a <lb/>
            rough and unpolished homebred servant, I like my servant <lb/>
            born in my house : I like ray country-bred father's heavy <lb/>
            silver plate stamped with no maker's name: I do not want <lb/>
            a table that is beauteous with dappled spots, or known to <lb/>
            all the town by the number of fashionable people to whom <lb/>
            it has successively belonged, but one which stands merely <lb/>
            for use, and which causes no guest's eye to dwell upon it <lb/>
            with pleasure or to kindle at it with envy. While I am <lb/>
            well satisfied with this, I am reminded of the clothes of a <lb/>
            certain schoolboy, dressed with no ordinary care and <lb/>
            splendour, of slaves bedecked with gold and a whole regi- <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Juv. it. 150. </note> <pb n="252"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            ment of glittering attendants. I think of houses too, where <lb/>
            one treads on precious stones, and where valuables lie about <lb/>
            in every corner, where the very roof is brilliantly painted, <lb/>
            and a whole nation attends and accompanies an inheri­ <lb/>
            tance on the road to ruin. What shall I say of waters, <lb/>
            transparent to the very bottom, which flow round the guests, <lb/>
            and banquets worthy of the theatre in which they take <lb/>
            place ? Coming as I do from a long course of dull thrift, <lb/>
            I find myself surrounded by the most brilliant luxury, which <lb/>
            echoes around me on every side: my sight becomes a little <lb/>
            dazzled by it: I can lift up my heart against it more easily <lb/>
            than my eyes. When I return from seeing it I am a sadder, <lb/>
            though not a worse man, I cannot walk amid my own <lb/>
            paltry possessions with so lofty a step as before, and silently <lb/>
            there steals over me a feeling of vexation, and a doubt <lb/>
            whether that way of life may not be better than mine. <lb/>
            None of these things alter my principles, yet all of them <lb/>
            disturb me. At one time I would obey the maxims of our <lb/>
            school and plunge into public life, I would obtain office <lb/>
            and become consul, not because the purple robe and lictor's <lb/>
            axes attract me, but in order that I may be able to be of <lb/>
            use to my friends, my relatives, to all my countrymen, and <lb/>
            indeed to all mankind. Ready and determined, I follow <lb/>
            the advice of Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, all of whom <lb/>
            bid one take part in public affairs, though none of them <lb/>
            ever did so himself: and then, as soon as something disturbs <lb/>
            my mind, which is not used to receiving shocks, as soon as <lb/>
            something occurs which is either disgraceful, such as often <lb/>
            occurs in all men's lives, or which does not proceed quite <lb/>
            easily, or when subjects of very little importance require <lb/>
            me to devote a great deal of time to them, I go back to my <lb/>
            life of leisure, and, just as even tired cattle go faster when <lb/>
            they are going home, I wish to retire and pass my life <lb/>
            within the walls of my house. "No one," I say, "that <lb/>
            will give me no compensation worth such a loss shall ever <pb n="253"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            rob me of a day. Let my mind be contained within itself <lb/>
            and improve itself: let it take no part with other men'a <lb/>
            affairs, and do nothing which depends on the approval of <lb/>
            others: let me enjoy a tranquillity undisturbed by either <lb/>
            public or private troubles." But whenever my spirit is <lb/>
            roused by reading some brave words, or some noble example <lb/>
            spurs me into action, I want to rush into the law courts, to <lb/>
            place my voice at one man's disposal, my services at <lb/>
            another's, and to try to help him even though I may not <lb/>
            succeed, or to quell the pride of some lawyer who is <lb/>
            puffed up by ill-deserved success: but I think, by Hercules, <lb/>
            that in philosophical speculation it is better to view things <lb/>
            as they are, and to speak of them on their own account, <lb/>
            and as for words, to trust to things for them, and to let <lb/>
            one's speech simply follow whither they lead. " Why do <lb/>
            you want to construct a fabric that will endure for ages ? <lb/>
            Do you not wish to do this in order that posterity may talk <lb/>
            of you : yet you were born to die, and a silent death is the <lb/>
            least wretched. Write something therefore in a simple <lb/>
            style, merely to pass the time, for your own use, and not <lb/>
            for publication. Less labour is needed when one does not <lb/>
            look beyond the present." Then again, when the mind is <lb/>
            elevated by the greatness of its thoughts, it becomes osten­ <lb/>
            tatious in its use of words, the loftier its aspirations, the <lb/>
            more loftily it desires to express them, and its speech rises <lb/>
            to the dignity of its subject. At such times I forget my <lb/>
            mild and moderate determination and soar higher than is <lb/>
            my wont, using a language that is not my own. Not to <lb/>
            multiply examples, I am in all things attended by this <lb/>
            weakness of a well-meaning mind, to whose level I fear that <lb/>
            I shall be gradually brought down, or, what is even more <lb/>
            worrying, that I may always hang as though about to fall, <lb/>
            and that there may be more the matter with me than I <lb/>
            myself perceive: for we take a friendly view of our own <lb/>
            private affairs, and partiality always obscures our judgment. <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BE. IX. </note> <lb/>
            I fancy that many men would have arrived at wisdom had <lb/>
            they not believed themselves to have arrived there already, <lb/>
            had they not purposely deceived themselves as to some <lb/>
            parts of their character, and passed by others with their <lb/>
            eyes shut: for you have no grounds for supposing that <lb/>
            other people's flattery is more ruinous to us than our own. <lb/>
            Who dares to tell himself the truth ? Who is there, by <lb/>
            however large a troop of caressing courtiers he may be <lb/>
            surrounded, who in spite of them is not his own greatest <lb/>
            flatterer ? I beg you, therefore, if you have any remedy <lb/>
            by which you could stop this vacillation of mine, to deem <lb/>
            me worthy to owe my peace of mind to you. I am well <lb/>
            aware that these oscillations of mind are not perilous and <lb/>
            that they threaten me with no serious disorder : to express <lb/>
            what I complain of by an exact simile, I am not suffering <lb/>
            from a storm, but from sea-sickness. Take from me, then, <lb/>
            this evil, whatever it may be, and help one who is in distress <lb/>
            within sight of land.</p>
          <p>II. [Seneca.] I have long been silently asking myself, <lb/>
            my friend Serenus, to what I should liken such a condition <lb/>
            of mind, and I find that nothing more closely resembles it <lb/>
            than the conduct of those who, after having recovered from <lb/>
            a long and serious illness, occasionally experience slight <lb/>
            touches and twinges, and, - although they have passed <lb/>
            through the final stages of the disease, yet have suspicions <lb/>
            that it has not left them, and though in perfect health yet <lb/>
            hold out their pulse to be felt by the physician, and when­ <lb/>
            ever they feel warm suspect that the fever is returning. <lb/>
            Such men, Serenus, are not unhealthy, but they are not <lb/>
            accustomed to being healthy; just as even a quiet sea <lb/>
            or lake nevertheless displays a certain amount of ripple <lb/>
            when its waters are subsiding after a storm. What you <lb/>
            need, therefore, is, not any of those harsher remedies to <lb/>
            which allusion has been made, not that you should in some <lb/>
            cases check yourself, in others be angry with yourself, in <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            others sternly reproach yourself, but that you should adopt <lb/>
            that which comes last in the list, have confidence in your­ <lb/>
            self, and believe that you are proceeding on the right path, <lb/>
            without being led aside by the numerous divergent tracks <lb/>
            of wanderers which cross it in every direction, some of them <lb/>
            circling about the right path itself. What you desire, to <lb/>
            be undisturbed, is a great thing, nay, the greatest thing of <lb/>
            all, and one which raises a man almost to the level of a <lb/>
            god. The Greeks call this calm steadiness of mind <lb/>
            euthymia, and Democritus's treatise upon it is excel­ <lb/>
            lently written: I call it peace of mind: for there is no <lb/>
            necessity for translating so exactly as to copy the words of <lb/>
            the Greek idiom: the essential point is to mark the matter <lb/>
            under discussion by a name which ought to have the same <lb/>
            meaning as its Greek name, though perhaps not the same <lb/>
            form. What we are seeking, then, is how the mind may <lb/>
            always pursue a steady, unruffled course, may be pleased <lb/>
            with itself, and look with pleasure upon its surroundings, <lb/>
            and experience no interruption of this joy, but abide in a <lb/>
            peaceful condition without being ever either elated or <lb/>
            depressed: this will be " peace of mind." Let us now <lb/>
            consider in a general way how it may be attained: then <lb/>
            you may apply as much as you choose of the universal <lb/>
            remedy to your own case. Meanwhile we must drag to <lb/>
            light the entire disease, and then each one will recognize <lb/>
            his own part of it: at the same time you will understand <lb/>
            how much less you suffer by your self-depreciation than <lb/>
            those who are bound by some showy declaration which <lb/>
            they have made, and are oppressed by some grand title of <lb/>
            honour, so that shame rather than their own free will forces <lb/>
            them to keep up the pretence. The same thing applies <lb/>
            both to those who suffer from fickleness and continual <lb/>
            changes of purpose, who always are fondest of what they <lb/>
            have given up, and those who merely yawn and dawdle: <lb/>
            add to these those who, like bad sleepers, turn from side to <pb n="256"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            side, and settle themselves first in one manner and then in <lb/>
            another, until at last they find rest through sheer weari­ <lb/>
            ness : in forming the habits of their lives they often end by <lb/>
            adopting some to which they are not kept by any dislike <lb/>
            of change, but in the practice of which old age, which is <lb/>
            slow to alter, has caught them living : add also those who <lb/>
            are by no means fickle, yet who must thank their dulness, <lb/>
            not their consistency for being so, and who go on living not <lb/>
            in the way they wish, but in the way they have begun to <lb/>
            live. There are other special forms of this disease without <lb/>
            number, but it has but one effect, that of making people <lb/>
            dissatisfied with themselves. This arises from a distem­ <lb/>
            perature of mind and from desires which one is afraid to <lb/>
            express or unable to fulfil, when men either dare not <lb/>
            attempt as much as they wish to do, or fail in their efforts <lb/>
            and depend entirely upon hope: such people are always <lb/>
            fickle and changeable, which is a necessary consequence of <lb/>
            living in a state of suspense : they take any way to arrive <lb/>
            at their ends, and teach and force themselves to use both <lb/>
            dishonourable and difficult means to do so, so that when <lb/>
            their toil has been in vain they are made wretched by the <lb/>
            disgrace of failure, and do not regret having longed for <lb/>
            what was wrong, but having longed for it in vain. They <lb/>
            then begin to feel sorry for what they have done, and afraid <lb/>
            to begin again, and their mind falls by degrees into a state <lb/>
            of endless vacillation, because they can neither command nor <lb/>
            obey their passions, of hesitation, because their life cannot <lb/>
            properly develope itself, and of decay, as the mind becomes <lb/>
            stupefied by disappointments. All these symptoms become <lb/>
            aggravated when their dislike of a laborious misery has <lb/>
            driven them to idleness and to secret studies, which are un­ <lb/>
            endurable to a mind eager to take part in public affairs, <lb/>
            desirous of action and naturally restless, because, of course, <lb/>
            it finds too few resources within itself: when therefore it <lb/>
            loses the amusement which business itself affords to busy <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            men, it cannot endure home, loneliness, or the walls of a <lb/>
            room, and regards itself with dislike when left to itself. <lb/>
            Hence arises that weariness and dissatisfaction with one­ <lb/>
            self, that tossing to and fro of a mind which can nowhere <lb/>
            find rest, that unhappy and unwilling endurance of en­ <lb/>
            forced leisure. In all cases where one feels ashamed to <lb/>
            confess the real cause of one's suffering, and where modesty <lb/>
            leads one to drive one's sufferings inward, the desires pent <lb/>
            up in a little space without any vent choke one another. <lb/>
            Hence comes melancholy and drooping of spirit, and a <lb/>
            thousand waverings of the unsteadfast mind, which is held <lb/>
            in suspense by unfulfilled hopes, and saddened by disap­ <lb/>
            pointed ones : hence comes the state of mind of those who <lb/>
            loathe their idleness, complain that they have nothing to <lb/>
            do, and view the progress of others with the bitterest <lb/>
            jealousy : for an unhappy sloth favours the growth of envy, <lb/>
            and men who cannot succeed themselves wish every one <lb/>
            else to be ruined. This dislike of other men's progress and <lb/>
            despair of one's own produces a mind angered against for­ <lb/>
            tune, addicted to complaining of the age in which it lives, <lb/>
            to retiring into corners and brooding over its misery, until <lb/>
            it becomes sick and weary of itself : for the human mind is <lb/>
            naturally nimble and apt at movement: it delights in every <lb/>
            opportunity of excitement and forgetfulness of itself, and <lb/>
            the worse a man's disposition the more he delights in this, <lb/>
            because he likes to wear himself out with busy action, just <lb/>
            as some sores long for the hands that injure them and <lb/>
            delight in being touched, and the foul itch enjoys anything <lb/>
            that scratches it. Similarly I assure you that these minds, <lb/>
            over which desires have spread like evil ulcers, take plea­ <lb/>
            sure in toils and troubles, for there are some things which <lb/>
            please our body while at the same time they give it a <lb/>
            certain amount of pain, such as turning oneself over and <lb/>
            changing one's side before it is wearied, or cooling oneself <lb/>
            in one position after another. It is like Homer's Achilles, <note type="footnote"> s </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            lying first upon its face, then upon its back, placing itself <lb/>
            in various attitudes, and, as sick people are wont, enduring <lb/>
            none of them for long, and using changes as though they <lb/>
            were remedies. Hence men undertake aimless wanderings, <lb/>
            travel along distant shores, and at one time at sea, at <lb/>
            another by land, try to soothe that fickleness of disposition <lb/>
            which always is dissatisfied with the present. " Now let <lb/>
            us make for Campania: now I am sick of rich cultivation : <lb/>
            let us see wild regions, let us thread the passes of Bruttii <lb/>
            and Lucania: yet amid this wilderness one wants some­ <lb/>
            thing of beauty to relieve our pampered eyes after so long <lb/>
            dwelling on savage wastes: let us seek Tarentum with its <lb/>
            famous harbour, its mild winter climate, and its district, <lb/>
            rich enough to support even the great hordes of ancient <lb/>
            times. Let us now return to town: our ears have too long <lb/>
            missed its shouts and noise: it would be pleasant also to <lb/>
            enjoy the sight of human bloodshed." Thus one journey <lb/>
            succeeds another, and one sight is changed for another. <lb/>
            As Lucretius says:- <lb/>
            Thus every mortal from himself doth flee ;" <lb/>
            but what does he gain by so doing if he does not escape <lb/>
            from himself? he follows himself and weighs himself down <lb/>
            by his own most burdensome companionship. We must <lb/>
            understand, therefore, that what we suffer from is not the <lb/>
            fault of the places but of ourselves : we are weak when <lb/>
            there is anything to be endured, and cannot support either <lb/>
            labour or pleasure, either one's own business or any one <lb/>
            else's for long. This has driven some men to death, because <lb/>
            by frequently altering their purpose they were always <lb/>
            brought back to the same point, and had left themselves <lb/>
            no room for anything new. They had become sick of life <lb/>
            and of the world itself, and as all indulgences palled upon <lb/>
            them they began to ask themselves the question, " How <lb/>
            long are we to go on doing the same thing ? "</p><pb n="259"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> III. You ask me what I think we had better make use <lb/>
            of to help us to support this ennui. " The best thing," as <lb/>
            Athenodorus says, " is to occupy oneself with business, <lb/>
            with the managements affairs of state and the duties of a <lb/>
            citizen : for as some pass the day in exercising themselves <lb/>
            in the sun and in taking care of their bodily health, and <lb/>
            athletes find it most useful to spend the greater part of <lb/>
            their time in feeding up the muscles and strength to whose <lb/>
            cultivation they have devoted their lives ; so too for you <lb/>
            who are training your mind to take part in the struggles of <lb/>
            political life, it is far more honourable to be thus at work <lb/>
            than to be idle. He whose object is to be of service to his <lb/>
            countrymen and to all mortals, exercises himself and does <lb/>
            good at the same time when he is engrossed in business <lb/>
            and is working to the best of his ability both in the interests <lb/>
            of the public and of private men. But," continues he, <lb/>
            " because innocence is hardly safe among such furious <lb/>
            ambitions and so many men who turn one aside from the <lb/>
            right path, and it is always sure to meet with more <lb/>
            hindrance than help, we ought to withdraw ourselves from <lb/>
            the forum and from public life, and a great mind even in <lb/>
            a private station can find room wherein to expand freely. <lb/>
            Confinement in dens restrains the springs of lions and wild <lb/>
            creatures, but this does not apply to human beings, who <lb/>
            often effect the most important works in retirement. Let <lb/>
            a man, however, withdraw himself only in such a fashion <lb/>
            that wherever he spends his leisure his wish may still be to <lb/>
            benefit individual men and mankind alike, both with his <lb/>
            intellect, his voice, and his advice. The man that does <lb/>
            good service to the state is not only he who brings forward <lb/>
            candidates for public office, defends accused persons, and <lb/>
            gives his vote on questions of peace and war, but he who en­ <lb/>
            courages young men in well-doing, who supplies the present <lb/>
            dearth of good teachers by instilling into their minds the <lb/>
            principles of virtue, who seizes and holds back those who <pb n="260"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            are rushing wildly in pursuit of riches and luxury, and, if he <lb/>
            does nothing else, at least checks their course-such a man <lb/>
            does service to the public though in a private station. Which <lb/>
            does the most good, he who decides between foreigners and <lb/>
            citizens (as praetor peregrinus), or, as praetor urbanus, pro­ <lb/>
            nounces sentence to the suitors in his court at his assistant's <lb/>
            dictation, or he who shows them what is meant by justice, <lb/>
            filial feeling, endurance, courage, contempt of death and <lb/>
            knowledge of the gods, and how much a man is helped by a <lb/>
            good conscience ? If then you transfer to philosophy the <lb/>
            time which you take away from the public service, you <lb/>
            will not be a deserter or have refused to perform your <lb/>
            proper task. A soldier is not merely one who stands in <lb/>
            the ranks and defends the right or the left wing of the <lb/>
            army, but he also who guards the gates-a service which, <lb/>
            though less dangerous, is no sinecure-who keeps watch, <lb/>
            and takes charge of the arsenal: though all these are <lb/>
            bloodless duties, yet they count as military service. As <lb/>
            soon as you have devoted yourself to philosophy, you will <lb/>
            have overcome all disgust at life: you will not wish for <lb/>
            darkness because you are weary of the light, nor will you <lb/>
            be a trouble to yourself and useless to others: you will <lb/>
            acquire many friends, and all the best men will be attracted <lb/>
            towards you : for virtue, in however obscure a position, <lb/>
            cannot be hidden, but gives signs of its presence : any one <lb/>
            who is worthy will trace it out by its footsteps : but if we <lb/>
            give up all society, turn our backs upon the whole human <lb/>
            race, and live communing with ourselves alone, this soli­ <lb/>
            tude without any interesting occupation will lead to a want <lb/>
            of something to do: we shall begin to build up and to <lb/>
            pull down, to dam out the sea, to cause waters to flow <lb/>
            through natural obstacles, and generally to make a bad <lb/>
            disposal of the time which Nature has given us to spend : <lb/>
            some of us use it grudgingly, others wastefully; some of us <lb/>
            spend it so that we can show a profit and loss account, <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            others so that they have no assets remaining : than which <lb/>
            nothing can be more shameful. Often a man who is very <lb/>
            old in years has nothing beyond his age by which he can <lb/>
            prove that he has lived a long time."</p>
          <p>IV. To me, my dearest Serenus, Athenodorus seems to <lb/>
            have yielded too completely to the times, to have fled too <lb/>
            soon: I will not deny that sometimes one must retire, but <lb/>
            one ought to retire slowly, at a foot's pace, without losing <lb/>
            one's ensigns or one's honour as a soldier: those who make <lb/>
            terms with arms in their hands are more respected by their <lb/>
            enemies and more safe in their hands. This is what I <lb/>
            think ought to be done by virtue and by one who practises <lb/>
            virtue : if Fortune get the upper hand and deprive him of <lb/>
            the power of action, let him not straightway turn his back <lb/>
            to the enemy, throw away his arms, and run away seeking <lb/>
            for a hiding-place, as if there were any place whither <lb/>
            Fortune could not pursue him, but let him be more sparing <lb/>
            in his acceptance of public office, and after due deliberation <lb/>
            discover some means by which he can be of use to the <lb/>
            state. He is not able to serve in the army : then let him <lb/>
            become a candidate for civic honours: must he live in a <lb/>
            private station ? then let him be an advocate: is he con­ <lb/>
            demned to keep silence? then let him help his countrymen <lb/>
            with silent counsel. Is it dangerous for him even to enter <lb/>
            the forum ? then let him prove himself a good comrade, a <lb/>
            faithful friend, a sober guest in people's houses, at public <lb/>
            shows, and at wine-parties. Suppose that he has lost the <lb/>
            status of a citizen ; then let him exercise that of a man : <lb/>
            our reason for magnanimously refusing to confine ourselves <lb/>
            within the walls of one city, for having gone forth to enjoy <lb/>
            intercourse with all lands and for professing ourselves to <lb/>
            be citizens of the world is that we may thus obtain a wider <lb/>
            theatre on which to display our virtue. Is the bench of <lb/>
            judges closed to you, are you forbidden to address the <lb/>
            people from the hustings, or to be a candidate at elections ? <pb n="262"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            then turn your eyes away from Rome, and see what a wide <lb/>
            extent of territory, what a number of nations present <lb/>
            themselves before you. Thus, it is never possible for so <lb/>
            many outlets to be closed against your ambition that more <lb/>
            will not remain open to it: but see whether the whole <lb/>
            prohibition does not arise from your own fault. You do <lb/>
            not choose to direct the affairs of the state except as consul <lb/>
            or prytanis 1 or meddix2 or sufes: 3 what should we say if <lb/>
            you refused to serve in the army save as general or mili­ <lb/>
            tary tribune ? Even though others may form the first <lb/>
            line, and your lot may have placed you among the veterans <lb/>
            of the third, do your duty there with your voice, encourage­ <lb/>
            ment, example, and spirit: even though a man's hands be <lb/>
            cut off, he may find means to help his side in a battle, if <lb/>
            he stands his ground and cheers on his comrades. Do <lb/>
            something of that sort yourself : if Fortune removes you <lb/>
            from the front rank, stand your ground nevertheless and <lb/>
            cheer on your comrades, and if somebody stops your mouth, <lb/>
            stand nevertheless and help your side in silence. The <lb/>
            services of a good citizen are never thrown away: he does <lb/>
            good by being heard and seen, by his expression, his <lb/>
            gestures, his silent determination, and his very walk. As <lb/>
            some remedies benefit us by their smell as well as by their <lb/>
            their taste and touch, so virtue even when concealed and <lb/>
            at a distance sheds usefulness around. Whether she moves <lb/>
            at her ease and enjoys her just rights, or can only appear <lb/>
            abroad on sufferance and is forced to shorten sail to the <lb/>
            tempest, whether it be unemployed, silent, and pent up in <lb/>
            a narrow lodging, or openly displayed, in whatever guise <lb/>
            she may appear, she always does good. What ? do you <lb/>
            think that the example of one who can rest nobly has no <lb/>
            value ? It is by far the best plan, therefore, to mingle <note type="footnote"> 1 The chief magistrate of the Greeks. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The chief magistrate of the Oscans. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The chief magistrate of the Carthaginians. </note> <pb n="263"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            leisure with business, whenever chance impediments or the <lb/>
            state of public affairs forbid one's leading an active life : <lb/>
            for one is never so cut off from all pursuits as to find no <lb/>
            room left for honourable action.</p>
          <p>V. Could you anywhere find a miserable city than that <lb/>
            of Athens when it was being torn to pieces by the thirty <lb/>
            tyrants ? they slew thirteen hundred citizens, all the best <lb/>
            men, and did not leave off because they had done so, but <lb/>
            their: cruelty became stimulated by exercise. In the city <lb/>
            which possessed that most reverend tribunal, the Court of <lb/>
            the Areopagus, which possessed a Senate, and a popular, <lb/>
            assembly which was like a Senate, there met daily a <lb/>
            wretched crew of butchers, and the unhappy Senate House <lb/>
            was crowded with tyrants. A state, in which there were <lb/>
            so many tyrants that they would have been enough to <lb/>
            form a bodyguard for one, might surely have rested from <lb/>
            the struggle; it seemed impossible for men's minds even <lb/>
            to conceive hopes of recovering their liberty, nor could <lb/>
            they see any room for a remedy for such a mass of evil: <lb/>
            for whence could the unhappy state obtain all the Har­ <lb/>
            modiuses it would need to slay so many tyrants ? Yet <lb/>
            Socrates was in the midst of the city, and consoled its <lb/>
            mourning Fathers, encouraged those who despaired of the <lb/>
            republic, by his reproaches brought rich men, who feared <lb/>
            that their wealth would be their ruin, to a tardy repentance <lb/>
            of their avarice, and moved about as a great example to <lb/>
            those who wished to imitate him, because he walked a <lb/>
            free man in the midst of thirty masters. However, Athens <lb/>
            herself put him to death in prison, and Freedom herself <lb/>
            could not endure the freedom of one who had treated a <lb/>
            whole band of tyrants with scorn: you may know, therefore, <lb/>
            that even in an oppressed state a wise man can find an <lb/>
            opportunity for bringing himself to the front, and that in a <lb/>
            prosperous and flourishing one wanton insolence, jealousy, <lb/>
            and a thousand other cowardly vices bear sway. We ought, <pb n="264"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            therefore, to expand or contract ourselves according as <lb/>
            the state presents itself to us, or as Fortune offers us oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities : but in any case we ought to move and not to <lb/>
            become frozen still by fear: nay, he is the best man who, <lb/>
            though peril menaces him on every side and arms and <lb/>
            chains beset his path, nevertheless neither impairs nor <lb/>
            conceals his virtue : for to keep oneself safe does not mean <lb/>
            to bury oneself. I think that Curius Dentatus spoke truly <lb/>
            when he said that he would rather be dead than alive: the <lb/>
            worst evil of all is to leave the ranks of the living before <lb/>
            one dies : yet it is your duty, if you happen to live in an <lb/>
            age when it is not easy to serve the state, to devote more <lb/>
            time to leisure and to literature. Thus, just as though <lb/>
            you were making a perilous voyage, you may from time <lb/>
            to time put into harbour, and set yourself free from public <lb/>
            business without waiting for it to do so.</p>
          <p>VI. We ought, however, first to examine our own selves, <lb/>
            next the business which we propose to transact, next those <lb/>
            for whose sake or in whose company we transact it.</p>
          <p>It is above all things necessary to form a true estimate <lb/>
            of oneself, because as a rule we think that we can do more <lb/>
            than we are able : one man is led too far through confidence <lb/>
            in his eloquence, another demands more from his estate <lb/>
            than it can produce, another burdens a weakly body with <lb/>
            some toilsome duty. Some men are too shamefaced for <lb/>
            the conduct of public affairs, which require an unblushing <lb/>
            front: some men's obstinate pride renders them unfit for <lb/>
            courts : some cannot control their anger, and break into <lb/>
            unguarded language on the slightest provocation : some <lb/>
            cannot rein in their wit or resist making risky jokes : for <lb/>
            all these men leisure is better than employment: a bold, <lb/>
            haughty and impatient nature ought to avoid anything <lb/>
            that may lead it to use a freedom of speech which will bring <lb/>
            it to ruin. Next we must form an estimate of the matter <lb/>
            which we mean to deal with, and compare our strength <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            with the deed we are about to attempt: for the bearer <lb/>
            ought always to be more powerful than his load: indeed, <lb/>
            loads which are too heavy for their bearer must of necessity <lb/>
            crush him : some affairs also are not so important in them­ <lb/>
            selves as they are prolific and lead to much more business, <lb/>
            which employments, as they involve us in new and various <lb/>
            forms of work, ought to be refused. Neither should you <lb/>
            engage in anything from which you are not free to retreat: <lb/>
            apply yourself to something which you can finish, or at <lb/>
            any rate can hope to finish: you had better not meddle with <lb/>
            those operations which grow in importance, while they are <lb/>
            being transacted, and which will not stop where you in­ <lb/>
            tended them to stop.</p>
          <p>VII. In all cases one should be careful in one's choice of <lb/>
            men, and see whether they be worthy of our bestowing a <lb/>
            part of our life upon them, or whether we shall waste our <lb/>
            own time and theirs also : for some even consider us to be <lb/>
            in their debt because of our services to them. Athenodorus <lb/>
            said that " he would not so much as dine with a man who <lb/>
            would not be grateful to him for doing so": meaning, I <lb/>
            imagine, that much less would he go to dinner with those <lb/>
            who recompense the services of their friends by their table, <lb/>
            and regard courses of dishes as donatives, as if they over­ <lb/>
            ate themselves to do honour to others. Take away from <lb/>
            these men their witnesses and spectators: they will take <lb/>
            no pleasure in solitary gluttony. You must decide whether <lb/>
            your disposition is better suited for vigorous action or for <lb/>
            tranquil speculation and contemplation, and you must <lb/>
            adopt whichever the bent of your genius inclines you for. <lb/>
            Isocrates laid hands upon Ephorus and led him away from <lb/>
            the forum, thinking that he would be more usefully em­ <lb/>
            ployed in compiling chronicles; for no good is done by <lb/>
            forcing one's mind to engage in uncongenial work: it is <lb/>
            vain to struggle against Nature. Yet nothing delights the <lb/>
            mind so much as faithful and pleasant friendship : what a <pb n="266"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            blessing it is when there is one whose breast is ready to <lb/>
            receive all your secrets with safety, whose knowledge of, <lb/>
            your actions you fear less than your own conscience, whose <lb/>
            conversation removes your anxieties, whose advice assists. <lb/>
            your plans, whose cheerfulness dispels your gloom, whose <lb/>
            very sight delights you ! We should choose for our friends <lb/>
            men who are, as far as possible, free from strong desires : <lb/>
            for vices are contagious, and pass from a man to his neigh­ <lb/>
            bour, and injure those who touch them. As, therefore, in <lb/>
            times of pestilence we have to be careful not to sit near <lb/>
            people who are infected and in whom the disease is raging, <lb/>
            because by so doing, we shall run into danger and catch <lb/>
            the plague from their very breath; so, too, in choosing our. <lb/>
            friends' dispositions, we must take care to select those who <lb/>
            are as far as may be unspotted by the world; for the way <lb/>
            to breed disease is to mix what is sound with what is rotten. <lb/>
            Yet I do not advise you to follow after or draw to yourself <lb/>
            no one except a wise man: for where will you find him <lb/>
            whom for so many centuries we have sought in vain ? in <lb/>
            the place of the best possible man take him who is least <lb/>
            bad. You would hardly find any time that would have <lb/>
            enabled you to make a happier choice than if you could <lb/>
            have sought for a good man from among the Platos and <lb/>
            Xenophons and the rest of the produce of the brood of <lb/>
            Socrates, or if yon had been permitted to choose one from <lb/>
            the age of Cato : an age which bore many men worthy to <lb/>
            be born in Cato's time (just as it also bore many men worse <lb/>
            than were ever known before, planners of the blackest <lb/>
            crimes : for it needed both classes in order to make Cato <lb/>
            understood: it wanted both good men, that he might win <lb/>
            their approbation, and bad men, against whom he could <lb/>
            prove his strength) : but at the present day, when there is <lb/>
            such a dearth of good men, you must be less squeamish in <lb/>
            your choice. Above all, however, avoid dismal men who <lb/>
            grumble at whatever happens, and find something to com- <pb n="267"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            plain of in everything. Though he may continue loyal <lb/>
            and friendly towards you, still one's peace of mind is <lb/>
            destroyed by a comrade whose mind is soured and who <lb/>
            meets every incident with a. groan.</p>
          <p>VIII. Let us now pass on to the consideration of pro­ <lb/>
            perty, that most fertile source of human sorrows : for if <lb/>
            you compare all the other ills from which we suffer-deaths, <lb/>
            sicknesses, fears, regrets, endurance of pains and labours­ <lb/>
            with those miseries which our money inflicts upon us, the <lb/>
            latter will far outweigh all the others. Reflect, then, how <lb/>
            much less a grief it is never to have had any money than <lb/>
            to have lost it: we shall thus understand that the less poverty <lb/>
            has to lose, the less torment it has with which to afflict <lb/>
            us : for you are mistaken if you suppose that the rich bear <lb/>
            their losses with greater spirit than the poor: a wound causes <lb/>
            the same amount of pain to the greatest and the smallest <lb/>
            body. It was a neat saying of Bion's, that it hurts bald men <lb/>
            as much as hairy men to have their hairs pulled out" : you <lb/>
            may be assured that the same thing is true of rich and <lb/>
            poor people, that their suffering is equal: for their money <lb/>
            clings to both classes, and cannot be torn away without <lb/>
            their feeling it: yet it is more endurable, as I have said, <lb/>
            and easier not to gain property than to lose it, and there­ <lb/>
            fore you will find that those upon whom Fortune has never <lb/>
            smiled are more cheerful than those whom she has deserted; <lb/>
            Diogenes, a man of infinite spirit, perceived this, and made <lb/>
            it impossible that anything should be taken from him. <lb/>
            Call this security from loss poverty, want, necessity, or <lb/>
            any contemptuous name you please : I shall consider such <lb/>
            a man to be happy, unless you find me another who can <lb/>
            lose nothing. If I am not mistaken, it is a royal attribute <lb/>
            among so many misers, sharpers, and robbers, to be the <lb/>
            one man who cannot be injured. If any one doubts the <lb/>
            happiness of Diogenes, he would doubt whether the position <lb/>
            of the immortal gods was one of sufficient happiness, <pb n="268"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            because they have no farms or gardens, no valuable estates <lb/>
            let to strange tenants, and no large loans in the money <lb/>
            market. Are you not ashamed of yourself, you who gaze <lb/>
            upon riches with astonished admiration ? Look upon the <lb/>
            universe : you will see the gods quite bare of property, and <lb/>
            possessing nothing though they give everything. Do you <lb/>
            think that this man who has stripped himself of all <lb/>
            fortuitous accessories is a pauper, or one like to the <lb/>
            immortal gods ? Do you call Demetrius, Pompeius's <lb/>
            freedman, a happier man, he who was not ashamed to be <lb/>
            richer than Pompeius, who was daily furnished with a list <lb/>
            of the number of his slaves, as a general is with that of his <lb/>
            army, though he had long deserved that all his riches <lb/>
            should consist of a pair of underlings, and a roomier cell <lb/>
            than the other slaves ? But Diogenes's only slave ran <lb/>
            away from him, and when he was pointed out to Diogenes, <lb/>
            he did not think him worth fetching back. " It is a shame," <lb/>
            he said, "that Manes should be able to live without <lb/>
            Diogenes, and that Diogenes should not be able to live <lb/>
            without Manes." He seems to me to have said, "Fortune, <lb/>
            mind your own business : Diogenes has nothing left that <lb/>
            belongs to you. Did my slave run away ? nay, he went <lb/>
            away from me as a free man." A household of slaves <lb/>
            requires food and clothing : the bellies of so many hungry <lb/>
            creatures have to be filled: we must buy raiment for them, <lb/>
            we must watch their most thievish hands, and we must <lb/>
            make use of the services of people who weep and execrate <lb/>
            us. How far happier is he who is indebted to no man for <lb/>
            anything except for what he can deprive himself of with <lb/>
            the greatest ease! Since we, however, have not such <lb/>
            strength of mind as this, we ought at any rate to diminish <lb/>
            the extent of our property, in order to be less exposed to <lb/>
            the assaults of fortune : those men whose bodies can be <lb/>
            within the shelter of their armour, are more fitted for war <lb/>
            than those whose huge size everywhere extends beyond <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            it, and exposes them to wounds : the best amount of pro­ <lb/>
            perty to have is that which is enough to keep us from <lb/>
            poverty, and which yet is not far removed from it.</p>
          <p>IX. We shall be pleased with this measure of wealth if <lb/>
            we have previously taken pleasure in thrift, without which <lb/>
            no riches are sufficient, and with which none are insuffi­ <lb/>
            cient, especially as the remedy is always at hand, and <lb/>
            poverty itself by calling in the aid of thrift can convert <lb/>
            itself into riches. Let us accustom ourselves to set aside <lb/>
            mere outward show, and to measure things by their uses, <lb/>
            not by their ornamental trappings: let our hunger be <lb/>
            tamed by food, our thirst quenched by drinking, our lust <lb/>
            confined within needful bounds; let us learn to use our <lb/>
            limbs, and to arrange our dress and way of life according <lb/>
            to what was approved of by our ancestors, not in imitation <lb/>
            of new-fangled models: let us learn to increase our conti­ <lb/>
            nence, to repress luxury, to set bounds to our pride, to <lb/>
            assuage our anger, to look upon poverty without prejudice, <lb/>
            to practise thrift, albeit many are ashamed to do so, to <lb/>
            apply cheap remedies to the wants of nature, to keep all <lb/>
            undisciplined hopes and aspirations as it were under lock <lb/>
            and key, and to make it our business to get our riches <lb/>
            from ourselves and not from Fortune. We never can so <lb/>
            thoroughly defeat the vast diversity and malignity of mis­ <lb/>
            fortune with which we are threatened as not to feel the weight <lb/>
            of many gusts if we offer a large spread of canvas to the <lb/>
            wind: we must draw our affairs into a small compass, to make <lb/>
            the darts of Fortune of no avail. For this reason, some­ <lb/>
            times slight mishaps have turned into remedies, and more <lb/>
            serious disorders have been healed by slighter ones. When <lb/>
            the mind pays no attention to good advice, and cannot be <lb/>
            brought to its senses by milder measures, why should we <lb/>
            not think that its interests are being served by poverty, <lb/>
            disgrace, or financial ruin being applied to it ? one evil is <lb/>
            balanced by another. Let us then teach ourselves to be able to <pb n="270"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            dine without all Rome to look on, to be the slaves of fewer <lb/>
            slaves, to get' clothes which fulfil their original purpose, <lb/>
            and to live in a smaller house. The inner curve is the <lb/>
            one to take, not only in running races and in the contests <lb/>
            of the circus, but also in the race of life; even literary <lb/>
            pursuits, the most becoming thing for a gentleman to <lb/>
            spend money upon, are only justifiable as long as they are <lb/>
            kept within bounds. What is the use of possessing num­ <lb/>
            berless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can <lb/>
            hardly read through in a lifetime ? A student is over­ <lb/>
            whelmed by such a mass, not instructed, and it is much <lb/>
            better to devote yourself to a few writers than to skim <lb/>
            through many. Forty thousand books were burned at <lb/>
            Alexandria: some would have praised this library as a <lb/>
            most noble memorial of royal wealth, like Titus Livius, <lb/>
            who says that it was " a splendid result of the taste and <lb/>
            attentive care of the kings."1 It had nothing to do with <lb/>
            taste or care, but was a piece of learned luxury, nay, not <lb/>
            even learned, since they amassed it, not for the sake of <lb/>
            learning, but to make a show, like many men who know <lb/>
            less about letters than a slave is expected to know, and <lb/>
            who uses his books not to help him in his studies but to <lb/>
            ornament his dining-room. Let a man, then, obtain as <lb/>
            many books as he wants, but none for show. " It is more <lb/>
            respectable," say you, " to spend one's money on such books <lb/>
            than on vases of Corinthian brass and paintings." Not so : <lb/>
            everything that is carried to excess is wrong. What <lb/>
            excuses can you find for a man who is eager to buy book­ <lb/>
            cases of ivory and citrus wood, to collect the works of <lb/>
            unknown or discredited authors, and who sits yawning <note type="footnote"> 1 11 Livy himself styled the Alexandrian library elegantiae regum <lb/>
            curaeque egregium opus: a liberal encomium, for which he is pertly <lb/>
            criticised by the narrow stoicism of Seneca (Tranq., ch. ix.), whose <lb/>
            wisdom, on this occasion, deviates into nonsense."-GIBBON, "Decline <lb/>
            and Fall," ch. li., note. </note> <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            amid so many thousands of books, whose backs and titles <lb/>
            please him more than any other part of them ? Thus in <lb/>
            the houses of the laziest of men you will see the works of <lb/>
            all the orators and historians stacked upon book-shelves <lb/>
            reaching right up to the ceiling. At the present day a <lb/>
            library has become as necessary an appendage to a house <lb/>
            as a hot and cold bath. I would excuse them straightway <lb/>
            if they really were carried away by an excessive zeal for <lb/>
            literature; but as it is, these costly works of sacred genius, <lb/>
            with all the illustrations that adorn them, are merely <lb/>
            bought for display and to serve as wall-furniture.</p>
          <p>X. Suppose, however, that your life has become full of <lb/>
            trouble, and that without knowing what you were doing <lb/>
            you have fallen into some snare which either public or pri­ <lb/>
            vate Fortune has set for you, and that you can neither <lb/>
            untie it nor break it-: then remember that fettered men <lb/>
            suffer much at first from the burdens and clogs upon their <lb/>
            legs: afterwards, when they have made up their minds <lb/>
            not to fret themselves about them, but to endure them, <lb/>
            necessity teaches them to bear them bravely, and habit to <lb/>
            bear them easily. In every station of life you will find <lb/>
            amusements, relaxations, and enjoyments; that is, pro­ <lb/>
            vided you be willing to make light of evils rather than to <lb/>
            hate them. Knowing to what sorrows we were born, <lb/>
            there is nothing for which Nature more deserves our <lb/>
            thanks than for having invented habit as an alleviation of <lb/>
            misfortune, which soon accustoms us to the severest evils. <lb/>
            No one could hold out against misfortune if it permanently <lb/>
            exercised the same force as at its first onset. We are all <lb/>
            chained to Fortune : some men's chain is loose and made <lb/>
            of gold, that of others is tight and of meaner metal: but <lb/>
            what difference does this make ? we are all included in the <lb/>
            same captivity, and even those who have bound us are <lb/>
            bound themselves, unless you think that a chain on the left <lb/>
            side is lighter to bear: one man may be bound by public <pb n="272"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            office, another by wealth: some have to bear the weight of <lb/>
            illustrious, some of humble birth : some are subject to the <lb/>
            commands of others, some only to their own: some are <lb/>
            kept in one place by being banished thither, others by <lb/>
            being elected to the priesthood. All life is slavery: let <lb/>
            each man therefore reconcile himself to his lot, complain <lb/>
            'of it as little as possible, and lay hold of whatever good <lb/>
            lies within his reach. No condition can be so wretched <lb/>
            that an impartial mind can find no compensations in it. <lb/>
            Small sites, if ingeniously divided, may be made use of for <lb/>
            many different purposes, and arrangement will render ever <lb/>
            so narrow a room habitable. Call good sense to your aid <lb/>
            against difficulties: it is possible to soften what is harsh, <lb/>
            to widen what is too narrow, and to make heavy burdens <lb/>
            press less severely upon one who bears them skilfully. <lb/>
            Moreover, we ought not to allow our desires to wander far <lb/>
            afield, but we must make them confine themselves to our <lb/>
            immediate neighbourhood, since they will not endure to be <lb/>
            altogether locked up. We must leave alone things which <lb/>
            either cannot come to pass or can only be effected with <lb/>
            difficulty, and follow after such things as are near at hand <lb/>
            and within reach of our hopes, always remembering that all <lb/>
            things are equally unimportant, and that though they have <lb/>
            a different outward appearance, they are all alike empty <lb/>
            within. Neither let us envy those who are in high places : <lb/>
            the heights which look lofty to us are steep and rugged. <lb/>
            Again, those whom unkind fate has placed in critical <lb/>
            situations will be safer if they show as little pride in their <lb/>
            proud position as may be, and do all they are able to bring <lb/>
            down their fortunes to the level of other men's. There <lb/>
            are many who must needs cling to their high pinnacle of <lb/>
            power, because they cannot descend from it save by falling <lb/>
            headlong: yet they assure us that their greatest burden is <lb/>
            being obliged to be burdensome to others, and that they <lb/>
            are nailed to their lofty post rather than raised to it: let <pb n="273"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            them then, by dispensing justice, clemency, and kindness <lb/>
            with an open and liberal hand, provide themselves with <lb/>
            assistance to break their fall, and looking forward to this <lb/>
            maintain their position more hopefully. Yet nothing sets <lb/>
            us free from these alternations of hope and fear so well as <lb/>
            always fixing some limit to our successes, and not allowing <lb/>
            Fortune to choose when to stop our career, but to halt of <lb/>
            our own accord long before we apparently need do so. By <lb/>
            acting thus certain desires will rouse up our spirits, and <lb/>
            yet being confined within bounds, will not lead us to <lb/>
            embark on vast and vague enterprises.</p>
          <p>XI. These remarks of mine apply only to imperfect, <lb/>
            commonplace, and unsound natures, not to the wise man, <lb/>
            who needs not to walk with timid and cautious gait: for <lb/>
            he has such confidence in himself that he does not hesitate <lb/>
            to go directly in the teeth of Fortune, and never will give <lb/>
            way to her. Nor indeed has he any reason for fearing her, <lb/>
            for he counts not only chattels, property, and high office, <lb/>
            but even his body, his eyes, his hands, and everything <lb/>
            whose use makes life dearer to us, nay, even his very self, <lb/>
            to be things whose possession is uncertain; he lives as <lb/>
            though he had borrowed them, and is ready to return them <lb/>
            cheerfully whenever they are claimed. Yet he does not <lb/>
            hold himself cheap, because he knows that he is not his <lb/>
            own, but performs all his duties as carefully and prudently <lb/>
            as a pious and scrupulous man would take care of property <lb/>
            left in his charge as trustee. When he is bidden to give <lb/>
            them up, he will not complain of Fortune, but will say, " I <lb/>
            thank you for what I have had possession of: I have <lb/>
            managed your property so as largely to increase it, but <lb/>
            since you order me, I give it back to you and return it <lb/>
            willingly and thankfully. If you still wish me to own <lb/>
            anything of yours, I will keep it for you : if you have <lb/>
            other views, I restore into your hands and make restitution <lb/>
            of all my wrought and coined silver, my house and my <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            household. Should Nature recall what she previously en­ <lb/>
            trusted us with, let us say to her also: ' Take back my <lb/>
            spirit, which is better than when you gave it me: I do not <lb/>
            shuffle or hang back. Of my own free will I am ready to <lb/>
            return what you gave me before I could think: take me <lb/>
            away.' " What hardship can there be in returning to the <lb/>
            place from whence one came ? a man cannot live well if he <lb/>
            knows not how to die well. We must, therefore, take <lb/>
            away from this commodity its original value, and count <lb/>
            the breath of life as a cheap matter. " We dislike gladia­ <lb/>
            tors," says Cicero, " if they are eager to save their lives by <lb/>
            any means whatever: but we look favourably upon them <lb/>
            if they are openly reckless of them." You may be sure <lb/>
            that -the same thing occurs with us: we often die because <lb/>
            we are afraid of death. Fortune, which regards our lives <lb/>
            as a show in the arena for her own enjoyment, says, "Why <lb/>
            should I spare you, base and cowardly creature that you <lb/>
            are ? you will be pierced and hacked with all the more <lb/>
            wounds because you know not how to offer your throat to <lb/>
            the knife: whereas you, who receive the stroke without <lb/>
            drawing away your neck or putting up your hands to stop <lb/>
            it, shall both live longer and die more quickly." He who <lb/>
            fears death will never act as becomes a living man : but <lb/>
            he who knows that this fate was laid upon him as soon as <lb/>
            he was conceived will live according to it, and by this <lb/>
            strength of mind will gain this further advantage, that <lb/>
            nothing can befal him unexpectedly: for by looking for­ <lb/>
            ward to everything which can happen as though it would <lb/>
            happen to him, he takes the sting out of all evils, which <lb/>
            can make no difference to those who expect it and are pre­ <lb/>
            pared to meet it: evil only comes hard upon those who <lb/>
            have lived without giving it a thought and whose atten­ <lb/>
            tion has been exclusively directed to happiness. Disease, <lb/>
            captivity, disaster, conflagration, are none of them unex­ <lb/>
            pected: I always knew with what disorderly company <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            Nature had associated me. The dead have often been <lb/>
            wailed for in my neighbourhood: the torch and taper have <lb/>
            often been borne past my door before the bier of one who <lb/>
            has died before his time: the crash of falling buildings <lb/>
            has often resounded by my side : night has snatched away <lb/>
            many of those with whom I have become intimate in the <lb/>
            forum, the Senate-house, and in society, and has sundered <lb/>
            the hands which were joined in friendship : ought I to be <lb/>
            surprised if the dangers which have always been circling <lb/>
            around me at last assail me ? How large a part of man­ <lb/>
            kind never think of storms when about to set. sail? I <lb/>
            shall never be ashamed to quote a good saying because it <lb/>
            comes from a bad author. Publilius, who was a more power­ <lb/>
            ful writer than any of our other playwrights, whether <lb/>
            comic or tragic, whenever he chose to rise above farcical <lb/>
            absurdities and speeches addressed to the gallery, among <lb/>
            many other verses too noble even for tragedy, let alone for <lb/>
            comedy, has this one :— <lb/>
            " What one bath suffered may befall us all." <lb/>
            If a man takes this into his inmost heart and looks upon <lb/>
            all the misfortunes of other men, of which there is always <lb/>
            a great plenty, in this spirit, remembering that there is <lb/>
            nothing to prevent their coming upon him also, he will <lb/>
            arm himself against them long before they attack him. It <lb/>
            is too late to school the mind to endurance of peril after <lb/>
            peril has come. "I did not think this would happen," <lb/>
            and " Would you ever have believed that this would have <lb/>
            happened ? " say you. But why should it not ? Where <lb/>
            are the riches after which want, hunger, and beggary do <lb/>
            not follow ? what office is there whose purple robe, augur's <lb/>
            staff, and patrician reins have not as their accompaniment <lb/>
            rags and banishment, the brand of infamy, a thousand <lb/>
            disgraces, and utter reprobation ? what kingdom is there <lb/>
            for which ruin, trampling under foot, a tyrant and a <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            butcher are not ready at hand ? nor are these matters <lb/>
            divided by long periods of time, but there is but the space <lb/>
            of an hour between sitting on the throne ourselves and <lb/>
            clasping the knees of some one else as suppliants. Know <lb/>
            then that every station of life is transitory, and that what <lb/>
            has ever happened to anybody may happen to you also. <lb/>
            You are wealthy : are you wealthier than Pompeius ? 1 <lb/>
            Yet when Gaius,2 his old relative and new host, opened <lb/>
            Caesar's house to him in order that he might close his <lb/>
            own, he lacked both bread and water: though he owned <lb/>
            so many rivers which both rose and discharged themselves <lb/>
            within his dominions, yet he had to beg for drops of water: <lb/>
            he perished of hunger and thirst in the palace of his rela­ <lb/>
            tive, while his heir was contracting for a public funeral for <lb/>
            one who was in want of food. You have filled public <lb/>
            offices : were they either as important, as unlooked for, or <lb/>
            as all-embracing as those of Sejanus ? Yet on the day on <lb/>
            which the Senate disgraced him, the people tore him to <lb/>
            pieces: the executioner 3 could find no part left large <lb/>
            enough to drag to the Tiber, of one upon whom gods and <lb/>
            men had showered all that could be given to man. You <lb/>
            are a king: I will not bid you go to Croesus for an <lb/>
            example, he who while yet alive saw his funeral pile both <lb/>
            lighted and extinguished, being made to outlive not only <lb/>
            his kingdom but even his own death, nor to Jugurtha, <lb/>
            whom the people of Rome beheld as a captive within the <lb/>
            year in which they had feared him. We have seen <lb/>
            Ptolemaeus King of Africa, and Mithridates King of <lb/>
            Armenia, under the charge of Gaius's * guards: the former <lb/>
            was sent into exile, the latter chose it in order to make his <note type="footnote"> 1 Haase reads Ptolemaeus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Caligula. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It was the duty of the executioner to fasten a hook to the neck of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            exile more honourable. Among such continual topsy. <lb/>
            turvy changes, unless you expect that whatever can happen <lb/>
            will happen to you, you give adversity power against you, <lb/>
            a power which can be destroyed by any one who looks at it <lb/>
            beforehand.</p>
          <p>XII. The next point to these will be to take care that <lb/>
            we do not labour for what is vain, or labour in vain : that <lb/>
            is to say, neither to desire what we are not able to obtain, <lb/>
            nor yet, having obtained our desire too late, and after much <lb/>
            toil to discover the folly of our wishes : in other words, <lb/>
            that our labour may not be without result, and that the <lb/>
            result may not be unworthy of our labour: for as a rule <lb/>
            sadness arises from one of these two things, either from <lb/>
            want of success or from being ashamed of having suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded. We must limit the running to and fro which most <lb/>
            men practise, rambling about houses, theatres, and market- <lb/>
            places. They mind other men's business, and always seem <lb/>
            as though they themselves had something to do. If you <lb/>
            ask one of them as he comes out of his own door, " Whither <lb/>
            are you going ? " he will answer, " By Hercules, I do not <lb/>
            know: but I shall see some people and do something." <lb/>
            They wander purposelessly seeking for something to do, <lb/>
            and do, not what they have made up their minds to do, <lb/>
            but what has causually fallen in their way. They move <lb/>
            uselessly and without any plan, just like ants crawling over <lb/>
            bushes, which creep up to the top and then down to the <lb/>
            bottom again without gaining anything. Many men spend <lb/>
            their lives in exactly the same fashion, which one may call <lb/>
            a state of restless indolence. You would pity some of them <lb/>
            when you see them running as if their house was on fire : <lb/>
            they actually jostle all whom they meet, and hurry along <lb/>
            themselves and others with them, though all the while they <lb/>
            are are going to salute some one who will not return their <lb/>
            greeting, or to attend the funeral of some one whom they <lb/>
            did not know: they are going to hear the verdict on one <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            who often goes to law, or to see the wedding of one who <lb/>
            often gets married : they will follow a man's litter, and in <lb/>
            some places will even carry it: afterwards returning home <lb/>
            weary with idleness, they swear that they themselves do <lb/>
            Dot know why they went out, or where they have been, and <lb/>
            on the following day they will wander through the same <lb/>
            round again. Let all your work, therefore, have some pur­ <lb/>
            pose, and keep some object in view: these restless people <lb/>
            are not made restless by labour, but are driven out of their <lb/>
            minds by mistaken ideas: for even they do not put them­ <lb/>
            selves in motion without any hope : they are excited by <lb/>
            the outward appearance of something, and their crazy mind <lb/>
            cannot see its futility. In the same way every one of those <lb/>
            who walk out to swell the crowd in the streets, is led round <lb/>
            the city by worthless and empty reasons; the dawn drives <lb/>
            him forth, although he has nothing to do, and after he has <lb/>
            pushed his way into many men's doors, and saluted their <lb/>
            nomenclators one after the other, and been turned away <lb/>
            from many others, he finds that the most difficult person <lb/>
            of all to find at home is himself. From this evil habit <lb/>
            comes that worst of all vices, talebearing and prying into <lb/>
            public and private secrets, and the knowledge of many <lb/>
            things which it is neither safe to tell nor safe to listen to.</p>
          <p>XIII. It was, I imagine, following out this principle <lb/>
            that Democritis taught that " he who would live at peace <lb/>
            must not do much business either public or private," re­ <lb/>
            ferring of course to unnecessary business: for if there be <lb/>
            any necessity for it we ought to transact not only much <lb/>
            but endless business, both public and private; in cases, <lb/>
            however, where no solemn duty invites us to act, we had <lb/>
            better keep ourselves quiet: for he who does many things <lb/>
            often puts himself in Fortune's power, and it is safest not <lb/>
            to tempt her often, but always to remember her existence, <lb/>
            and never to promise oneself anything on her security. I <lb/>
            will set sail unless anything happens to prevent me, I shall <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            be praetor, if nothing hinders me, my financial operations <lb/>
            will succeed, unless anything goes wrong with them. This <lb/>
            is why we say that nothing befals the wise man which he <lb/>
            did not expect-we do not make him exempt from the <lb/>
            chances of human life, but from its mistakes, nor does <lb/>
            everything happen to him as he wished it would, but as he <lb/>
            thought it would: now his first thought was that his <lb/>
            purpose might meet with some resistance, and the pain of <lb/>
            disappointed wishes must affect a man's mind less severely <lb/>
            if he has not been at all events confident of success.</p>
          <p>XIV. Moreover, we ought to cultivate an easy temper, <lb/>
            and not become over fond of the lot which fate has assigned <lb/>
            to us, but transfer ourselves to whatever other condition <lb/>
            chance may lead us to, and fear no alteration, either in our <lb/>
            purposes or our position in life, provided that we do not <lb/>
            become subject to caprice, which of all vices is the most <lb/>
            hostile to repose : for obstinacy, from which Fortune often <lb/>
            wrings some concession, must needs be anxious and un­ <lb/>
            happy, but caprice, which can never restrain itself, must <lb/>
            be more so. Both of these qualities, both that of altering <lb/>
            nothing, and that of being dissatisfied with everything, are <lb/>
            enemies to repose. The mind ought in all cases to be <lb/>
            called away from the contemplation of external things to <lb/>
            that of itself: let it confide in itself, rejoice in itself, admire <lb/>
            its own works; avoid as far as may be those of others, and <lb/>
            devote itself to itself; let it not feel losses, and put a good <lb/>
            construction even upon misfortunes. Zeno, the chief of <lb/>
            our school, when he heard the news of a shipwreck, in <lb/>
            which all his property had been lost, remarked, " Fortune <lb/>
            bids me follow philosophy in lighter marching order." A <lb/>
            tyrant threatened Theodorus with death, and even with <lb/>
            want of burial. " You are able to please yourself," he <lb/>
            answered, " my half pint of blood is in your power: for; <lb/>
            as for burial, what a fool you must be if you suppose that <lb/>
            I care whether I rot above ground or under it." Julius <pb n="280"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            Kanus, a man of peculiar greatness, whom even the fact of <lb/>
            his having been born in this century does not prevent our <lb/>
            admiring, had a long dispute with Gains, and when as he <lb/>
            was going away that Phalaris of a man said to him, " That <lb/>
            you may not delude yourself with any foolish hopes, I have <lb/>
            ordered you to be executed," he answered, " I thank you, <lb/>
            most excellent prince." I am not sure what he meant: <lb/>
            for many ways of explaining his conduct occur to me. Did <lb/>
            he wish to be reproachful, and to show him how great his <lb/>
            cruelty must be if death became a kindness ? or did he <lb/>
            upbraid him with his accustomed insanity ? for even those <lb/>
            whose children were put to death, and whose goods were <lb/>
            confiscated, used to thank him : or was it that he willingly <lb/>
            received death, regarding it as freedom ? Whatever he <lb/>
            meant, it was a magnanimous answer. Some one may say, <lb/>
            "After this Gaius might have let him live." Kanus had <lb/>
            no fear of this: the good faith with which Gains carried <lb/>
            out such orders as these was well known. Will you believe <lb/>
            that he passed the ten intervening days before his execution <lb/>
            without the slightest despondency ? it is marvellous how <lb/>
            that man spoke and acted, and how peaceful he was. He <lb/>
            was playing at draughts when the centurion in charge of a <lb/>
            number of those who where going to be executed bade him <lb/>
            join them: on the summons he counted his men and said <lb/>
            to his companion, 11 Mind you do not tell a lie after my <lb/>
            death, and say that you won ;" then,. turning to the cen­ <lb/>
            turion, he said "You will bear me witness that I am one <lb/>
            man ahead of him." Do you think that Kanus played upon <lb/>
            that draught-board ? nay, he played with it. His friends <lb/>
            were sad at being about to lose so great a man : " Why," <lb/>
            asked he, " are you sorrowful ? you are enquiring whether <lb/>
            our souls are immortal, but I shall presently know." Nor <lb/>
            did he up to the very end cease his search after truth, and <lb/>
            raised arguments upon the subject of his own death. His <lb/>
            own teacher of philosophy accompanied him, and they <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            were not far from the hill on which the daily sacrifice to <lb/>
            Caesar our god was offered, when he said, " What are you <lb/>
            thinking of now, Kanus? or what are your ideas?" "I <lb/>
            have decided," answered Kanus, "at that most swiftly- <lb/>
            passing moment of all to watch whether the spirit will be <lb/>
            conscious of the act of leaving the body." He promised, <lb/>
            too, that if he made any discoveries, he would come round <lb/>
            to his friends and tell them what the condition of the souls <lb/>
            of the departed might be. Here was peace in the very <lb/>
            midst of the storm : here was a soul, worthy of eternal <lb/>
            life, which used its own fate as a proof of truth, which <lb/>
            when at the last step of life experimented upon his fleeting <lb/>
            breath, and did not merely continue to learn until he died, <lb/>
            but learned something even from death itself. No man <lb/>
            has carried the life of a philosopher further. I will not <lb/>
            hastily leave the subject of a great man, and one who <lb/>
            deserves to be spoken of with respect: I will hand thee down <lb/>
            to all posterity, thou most noble heart, chief among the <lb/>
            many victims of Gains.</p>
          <p>XV. Yet we gain nothing by getting rid of all personal <lb/>
            causes of sadness, for sometimes we are possessed by hatred <lb/>
            of the human race. When you reflect how rare simplicity <lb/>
            is, how unknown innocence, how seldom faith is kept, <lb/>
            unless it be to our advantage, when you remember such <lb/>
            numbers of successful crimes, so many equally hateful <lb/>
            losses and gains of lust, and ambition so impatient even of <lb/>
            its own natural limits that it is willing to purchase distinc­ <lb/>
            tion by baseness, the mind seems as it were cast into dark­ <lb/>
            ness, and shadows rise before it as though the virtues were <lb/>
            all overthrown and we were no longer allowed to hope to <lb/>
            possess them or benefited by their possession. We ought <lb/>
            therefore to bring ourselves into such a state of mind that <lb/>
            all the vices of the vulgar may not appear hateful to us, <lb/>
            but merely ridiculous, and we should imitate Democritus <lb/>
            rather than Heraclitus. The latter of these, .whenever he <pb n="282"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX, </note> <lb/>
            appeared in public, used to weep, the former to laugh : the <lb/>
            one thought all human doings to be follies, the other <lb/>
            thought them to be miseries. We must take a higher <lb/>
            view of all things, and bear with them more easily: it <lb/>
            better becomes a man to scoff at life than to lament over <lb/>
            it. Add to this that he who laughs at the human race <lb/>
            deserves better of it than he who mourns for it, for the <lb/>
            former leaves it some good hopes of improvement, while <lb/>
            the latter stupidly weeps over what he has given up all <lb/>
            hopes of mending. He who after surveying the universe <lb/>
            cannot control his laughter shows, too, a greater mind <lb/>
            than he who cannot restrain his tears, because his mind is <lb/>
            only affected in the slightest possible degree, and he does <lb/>
            not think that any part of all this apparatus is either <lb/>
            important, or serious, or unhappy. As for the several <lb/>
            causes which render us happy or sorrowful, let every one <lb/>
            describe them for himself, and learn the truth of Bion's <lb/>
            saying, " That all the doings of men were very like what he <lb/>
            began with, and that there is nothing in their lives which <lb/>
            is more holy or decent than their conception." Yet it is <lb/>
            better to accept public morals and human vices calmly <lb/>
            without bursting into either laughter or tears; for to be <lb/>
            hurt by the sufferings of others is to be for ever miserable, <lb/>
            while to enjoy the sufferings of others is an inhuman plea­ <lb/>
            sure, just as it is a useless piece of humanity to weep and <lb/>
            pull a long face because some one is burying his son. In <lb/>
            one's own misfortunes, also, one ought so to conduct one­ <lb/>
            self as to bestow upon them just as much sorrow as reason, <lb/>
            not as much as custom requires : for many shed tears in <lb/>
            order to show them, and whenever no one is looking at <lb/>
            them their eyes are dry, but they think it disgraceful not <lb/>
            to weep when every one does so. So deeply has this evil <lb/>
            of being guided by the opinion of others taken root in as, <lb/>
            that even grief, the simplest of all emotions, begins to be <lb/>
            counterfeited.</p><pb n="283"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. XVI.] </note> XVI. There comes now a part of our subject which is <lb/>
            wont with good cause to make one sad and anxious : I <lb/>
            mean when good men come to bad ends ; when Socrates is <lb/>
            forced to die in prison, Rutilius to live in exile, Pompeius <lb/>
            and Cicero to offer their necks to the swords of their own <lb/>
            followers, when the great Cato, that living image of virtue, <lb/>
            falls upon his sword and rips up both himself and the <lb/>
            republic, one cannot help being grieved that Fortune <lb/>
            should bestow her gifts so unjustly: what, too, can a good <lb/>
            man hope to obtain when he sees the best of men meeting <lb/>
            with the worst fates. Well, but see how each of them <lb/>
            endured his fate, and if they endured it bravely, long in <lb/>
            your heart for courage as great as theirs ; if they died in a <lb/>
            womanish and cowardly manner, nothing was lost: either <lb/>
            they deserved that you should admire their courage, or else <lb/>
            they did not deserve that you should wish to imitate their <lb/>
            cowardice: for what can be more shameful than that the <lb/>
            greatest men should die so bravely as to make people <lb/>
            cowards. Let us praise one who deserves such constant <lb/>
            praises, and say, " The braver you are the happier you are ! <lb/>
            You have escaped from all accidents, jealousies, diseases: <lb/>
            you have escaped from prison : the gods have not thought <lb/>
            you worthy of ill-fortune, but have thought that fortune <lb/>
            no longer deserved to have any power over you": but <lb/>
            when any one shrinks back in the hour of death and looks <lb/>
            longingly at life, we must lay hands upon him. I will <lb/>
            never weep for a man who dies cheerfully, nor for one who <lb/>
            dies weeping: the former wipes away my tears, the latter <lb/>
            by his tears makes himself unworthy that any should be <lb/>
            shed for him. Shall I weep for Hercules because he was <lb/>
            burned alive, or for Regulus because he was pierced by <lb/>
            so many nails, or for Cato because he tore open his wounds <lb/>
            a second time ? All these men discovered how at the cost <lb/>
            of a small portion of time they might obtain immortality, <lb/>
            and by their deaths gained eternal life.</p><pb n="284"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> XVII. It also proves a fertile source of troubles if you <lb/>
            take pains to conceal your feelings and never show your­ <lb/>
            self to any one undisguised, but, as many men do, live an <lb/>
            artificial life, in order to impose upon others : for the con­ <lb/>
            stant watching of himself becomes a torment to a man, and <lb/>
            he dreads being caught doing something at variance with <lb/>
            his usual habits, and,. indeed, we never can be at our ease <lb/>
            if we imagine that every one who looks at us is weighing our <lb/>
            real value: for many things occur which strip people of <lb/>
            their disguise, however reluctantly they may part with it, <lb/>
            and even if all this trouble about oneself is successful, still <lb/>
            life is neither happy nor safe when one always has to wear <lb/>
            a mask. But what pleasure there is in that honest straight­ <lb/>
            forwardness which is its own ornament, and which conceals <lb/>
            no part of its character? Yet even this life, which hides <lb/>
            nothing from any one runs some risk of being despised; for <lb/>
            there are people who disdain whatever they come close to : <lb/>
            but there is no danger of virtue's becoming contemptible <lb/>
            when she is brought near our eyes, and it is better to be <lb/>
            scorned for one's simplicity than to bear the burden of un­ <lb/>
            ceasing hypocrisy. Still, we must observe moderation in <lb/>
            this matter, for there is a great difference between living <lb/>
            simply and living slovenly. Moreover, we ought to retire <lb/>
            a great deal into ourselves: for association with persons <lb/>
            unlike ourselves upsets all that we had arranged, rouses the <lb/>
            passions which were at rest, and rubs into a sore any weak <lb/>
            or imperfectly healed place in our minds. Nevertheless we <lb/>
            ought to mix up these two things, and to pass our lives <lb/>
            alternately in solitude and among throngs of people; for <lb/>
            the former will make us long for the society of mankind, <lb/>
            the latter for that of ourselves, and the one will counteract <lb/>
            the other : solitude will cure us when we are sick of crowds, <lb/>
            and crowds will cure us when we are sick of solitude. <lb/>
            Neither ought we always to keep the mind strained to the <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            same pitch, but it ought sometimes to be relaxed by amuse­ <lb/>
            ment. Socrates did not blush to play with little boys, <lb/>
            Cato used to refresh his mind with wine after he had <lb/>
            wearied it with application to affairs of state, and Scipio <lb/>
            would move his triumphal and soldierly limbs to the sound <lb/>
            of music, not with a feeble and halting gait, as is, the <lb/>
            fashion now-a-days, when we sway in our very walk with <lb/>
            more than womanly weakness, but dancing as men were <lb/>
            wont in the days of old on sportive and festal occasions, <lb/>
            with manly bounds, thinking it no harm to be seen so <lb/>
            doing even by their enemies. Men's minds ought to have <lb/>
            relaxation : they rise up better and more vigorous after <lb/>
            rest. We must not force crops from rich fields, for an un­ <lb/>
            broken course of heavy crops will soon exhaust their fer­ <lb/>
            tility, and so also the liveliness of our minds will be de­ <lb/>
            troyed by unceasing labour, but they will recover their <lb/>
            strength after a short period of rest and relief: for con­ <lb/>
            tinuous toil produces a sort of numbness and sluggishness. <lb/>
            Men would not be so eager for this, if play and amusement <lb/>
            did not possess natural attractions for them, although con­ <lb/>
            stant indulgence in them takes away all gravity and all <lb/>
            strength from the mind: for sleep, also, is necessary for <lb/>
            our refreshment, yet if you prolong it for days and nights <lb/>
            together it will become death. There is a great difference <lb/>
            between slackening your hold of a thing and letting it go. <lb/>
            The founders of our laws appointed festivals, in order that <lb/>
            men might be publicly encouraged to be cheerful, and they <lb/>
            thought it necessary to vary our labours with amusements, <lb/>
            and, as I said before, some great men have been wont to give <lb/>
            themselves a certain number of holidays in every month, <lb/>
            and some divided every day into play-time and work-time. <lb/>
            Thus, I remember that great orator Asinius Pollio would <lb/>
            not attend to any business after the tenth hour : he would <lb/>
            not even read letters after that time for fear some new <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. IX. </note> <lb/>
            trouble should arise, but in those two hours1 used to get <lb/>
            rid of the weariness which he had contracted during the <lb/>
            whole day. Some rest in the middle of the day, and re­ <lb/>
            serve some light occupation for the afternoon. Our an­ <lb/>
            cestors, too, forbade any new motion to be made in the <lb/>
            Senate after the tenth hour. Soldiers divide their watches, <lb/>
            and those who have just returned from active service are <lb/>
            allowed to sleep the whole night undisturbed. We must <lb/>
            humour our minds and grant them rest from time to time, <lb/>
            which acts upon them like food, and restores their strength. <lb/>
            It does good also to take walks out of doors, that our spirits <lb/>
            may be raised and refreshed by the open air and fresh <lb/>
            breeze: sometimes we gain strength by driving in a car­ <lb/>
            riage, by travel, by change of air, or by social meals and a <lb/>
            more generous allowance of wine: at times we ought to <lb/>
            drink even to intoxication, not so as to drown, but merely <lb/>
            to dip ourselves in wine: for wine washes away troubles <lb/>
            and dislodges them from the depths of the mind, and acts <lb/>
            as a remedy to sorrow as it does to some diseases. The <lb/>
            inventor of wine is called Liber, not from the licence <lb/>
            which he gives to our tongues, but because he liberates the <lb/>
            mind from the bondage of cares, and emancipates it, ani­ <lb/>
            mates it, and renders it more daring in all that it attempts. <lb/>
            Yet moderation is wholesome both in freedom and in wine. <lb/>
            It is believed that Solon and Arcesilaus used to drink deep. <lb/>
            Cato is reproached with drunkenness: but whoever casts <lb/>
            this in his teeth will find it easier to turn his reproach into <lb/>
            a commendation than to prove that Cato did anything <lb/>
            wrong: however, we ought not to do it often, for fear the <lb/>
            mind should contract evil habits, though it ought some­ <lb/>
            times to be forced into frolic and frankness, and to cast off <lb/>
            dull sobriety for a while. If we believe the Greek poet, <lb/>
            " it is sometimes pleasant to be mad "; again, Plato always <note type="footnote"> 1 The Romans reckoned twelve hours from sunrise to sunset. These <lb/>
            " two hours " were therefore the two last of the day. </note> <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            knocked in vain at the door of poetry when he was sober; <lb/>
            or, if we trust Aristotle, no great genius has ever been <lb/>
            without a touch of insanity. The mind cannot use lofty <lb/>
            language, above that of the common herd, unless it be <lb/>
            excited. When it has spurned aside the commonplace <lb/>
            environments of custom, and rises sublime, instinct with <lb/>
            sacred fire, then alone can it chant a song too grand for <lb/>
            mortal lips: as long as it continues to dwell within itself <lb/>
            it cannot rise to any pitch of splendour: it must break <lb/>
            away from the beaten track, and lash itself to frenzy, till <lb/>
            it gnaws the curb and rushes away bearing up its rider to <lb/>
            heights whither it would fear to climb when alone.</p>
          <p>I have now, my beloved Serenus, given you an account <lb/>
            of what things can preserve peace of mind, what things can <lb/>
            restore it to us, what can arrest the vices which secretly <lb/>
            undermine it: yet be assured, that none of these is strong <lb/>
            enough to enable us to retain so fleeting a blessing, unless <lb/>
            we watch over our vacillating mind with intense and un­ <lb/>
            remitting care.</p><pb n="288"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE greater part of mankind, my Paulinus, complains <lb/>
            of the unkindness of Nature, because we are born <lb/>
            only for a short space of time, and that this allotted period <lb/>
            of life runs away so swiftly, nay so hurriedly, that with <lb/>
            but few exceptions men's life comes to an end just as they <lb/>
            are preparing to enjoy it: nor is it only the common herd <lb/>
            and the ignorant vulgar who mourn over this universal <lb/>
            misfortune, as they consider it to be: this reflection has <lb/>
            wrung complaints even from great men. Hence comes that <lb/>
            well-known saying of physicians, that art is long but life <lb/>
            is short: hence arose that quarrel, so unbefitting a sage, <lb/>
            which Aristotle picked with Nature, because she had in­ <lb/>
            dulged animals with such length of days that some of them <lb/>
            lived for ten or fifteen centuries, while man, although born <lb/>
            for many and such great exploits, had the term of his <lb/>
            . existence cut so much shorter. We do not have a very short <lb/>
            time assigned to us, but we lose a great deal of it: life is <lb/>
            long enough to carry out the most important projects : we <note type="footnote"> 1 "On croit que ce Paulin étoit frère de Pauline, Spouse de Sénéque." <lb/>
            —LA GRANGE. </note> <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            have an ample portion, if we do but arrange the whole of <lb/>
            it aright: but when it all runs to waste through luxury <lb/>
            and carelessness, when it is not devoted to any good purpose, <lb/>
            then at the last we are forced to feel that it is all over, <lb/>
            although we never noticed how it glided away. Thus it <lb/>
            is: we do not receive a short life, but we make it a short <lb/>
            one, and we are not poor in days, but wasteful of them. <lb/>
            When great and kinglike riches fall into the hands of a <lb/>
            bad master, they are dispersed straightway, but even a <lb/>
            moderate fortune, when bestowed upon a wise guardian, <lb/>
            increases by use: and in like manner our life has great <lb/>
            opportunities for one who knows how to dispose of it to the <lb/>
            best advantage.</p>
          <p>II. Why do we complain of Nature ? she has dealt kindly <lb/>
            with us. Life is long enough, if you know how to use it. <lb/>
            One man is possessed by an avarice which nothing can <lb/>
            satisfy, another by a laborious diligence in doing what is <lb/>
            totally useless: another is sodden by wine: another is <lb/>
            benumbed by sloth : one man is exhausted by an ambition <lb/>
            which makes him court the good will of others 1: another, <lb/>
            through his eagerness as a merchant, is led to visit every <lb/>
            land and every sea by the hope of gain : some are plagued <lb/>
            by the love of soldiering, and are always either endangering <lb/>
            other men's lives or in trembling for their own : some <lb/>
            wear away their lives in that voluntary slavery, the .unre­ <lb/>
            quited service of great men : many are occupied either in <lb/>
            laying claim to other men's fortune or in complaining of <lb/>
            their own : a great number have no settled purpose, and <lb/>
            are tossed from one new scheme to another by a rambling, <lb/>

            surround us on every side, and do not permit us to regain <lb/>
            our feet, or to raise our eyes and gaze upon truth, but when <lb/>
            we are down keep us prostrate and chained to. low desires. <lb/>
            Men who are in this condition are never allowed to, come <lb/>
            to themselves : if ever by chance they obtain any rest, they <lb/>
            roll to and fro like the deep sea, which heaves and tosses <lb/>
            after a gale, and they never have any respite from their <lb/>
            lusts. Do you suppose that I speak of those whose ills are <lb/>
            notorious ? Nay, look at those whose prosperity all men <lb/>
            run to see: they are choked by their own good things. To <lb/>
            how many men do riches prove a heavy burden ? how many <lb/>
            men's eloquence and continual desire to display their <lb/>
            own cleverness has cost them their lives ?1 how many are <lb/>
            sallow with constant sensual indulgence ? how many have <lb/>
            no freedom left them by the tribe of clients that surges <lb/>
            around them ? Look through all these, from the lowest <lb/>
            to the highest :-this man calls his friends,to support him, <lb/>
            this one is present in court, this one is the defendant, this <lb/>
            one pleads for him, this one is on the jury: but no one <lb/>
            lays claim to his own self, every one wastes his time over <lb/>
            some one else. Investigate those men, whose names are in <lb/>
            every one's mouth: you will find that they bear just the <lb/>
            same marks : A is devoted to B, and B to C: no one belongs <lb/>
            to himself. Moreover some men are full of most irrational <lb/>
            anger: they complain of the insolence of their chiefs, <lb/>
            because they have not granted them an audience when they <lb/>
            wished for it; as if a man had any right to complain of <lb/>
            being so haughtily shut out by another, when he never has <note type="footnote"> 1 11 Combien d'orateurs qui s'épuisent de sang et de forces pour faire <lb/>

            ears to your words, and give you a seat by his side : but <lb/>
            you never design to look upon yourself, to listen to your <lb/>
            own grievances. 'You ought not, then, to claim these <lb/>
            services from another, especially since while you yourself <lb/>
            were doing so, you did not wish for an interview with <lb/>

            minds: men will not allow any one to establish himself <lb/>
            upon their estates, and upon the most trifling dispute about <lb/>
            the measuring of boundaries, they betake themselves to <lb/>
            stones and cudgels: yet they allow others to encroach upon <note type="footnote"> 1 " Pour vous, jamais vous ne daignâtes vous regarder seulement, on <lb/>

            their lives, nay, they themselves actually lead others in I o <lb/>
            take possession of them. You cannot find any one who <lb/>
            wants to distribute his money ; yet among how many people <lb/>
            does every one distribute his life ? men covetously guard <lb/>
            their property from waste, but when it comes to waste of <lb/>
            time, they are most prodigal of that of which it would <lb/>
            become them to be sparing.. Let us take one of the elders, <lb/>
            and say to him, "We perceive that you have arrived at the <lb/>
            extreme limits of human life : you are in your hundredth <lb/>
            year, or even older. Come now, reckon up your whole life <lb/>
            in black and white: tell us how much of your time has <lb/>
            been spent upon your creditors, how much on your mistress, <lb/>
            how much on your king, how much on your clients, how <lb/>
            much in quarrelling with your wife, how much in keeping <lb/>
            your slaves in order, how much in running up and down <lb/>
            the city on business. Add to this the diseases which we <lb/>
            bring upon us with our own hands, and the time which has <lb/>
            laid idle without any use having been made of it; you will <lb/>
            see that you have not lived as many years as you count. <lb/>
            Look back in your memory and see how often you have <lb/>
            been consistent in your projects, how many days passed as <lb/>
            you intended them to do when you were at your own <lb/>
            disposal, how often you did not change colour and your <lb/>
            spirit did not quail, how much work you have done in so <lb/>
            long a time, how many people have without your knowledge <lb/>
            stolen parts of your life from you, how much you have <lb/>
            lost, how large a part has been taken up by useless grief, <lb/>
            foolish gladness, greedy desire, or polite conversation; how <lb/>
            little of yourself is left to you : you will then perceive that <lb/>
            you will die prematurely." What, then, is the reason of <lb/>
            this ? It is that people live as though they would live for <lb/>
            ever: you never remember your human frailty; you never <lb/>
            notice how much of your time has already gone by : you <lb/>
            spend it as though you had an abundant and overflowing <lb/>
            store of it, though all the while that day which you devote <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            to some man or to some thing is perhaps your last. You <lb/>
            fear everything, like mortals as you are, and yet you desire <lb/>
            everything as if you were immortals. You will hear many <lb/>
            men say, " After my fiftieth year I will give myself up to <lb/>
            leisure : my sixtieth shall be my last year of public office ": <lb/>
            and what guarantee have you that your life will last any <lb/>
            longer ? who will let all this go on just as you have <lb/>
            arranged it ? are you not ashamed to reserve only the <lb/>
            leavings of your life for yourself, and appoint for the en­ <lb/>
            joyment of your own right mind only that time which you <lb/>
            cannot devote to any business ? How late it is to begin life <lb/>
            just when we have to be leaving it! What a foolish forget­ <lb/>
            fulness of our mortality, to put off wholesome counsels until <lb/>
            our fiftieth or sixtieth year, and to choose that our lives <lb/>
            shall begin at a point which few of us ever reach.</p>
          <p>IV. You will find that the most powerful and highly- <lb/>
            placed men let fall phrases in which they long for leisure, <lb/>
            praise it, and prefer it to all the blessings which they enjoy. <lb/>
            Sometimes they would fain descend from their lofty pedestal, <lb/>
            if it could be safely done : for Fortune collapses by its own <lb/>
            weight, without any shock or interference from without. <lb/>
            The late Emperor Augustus, upon whom the gods bestowed <lb/>
            more blessings than on any one else, never ceased to pray <lb/>
            for rest and exemption from the troubles of empire: he <lb/>
            used to enliven his labours with this sweet, though unreal <lb/>
            consolation, that he would some day live for himself alone. <lb/>
            In a letter which he addressed to the Senate, after pro­ <lb/>
            mising that his rest shall not be devoid of dignity nor <lb/>
            discreditable to his former glories, I find the following <lb/>
            words :—" These things, however, it is more honourable to <lb/>
            do than to promise: but iny eagerness for that time, so <lb/>
            earnestly longed for, has led me to derive a certain pleasure <lb/>
            from speaking about it, though the reality is still far <lb/>
            distant." 1 He thought leisure so important, that though <note type="footnote"> 1 "Dans une lettre qu'il envoya au Sénat apres avoir promis que son </note> <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            he could not actually enjoy it, yet he did so by anticipation <lb/>
            and by thinking about it. He, who saw everything de­ <lb/>
            pending upon himself alone, who swayed the fortunes of <lb/>
            men and of nations, thought that his happiest day would <lb/>
            be that on which he laid aside his greatness. He knew by <lb/>
            experience how much labour was involved in that glory <lb/>
            that shone through all lands, and how much secret anxiety <lb/>
            was concealed within it: he had been forced to assert his <lb/>
            rights by war, first with his countrymen, next with his <lb/>
            colleagues, and lastly with his own relations, and had shed <lb/>
            blood both by sea and by land : . after marching his troops <lb/>
            under arms through Macedonia, Sicily, Egypt, Syria, Asia <lb/>
            Minor, and almost all the countries of the world, when they <lb/>
            were weary with slaughtering Romans he had directed <lb/>
            them against a foreign foe. While he was pacifying the <lb/>
            Alpine regions, and subduing the enemies whom he found <lb/>
            in the midst of the Roman empire, while he was extending <lb/>
            its boundaries beyond the Rhine, the Euphrates, and the <lb/>
            Danube, at Rome itself the swords of Murena, Caepio, <lb/>
            Lepidus, Egnatius, and others were being sharpened to <lb/>
            slay him. Scarcely had he escaped from their plot, when <lb/>
            his already failing age was terrified by his daughter and <lb/>
            all the noble youths who were pledged to her cause by <lb/>
            adultery with her by way of oath of fidelity. Then there <lb/>
            was Paulus and Antonius's mistress, a second time to be <note type="footnote"> repos n'aura rien indigne de la gloire de ses premieres annees, il ajoute : <lb/>

            feared by Rome : and when he had cut out these ulcers <lb/>
            from his very limbs, others grew in their place: the empire, <lb/>
            like a body overloaded with blood, was always breaking <lb/>
            out somewhere. For this reason he longed for leisure : all <lb/>
            his labours were based upon hopes and thoughts of leisure : <lb/>
            this was the wish of him who could accomplish the wishes <lb/>
            of all other men. ,</p>
          <p>V. While tossed hither and thither by Catiline and Clor <lb/>
            dius, Pompeius and Crassus, by some open enemies and some <lb/>
            doubtful friends, while he he struggled with the struggling <lb/>
            republic and kept it, from going to ruin, when at last he was <lb/>
            banished, being neither able. to keep silence in prosperity nor <lb/>
            to endure adversity with patience, how often must Marcus ' <lb/>
            Cicero have cursed that consulship of his which he <lb/>
            never ceased to praise, and which nevertheless deserved it ? <lb/>
            What piteous expressions he uses in a letter to Atticus <lb/>
            when Pompeius the father had been defeated, and his son <lb/>
            was recruiting his shattered forces in Spain ? " Do you <lb/>
            ask," writes he, " what I am doing here? I am living in <lb/>
            my Tusculan villa almost as a prisoner." He adds more <lb/>
            afterwards, wherein he laments his former life, complains <lb/>
            of the present, and despairs of the future. Cicero called <lb/>
            himself " half a prisoner," but, by Hercules, the wise man <lb/>
            never would have come under so lowly a title: he never <lb/>
            would be half a prisoner, but would always enjoy complete <lb/>
            and entire liberty, being free, in his own power, and greater <lb/>
            than all others: for what can be greater than the man who <lb/>
            is greater than Fortune ?</p>
          <p>VI. When Livius Drusus, a vigorous and energetic man, <lb/>
            brought forward bills for new laws and radical measures of <lb/>
            the Gracchus pattern, being the centre of a vast mob of all <lb/>
            the peoples of Italy, and seeing no way to solve the question, <lb/>
            since he was not allowed to deal with it as he wished, and <lb/>
            yet was not free to throw it up after having once taken <lb/>
            part in it, complained bitterly of his life, which had been <pb n="296"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            one of unrest from the very cradle, and said, we are told, <lb/>
            that " he was the only person who had never had any holi­ <lb/>
            days even when he was a boy." Indeed, while he was <lb/>
            still under age and wearing the praetexta, he had the <lb/>
            courage to plead the cause of accused persons in court, and <lb/>
            to make use of his influence so powerfully that it is well <lb/>
            known that in some causes his, exertions gained a verdict. <lb/>
            Where would such precocious ambition stop? You may <lb/>
            be sure that one who showed such boldness as a child <lb/>
            would end by becoming a great pest both in public and in <lb/>
            private life: it was too late for him to complain that he <lb/>
            had had no holidays, when from his boyhood he had <lb/>
            been a firebrand and a nuisance in the courts. It is a stock <lb/>
            question whether he committed suicide: for he fell by a <lb/>
            sudden wound in the groin, and some doubted whether his <lb/>
            death was caused by his own hand, though none disputed <lb/>
            its having happened most seasonably. It would be super­ <lb/>
            fluous to mention more who, while others thought them <lb/>
            the happiest of men, have themselves borne true wit­ <lb/>
            ness to their own feelings, and have loathed all that <lb/>
            they have done for all the years of their lives : yet by these <lb/>
            complaints they have effected no alteration either in others <lb/>
            or in themselves: for after these words have escaped them <lb/>
            their feelings revert to their accustomed frame. By Her­ <lb/>
            cules, that life of you great men, even though it should <lb/>
            last for more than a thousand years, is still a very short <lb/>
            one : those vices of yours would swallow up any extent of <lb/>
            time: no wonder if this our ordinary span, which, though <lb/>
            Nature hurries on, can be enlarged by common sense, soon <lb/>
            slips away from you : for you do not lay hold of it or hold <lb/>
            it back, and try to delay the swiftest of all things, but you <lb/>
            let it pass as though it were a useless thing and you could <lb/>
            supply its place.</p>
          <p>VII. Among these I reckon in the first place those who <lb/>
            devote their time to nothing but drinking and debauchery : <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            for no men are busied more shamefully: the others, al­ <lb/>
            though the glory which they pursue is but a counterfeit, <lb/>
            still deserve some credit for their pursuit of it-though <lb/>
            you may tell me of misers, of passionate men, of men who <lb/>
            hate and who even wage war without a cause-yet all such <lb/>
            men sin like men : but the sin of those who are given up to <lb/>
            gluttony and lust is a disgraceful one. Examine all the <lb/>
            hours of their lives : consider how much time they spend <lb/>
            in calculation, how much in plotting, how much in fear, <lb/>
            how much in giving and receiving flattery, how much in <lb/>
            entering into recognizances for themselves or for others, <lb/>
            how much in banquets, which indeed become a serious <lb/>
            business, you will see that they are not allowed any <lb/>
            breathing time either by their pleasures or their pains. <lb/>
            Finally, all are agreed that nothing, neither eloquence nor <lb/>
            literature, can be done properly by one who is occupied <lb/>
            with something else; for nothing can take deep root in a <lb/>
            mind which is directed to some other subject, and which <lb/>
            rejects whatever you try to stuff into it. No man knows <lb/>
            less about living than a business man: there is nothing <lb/>
            about which it is more difficult to gain knowledge. Other <lb/>
            arts have many folk everywhere who profess to teach <lb/>
            them: some of them can be so- thoroughly learned by <lb/>
            mere boys, that they are able to teach them to others: <lb/>
            but one's whole life must be spent in learning how to <lb/>
            live, and, which may perhaps surprise you more, one's <lb/>
            whole life must be spent in learning how to die. Many <lb/>
            excellent men have freed themselves from all hindrances, <lb/>
            have given up riches, business, and pleasure, and have <lb/>
            made it their duty to the very end of their lives to learn <lb/>
            how to live : and yet the larger portion of them leave this <lb/>
            life confessing that they do not yet know how to live, and <lb/>
            still less know how to live as wise men. Believe me, it <lb/>
            requires a great man and one who is superior to human <lb/>
            frailties not to allow any of his time to be filched from him: <pb n="298"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            and therefore it follows that his life is a very long one, <lb/>
            because he devotes every possible part of it to himself : no <lb/>
            portion lies idle or uncultivated, or in another man's power; <lb/>
            for he finds nothing worthy of. being exchanged for his <lb/>
            time, which he husbands most grudgingly. He, therefore, <lb/>
            had time enough : whereas those who gave up a great part <lb/>
            of their lives to the people of necessity had not enough. <lb/>
            Yet you need not suppose that the latter were not sometimes <lb/>
            conscious of their loss: indeed, you will hear most of those <lb/>
            who are troubled with great prosperity every now and then <lb/>
            cry out amid their hosts of clients, their pleadings in court, <lb/>
            and their other honourable troubles, " I am not allowed to <lb/>
            live my own life." Why is he not allowed ? because all <lb/>
            those who call upon you to defend them, take you away <lb/>
            from yourself. How many of your days have been spent <lb/>
            by that defendant ? by that candidate for office ? by that <lb/>
            old woman who is weary with burying her heirs ? by that <lb/>
            man who pretends to be ill, in order to excite the greed of <lb/>
            those who hope to inherit his property? by that powerful <lb/>
            friend of yours, who uses you to swell his train, not to be <lb/>
            his friend ? Balance your account, and run over all the <lb/>
            days of your life; you will see that only a very few days, <lb/>
            and only those which were useless for any other purpose, <lb/>
            have been left to you. He who has obtained the fasces 1 <lb/>
            for which he longed, is eager to get rid of them, and is <lb/>
            constantly saying, "When will this year be over? " another <lb/>
            exhibits public games, and once would have given a great <lb/>
            deal for the chance of doing so, but now " when," says he, <lb/>
            " shall I escape from this?" another is an advocate who <lb/>
            is fought for in all the courts, and who draws immense <lb/>
            audiences, who crowd all the forum to a far greater distance <lb/>
            than they can hear him; " When," says he, "will vacation­ <lb/>
            time come?" Every man hurries through his life, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Fasces, the rods carried by the lictors as symbols of office. See <lb/>
            Smith's " Diet. of Antiquities," s.v. </note> <pb n="299"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            suffers from a yearning for the future, and a weariness of <lb/>
            the present: but he who disposes of all his time for his own <lb/>
            purposes, who arranges all his days as though he were <lb/>
            arranging the plan of his life, neither wishes for nor fears <lb/>
            the morrow: for what new pleasure can any hour now <lb/>
            bestow upon him ? he knows it all, and- has indulged in it <lb/>
            all even to satiety. Fortune may deal with the rest as she <lb/>
            will, his life is already safe from her:, such a man may <lb/>
            gain something, but cannot lose anything: and, indeed, he <lb/>
            can only gain anything in the same way as one who is <lb/>
            already glutted and filled can get some extra food which <lb/>
            he takes although he does not want it. - You have no <lb/>
            grounds,. therefore, for supposing that any one has lived <lb/>
            long, because he has wrinkles or grey hairs : such a man <lb/>
            has not lived long, but has only been long alive. Why ! <lb/>
            would you think that a man had voyaged much if a fierce <lb/>
            gale had caught him as soon as he left his port, and he had <lb/>
            been driven round and round the same place continually <lb/>
            by a succession of winds blowing from opposite quarters P <lb/>
            such a man has not travelled much, he has only been much <lb/>
            tossed about.</p>
          <p>VIII. I am filled with wonder when I see some men <lb/>
            asking others for their time, and those who are asked for <lb/>
            it most willing to give it: both parties consider the object <lb/>
            for which the time is given, but neither of them thinks of <lb/>
            the time itself, as though in asking for this one asked for <lb/>
            nothing, and in giving it one gave nothing: we play with <lb/>
            what is the most precious of all things: yet it escapes men's <lb/>
            notice, because it is an incorporeal thing, and because it <lb/>
            does not come before our eyes; and therefore it is held <lb/>
            very cheap, nay, hardly any value whatever is put upon it. <lb/>
            Men set the greatest store upon presents or pensions, and <lb/>
            hire out their work, their services, or their care in order to <lb/>
            gain them : no one values time : they give it much more <lb/>
            freely, as though it cost nothing. Yet you will see these <pb n="300"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            same people clasping the knees of their physician as sup­ <lb/>
            pliants when they are sick and in present peril of death, <lb/>
            and if threatened with a capital charge willing to give all <lb/>
            that they possess in order that they may live: so incon­ <lb/>
            sistent are they. Indeed, if the number of every man's <lb/>
            future years could be laid before him, as we can lay that <lb/>
            of his past years, how anxious those who found that they <lb/>
            had but few years remaining would be to make the most of <lb/>
            them ? Yet it is easy to arrange the distribution of a <lb/>
            quantity, however small, if we know how much there is: <lb/>
            what you ought to husband most carefully is that which <lb/>
            may run short you know not when. Yet you have no <lb/>
            reason to suppose that they do not know how dear a thing <lb/>
            time is : they are wont to say to those whom they especially <lb/>
            love that they are ready to give them a part of their own <lb/>
            years. They do give them, and know not that they are <lb/>
            giving them; but they give them in such a manner that <lb/>
            they themselves lose them without the others gaining them. <lb/>
            They do not, however, know whence they obtain their <lb/>
            supply, and therefore they are able to endure the waste of <lb/>
            what is not seen : yet no one will give you back your years, <lb/>
            no one will restore them to you again : your life will run <lb/>
            its course when once it has begun, and will neither begin <lb/>
            again or efface what it has done. It will make no dis­ <lb/>
            turbance, it will give you no warning of how fast it flies : <lb/>
            it will move silently on: it will not prolong itself at the <lb/>
            command of a king, or at the wish of a nation : as it <lb/>
            started on its first day, so it will run: it will never turn <lb/>
            aside, never delay. What follows, then ? Why ! you are <lb/>
            busy, but life is hurrying on: death will be here some time <lb/>
            or other, and you must attend to him, whether you will or <lb/>
            no.</p>
          <p>IX. Can anything be mentioned which is more insane <lb/>
            than the ideas of leisure of those people who boast of their <lb/>
            worldly wisdom ? They live laboriously, in order that <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            they may live better ; they fit themselves out for life at <lb/>
            the expense of life itself, and cast their thoughts a long <lb/>
            way forwards: yet postponement is the greatest waste of <lb/>
            life: it wrings day after day from us, and takes away <lb/>
            the present by promising something hereafter: there is no <lb/>
            such obstacle to true living as waiting, which loses to-day <lb/>
            while it is depending on the morrow. You dispose of <lb/>
            that which is in the hand of Fortune, and you let go that <lb/>
            which is in your own. Whither are you looking, whither <lb/>
            are you stretching forward ? everything future is uncer­ <lb/>
            tain*: live now straightway. See how the greatest of bards <lb/>
            cries to you and sings in wholesome verse as though <lb/>
            inspired with celestial fire:- <lb/>
            The best of wretched mortals' days is that <lb/>
            Which is the first to fly." <lb/>
            Why do you hesitate, says he, why do you stand back ? <lb/>
            unless you seize it it will have fled : and even if you do seize <lb/>
            it, it will still fly. Our swiftness in making use of our time <lb/>
            ought therefore to vie with the swiftness of time itself, and <lb/>
            we ought to drink of it as we should of a fast-running <lb/>
            torrent which will not be always running. The poet, <lb/>
            too, admirably satirizes our boundless thoughts, when he <lb/>
            says, not the first age," but the first day." Why are <lb/>
            you careless and slow while time is flying so fast, and why <lb/>
            do you spread out before yourself a vision of long months and <lb/>
            years, as many as your greediness requires ? he talks with <lb/>
            you about one day, and that a fast-fleeting one. There can, <lb/>
            then, be no doubt that the best days are those which fly <lb/>
            first for wretched, that is, for busy mortals, whose minds <lb/>
            are still in their childhood when old age comes upon them, <lb/>
            and they reach it unprepared and without arms to combat <lb/>
            it. They have never looked forward: they have all of a <lb/>
            sudden stumbled upon old age: they never noticed that it <lb/>
            was stealing upon them day by day. As conversation, or <lb/>
            reading, or deep thought deceives travellers, and they find <pb n="302"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            themselves at their journey's end before they knew that it <lb/>
            was drawing near, so in this fast and never-ceasing journey <lb/>
            of life, which we make at the same pace whether we are <lb/>
            asleep or awake, busy people never notice that they are <lb/>
            moving till they are at the end of it.</p>
          <p>X. If I chose to divide this proposition into separate <lb/>
            steps, supported by evidence, many things occur to me by <lb/>
            which I could prove that the lives of- busy men are the <lb/>
            shortest of all. Fabianus, who was none of your lecture­ <lb/>
            room philosophers, but one of the true antique pattern, <lb/>
            used to say, "We ought to'fight against the passions by <lb/>
            main force, not by skirmishing, and upset their line of <lb/>
            battle by a home charge, not by inflicting trifling wounds : <lb/>
            I do not approve of dallying with sophisms; they must be <lb/>
            crushed, not merely scratched." Yet, in order that sinners <lb/>
            may be confronted with their errors, they must be taught, <lb/>
            and not merely mourned for. Life is divided into three <lb/>
            parts : that which has been, that which is, and that which <lb/>
            is to come : of these three stages, that which we are passing <lb/>
            through is brief, that which we are about to pass is uncer­ <lb/>
            tain, and that which we have passed is certain: this it is <lb/>
            over which Fortune has lost her rights, and which can fall <lb/>
            into no other man's power: and this is what busy men <lb/>
            lose: for they have no leisure to look back upon the past, <lb/>
            and even if they had, they take no pleasure in remembering <lb/>
            what they regret: they are, therefore, unwilling to turn <lb/>
            their minds to the contemplation of ill-spent time, and they <lb/>
            shrink from reviewing a course of action whose faults become <lb/>
            glaringly apparent when handled a second time, although they <lb/>
            were snatched at when we were under the spell of immediate <lb/>
            gratification. No one, unless all his acts have been submitted <lb/>
            to the infallible censorship of his own conscience, willingly <lb/>
            turns his thoughts back upon the past. He who has ambi­ <lb/>
            tiously desired, haughtily scorned, passionately vanquished, <lb/>
            treacherously deceived, greedily snatched, or prodigally <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            wasted much, must needs fear his own memory; yet this <lb/>
            is a holy and consecrated part of our time, beyond the <lb/>
            reach of all human accidents, removed from the dominion <lb/>
            of Fortune, and which cannot be disquieted by want, fear, <lb/>
            or attacks of sickness: this can neither be troubled nor <lb/>
            taken away from one : we possess it for ever undisturbed. <lb/>
            Our .present consists only of single days, and those, too, <lb/>
            taken one hour at: a time: but all the days of past times <lb/>
            appear before us when bidden, and allow themselves to be <lb/>
            examined and lingered over, albeit busy men cannot find <lb/>
            time for so doing.. It is the privilege of a tranquil and <lb/>
            peaceful mind to review all the parts of its life: but the <lb/>
            minds of busy men are like animals under the yoke, and <lb/>
            cannot bend aside or look back. Consequently, their life <lb/>
            passes away into vacancy, and as you do no good however <lb/>
            much you may pour into a vessel which cannot keep or <lb/>
            hold what you put there, so also it matters not how much <lb/>
            time you give men if it can find no place to settle in, but <lb/>
            leaks away through the chinks and holes of their minds. <lb/>
            Present time is very short, so much so that to some it <lb/>
            seems to be no time at all; for it is always in motion, and <lb/>
            runs swiftly away: it ceases to exist before it comes, and <lb/>
            can no more brook delay than can the universe or the host of <lb/>
            heaven, whose unresting movement never lets them pause <lb/>
            on their way. Busy men, therefore, possess present time <lb/>
            alone, that being so short that they cannot grasp it, and <lb/>
            when they are occupied with many things they lose even <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>XI. In a word, do you want to know for how short a time <lb/>
            they live ? see how they desire to live long: broken-down <lb/>
            old men beg in their prayers for the addition of a few more <lb/>
            years: they pretend to be younger than they are: they <lb/>
            delude themselves with their own lies, and are as willing to <lb/>
            cheat themselves as if they could cheat Fate at the same <lb/>
            time: when at last some weakness reminds them that they <pb n="304"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            are mortal, they die as it were in terror: they may rather <lb/>
            be said to be dragged out of this life than to depart from it. <lb/>
            They loudly exclaim that they have been fools and have not <lb/>
            lived their lives, and declare that if they only survive this <lb/>
            sickness they will spend the rest of their lives at leisure : at <lb/>
            such times they reflect how uselessly they have laboured to <lb/>
            provide themselves with what they have never enjoyed, and <lb/>
            how all their toil has gone for nothing: but those whose <lb/>
            life is spent without any engrossing business may well <lb/>
            find it ample: no part of it is made over to others, or <lb/>
            scattered here and there; no part is entrusted to Fortune, is <lb/>
            lost by neglect, is spent in ostentatious giving, or is useless : <lb/>
            all of it is, so to speak, invested at good interest. A very <lb/>
            small amount of it, therefore, is abundantly sufficient, and <lb/>
            so, when his last day arrives, the wise man will not hang <lb/>
            back, but will walk with a steady step to meet death.</p>
          <p>XII. Perhaps you will ask me whom I mean by " busy <lb/>
            men " ? you need not think that I allude only to those who <lb/>
            are hunted out of the courts of justice with dogs at the <lb/>
            close of the proceedings, those whom you see either honour­ <lb/>
            ably jostled by a crowd of their own clients or contempt­ <lb/>
            uously hustled in visits of ceremony by strangers, who <lb/>
            call them away from home to hang about their patron's <lb/>
            doors, or who make use of the praetor's sales by auction to <lb/>
            acquire infamous gains which some day will prove their <lb/>
            own ruin. Some men's leisure is busy: in their country <lb/>
            house or on their couch, in complete solitude, even though <lb/>
            they have retired from all men's society, they still continue <lb/>
            to worry themselves : we ought not to say that such men's <lb/>
            life is one of leisure, but their very business is sloth. <lb/>
            Would you call a man idle who expends anxious finicking <lb/>
            care in the arrangement of his Corinthian bronzes, valuable <lb/>
            only through the mania of a few connoisseurs ? and who <lb/>
            passes the greater part of his days among plates of rusty <lb/>
            metal ? who sits in the palaestra (shame, that our very vices <pb n="305"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            should be foreign) watching boys wrestling ? who distri­ <lb/>
            butes his gangs of fettered slaves into pairs according to their <lb/>
            age and colour ? who keeps athletes of the latest fashion ? <lb/>
            Why, do you call those men idle, who pass many hours at <lb/>
            the barber's while the growth of the past night is being <lb/>
            plucked out by the roots, holding councils over each several <lb/>
            hair, while the scattered locks are arranged in order and <lb/>
            those which fall back are forced forward on to the forehead ? <lb/>
            How angry they become if the shaver is a little careless, as <lb/>
            though he were shearing a. man! what a white heat they <lb/>
            work themselves into if some of their mane is cut away, if <lb/>
            some part of it is ill-arranged, if all their ringlets do not lie <lb/>
            in regular order ! who of them would not rather that the <lb/>
            state were overthrown than that his hair should be <lb/>
            ruffled ? who does not care more for the appearance of his <lb/>
            head than for his health ? who would not prefer ornament <lb/>
            to honour ? Do you call these men idle, who make a busi­ <lb/>
            ness of the comb and looking-glass ? what of those who de­ <lb/>
            vote their lives to composing, hearing, and learning songs, <lb/>
            who twist their voices, intended by Nature to sound best, <lb/>
            and simplest when used straightforwardly, through all the <lb/>
            turns of futile melodies : whose fingers are always beating <lb/>
            time to some music on which they are inwardly meditating ; <lb/>
            who, when invited to serious and even sad business may <lb/>
            be heard humming an air to themselves ?-such people are <lb/>
            not at leisure, but are busy about trifles. As for their ban­ <lb/>
            quets, by Hercules, I cannot reckon them among their unoc­ <lb/>
            cupied times when I see with what anxious care they set <lb/>
            out their plate, how laboriously they arrange the girdles of <lb/>
            their waiters' tunics, how breathlessly they watch to see how <lb/>
            the cook dishes up the wild boar, with what speed, when the <lb/>
            signal is given, the slave-boys run to perform their duties, <lb/>
            how skilfully birds are carved into pieces of the right size, <lb/>
            how painstakingly wretched youths wipe up the spittings of <lb/>
            drunken men. By these means men seek credit for taste <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            and grandeur, and their vices follow them so far into their <lb/>
            privacy that they can neither eat nor drink without a view <lb/>
            to effect. Nor should I count those men idle who have <lb/>
            themselves carried hither and thither in sedans and litters, <lb/>
            and who look forward to their regular hour for taking this <lb/>
            exercise as though they were not allowed to omit it: men <lb/>
            who are reminded by some one else when to bathe, when to <lb/>
            swim, when to dine: they actually reach such a pitch of <lb/>
            languid effeminacy as not to be able to find out for them­ <lb/>
            selves whether they are hungry. I have heard one of these <lb/>
            luxurious folk-if indeed, we ought to give the name of <lb/>
            luxury to unlearning the life and habits of a man—when he <lb/>
            was carried in men's arms out of the bath and placed in his <lb/>
            chair, say inquiringly, " Am I seated ? " Do you suppose <lb/>
            that such a man as this, who did not know when he was <lb/>
            seated, could know whether he was alive, whether he could <lb/>
            see, whether he was at leisure ? I can hardly say whether <lb/>
            I pity him more if he really did not know or if he pretended <lb/>
            not to know this. Such people dp really become unconscious <lb/>
            of much, but they behave as though they were unconscious <lb/>
            of much more: they delight in some failings because they <lb/>
            consider them to be proofs of happiness: it seems the part <lb/>
            of an utterly low and contemptible man to know what he is <lb/>
            doing. After this, do you suppose that playwrights draw <lb/>
            largely upon their imaginations in their burlesques upon <lb/>
            luxury: by Hercules, they omit more than they invent; <lb/>
            in this age, inventive in this alone, such a number of in­ <lb/>
            credible vices have been produced, that already you are <lb/>
            able to reproach the playwrights with omitting to notice <lb/>
            them. To think that there should be any one who had so <lb/>
            far lost his senses through luxury as to take some one else's <lb/>
            opinion as to whether he was sitting or not ? This man <lb/>
            certainly is not at leisure: you must bestow a different <lb/>
            title on him: he is sick, or rather dead: he only is at <lb/>
            leisure who feels that he is at leisure: but this creature is <pb n="307"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            only half alive, if he wants some one to tell him what <lb/>
            position his body is in. How can such a man be able to <lb/>
            dispose of any time ?</p>
          <p>XIII. It would take long to describe the various indi­ <lb/>
            viduals who have wasted their lives over playing at draughts, <lb/>
            playing at ball, or toasting their bodies in the sun : men <lb/>
            are not at leisure if their pleasures partake of the character <lb/>
            of business, for no one will doubt that those persons are <lb/>
            laborious triflers who devote themselves to the study of <lb/>
            futile literary questions, of whom there is already a great <lb/>
            number in Rome also. It used to be a peculiarly Greek <lb/>
            disease of the mind to investigate how many rowers Ulysses <lb/>
            had, whether the Iliad or the Odyssey was written first, <lb/>
            and furthermore, whether they were written by the same <lb/>
            author, with other matters of the same stamp, which <lb/>
            neither please your inner consciousness if you keep them <lb/>
            to yourself, nor make you seem more learned, but only more <lb/>
            troublesome, if you publish them abroad. See, already <lb/>
            this vain longing to learn what is useless has taken hold <lb/>
            of the Romans: the other day I heard somebody telling <lb/>
            who was the first Roman general who did this or that: <lb/>
            Duillius was the first who won a sea-fight, Curius Dentatus <lb/>
            was the first who drove elephants in his triumph: moreover, <lb/>
            these stories, though they add nothing to real glory, do <lb/>
            nevertheless deal with the great deeds of our countrymen : <lb/>
            such knowledge is not profitable, yet it claims our atten­ <lb/>
            tion as a fascinating kind of folly. I will even pardon <lb/>
            those who want to know who first persuaded the Romans <lb/>
            to go on board ship. It was Claudius, who for this reason <lb/>
            was surnamed Caudex, because any piece of carpentry <lb/>
            formed of many planks was called caudex by the ancient <lb/>
            Romans, for which reason public records are called Codices, <lb/>
            and by old custom the ships which ply on the Tiber with <lb/>
            provisions are called codicariae. Let us also allow that it is <lb/>
            to the point to tell how Valerius Corvinus was the first <pb n="308"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X-</note> <lb/>
            to conquer Messana, and first of the family of the Valerii <lb/>
            transferred the name of the captured city to his own, and <lb/>
            was called Messana, and how the people gradually corrupted <lb/>
            the pronunciation and called him Messalla: or would you <lb/>
            let any one find interest in Lucius Sulla having been the first <lb/>
            to let lions loose in the circus, they having been previously <lb/>
            exhibited in chains, and hurlers of darts having been <lb/>
            sent by King Bocchus to kill them ? This may be permitted <lb/>
            to their curiosity; but can it serve any useful purpose to <lb/>
            know that Pompeius was the first to exhibit eighteen <lb/>
            elephants in the circus, who were matched in a mimic <lb/>
            battle with some convicts ? The leading man in the state, <lb/>
            and one who, according to tradition, was noted among <lb/>
            the ancient leaders of the state for his transcendent goodness <lb/>
            of heart, thought it a notable kind of show to kill men in <lb/>
            a manner hitherto unheard of. Do they fight to the death ? <lb/>
            that is not cruel enough : are they torn to pieces p that is <lb/>
            not cruel enough: let them be crushed flat by animals of <lb/>
            enormous bulk. It would be much better that such a <lb/>
            thing should be forgotten, for fear that hereafter some <lb/>
            potentate might hear of it and envy its refined barbarity. <lb/>
            0, how doth excessive prosperity blind our intellects ! at <lb/>
            the moment at which he was casting so many troops of <lb/>
            wretches to be trampled on by outlandish beasts, when he <lb/>
            was proclaiming war between such different creatures, <lb/>
            when he was shedding so much blood before the eyes of <lb/>
            the Roman people, whose blood he himself was soon to <lb/>
            shed even more freely, he thought himself the master of <lb/>
            the whole world; yet he afterwards, deceived by the <lb/>
            treachery of. the Alexandrians, had to offer himself to the <lb/>
            dagger of the vilest of slaves, and then at last discovered <lb/>
            what an empty boast was his surname of 11 The Great.'' <lb/>
            But to return to the point from which I have digressed, I <lb/>
            will prove that even on this very subject some people <lb/>
            expend useless pains. The same author tells us that <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            Metellus, when he triumphed after having conquered the <lb/>
            Carthaginians in Sicily, was the only Roman who ever had <lb/>
            a hundred and twenty captured elephants led before his <lb/>
            car: and that Sulla was the last Roman who extended the <lb/>
            pomoerium,l which it was not the custom of the ancients <lb/>
            to extend on account of the conquest of provincial, but <lb/>
            only of Italian territory. Is it more useful to know this, <lb/>
            than to know that the Mount Aventine, according to <lb/>
            him, is outside of the pomoerium, for one of two reasons, <lb/>
            either because it was thither that the plebeians seceded, or <lb/>
            because when Remus took his auspices on that place the <lb/>
            birds which he saw were not propitious: and other stories <lb/>
            without number of the like sort, which are either actual <lb/>
            falsehoods or much the same as falsehoods ? for even if <lb/>
            you allow that these authors speak in all good faith, if <lb/>
            they pledge themselves for the truth of what they write, <lb/>
            still, whose mistakes will be made fewer by such stories ? <lb/>
            whose passions will be restrained ? whom will they make <lb/>
            more brave, more just, or more gentlemanly ? My friend <lb/>
            Fabianus used to say that he was not sure that it was not <lb/>
            better not to apply oneself to any studies at all than to <lb/>
            become interested in these.</p>
          <p>. XIV. The only persons who are really at leisure are <lb/>
            those who devote themselves to philosophy: and they alone <lb/>
            really live : for they do not merely enjoy their own life­ <lb/>
            time, but they annex every century to their own: all <lb/>
            the years which have passed before them belong to them. <lb/>
            Unless we are the most ungrateful creatures in the world, <lb/>
            we shall regard these noblest of men, the founders of <lb/>
            divine schools of thought, as having been born for us, and <lb/>
            having prepared life for -as: we are led by the labour of <lb/>
            others to behold most beautiful things which have been <lb/>
            brought out of darkness into light: we are not shut out <lb/>
            from any period, we can make our way into every subject, <note type="footnote">1 See Smith's "Dict. of Antiquities." </note> <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            and, if only we can summon up sufficient strength of mind <lb/>
            to overstep the narrow limit of human weakness, we have <lb/>
            a vast extent of time wherein to disport ourselves : we may <lb/>
            argue with Socrates, doubt with Carneades, repose with <lb/>
            Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, out­ <lb/>
            herod it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows us to <lb/>
            commune with every age, why do we not abstract ourselves <lb/>
            from our own petty fleeting span of time, and give our­ <lb/>
            selves up with our whole mind to what is vast, what <lb/>
            is eternal, what we share with better men than our­ <lb/>
            selves ? Those who gad about in a round of calls, who <lb/>
            worry- themselves and others, after they have indulged <lb/>
            their madness to the full, and crossed every patron's <lb/>
            threshold daily, leaving no open door unentered, after <lb/>
            they have hawked about their interested greetings in <lb/>
            houses of the most various character,-after all, how few <lb/>
            people are they able to see out of so vast a city, divided <lb/>
            among so many different ruling passions : how many will <lb/>
            be moved by sloth, self-indulgence, or rudeness to deny <lb/>
            them admittance: how many, after they have long plagued <lb/>
            them, will run past them with feigned hurry ? how many <lb/>
            will avoid coming out through their entrance-hall with its <lb/>
            crowds of clients, and will escape by some concealed back­ <lb/>
            door ? as though it were not ruder to deceive their visitor <lb/>
            than to deny him admittance!-how many, half asleep and <lb/>
            stupid with yesterday's debauch, can hardly be brought to <lb/>
            return the greeting of the wretched man who has broken <lb/>
            his own rest in order to wait on that of another, even after <lb/>
            his name has been whispered to them for the thousandth <lb/>
            time, save by a most offensive yawn of his half-opened lips. <lb/>
            We may truly say that those men are pursuing the true <lb/>
            path of duty, who wish every day to consort on the <lb/>
            most familiar terms with Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, <lb/>
            and the rest of those high priests of virtue, with Aristotle <lb/>
            and with Theophrastus. None of these men will be " en- <pb n="311"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            gaged," none of these will fail to send you away after <lb/>
            visiting him in a happier frame of mind and on better <lb/>
            terms with yourself, none of them will let you leave him <lb/>
            empty-handed : yet their society may be enjoyed by all <lb/>
            men, and by night as well as by day.</p>
          <p>XV. None of these men will force you to die, but all of <lb/>
            them will teach you how to die: none of these will waste <lb/>
            your time, but will add his own to it. The talk of these <lb/>
            men is not dangerous, their friendship will not lead you to <lb/>
            the scaffold, their society will not ruin you in expenses: <lb/>
            you may take from them whatsoever you will; they will <lb/>
            not prevent your taking the deepest draughts of their <lb/>
            wisdom that you please. What blessedness, what a fair old <lb/>
            age awaits the man who takes these for his patrons! he <lb/>
            will have friends with whom he may discuss all matters, <lb/>
            great and small, whose advice he may ask daily about him­ <lb/>
            self, from whom he will hear truth without insult, praise <lb/>
            without flattery, and according to whose likeness he may <lb/>
            model his own character. We are wont to say that we are <lb/>
            not able to choose who our parents should be, but that <lb/>
            they were assigned to us by chance; yet we may be born <lb/>
            just as we please: there are several families of the noblest <lb/>
            intellects : choose which you would like to belong to : by <lb/>
            your adoption you will not receive their name only, but also <lb/>
            their property, which is not intended to be guarded in a <lb/>
            mean and miserly spirit: the more persons you divide it <lb/>
            among the larger it becomes. These will open to you the <lb/>
            path which leads to eternity, and will raise you to a height <lb/>
            from whence none shall cast you down. By this means <lb/>
            alone can you prolong your mortal life, nay, even turn it <lb/>
            into an immortal one. High office, monuments, all that <lb/>
            ambition records in decrees or piles up in stone, soon passes <lb/>
            away: lapse of time casts down and ruins everything ; but <lb/>
            those things on which Philosophy has set its seal are <lb/>
            beyond the reach of injury: no age will discard them or <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            lessen their force, each succeeding century will add some­ <lb/>
            what to the respect in which they are held: for we look <lb/>
            upon what is near us with jealous eyes, but we admire <lb/>
            what is further off with less prejudice. The wise man's <lb/>
            life, therefore, includes much : he is not hedged in by the <lb/>
            same limits which confine others: he alone is exempt from <lb/>
            the laws by which mankind is governed: all ages serve <lb/>
            him like a god. If any time be past, he recals it by his <lb/>
            memory; if it be present, he uses it; if it be future, he <lb/>
            anticipates it: his life is a long one because he concentrates <lb/>
            all times into it.</p>
          <p>XVI. Those men lead the shortest and unhappiest lives <lb/>
            who forget the past, neglect the present, and dread the <lb/>
            future: when they reach the end of it the poor wretches <lb/>
            learn too fate that they were busied all the while that they <lb/>
            were doing nothing. You need not think, because some­ <lb/>
            times they call for death, that their lives are long: their <lb/>
            folly torments them with vague passions which lead them <lb/>
            into the very things of which they are afraid : they often, <lb/>
            therefore, wish for death because they live in fear. Neither <lb/>
            is it, as you might think, a proof of the length of their lives <lb/>
            that they often find the days long, that they often com­ <lb/>
            plain how slowly the hours pass until the appointed time <lb/>
            arrives for dinner : for whenever they are left without <lb/>
            their usual business, they fret helplessly in their idleness, <lb/>
            and know not how to arrange or to spin it out. They <lb/>
            betake themselves, therefore, to some business, and all the <lb/>
            intervening time is irksome to them; they would wish, <lb/>
            by Hercules, to skip over it, just as they wish to skip over <lb/>
            the intervening days before a gladiatorial contest or some <lb/>
            other time appointed for a public spectacle or private indul­ <lb/>
            gence : all postponement of what they wish for is grievous to <lb/>
            them. Yet the very time which they enjoy is brief and soon <lb/>
            past, and is made much briefer by their own fault: for they <lb/>
            run from one pleasure to another, and are not able to devote <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            themselves consistently to one passion : their days are not <lb/>
            long, but odious to them : on the other hand, how short they <lb/>
            find the nights which they spend with courtezans or over <lb/>
            wine ? Hence arises that folly of the poets who encourage <lb/>
            the errors of mankind by their myths, and declare that <lb/>
            Jupiter to gratify his voluptuous desires doubled the length <lb/>
            of the night. Is it not adding fuel to our vices to name <lb/>
            the gods as their authors, and to offer our distempers free <lb/>
            scope by giving them deity for an example ? How can the <lb/>
            nights for which men pay so dear fail to appear of the <lb/>
            shortest ? they lose the day in looking forward to the night, <lb/>
            and lose the night through fear of the dawn.</p>
          <p>. XVII. Such men's very pleasures are restless and dis­ <lb/>
            turbed by various alarms, and at the most joyous moment <lb/>
            of all there rises the anxious thought: " How long <lb/>
            will this last ? " This frame of mind has led kings to <lb/>
            weep over their power, and they have not been so much <lb/>
            delighted at the grandeur of their position, as they have <lb/>
            been terrified by the end to which it must some day come. <lb/>
            That most arrogant Persian king,1 when his army stretched <lb/>
            over vast plains and could not be counted but only measured, <lb/>
            burst into tears at the thought that in less than a hundred <lb/>
            years none of all those warriors would be alive: yet their death <lb/>
            was brought upon them by the very man who wept over it, <lb/>
            who was about to destroy some of them by sea, some on land, <lb/>
            some in battle, and some in flight, and who would in a very <lb/>
            short space of time put an end to those about whose hundredth <lb/>
            year he showed such solicitude. Why need we wonder at <lb/>
            their very joys being mixed with fear ? they do not rest <lb/>
            upon any solid grounds, but are disturbed by the same <lb/>
            emptiness from which they spring. What must we suppose <lb/>
            to be the misery of such times as even they. acknowledge to <lb/>
            be wretched, when even the joys by which they elevate <lb/>
            themselves and raise themselves above their fellows are of <note type="footnote"> 1 Xerxes. </note> <pb n="314"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            a mixed character. tAll the greatest blessings are enjoyed <lb/>
            with fear, and no thing is so untrustworthy as extreme <lb/>
            prosperity: we require fresh strokes of good fortune to <lb/>
            enable us to keep that which we are enjoying, and even <lb/>
            those of our prayers which are answered require fresh <lb/>
            prayers. Everything for which we are dependent on chance <lb/>
            is uncertain : the higher it rises, the more opportunities it <lb/>
            has of falling. Moreover, no one takes any pleasure in <lb/>
            what is about to fall into ruin: very wretched, therefore, <lb/>
            as well as very short must be the lives of those who work <lb/>
            very hard to gain what they must work even harder to <lb/>
            keep: they obtain what they wish with infinite labour, and <lb/>
            they hold what they have obtained with fear and trembling. <lb/>
            Meanwhile they take no account of time, of which they will <lb/>
            never have a fresh and larger supply: they substitute new <lb/>
            occupations for old ones, one hope leads to another, one <lb/>
            ambition to another : they do not seek for an end to their <lb/>
            wretchedness, but they change its subject. Do our own pre­ <lb/>
            ferments trouble us ? nay, those of other men occupy more <lb/>
            of our time. Have we ceased from our labours in canvassing ? <lb/>
            then we begin others in voting. Have we got rid of the <lb/>
            trouble of accusation ? then we begin that of judging. <lb/>
            Has a man ceased to be a judge ? then he becomes an <lb/>
            examiner. Has he grown old in the salaried management <lb/>
            of other people's property ? then he becomes occupied with <lb/>
            his own. Marius is discharged from military service; he <lb/>
            becomes consul many times : Quintius is eager to reach the <lb/>
            end of his dictatorship; he will be called a second time <lb/>
            from the plough: Scipio marched against the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians before he was of years sufficient for so great an <lb/>
            undertaking; after he has conquered Hannibal, conquered <lb/>
            Antiochus, been the glory of his own consulship and the <lb/>
            surety for that of his brother, he might, had he wished it, <lb/>
            have been set on the same pedestal with Jupiter; but civil <lb/>
            factions will vex the saviour of the state, and he who when <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            a young man disdained to receive divine honours, will <lb/>
            take pride as an old man in obstinately remaining in exile. <lb/>
            We shall never lack causes of anxiety, either pleasurable <lb/>
            or painful : our life will be pushed along from one business <lb/>
            to another: leisure will always be wished for, and never <lb/>
            enjoyed.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Whefore, my dearest Paulinus, tear yourself <lb/>
            away from the common herd, and since you have seen more <lb/>
            rough weather than one would think from your age, betake <lb/>
            yourself at length to a more peaceful haven : reflect what <lb/>
            waves you have sailed through, what storms you have <lb/>
            endured in private life, and brought upon yourself in <lb/>
            public. Your courage has been sufficiently displayed by <lb/>
            many toilsome and wearisome proofs; try how it will <lb/>
            deal with leisure: the greater, certainly the better part of <lb/>
            your life, has been given to your country ; take now some <lb/>
            part of your time for yourself as well. I do not urge you <lb/>
            to practise a dull or lazy sloth, or to drown all your fiery <lb/>
            spirit in the pleasures which are dear to the herd: that is <lb/>
            not rest: you can find greater works than all those which you <lb/>
            have hitherto so manfully carried out, upon which you may <lb/>
            employ yourself in retirement and security. You manage <lb/>
            the revenues of the entire world, as unselfishly as though <lb/>
            they belonged to another, as laboriously as if they were <lb/>
            your own, as scrupulously as though they belonged to the <lb/>
            public: you win love in an office in which it is hard to <lb/>
            avoid incurring hatred; yet, believe me, it is better to <lb/>
            understand your own mind than to understand the <lb/>
            corn-market. Take away that keen intellect of yours, <lb/>
            so well capable of grappling with the greatest subjects, <lb/>
            from a post which may be dignified, but which is hardly <lb/>
            fitted to render life happy, and reflect that you did <lb/>
            not study from childhood all the branches of a liberal <lb/>
            education merely in order that many thousand tons of <lb/>
            corn might safely be entrusted to your charge: you have <pb n="316"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            given us promise of something greater and nobler than <lb/>
            this. There will never be any want of strict economists <lb/>
            or of laborious workers : slow-going beasts of burden are <lb/>
            better suited for carrying loads than well-bred horses, <lb/>
            whose generous swiftness no one would encumber with <lb/>
            a heavy pack. Think, moreover, how full of risk is <lb/>
            the great task which you have undertaken : you have to <lb/>
            deal with the human stomach : a hungry people will not <lb/>
            endure reason, will not be appeased by justice, and will <lb/>
            not hearken to any prayers. Only just a few days <lb/>
            ago, when G. Caesar perished, grieving for nothing so <lb/>
            much (if those in the other world can feel grief) as that <lb/>
            the Roman people did not die with him, there was said to <lb/>
            be only enough corn for seven or eight days' consumption : <lb/>
            while he was making bridges with ships 1 and playing with <lb/>
            the resources of the empire, want of provisions, the worst <lb/>
            evil that can befall even a besieged city, was at hand : his <lb/>
            imitation of a crazy outlandish and misproud king very <lb/>
            nearly ended in ruin, famine, and the general revolution <lb/>
            which follows famine. What must then have been the <lb/>
            feelings of those who had the charge of supplying the city <lb/>
            with corn, who were in danger of stoning, of fire and sword, <lb/>
            of Gaius himself ? With consummate art they concealed <lb/>
            the vast internal evil by which the state was menaced, and <lb/>
            were quite right in so doing; for some diseases must be <lb/>
            cured without the patient's knowledge: many have died <lb/>
            through discovering what was the matter with them.</p>
          <p>XIX. Betake yourself to these quieter, safer, larger <lb/>
            fields of action : do you think that there can be any com­ <lb/>
            parison between seeing that corn is deposited in the public <note type="footnote"> 1 11 Sénéque parle ici du pont que Caligula fit construire sur le golphe <lb/>

            tion, their form ? to what changes your soul has to look <lb/>
            forward ? where Nature will place us when we are dismissed <lb/>
            from our bodies ? what that principle is which holds all <lb/>
            the heaviest particles of our universe in the middle, sus­ <lb/>
            pends the lighter ones above, puts fire highest of all, and <lb/>
            causes the stars to rise in their courses, with many other <lb/>
            matters, full of marvels ? Will you not 1 cease to grovel <lb/>
            on earth' and turn your mind's eye on these themes ? nay, <lb/>
            while your blood still flows swiftly, before your knees grow <lb/>
            feeble, you ought to take the better path. In this course <lb/>
            of life there await you many good things, such as love and <lb/>
            practice of the virtues, forgetfulness of passions, knowledge <lb/>
            of how to live and die, deep repose. The position of all <lb/>
            busy men is unhappy, but most unhappy of all is that of <lb/>
            those who do not even labour at their own affairs, but have <lb/>
            to regulate their rest by another man's sleep, their walk by <lb/>
            another man's pace, and whose very love and hate, the <lb/>
            freest things in the world, are at another's bidding. If <lb/>
            such men wish to know how short their lives are, let them <lb/>
            think how small a fraction of them is their own.</p>
          <p>XX. When, therefore, you see a man often wear the <lb/>
            purple robes of office, and hear his name often repeated in <lb/>
            the forum, do not envy him: he gains these things by <lb/>
            losing so much of his life. Men throw away all their <lb/>
            years in order to have one year named after them as con­ <lb/>
            sul: some lose their lives during the early part of the <lb/>
            struggle, and never reach the height to which they aspired: <note type="footnote"> 1 For vis tu see Juv. v., vis tu consuetis, &amp;c. Mayor's note. </note> <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. X. </note> <lb/>
            some after having submitted to a thousand indignities in <lb/>
            order to reach the crowning dignity, have the miserable <lb/>
            reflexion that the only result of their labours will be the <lb/>
            inscription on their tombstone. Some, while telling off <lb/>
            extreme old age, like youth, for new aspirations, have <lb/>
            found it fail from sheer weakness amid great and presump­ <lb/>
            tuous enterprises. It is a shameful ending, when a man's <lb/>
            breath deserts him in a court of justice, while, although <lb/>
            well stricken in years, he is still striving to gain the sympa­ <lb/>
            thies of an ignorant audience for some obscure litigant: it <lb/>
            is base to perish in the midst of one's business, wearied with <lb/>
            living sooner than with working; shameful, too, to die in <lb/>
            the act of receiving payments, amid the laughter of one's <lb/>
            long-expectant heir. I cannot pass over an an instance <lb/>
            which occurs to me: Turannius was an old man of the <lb/>
            -most painstaking exactitude, who after entering upon his <lb/>
            ninetieth year, when he had by G. Caesar's own act been <lb/>
            relieved of his duties as collector of the revenue, ordered <lb/>
            himself to be laid out on his bed and mourned for as <lb/>
            though he were dead. The whole house mourned for the <lb/>
            leisure of its old master, and did not lay aside its mourning <lb/>
            until his work was restored to him. Can men find such <lb/>
            pleasure in dying in harness ? Yet many are of the same <lb/>
            mind: they retain their wish for labour longer than their <lb/>
            capacity for it, and fight against their bodily weakness; <lb/>
            they think old age an evil for no other reason than because <lb/>
            it lays them on the shelf. The law does not enrol a soldier <lb/>
            after his fiftieth year, or require a senator's attendance <lb/>
            after his sixtieth : but men have more difficulty in obtain­ <lb/>
            ing their own consent than that of the law to a life of <lb/>
            leisure. Meanwhile, while they are plundering and being <lb/>
            plundered, while one is disturbing another's repose, and all <lb/>
            are being made wretched alike, life remains without profit, <lb/>
            without pleasure, without any intellectual progress: no one <lb/>
            keeps death well before his eyes, no one refrains from far- <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            reaching hopes. Some even arrange things which lie <lb/>
            beyond their own lives, such as huge sepulchral buildings, <lb/>
            the dedication of public works, and exhibitions to be given <lb/>
            at their funeral-pyre, and ostentatious processions: but, by <lb/>
            Hercules, the funerals of such men ought to be conducted <lb/>
            by the light of torches and wax tapers, 1 as though they <lb/>
            had lived but a few days. <note type="footnote"> 1 As those of children were. </note></p>

          <p>M <lb/>
            Y best of mothers, I have often felt eager to console <lb/>
            you, and have as often checked that impulse. Many <lb/>
            things urged me to make the attempt: in the first place, I <lb/>
            thought that if, though I might not be able to restrain <lb/>
            your tears, yet that if I could even wipe them away, I <lb/>
            should set myself free from all my own sorrows : then I was <lb/>
            quite sure that I should rouse you from your grief with <lb/>
            more authority if I had first shaken it off myself. I feared, <lb/>
            too, lest Fortune, though overcome by me, might neverthe­ <lb/>
            less overcome some one of my family. Then I endeavoured <lb/>
            to crawl and bind up your wounds in the best way I could, <lb/>
            holding my hand over my own wound; but then again <lb/>
            other considerations occurred to me which held me back : <lb/>
            I knew that I must not oppose your grief during its first <lb/>
            transports, lest my very attempts at consolation might <lb/>
            irritate it, and add fuel to it: for in diseases, also, there is <lb/>
            nothing more hurtful than medicine applied too soon. I <lb/>
            waited, therefore, until it exhausted itself by its own <lb/>
            violence, and being weakened by time, so that it was able <lb/>
            to bear remedies, would allow itself to be handled and <pb n="321"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            touched. Beside this, while turning over all the works <lb/>
            which the greatest geniuses have composed, for the purpose <lb/>
            of soothing and pacifying grief, I could not find any <lb/>
            instance of one who had offered consolation to his relatives, <lb/>
            while be himself was being sorrowed over by them. Thus, <lb/>
            the subject being a new one, I hesitated and feared that <lb/>
            instead of consoling, I might embitter your grief. Then <lb/>
            there was the thought that a man who had only just raised <lb/>
            his head after burying his child, and who wished to console <lb/>
            his friends, would require to use new phrases not taken from <lb/>
            our common every-day words of comfort: but every sorrow <lb/>
            of more than usual magnitude must needs prevent one's <lb/>
            choosing one's words, seeing that it often prevents one's <lb/>
            using one's very voice. However this may be, I will make <lb/>
            the attempt, not trusting in my own genius, but because my <lb/>
            consolation will be most powerful since it is I who offer it. <lb/>
            You never would deny me anything, and I hope, though <lb/>
            all grief is obstinate, that you will surely not refuse me <lb/>
            this request, that you will allow me to set bounds to your <lb/>
            sorrow.</p>
          <p>II. See how far I have presumed upon your indulgence : <lb/>
            I have no doubts about my having more power over you <lb/>
            than your grief, than which nothing has more power over <lb/>
            the unhappy. In order, therefore, to avoid encountering <lb/>
            it straightway, I will at first take its part and offer <lb/>
            it every encouragement: I will rip up and bring to <lb/>
            light again wounds already scarred. Some one may say, <lb/>
            " What sort of consolation is this, for a man to rake up <lb/>
            buried evils, and to bring all its sorrows before a mind <lb/>
            which scarcely can bear the sight of one?" but let him <lb/>
            reflect that diseases which are so malignant that they do <lb/>
            but gather strength from ordinary remedies, may often be <lb/>
            cured by the opposite treatment: I will, therefore, display <lb/>
            before your grief all its woes and miseries : this will be to <lb/>
            effect a cure, not by soothing measures, but by cautery and <note type="footnote"> y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            the knife. What shall I gain by this ? I shall make the <lb/>
            mind that could overcome so many sorrows, ashamed to <lb/>
            bewail one wound more in a body so full of scars. Let <lb/>
            those whose feeble minds have been enervated by a long <lb/>
            period of happiness, weep and lament for many days, and <lb/>
            faint away on receiving the slightest blow : but those whose <lb/>
            years have all been passed amid catastrophes should bear <lb/>
            the severest losses with brave and unyielding patience. <lb/>
            Continual misfortune has this one advantage, that it ends <lb/>
            by rendering callous those whom it is always scourging. III <lb/>
            fortune has given you no respite, and has not left even <lb/>
            your birthday free from the bitterest grief: you lost your <lb/>
            mother as soon as you were born, nay, while you were being <lb/>
            born, and you came into life, as it were, an outcast: you grew <lb/>
            up under a step-mother, whom you made into a mother by <lb/>
            all the obedience and respect which even a real daughter <lb/>
            could have bestowed upon her: and even a good step-mother <lb/>
            costs every one dear. You lost your most affectionate uncle, <lb/>
            a brave and excellent man, just when you were awaiting <lb/>
            his return : and, lest Fortune should weaken its blows by <lb/>
            dividing them, within a month you lost your beloved <lb/>
            husband, by whom you had become the mother of three <lb/>
            children. This sorrowful news was brought you while <lb/>
            you were already in mourning, while all your children <lb/>
            were absent, so that all your misfortunes seemed to have <lb/>
            been purposely brought upon you at a time when your <lb/>
            grief could nowhere find any repose. I pass over all the <lb/>
            dangers and alarms which you have endured without any <lb/>
            respite : it was but the other day that you received the <lb/>
            bones of three of your grandchildren in the bosom from <lb/>
            which you had sent them forth: less than twenty days <lb/>
            after you had buried my child, who perished in your arms <lb/>
            and amid your kisses, you heard that I had been exiled : <lb/>
            you wanted only this drop in your cup, to have to weep for <lb/>
            those who still lived.</p><pb n="323"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> III. The last wound is, I admit, the severest that you <lb/>
            have ever yet sustained: it has not merely torn the skin, <lb/>
            but has pierced you to the very heart: yet as recruits cry <lb/>
            aloud when only slightly wounded, and shudder more at <lb/>
            the hands of the surgeon than at the sword, while veterans <lb/>
            even when transfixed allow their hurts to be dressed without <lb/>
            a groan, and as patiently as if they were in some one else's <lb/>
            body, so now you ought to offer yourself courageously to <lb/>
            be healed. Lay aside lamentations and wailings, and all <lb/>
            the usual noisy manifestations of female sorrow : you have <lb/>
            gained nothing by so many misfortunes, if you have not <lb/>
            learned how to suffer. Now, do I seem not to have spared <lb/>
            you ? nay, I have not passed over any of your sorrows, <lb/>
            but have placed them all together in a mass before you.</p>
          <p>IV. I have done this by way of a heroic remedy: for I <lb/>
            have determined to conquer this grief of yours, not merely <lb/>
            to limit it; and I shall conquer it, I believe, if in the first <lb/>
            place I can prove that I am not suffering enough to entitle <lb/>
            me to be called unhappy, let alone to justify me in rendering <lb/>
            my family unhappy: and, secondly, if I can deal with <lb/>
            your case and prove that even your misfortune, which <lb/>
            comes upon you entirely through me, is not a severe one.</p>
          <p>The point to which I shall first address myself is that of <lb/>
            which your motherly love longs to hear, I mean, that I am <lb/>
            not suffering : if I can, I will make it clear to you that the <lb/>
            events by which you think that I am overwhelmed, are not <lb/>
            unendurable : if you cannot believe this, I at any rate shall <lb/>
            be all the more pleased with myself for being happy under <lb/>
            circumstances which could make most men miserable. <lb/>
            You need not believe what others say about me : that you <lb/>
            may not be puzzled by any uncertainty as to what to think, <lb/>
            I distinctly tell you that I am not miserable : I will add, <lb/>
            for your greater comfort, that it is not possible for me to <lb/>
            be made miserable.</p>
          <p>V. We are born to a comfortable position enough, if we <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            do not afterwards lose it: the aim of Nature has been to <lb/>
            enable us to live well without needing a vast apparatus to <lb/>
            enable us to do so : every man is able by himself to make <lb/>
            himself happy. External circumstances have very little <lb/>
            importance either for good or for evil: the wise man is <lb/>
            neither elated by prosperity nor depressed by adversity; <lb/>
            for he has always endeavoured to depend chiefly upon <lb/>
            himself and to derive all his joys from himself. Do I, <lb/>
            then, call myself a wise man ? far from it: for were I able <lb/>
            to profess myself wise, I should not only say that I was <lb/>
            not unhappy, but should avow myself to be the most <lb/>
            fortunate of men, and to be raised almost to the level of a <lb/>
            god : as it is, I have applied myself to the society of wise <lb/>
            men, which suffices to lighten all sorrows, and, not being <lb/>
            as yet able to rely upon my own strength, I have betaken <lb/>
            myself for refuge to the camp of others, of those, namely, <lb/>
            who can easily defend both themselves and their friends. <lb/>
            They have ordered me always to stand as it were on guard, <lb/>
            and to mark the attacks and charges of Fortune long <lb/>
            before she delivers them ; she is only terrible to those whom <lb/>
            she catches unawares; he who is always looking out for <lb/>
            her assault, easily sustains it: for so also an invasion of <lb/>
            the enemy overthrows those by whom it is unexpected, <lb/>
            but those who have prepared themselves for the coming war <lb/>
            before it broke out, stand in their ranks fully equipped <lb/>
            and repel with ease the first, which is always the most <lb/>
            furious onset. I never have trusted in Fortune, even when <lb/>
            she seemed most peaceful. I have accepted all the gifts <lb/>
            of wealth, high office, and influence, which she has so <lb/>
            bountifully bestowed upon me, in such a manner that she <lb/>
            can take them back again without disturbing me: I have <lb/>
            kept a great distance between them and myself : and there­ <lb/>
            fore she has taken them, not painfully torn them away <lb/>
            from me. No man loses anything by the frowns of Fortune <lb/>
            unless he has been deceived by ier smiles : those who have <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI. ] </note> <lb/>
            enjoyed her bounty as though it were their own heritage <lb/>
            for ever, and who have chosen to take precedence of others <lb/>
            because of it, lie in abject sorrow when her unreal and <lb/>
            fleeting delights forsake their empty childish minds, that <lb/>
            know nothing about solid pleasure: but he who has not <lb/>
            been puffed up by success, does not collapse after failure : <lb/>
            he possesses a mind of tried constancy, superior to the <lb/>
            influences of either state; for even in the midst of pros­ <lb/>
            perity he has experimented upon his powers of enduring <lb/>
            adversity. Consequently I have always believed that there <lb/>
            was no real good in any of those things which all men <lb/>
            desire : I then found that they were empty, and merely <lb/>
            painted over with artificial and deceitful dyes, without <lb/>
            containing anything within which corresponds to their <lb/>
            outside: I now find nothing so harsh and fearful as the <lb/>
            common opinion of mankind threatened me with in this <lb/>
            which is known as adversity: the word itself, owing to the <lb/>
            prevalent belief and ideas current about it, strikes some­ <lb/>
            what unpleasantly upon one's ears, and thrills the hearers <lb/>
            as something dismal and accursed, for so bath the vulgar <lb/>
            decreed that it should be: but a great many of the decrees <lb/>
            of the vulgar are reversed by the wise.</p>
          <p>VI. Setting aside, then, the verdict of the majority, who <lb/>
            are carried away by the first appearance of things and the <lb/>
            usual opinion about them, let us consider what is meant by <lb/>
            exile: clearly a changing from one place to another. That <lb/>
            I may not seem to be narrowing its force, and taking <lb/>
            away its worst parts, I must add, that this changing of <lb/>
            place is accompanied by poverty, disgrace, and contempt. <lb/>
            Against these I will combat later on: meanwhile I wish to <lb/>
            consider what there is unpleasant in the mere act of <lb/>
            changing one's place of abode.</p>
          <p>"It is unbearable," men say, "to lose one's native land." <lb/>
            Look, I pray you, on these vast crowds, for whom all the <lb/>
            countless roofs of Rome can scarcely find shelter: the <pb n="326"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            greater part of those crowds have lost their native land: <lb/>
            they have flocked hither from their country towns and <lb/>
            colonies, and in fine from all parts of the world. Some <lb/>
            have been brought by ambition, some by the exigencies of <lb/>
            public office, some by being entrusted with embassies, some <lb/>
            by luxury which seeks a convenient spot, rich in vices, <lb/>
            for its exercise, some by their wish for a liberal education, <lb/>
            others by a wish to see the public shows. Some have been <lb/>
            led hither by friendship, some by industry, which finds here <lb/>
            a wide field for the display of its powers. Some have <lb/>
            brought their beauty for sale, some their eloquence: people <lb/>
            of every kind assemble themselves together in Rome, <lb/>
            which sets a high price both upon virtues and vices. <lb/>
            Bid them all to be summoned to answer to their names, and <lb/>
            ask each one from what home he has come : you will find <lb/>
            that the greater part of them have left their own abodes, <lb/>
            and journeyed to a city which, though great and beauteous <lb/>
            beyond all others, is nevertheless not their own. Then <lb/>
            leave this city, which may be said to be the common pro­ <lb/>
            perty of all men, and visit all other towns: there is not <lb/>
            one of them which does not contain a large proportion of <lb/>
            aliens. Pass away from those whose delightful situation <lb/>
            and convenient position attracts many settlers : examine <lb/>
            wildernesses and the most rugged islands, Sciathus and <lb/>
            Seriphus, Gyarus and Corsica: you will find no place of <lb/>
            exile where some one does not dwell for his own pleasure. <lb/>
            What can be found barer or more precipitous on every <lb/>
            side than this rock ? what more barren in respect of food? <lb/>
            what more uncouth in its inhabitants ? more mountainous <lb/>
            in its configuration ? or more rigorous in its climate ? yet <lb/>
            even here there are more strangers than natives. So far, <lb/>
            therefore, is the mere change of place from being irksome, <lb/>
            that even this place has allured some away from their <lb/>
            country. I find some writers who declare that mankind <lb/>
            has a natural itch for change of abode and alteration of <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            domicile : for the mind of man is wandering and unquiet; <lb/>
            it never stands still, but spreads itself abroad and sends <lb/>
            forth its thoughts into all regions, known or unknown; <lb/>
            being nomadic, impatient of repose, and loving novelty <lb/>
            beyond everything else. You need not be suprised at this, <lb/>
            if you reflect upon its original source: it is not formed <lb/>
            from the same elements as the heavy and earthly body, but <lb/>
            from heavenly spirit: now heavenly things are by their <lb/>
            nature always in motion, speeding along and flying with <lb/>
            the greatest swiftness. Look at the luminaries which light <lb/>
            the world: none of them stands still. The sun is perpetually <lb/>
            in motion, and passes from one quarter to another, and <lb/>
            although he revolves with the entire heaven, yet neverthe­ <lb/>
            less he has a motion in the contrary direction to that of <lb/>
            the universe itself, and passes through all the constellations <lb/>
            without remaining in any : his wandering is incessant, and <lb/>
            he never ceases to move from place to place. All things <lb/>
            continually revolve and are for ever changing; they pass <lb/>
            from one position to another in accordance with natural <lb/>
            and unalterable laws : after they have completed a certain <lb/>
            circuit in a fixed space of time, they begin again the path <lb/>
            which they had previously trodden. Be not surprised, <lb/>
            then, if the human mind, which is formed from the same <lb/>
            seeds as the heavenly bodies, delights in change and <lb/>
            wandering, since the divine nature itself either takes <lb/>
            pleasure in constant and exceeding swift motion or perhaps <lb/>
            even preserves its existence thereby.</p>
          <p>VII. Come now, turn from divine to human affairs: you <lb/>
            will see that whole tribes and nations have changed their <lb/>
            abodes. What is the meaning of Greek cities in the midst <lb/>
            of barbarous districts ? or of the Macedonian language <lb/>
            existing among the Indians and the Persians? Scythia <lb/>
            and all that region which swarms with wild and uncivilized <lb/>
            tribes boasts nevertheless Achaean cities along the shores <lb/>
            of the Black Sea. Neither the rigours of eternal winter, <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            nor the character of men as savage as their climate, has <lb/>
            prevented people migrating thither. There is a mass of <lb/>
            Athenians in Asia Minor. Miletus has sent out into various <lb/>
            parts of the world citizens enough to populate seventy-five <lb/>
            cities. That whole coast of Italy which is washed by the <lb/>
            Lower Sea is a part of what once was " Greater Greece." <lb/>
            Asia claims the Tuscans as her own: there are Tyrians <lb/>
            living in Africa, Carthaginians in Spain; Greeks have <lb/>
            pushed in among the Gauls, and Gauls among the Greeks. <lb/>
            The Pyrenees have proved no barrier to the Germans : <lb/>
            human caprice makes its way through pathless and un­ <lb/>
            known regions : men drag along with them their children, <lb/>
            their wives, and their aged and worn-out parents. Some <lb/>
            have been tossed hither and thither by long wanderings, <lb/>
            until they have become too wearied to choose an abode, <lb/>
            but have settled in whatever place was nearest to them : <lb/>
            others have made themselves masters of foreign countries <lb/>
            by force of arms: some nations while making for parts <lb/>
            unknown have been swallowed up by the sea: some have <lb/>
            established themselves in the place in which they were <lb/>
            originally stranded by utter destitution. Nor have all <lb/>
            men had the same reasons for leaving their country and <lb/>
            for seeking for a new one : some have escaped from their <lb/>
            cities when destroyed by hostile armies, and having lost <lb/>
            their own lands have been thrust upon those of others : <lb/>
            some have been cast out by domestic quarrels: some have <lb/>
            been driven forth in consequence of an excess of population, <lb/>
            in order to relieve the pressure at home: some have been <lb/>
            forced to leave by pestilence, or frequent earthquakes, or some <lb/>
            unbearable defects of a barren soil: some have been seduced <lb/>
            by the fame of a fertile and over-praised. clime. Different <lb/>
            people have been led away from their homes by different <lb/>
            causes ; but in all cases it is clear that nothing remains in <lb/>
            the same place in which it was born: the movement of the <lb/>
            human race is perpetual: in this vast world some changes <pb n="329"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            take place daily. The foundations of new cities are laid, <lb/>
            new names of nations arise, while the former ones die out, <lb/>
            or become absorbed by more powerful ones. And yet what <lb/>
            else are all these general migrations but the banishments of <lb/>
            whole peoples ? Why should I lead you through all these <lb/>
            details ? what is the use of mentioning Antenor the founder <lb/>
            of Padua, or Evander who established his kingdom of <lb/>
            Arcadian settlers on the banks of the Tiber ? or Diomedes <lb/>
            and the other heroes, both victors and vanquished, whom <lb/>
            the Trojan war scattered over lands which were not their <lb/>
            own P It is a fact that the Roman Empire itself traces its <lb/>
            origin back to an exile as its founder, who, fleeing from <lb/>
            his country after its conquest, with what few relics he had <lb/>
            saved from the wreck, had been brought to Italy by hard <lb/>
            necessity and fear of his conqueror, which bade him seek <lb/>
            distant lands. Since then, how many colonies has this <lb/>
            people sent forth into every province ? wherever the <lb/>
            Roman conquers, there he dwells. These migrations always <lb/>
            found people eager to take part in them, and veteran <lb/>
            soldiers desert their native hearths and follow the flag of <lb/>
            the colonists across the sea. The matter does not need <lb/>
            illustrations by any more examples: yet I will add one <lb/>
            more which I have before my eyes : this very island1 has <lb/>
            often changed its inhabitants. Not to mention more ancient <lb/>
            events, which have become obscure from their antiquity, <lb/>
            the Greeks who inhabit Marseilles at the present day, when <lb/>
            they left Phocaea, first settled here, and it is doubtful what <lb/>
            drove them hence, whether it was the rigour of the climate, <lb/>
            the sight of the more powerful land of Italy, or the want <lb/>
            of harbours on the coast: for the fact of their having placed <lb/>
            themselves in the midst of what were then the most savage <lb/>
            and uncouth tribes of Gaul proves that they were not <lb/>
            driven hence by the ferocity of the natives. Subsequently <note type="footnote"> 1 Corsica. </note> <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            the Ligurians came over into this same island, and also the <lb/>
            Spaniards,1 which is proved by the resemblance of their <lb/>
            customs: for they wear the same head-coverings and the <lb/>
            same sort of shoes as the Cantabrians, and some of their <lb/>
            words are the same: for by association with Greeks and <lb/>
            Ligurians they have entirely lost their native speech. <lb/>
            Hither since then have been brought two Roman colonies, <lb/>
            one by Marius, the other by Sulla : so often has the popu­ <lb/>
            lation of this barren and thorny rock been changed. In <lb/>
            fine, you will scarcely find any land which is still in the <lb/>
            hands of its original inhabitants: all peoples have become <lb/>
            confused and intermingled : one has come after another: <lb/>
            one has wished for what another scorned : some have been <lb/>
            driven out of the land which they took from another. Thus <lb/>
            fate has decreed that nothing should ever enjoy an unin­ <lb/>
            terrupted course of good fortune.</p>
          <p>VIII. Varro, that most learned of all the Romans, thought <lb/>
            that for the mere change of place, apart from the other <lb/>
            evils attendant on exile, we may find a sufficient remedy in <lb/>
            the thought that wherever we go we always have the same <lb/>
            Nature to deal with. Marcus Brutus thought that there <lb/>
            was sufficient comfort in the thought that those who go <lb/>
            into exile are permitted to carry their virtues thither with <lb/>
            them. Though one might think that neither of these alone <lb/>
            were able to console an exile, yet it must be confessed that <lb/>
            when combined they have great power: for how very little <lb/>
            it is that we lose ! whithersoever we betake ourselves two <lb/>
            most excellent things will accompany us, namely, a common <lb/>
            Nature and our own especial virtue. Believe me, this is <lb/>
            the work of whoever was the Creator of the universe, <lb/>
            whether he be an all-powerful deity, an incorporeal mind <lb/>
            which effects vast works, a divine spirit by which all things <lb/>
            from the greatest to the smallest are equally pervaded, or <note type="footnote"> 1 Seneca himself was of Spanish extraction. </note> <pb n="331"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            fate and an unalterable connected sequence of events, this, <lb/>
            I say, is its work, that nothing above the very lowest can <lb/>
            ever fall into the power of another: all that is best for a. <lb/>
            man's enjoyment lies beyond human power, and can neither <lb/>
            be bestowed or taken away : this world, the greatest and <lb/>
            the most beautiful of Nature's productions, and its noblest <lb/>
            part, a mind which can behold and admire it, are our own. <lb/>
            property, and will remain with us as long as we ourselves <lb/>
            endure. Let us therefore briskly and cheerfully hasten with <lb/>
            undaunted steps whithersoever circumstances call us: let <lb/>
            us wander over whatever countries we please ; no place <lb/>
            of banishment can be found in the whole world in which <lb/>
            man cannot find a home. I can raise my eyes from the <lb/>
            earth to the sky in one place as well as in another; the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies are everywhere equally near to mankind : <lb/>
            accordingly, as long as my eyes are not deprived of that <lb/>
            spectacle of which they never can have their fill, as long <lb/>
            as I am allowed to gaze on the sun and moon, to dwell <lb/>
            upon the other stars, to speculate upon their risings and <lb/>
            settings, their periods, and the reasons why they move <lb/>
            faster or slower, to see so many stars glittering throughout <lb/>
            the night, some fixed, some not moving in a wide orbit <lb/>
            but revolving in their own proper track, some suddenly <lb/>
            diverging from it, some dazzling our eyes by a fiery blaze <lb/>
            as though they were falling, or flying along drawing after <lb/>
            them a long trail of brilliant light: while I am permitted <lb/>
            to commune with these, and to hold intercourse, as far as <lb/>
            a human being may, with all the company of heaven, while <lb/>
            I can raise my spirit aloft to view its kindred sparks above, <lb/>
            what does it matter upon what soil I tread ?</p>
          <p>IX. "But this country does not produce beautiful or fruit- <lb/>
            bearing trees ; it is not watered by the courses of large or <lb/>
            navigable rivers; it bears nothing which other nations <lb/>
            would covet, since its produce barely suffices to support its <lb/>
            inhabitants: no precious marbles are quarried here, no veins <pb n="332"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            of gold and silver are dug out." What of that! It must be <lb/>
            a narrow mind that takes pleasure in things of the earth : <lb/>
            it ought to be turned away from them to the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of those which can be seen everywhere, which are <lb/>
            equally brilliant everywhere : we ought to reflect, also, that <lb/>
            these vulgar matters by a mistaken perversion of ideas <lb/>
            prevent really good things reaching us: the further men <lb/>
            stretch out their porticos, the higher they raise their towers, <lb/>
            the more widely they extend their streets, the deeper they <lb/>
            sink their retreats from the heats of summer, the more <lb/>
            ponderous the roofs with which they cover their banqueting <lb/>
            halls, the more there will be to obstruct their view of <lb/>
            heaven. Fortune has cast you into a country in which <lb/>
            there is no lodging more splendid than a cottage: you must <lb/>
            indeed have a poor spirit, and one which seeks low sources <lb/>
            of consolation, if you endure this bravely because you have <lb/>
            seen the cottage of Romulus: say, rather, " Should that <lb/>
            lowly barn be entered by the virtues, it will straightway <lb/>
            become more beautiful than any temple, because within it <lb/>
            will be seen justice, self-restraint, prudence, love, a right <lb/>
            division of all duties, a knowledge of all things on earth <lb/>
            and in heaven. No place can be narrow, if it contains such <lb/>
            a company of the greatest virtues ; no exile can be irksome <lb/>
            in which one can be attended by these companions. Brutus, <lb/>
            in the book which he wrote upon virtue, says that he saw <lb/>
            Marcellus in exile at Mytilene, living as happily as it is <lb/>
            permitted to man to live, and never keener in his pursuit <lb/>
            of literature than at that time. He consequently adds the <lb/>
            reflexion : ' I seemed rather to be going into exile myself <lb/>
            when I had to return without him, than to be leaving him <lb/>
            in exile.' 0 how much more fortunate was Marcellus at <lb/>
            that time, when Brutus praised him for his exile, than when <lb/>
            Rome praised him for his consulship! what a man that <lb/>
            must have been who made any one think himself exiled <lb/>
            because he was leaving him in exile! what a man that <pb n="333"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            must have been who attracted the admiration of one whom <lb/>
            even his friend Cato admired ! Brutus goes on to say:­ <lb/>
            'Gaius Caesar sailed past Mytilene without landing, because <lb/>
            he could not bear to see a fallen man.' The Senate did <lb/>
            indeed obtain his recall by public petition, being so anxious <lb/>
            and sorrowful the while, that you would have thought that <lb/>
            they all were of Brutus's mind that day, and were not <lb/>
            pleading the cause of Marcellus, but their own, that they <lb/>
            might not be sent into exile by being deprived of him : <lb/>
            yet he gained far greater glory on the day when Brutus <lb/>
            could not bear to leave him in exile, and Caesar could not <lb/>
            bear to see him: for each of them bore witness to his <lb/>
            worth: Brutus grieved, and Caesar blushed at going home <lb/>
            without Marcellus. Can you doubt that so great a man <lb/>
            as Marcellus frequently encouraged himself to endure his <lb/>
            exile patiently in some such terms as these : " The loss of <lb/>
            your country is no misery to you : you have so steeped <lb/>
            yourself in philosophic lore, as to know that all the world <lb/>
            is the wise man's country? What! was not this very man <lb/>
            who banished you absent from his country for ten suc­ <lb/>
            cessive years ? he was, no doubt, engaged in the extension <lb/>
            of the empire, but for all that he was absent from his <lb/>
            country. Now see how his presence is required in Africa, <lb/>
            which threatens to re-kindle the war, in Spain which is <lb/>
            nursing up again the strength of the broken and -shattered <lb/>
            opposite faction, in treacherous Egypt, in fine, in all the parts <lb/>
            of the world, for all are watching their opportunity to seize <lb/>
            the empire at a disadvantage. Which will he go to meet <lb/>
            first? which part of the universal conspiracy will he first <lb/>
            oppose ? His victory will drag him through every country <lb/>
            in the world. Let nations look up to him and worship him: <lb/>
            do thou live satisfied with the admiration of Brutus."</p>
          <p>X. Marcellus, then, nobly endured his exile, and his <lb/>
            change of place made no change in his mind, even though <lb/>
            it was accompanied by poverty, in which every man who <pb n="334"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            has not fallen into the madness of avarice and luxury, <lb/>
            which upset all our ideas, sees no harm. Indeed, how very <lb/>
            little is required to keep a man alive ? and who, that has <lb/>
            any virtue whatever, will find this fail him? As for myself, <lb/>
            I do not feel that I have lost my wealth, but my occupa­ <lb/>
            tion : the wants of the body are few: it wants protection <lb/>
            from the cold, and the means of allaying hunger and thirst: <lb/>
            all desires beyond these are vices, not necessities. There is <lb/>
            no need for prying into all the depths of the sea, for <lb/>
            loading one's stomach with heaps of slaughtered animals, <lb/>
            or for tearing up shell-fish 1 from the unknown shore of the <lb/>
            farthest sea : may the gods and goddesses bring ruin upon <lb/>
            those whose luxury transcends the bounds of an empire <lb/>
            which is already perilously wide. They want to have their <lb/>
            ostentatious kitchens supplied with game from the other <lb/>
            side of the Phasis, and though Rome has not yet obtained <lb/>
            satisfaction from the Parthians, they are not ashamed to <lb/>
            obtain birds from them : they bring together from all <lb/>
            regions everything, known or unknown, to tempt their <lb/>
            fastidious palate: food, which their stomach, worn out <lb/>
            with delicacies, can scarcely retain, is brought from the <lb/>
            most distant ocean : they vomit that they may eat, and eat <lb/>
            that they may vomit, and do not even deign to digest the <lb/>
            banquets which they ransack the globe to obtain. If a <lb/>
            man despises these things, what harm can poverty do him ? <lb/>
            If he desires them, then poverty even does him good, for <lb/>
            he is cured in spite of himself, and though he will not receive <lb/>
            remedies even upon compulsion, yet while he is unable to <lb/>
            fulfil his wishes he is as though he had them not. Gaius <lb/>
            Caesar, whom in my opinion Nature produced in order to <lb/>
            show what unlimited vice would be capable of when <lb/>
            combined with unlimited power, dined one day at a cost of <lb/>
            ten millions of sesterces : and though in this he had the <note type="footnote"> 1 Qu., oysters from Britain. </note> <pb n="335"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            assistance of the intelligence of all his subjects, yet he <lb/>
            could hardly find how to make one dinner out of the tribute- <lb/>
            money of three provinces. How unhappy are they whose <lb/>
            appetite can only be aroused by costly food ! and the <lb/>
            costliness of food depends not upon its delightful flavour <lb/>
            and sweetness of taste, but upon its rarity and the <lb/>
            difficulty of procuring it: otherwise, if they chose to <lb/>
            return to their sound senses, what need would they have <lb/>
            of so many arts which minister to the stomach ? of <lb/>
            so great a commerce? of such ravaging of forests? of <lb/>
            such ransacking of the depths of the sea? Food is to <lb/>
            be found everywhere, and has been placed by Nature in <lb/>
            every part the world, but they pass it by as though they <lb/>
            were blind, and wander through all countries, cross the <lb/>
            seas, and excite at a great cost the hunger which they <lb/>
            might allay at a small one. One would like to say: Why <lb/>
            do you launch ships ? why do you arm your hands for battle <lb/>
            both with men and wild beasts ? why do you run so <lb/>
            riotously hither and thither ? why do you amass fortune <lb/>
            after fortune ? Are you unwilling to remember how small <lb/>
            our bodies are ? is it not frenzy and the wildest insanity to <lb/>
            wish for so much when you can contain so little ? Though <lb/>
            you may increase your income, and extend the boundaries <lb/>
            of your property, yet you never can enlarge your own <lb/>
            bodies: when your business transactions have turned out <lb/>
            well, when you have made a successful campaign, when you <lb/>
            have collected the food for which you have hunted through <lb/>
            all lands, you will have no place in which to bestow all these <lb/>
            superfluities. Why do you strive to obtain so much ? Do <lb/>
            you think that our ancestors, whose virtue supports our <lb/>
            vices even to the present day, were unhappy, though they <lb/>
            dressed their food with their own hands, though the earth <lb/>
            was their bed, though their roofs did not yet glitter with <lb/>
            gold, nor their temples with precious stones ? and so they <lb/>
            used then to swear with scrupulous honesty by earthenware <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            gods; those who called these gods to witness would go back <lb/>
            to the enemy for certain death rather than break their word.1 <lb/>
            Do you suppose that our dictator who granted an audience <lb/>
            to the ambassadors of the Samnites, while he roasted <lb/>
            the commonest food before the fire himself with that very <lb/>
            hand with which he had so often smitten the enemy, and <lb/>
            with which he had placed his laurel wreath upon the lap <lb/>
            of Capitolian Jove, enjoyed life less than the Apicius who <lb/>
            lived in our own days, whose habits tainted the entire <lb/>
            century, who set himself up as a professor of gastronomy <lb/>
            in that very city from which philosophers once were <lb/>
            banished as corruptors of youth ? It is worth while to know <lb/>
            his end. After he had spent a hundred millions of sesterces <lb/>
            on his kitchen, and had wasted on each single banquet a <lb/>
            sum equal to so many presents from the reigning emperors, <lb/>
            and the vast revenue which he drew from the Capitol, <lb/>
            being overburdened with debt, he then for the first time was <lb/>
            forced to examine his accounts : he calculated that he would <lb/>
            have ten millions left of his fortune, and, as though he would <lb/>
            live a life of mere starvation on ten millions, put an end to <lb/>
            his life by poison. How great must the luxury of that man <lb/>
            have been, to whom ten millions signified want ? Can you <lb/>
            think after this that the amount of money necessary to make <lb/>
            a fortune depends upon its actual extent rather than on the <lb/>
            mind of the owner ? Here was a man who shuddered at <lb/>
            the thought of a fortune of ten million sesterces, and escaped <lb/>
            by poison from a prospect which other men pray for. Yet, <lb/>
            for a mind so diseased, that last draught of his was the most <lb/>
            wholesome : he was really eating and drinking poisons <lb/>
            when he was not only enjoying, but boasting of his <lb/>
            enormous banquets, when he was flaunting his vices, when <lb/>
            he was causing his country to follow his example, when he <lb/>
            was inviting youths to imitate him, albeit youth is quick <note type="footnote"> 1 The allusion is evidently to Regulus. </note> <pb n="337"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            to learn evil, without being provided with a model to copy. <lb/>
            This is what befalls those who do not use their wealth <lb/>
            according to reason, which has fixed limits, but according <lb/>
            to vicious fashion, whose caprices are boundless and im­ <lb/>
            measurable. Nothing is sufficient for covetous desire, but <lb/>
            Nature can be satisfied even with scant measure. The <lb/>
            poverty of an exile, therefore, causes no inconvenience, for <lb/>
            no place of exile is so barren as not to produce what is <lb/>
            abundantly sufficient to support a man.</p>
          <p>XI. Next, need an exile regret his former dress and <lb/>
            house ? If he only wishes for these things because of their <lb/>
            use to him, he will want neither roof nor garment, for it <lb/>
            takes as little to cover the body as it does to feed it : Nature <lb/>
            has annexed no difficult conditions to anything which man <lb/>
            is obliged to do. If, however, he sighs for a purple robe <lb/>
            steeped in floods of dye, interwoven with threads of gold <lb/>
            and with many coloured artistic embroideries, then his <lb/>
            poverty is his own fault, not that of Fortune : even though <lb/>
            you restored to him all that he has lost, you would do him <lb/>
            no good ; for he would have more unsatisfied ambitions, if <lb/>
            restored, than he had unsatisfied wants when he was an <lb/>
            exile. If he longs for furniture glittering with silver vases, <lb/>
            plate which boasts the signature of antique artists, bronze <lb/>
            which the mania of a small clique has rendered costly, <lb/>
            slaves enough to crowd however large a house, purposely <lb/>
            overfed horses, and precious stones of all countries : what­ <lb/>
            ever collections he may make of these, he never will satisfy <lb/>
            his insatiable appetite, any more than any amount of liquor <lb/>
            will quench a thirst which arises not from the need of drink <lb/>
            but from the burning heat within a man; for this is not <lb/>
            thirst but disease. Nor does this take place only with <lb/>
            regard to money and food, but every want which is caused by <lb/>
            vice and not by necessity is of this nature : however much <lb/>
            you supply it with you do not quench it but intensify it. <lb/>
            He who restrains himself within the limits prescribed by <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            nature, will not feel poverty; he who exceeds them will <lb/>
            always be poor, however great his wealth may be. Even <lb/>
            a place of exile suffices to provide one with necessaries ; <lb/>
            whole kingdoms do not suffice to provide one with super­ <lb/>
            fluities. It is the mind which makes men rich : this it is <lb/>
            that accompanies them into exile, and in the most savage <lb/>
            wildernesses, after having found sufficient sustenance for <lb/>
            the body, enjoys its own overflowing resources: the mind <lb/>
            has no more connexion with money than the immortal <lb/>
            gods have with those things which are so highly valued by <lb/>
            untutored intellects, sunk in the bondage of the flesh. <lb/>
            Gems, gold, silver, and vast polished round tables are but <lb/>
            earthly dross, which cannot be loved by a pure mind that <lb/>
            is mindful of whence it came, is unblemished by sin, and <lb/>
            which, when released from the body, will straightway soar <lb/>
            aloft to the highest heaven: meanwhile, as far as it is per­ <lb/>
            mitted by the hindrances of its mortal limbs and this heavy <lb/>
            clog of the body by which it is surrounded, it examines <lb/>
            divine things with swift and airy thought. From this it <lb/>
            follows that no free-born man, who is akin to the gods, and <lb/>
            fit for any world and any age, can ever be in exile : for his <lb/>
            thoughts are directed to all the heavens and to all times <lb/>
            past and future: this trumpery body, the prison and fetter <lb/>
            of the spirit, may be tossed to this place or to that; upon <lb/>
            it tortures, robberies, and diseases may work their will: <lb/>
            but the spirit itself is holy and eternal, and upon it no one <lb/>
            can lay hands.</p>
          <p>XII. That you may not suppose that I merely use the <lb/>
            maxims of the philosophers to disparage the evils of poverty, <lb/>
            which no one finds terrible, unless he thinks it so; consider in <lb/>
            the first place how many more poor people there are than <lb/>
            rich, and yet you will not find that they are sadder or more <lb/>
            anxious than the rich : nay, I am not sure that they are <lb/>
            not happier, because they have fewer things to distract <lb/>
            their minds. From these poor men, who often are not <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            unhappy at their poverty, let us pass to the rich. How many <lb/>
            occasions there are on which they are just like poor men! <lb/>
            When they are on a journey their baggage is cut down, <lb/>
            whenever they are obliged to travel fast their train of <lb/>
            attendants is dismissed. When they are serving in the <lb/>
            army, how small a part of their property can they have <lb/>
            with them, since camp discipline forbids superfluities! Nor <lb/>
            is it only temporary exigences or desert places that put <lb/>
            them on the same level as poor men: they have some days <lb/>
            on which they become sick of their riches, dine reclining <lb/>
            on the ground, put away all their gold and silver plate, <lb/>
            and use earthenware. Madmen! they are always afraid <lb/>
            of this for which they sometimes wish. 0 how dense a <lb/>
            stupidity, how great an ignorance of the truth they show <lb/>
            when they flee from this thing and yet amuse them­ <lb/>
            selves by playing with it! Whenever I look back to the <lb/>
            great examples of antiquity, I feel ashamed to seek conso­ <lb/>
            lation for my poverty, now that luxury has advanced so <lb/>
            far in the present age, that the allowance of an exile is <lb/>
            larger than the inheritance of the princes of old. It is <lb/>
            well known that Homer had one slave, that Plato had <lb/>
            three, and that Zeno, who first taught the stern and mas­ <lb/>
            culine doctrine of the Stoics, had none : yet could any <lb/>
            one say that they lived wretchedly without himself being <lb/>
            thought a most pitiable wretch by all men ? Menenius <lb/>
            Agrippa, by whose mediation the patricians and plebeians <lb/>
            were reconciled, was buried by public subscription. Attilius <lb/>
            Regulus, while he was engaged in scattering the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians in Africa, wrote to the Senate that his hired servant <lb/>
            had left him, and that consequently his farm was deserted : <lb/>
            whereupon it was decreed that as long as Regulus was <lb/>
            absent, it should be cultivated at the expense of the state. <lb/>
            Was it not worth his while to have no slave, if thereby he <lb/>
            obtained the Roman people for his farm-bailiff ? Scipio's <lb/>
            daughters received their dowries from the Treasury, because <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            their father had left them none: by Hercules, it was right <lb/>
            for the Roman people to pay tribute to Scipio for once, <lb/>
            since he had exacted it for ever from Carthage. 0 how <lb/>
            happy were those girls' husbands, who had the Roman <lb/>
            people for their father-in-law. Can you think that those <lb/>
            whose daughters dance in the ballet, and marry with a <lb/>
            settlement of a million sesterces, are happier than Scipio, <lb/>
            whose children received their dowry of old-fashioned brass <lb/>
            money from their guardian the Senate? Can any one <lb/>
            despise poverty, when she has such a noble descent to boast <lb/>
            of ? can an exile be angry at any privation, when Scipio <lb/>
            could not afford a portion for his daughters, Regulus could <lb/>
            not afford a hired labourer, Menenius could not afford a <lb/>
            funeral? when all these men's wants were supplied in a <lb/>
            manner which rendered them a source of additional honour ? <lb/>
            Poverty, when such men as these plead its cause, is not only <lb/>
            harmless, but positively attractive.</p>
          <p>XIII. To this one may answer: "Why do you thus <lb/>
            ingeniously divide what can indeed be endured if taken <lb/>
            singly, but which all together are overwhelming ? Change <lb/>
            of place can be borne if nothing more than one's place be <lb/>
            changed: poverty can be borne if it be without disgrace, <lb/>
            which is enough to cow our spirits by itself." If any one <lb/>
            were to endeavour to frighten me with the number of my <lb/>
            misfortunes, I should answer him as follows : If you have <lb/>
            enough, strength to resist any one part of your ill-fortune, <lb/>
            you will have enough to resist it all. If virtue has once <lb/>
            hardened your mind, it renders it impervious to blows <lb/>
            from any quarter: if avarice, that greatest pest of the <lb/>
            human race, has left it, you will not be troubled by ambi­ <lb/>
            tion : if you regard the end of your days not as a punish­ <lb/>
            ment, but as an ordinance of nature, no fear of anything <lb/>
            else will dare to enter the breast which has cast out the <lb/>
            fear of death. If you consider sexual passion to have been <lb/>
            bestowed on mankind not for the sake of pleasure, but for <pb n="341"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            the continuance of the race, all other desires will pass <lb/>
            harmlessly by one who is safe even from this secret plague, <lb/>
            implanted in our very bosoms. Reason does.not conquer <lb/>
            vices one by one, but all together: if reason is defeated, it is <lb/>
            utterly defeated once for all. Do you suppose that any wise <lb/>
            man, who relies entirely upon himself, who has set himself <lb/>
            free from the ideas of the common herd, can be wrought <lb/>
            upon by disgrace ? A disgraceful death is worse even than <lb/>
            disgrace: yet Socrates bore the same expression of coun­ <lb/>
            tenance with which he had rebuked thirty tyrants, when <lb/>
            he entered the prison and thereby took away the infamous <lb/>
            character of the place; for the place which contained <lb/>
            Socrates could not be regarded as a prison. Was any one <lb/>
            ever so blind to the truth as to suppose that Marcus Cato <lb/>
            was disgraced by his double defeat in his candidature for <lb/>
            the praetorship and the consulship? that disgrace fell on <lb/>
            the praetorship and consulship which Cato honoured <lb/>
            by his candidature. No one is despised by others un­ <lb/>
            less he be previously despised by himself: a grovelling <lb/>
            and abject mind may fall an easy prey to such con­ <lb/>
            tempt: but he who stands up against the most cruel <lb/>
            misfortunes, and overcomes those evils by which others <lb/>
            would have been crushed-such a man, I say, turns his <lb/>
            misfortunes into badges of honour, because we are so con­ <lb/>
            stituted as to admire nothing so much as a man who bears <lb/>
            adversity bravely. At Athens, when Aristides was being <lb/>
            led to execution, every one who met him cast down his <lb/>
            eyes and groaned, as though not merely a just man but <lb/>
            justice herself was being put to death. Yet one man was <lb/>
            found who spat in his face : he might have been disturbed <lb/>
            at this, since he knew it could only be a foul-mouthed <lb/>
            fellow that would have the heart to do so; he, however, <lb/>
            wiped his face, and with a smile asked the magistrate who <lb/>
            accompanied him to warn that man not to open his mouth <lb/>
            so rudely again. To act thus was to treat contumely itself <pb n="342"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            with contempt. I know that some say that there is <lb/>
            nothing more terrible than disgrace, and that they would <lb/>
            prefer death. To such men I answer that even exile is <lb/>
            often accompanied by no disgrace whatever: if a great <lb/>
            man falls, he remains a great man after his fall, you can <lb/>
            no more suppose that he is disgraced than when people <lb/>
            tread upon the walls of a ruined temple, which the pious <lb/>
            treat with as much respect as when they were standing.</p>
          <p>XIV. Since, then, my dearest mother, you have no reason <lb/>
            for endless weeping on my account, it follows that your <lb/>
            tears must flow on your own: there are two causes for this, <lb/>
            either your having lost my protection, or your not being <lb/>
            able to bear the mere fact of separation. The first of these <lb/>
            I shall only touch upon lightly, for I know that your heart <lb/>
            loves nothing belonging to your children except themselves. <lb/>
            Let other mothers look to that, who make use of their sons' <lb/>
            authority with a woman's passion, who are ambitious through <lb/>
            their sons because they cannot bear office themselves, who <lb/>
            spend their sons' inheritance, and yet are eager to inherit it, <lb/>
            and who weary their sons by lending their eloquence to <lb/>
            others: you have always rejoiced exceedingly in the successes <lb/>
            of your sons, and have made no use of them whatever: you <lb/>
            have always set bounds to our generosity, although you set <lb/>
            none to your own: you, while a minor under the power of <lb/>
            the head of the family, still used to make presents to your <lb/>
            wealthy sons : you managed our inheritances with as much <lb/>
            care as if you were working for your own, yet refrained <lb/>
            from touching them as scrupulously as if they belonged to <lb/>
            strangers : you have spared to use our influence, as though <lb/>
            you enjoyed other means of your own, and you have taken <lb/>
            no part in the public offices to which we have been elected <lb/>
            beyond rejoicing in our success and paying our expenses : <lb/>
            your indulgence has never been tainted by any thought of <lb/>
            profit, and you cannot regret the loss of your son for a reason <lb/>
            which never had any weight with you before his exile. <pb n="343"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> XV. All my powers of consolation must be directed to <lb/>
            the other point, the true source of your maternal grief. <lb/>
            You say, " I am deprived of the embraces of my darling <lb/>
            son, I cannot enjoy the pleasure of seeing him and of hearing <lb/>
            him talk. Where is he at whose sight I used to smooth <lb/>
            my troubled brow, in whose keeping I used to deposit all <lb/>
            my cares ? Where is his conversation, of which I never <lb/>
            could have enough ? his studies, in which I used to take <lb/>
            part with more than a woman's eagerness, with more than <lb/>
            a mother's familiarity? Where are our meetings? the <lb/>
            boyish delight which he always showed at the sight of his <lb/>
            mother ? " To all this you add the actual places of our <lb/>
            merrymakings and conversation, and, what must needs <lb/>
            have more power to move you than anything else, the <lb/>
            traces of our late social life, for Fortune treated you with <lb/>
            the additional cruelty of allowing you to depart on the <lb/>
            very third day before my ruin, without a trace of anxiety, <lb/>
            and not fearing anything of the kind. It was well that we <lb/>
            had been separated by a vast distance: it was well that, <lb/>
            an absence of some years had prepared you to bear this <lb/>
            blow: you came home, not to take any pleasure in your­ <lb/>
            son, but to get rid of the habit of longing for him.: Had <lb/>
            you been absent long before, you would have borne it more' <lb/>
            bravely, as the very length of your absence would have <lb/>
            moderated your longing to see me: had you never gone. <lb/>
            away, you would at any rate have gained one last advantage <lb/>
            in seeing your son for two days longer : as it was, cruel <lb/>
            Fate so arranged it that you were not present with me during <lb/>
            my good fortune, and yet have not become accustomed to <lb/>
            my absence. But the harder these things are to bear, the <lb/>
            more virtue you must summon to your aid, and the more <lb/>
            bravely you must struggle as it were with an enemy whom <lb/>
            you know well, and whom you have already often conquered: <lb/>
            This blood did not flow from a body previously unhurt: <lb/>
            you have been struck through the scar of an old wound.'</p><pb n="344"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> XVI. You have no grounds for excusing yourself on the <lb/>
            ground of being a woman, who has a sort of right to weep <lb/>
            without restraint, though not without limit. For this reason <lb/>
            our ancestors allotted a space of ten months' mourning for <lb/>
            women who had lost their husbands, thus settling the <lb/>
            violence of a woman's grief by a public ordinance. They <lb/>
            did not forbid them to mourn, but they set limits to their <lb/>
            grief : for while it is a foolish weakness to give way to <lb/>
            endless grief when you lose one of those dearest to you, <lb/>
            yet it shows an unnatural hardness of heart to express no <lb/>
            grief at all: the best middle course between affection and <lb/>
            hard common sense is both to feel regret and to restrain <lb/>
            it. You need not look at certain women whose sorrow, <lb/>
            when once begun, has been ended only by death: you <lb/>
            know some who after the loss of their sons have never <lb/>
            laid aside the garb of mourning : you are constitutionally <lb/>
            stronger than these, and from you more is required. You <lb/>
            cannot avail yourself of the excuse of being a woman, for <lb/>
            you have no womanish vices. Unchastity, the greatest <lb/>
            evil of the age, has never classed you with the majority of <lb/>
            women ; you have not been tempted either by gems or by <lb/>
            pearls; riches have not allured you into thinking them the <lb/>
            greatest blessing that man can own; respectably brought <lb/>
            up as you were in an old-fashioned and strict household, <lb/>
            you have never been led astray by that imitation of others <lb/>
            which is so full of danger even to virtuous women. You <lb/>
            have never been ashamed of your fruitfulness as though it <lb/>
            were a reproach to your youth: you never concealed the <lb/>
            signs of pregnancy as though it were an unbecoming <lb/>
            burden, nor did you ever destroy your expected child within <lb/>
            your womb after the fashion of many other women, whose <lb/>
            attractions are to be found in their beauty alone. You <lb/>
            never defiled your face with paints or cosmetics : you never <lb/>
            liked clothes which showed the figure as plainly as though <lb/>
            it were naked : your sole ornament has been a consummate <pb n="345"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            loveliness which no time can impair, your greatest glory <lb/>
            has been your modesty. You cannot, therefore, plead your <lb/>
            womanhood as an excuse for your grief, because your <lb/>
            virtues have raised you above it: you ought to be as <lb/>
            superior to womanish tears as you are to womanish vices. <lb/>
            Even women would not allow you to pine away after re­ <lb/>
            ceiving this blow, but would bid you quickly and calmly <lb/>
            go through the necessary amount of mourning, and then to <lb/>
            arise and shake it off: I mean, if you are willing to take as <lb/>
            your models those women whose eminent virtue has given <lb/>
            them a place among even great men. Misfortune reduced <lb/>
            the number of Cornelia's children from twelve to two : if <lb/>
            you count the number of their deaths, Cornelia had lost <lb/>
            ten : if you weigh them, she had lost the Gracchi : never­ <lb/>
            theless, when her friends were weeping around her and <lb/>
            using too bitter imprecations against her fate, she forbade <lb/>
            them to blame fortune for having deprived1 her of her sons <lb/>
            the Gracchi. Such ought to have been the mother of him <lb/>
            who, when speaking in the Forum, said, " Would you speak <lb/>
            evil of the mother who bore me ? " The mother's speech <lb/>
            seems to me to show a far greater spirit: the son set a high <lb/>
            value on the birth of the Gracchi; the mother set an equal <lb/>
            value on their deaths. Rutilia followed her son Cotta into <lb/>
            exile, and was so passionately attached to him that she <lb/>
            could bear exile better than absence from him ; nor did she <lb/>
            return home before her son did so: after he had been <lb/>
            restored, and had been raised to honour in the republic, <lb/>
            she bore his death as bravely as she had borne his exile. <lb/>
            No one saw any traces of tears upon her cheeks after she <lb/>
            had buried her son: she displayed her courage when he <lb/>
            was banished, her wisdom when he died: she allowed no <note type="footnote"> 1 I think Madvig'sademisset spoils the sense. Dedisset means : "when <lb/>
            you bid me mourn the loss of the Gracchi you bid me blame fortune <lb/>
            for having given me such sons." "'Tis better to have loved and lost <lb/>
            than to have never loved at all."-.J. E. B. M. </note> <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            considerations either to interfere with her affection, or to <lb/>
            force her to protract a useless and foolish mourning. These <lb/>
            are the women with whom I wish you to be numbered: <lb/>
            you have the best reasons for restraining and suppressing <lb/>
            your sorrow as they did, because you have always imitated <lb/>
            their lives.</p>
          <p>XVII. I am aware that this is a matter which is not <lb/>
            in our power, and that none of the passions, least of <lb/>
            all that which arises from grief, are obedient to our <lb/>
            wishes; indeed, it is overbearing and obstinate, and stub­ <lb/>
            bornly rejects all remedies: we sometimes wish to crush <lb/>
            it, and to swallow our emotion, but, nevertheless, tears flow <lb/>
            over our carefully arranged and made-up countenance. <lb/>
            Sometimes we occupy our minds with public spectacles <lb/>
            and shows of gladiators; but during the very sights <lb/>
            by which it is amused, the mind is wrung by slight <lb/>
            touches of sorrow. It is better, therefore, to conquer it <lb/>
            than to cheat it; for a grief which has been deceived and <lb/>
            driven away either by pleasure or by business rises again, <lb/>
            and its period of rest does but give it strength for a more <lb/>
            terrible attack; but a grief which has been conquered by <lb/>
            reason is appeased for ever. I shall not, then, give you the <lb/>
            advice which so many, I know, adopt, that you should <lb/>
            distract your thoughts by a long journey, or amuse them <lb/>
            by a beautiful one; that you should spend much of your <lb/>
            time in the careful examination of accounts, and the <lb/>
            management of your estate, and that you should keep con­ <lb/>
            stantly engaging in new enterprises : all these things avail <lb/>
            but little, and do not cure, but merely obstruct our sorrow. <lb/>
            I had rather it should be brought to an end than that it <lb/>
            should be cheated : and, therefore, I would fain lead you <lb/>
            to the study of philosophy, the true place of refuge for all <lb/>
            those who are flying from the cruelty of Fortune: this will <lb/>
            heal your wounds and take. away all your sadness: to this <lb/>
            you would now have to apply yourself, even though you <pb n="347"/>
            <note type="margin"> OR. XVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            had never done so before; but as far as my father's old- <lb/>
            fashioned strictness permitted, you have gained a super­ <lb/>
            ficial, though not a thorough knowledge of all liberal studies. <lb/>
            Would that my father, most excellent man that he was, <lb/>
            had been less devoted to the customs of our ancestors, and <lb/>
            had been willing to have you thoroughly instructed in the <lb/>
            elements of philosophy, instead of receiving a mere smat­ <lb/>
            tering of it! I should not now need to be providing you <lb/>
            with the means of struggling against Fortune, but you <lb/>
            would offer them to me: but he did not allow you to pursue <lb/>
            your studies far, because some women use literature to <lb/>
            teach them luxury instead of wisdom. Still, thanks to your <lb/>
            keen intellectual appetite, you learned more than one could <lb/>
            have expected in the time : you laid the foundations of all <lb/>
            good learning : now return to them : they will render you <lb/>
            safe, they will console you, and charm you. If once they <lb/>
            have thoroughly entered into your mind, grief, anxiety, <lb/>
            the distress of vain suffering will never gain admittance <lb/>
            thither: your breast will not be open to any of these; <lb/>
            against all other vices it has long been closed. Philosophy <lb/>
            is your most trustworthy guardian, and it alone can save <lb/>
            you from the attacks of Fortune.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Since, however, you require something to lean <lb/>
            upon until you, can reach that haven of rest which <lb/>
            philosophy offers to you, I wish in the meantime to point <lb/>
            out to you the consolations which you have. Look at my <lb/>
            two brothers-while they are safe, you have no grounds <lb/>
            for complaint against Fortune ; you can derive pleasure <lb/>
            from the virtues of each of them, different as they are; the <lb/>
            one has gained high office by attention to business, the <lb/>
            other has philosophically despised it. Rejoice in the great <lb/>
            place of one of your sons, in the peaceful retirement <lb/>
            of the other, in the filial affection of both. I know <lb/>
            my brothers' most secret motives: the one adorns his <lb/>
            high office in order to confer lustre upon you, the <pb n="348"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            other has withdrawn from the world into his life of <lb/>
            quiet and contemplation, that he may have full enjoyment <lb/>
            of your society. Fortune has consulted both your safety <lb/>
            and your pleasure in her disposal of your two sons: you <lb/>
            may be protected by the authority of the one, and delighted <lb/>
            by the literary leisure of the other. They will vie with <lb/>
            one another in dutiful affection to you, and the loss <lb/>
            of one son will be supplied by the love of two others. I <lb/>
            can confidently promise that you will find nothing wanting <lb/>
            in your sons except their number. Now, then, turn your eyes <lb/>
            from them to your grandchildren; to Marcus, that most <lb/>
            engaging child, whose sight no sorrow can withstand. No <lb/>
            grief can be so great or so fresh in any one's bosom as not <lb/>
            to be charmed away by his presence. Where are the tears <lb/>
            which his joyousness could not dry ? whose heart is so <lb/>
            nipped by sorrow that his animation would not cause it <lb/>
            to dilate ? who would not be rendered mirthful by his <lb/>
            playfulness ? who would not be attracted and made to <lb/>
            forget his gloomy thoughts by that prattle to which no one <lb/>
            can ever be weary of listening ? I pray the gods that he <lb/>
            may survive us: may all the cruelty of fate exhaust itself on <lb/>
            me and go no further; may all the sorrow destined for my <lb/>
            mother and mygrandmother fall upon me; but let all the rest <lb/>
            flourish as they do now : I shall make no complaints about <lb/>
            my childlessness or my exile, if only my sacrifice may be <lb/>
            received as a sufficient atonement, and my family suffer <lb/>
            nothing more. Hold in your bosom Novatilla, who soon <lb/>
            will present you with great-grandchildren, she whom I had <lb/>
            so entirely adopted and made my own, that, now that she has <lb/>
            lost me, she seems like an orphan, even though her father <lb/>
            is alive. Love her for my sake as well as for her own : <lb/>
            Fortune has lately deprived her of her mother: your affec­ <lb/>
            tion will be able to prevent her really feeling the loss of <lb/>
            the mother whom she mourns. Take this opportunity of <lb/>
            forming and strengthening her principles; nothing sinks <pb n="349"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            so deeply into the mind as the teaching which we receive in <lb/>
            our earliest years; let her become accustomed to hearing your <lb/>
            discourses; let her character be moulded according to your <lb/>
            pleasure : she will gain much even if you give her nothing <lb/>
            more than your example. This continually recurring duty <lb/>
            will be a remedy in itself: for when your mind is full of <lb/>
            maternal sorrow, nothing can distract it from its grief <lb/>
            except either philosophic argument or honourable work. I <lb/>
            should count your father among your greatest consolations, <lb/>
            were he not absent: as it is, judge from your affection for <lb/>
            me what his affection is for you, and then you will see how <lb/>
            much more just it is that you should be preserved for him <lb/>
            than that you should be sacrificed to me. Whenever your <lb/>
            keenest paroxysms of grief assail you and bid you give way <lb/>
            to them, think of your father. By giving him so many <lb/>
            grandchildren and great-grandchildren you have made <lb/>
            yourself no longer his only daughter.; but you alone can <lb/>
            crown his prosperous life by a happy end: as long as he is <lb/>
            alive it is impiety for you to regret having been born.</p>
          <p>XIX. I have hitherto said nothing of your chief source <lb/>
            of consolation, your sister, that most faithful heart which <lb/>
            shares all your sorrows as fully as your own, and who feels <lb/>
            for all of us like a mother. With her you have mingled <lb/>
            your tears, on her bosom you have tasted your first repose : <lb/>
            she always feels for your troubles, and when I am in the <lb/>
            case she does not grieve for you alone. It was in her arms <lb/>
            that I was carried into Rome: by her affectionate and <lb/>
            motherly nursing I regained my strength after a long <lb/>
            period of sickness : she enlarged her influence to obtain the <lb/>
            office of quaestor for me, and her fondness for me made her <lb/>
            conquer a shyness which at other times made her shrink <lb/>
            from speaking to, or loudly greeting her friends. Neither <lb/>
            her retired mode of life, nor her country-bred modesty, at <lb/>
            a time when so many women display such boldness of <lb/>
            manner, her placidity, nor her habits of solitary seclusion <pb n="350"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            prevented her from becoming actually ambitious on my <lb/>
            account. Here, my dearest mother, is a source from which <lb/>
            you may gain true consolation : join yourself, as far as you <lb/>
            are able, to her, bind yourself to her by the closest embraces. <lb/>
            Those who are in sorrow are wont to flee from those who <lb/>
            are dearest to them, and to seek liberty for the indulgence <lb/>
            of their grief : do you let her share your every thought: if <lb/>
            you wish to nurse your grief, she will be your companion, <lb/>
            if you wish to lay it aside she will bring it to an end. If, <lb/>
            however, I rightly understand the wisdom of that most <lb/>
            perfect woman, she will not suffer you to waste your life in <lb/>
            unprofitable mourning, and will tell you what happened <lb/>
            in her own instance, which I myself witnessed. During a <lb/>
            sea-voyage she lost a beloved husband, my uncle, whom <lb/>
            she married when a maiden; she endured at the same time <lb/>
            grief for him and fear for herself, and at last, though ship­ <lb/>
            wrecked, nevertheless rescued his body from the vanquished <lb/>
            tempest. How many noble deeds are unknown to fame ! <lb/>
            If only she had had the simple-minded ancients to admire <lb/>
            her virtues, how many brilliant intellects would have vied <lb/>
            with one another in singing the praises of a wife who forgot <lb/>
            the weakness of her sex, forgot the perils of the sea, which <lb/>
            terrify even the boldest, exposed herself to death in order <lb/>
            to lay him in the earth, and who was so eager to give him <lb/>
            decent burial that she cared nothing about whether she <lb/>
            shared it or no. All the poets have made the wife' famous <lb/>
            who gave herself to death instead of her husband: my aunt <lb/>
            did more when she risked her life in order to give her <lb/>
            husband a tomb : it shows greater love to endure the same <lb/>
            peril for a less important end. After this, no one need <lb/>
            wonder that for sixteen years, during which her husband <lb/>
            governed the province of Egypt, she was never beheld in <lb/>
            public, never admitted any of the natives to her house, never <note type="footnote"> 1 Alcestis. </note> <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH..XX.] </note> <lb/>
            begged any favour of her husband, and never allowed anyone <lb/>
            to beg one of her. Thus it came to pass that a gossiping <lb/>
            province, ingenious in inventing scandal about its rulers, <lb/>
            in which even the blameless often incurred disgrace, <lb/>
            respected her as a singular example of uprightness, 1 never <lb/>
            made free with her name,-a remarkable piece of self- <lb/>
            restraint among a people who will risk everything rather <lb/>
            than forego a jest,-and that at the present time it hopes <lb/>
            for another governor's wife like her, although it has no <lb/>
            reasonable expectation of ever seeing one. It would have <lb/>
            been greatly to her credit if the province had approved her <lb/>
            conduct for a space of sixteen years: it was much more <lb/>
            creditable to her that it knew not of her existence. I do <lb/>
            not remind you of this in order to celebrate her praises, for <lb/>
            to take such scanty notice of them is to curtail them, <lb/>
            but in order that you may understand the magnanimity of <lb/>
            a woman who has not yielded either to ambition or to <lb/>
            avarice, those twin attendants and scourges of authority, <lb/>
            who, when her ship was disabled and her own death was <lb/>
            impending, was not restrained by fear from keeping fast <lb/>
            hold of her husband's dead body, and who sought not how <lb/>
            to escape from the wreck, but how to carry him out of it <lb/>
            with her. You must now show a virtue equal to hers, <lb/>
            recall your mind from grief, and take care that no one <lb/>
            may think that you are sorry that you have borne a son.</p>
          <p>XX. However, since it is necessary, whatever you do, <lb/>
            that your thoughts should sometimes revert to me, and that <lb/>
            I should now be present to your mind more often than your <lb/>
            other children, not because they are less dear to you, but <lb/>
            because it is natural to lay one's hands more often upon a <lb/>
            place that pains one; learn how you are to think of me : I <lb/>
            am as joyous and cheerful as in my best days : indeed these <note type="footnote"> I The context shows that sanctitas is opposed to " rapacity," " taking <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BK. XI. </note> <lb/>
            days are my best, because my mind is relieved from all <lb/>
            pressure of business and is at leisure to attend to its <lb/>
            own affairs, and at one time amuses itself with lighter <lb/>
            studies, at another eagerly presses its inquiries into its own <lb/>
            nature and that of the universe: first it considers the <lb/>
            countries of the world and their position: then the character <lb/>
            of the sea which flows between them, and the alternate <lb/>
            ebbings and flowings of its tides ; next it investigates all <lb/>
            the terrors which hang between heaven and earth, the <lb/>
            region which is torn asunder by thunderings, lightnings, <lb/>
            gusts of wind, vapour, showers of snow and hail. Finally, <lb/>
            having traversed every one of the realms below, it soars to <lb/>
            the highest heaven, enjoys the noblest of all spectacles, that <lb/>
            of things divine, and, remembering itself to be eternal, <lb/>
            reviews all that has been and all that will be for ever and <lb/>
            ever.</p><pb n="353"/>

          <p>.... compared with ours is firm and lasting ; but if you <lb/>
            transfer it to the domain of Nature, which destroys every­ <lb/>
            thing and calls everything back to the place from whence <lb/>
            it came, it is transitory. What, indeed, have mortal hands <lb/>
            made that is not mortal ? The seven wonders of the world, <lb/>
            and any even greater wonders which the ambition of later <lb/>
            ages has constructed, will be seen some day levelled with the <lb/>
            ground. So it is : nothing lasts for ever, few things even <lb/>
            last for long : all are susceptible of decay in one way or <lb/>
            another. The ways in which things come to an end are <lb/>
            manifold, but yet everything that has a beginning has an <lb/>
            end also. Some threaten the world with death, and, <lb/>
            though you may think the thought to be impious, this <lb/>
            entire universe, containing gods and men and all their <lb/>
            works will some day be swept away and plunged a second <lb/>
            time into its original darkness and chaos. Weep, if you <lb/>
            can, after this, over the loss of any individual life ! Can <lb/>
            we mourn the ashes of Carthage, Numantia, Corinth, or <lb/>
            any city that has fallen from a high estate, when we <lb/>
            know that the world must perish, albeit it has no place <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            into which it can fall. Weep, if you can, because Fate <lb/>
            has not spared you, she who some day will dare to work so <lb/>
            great a wickedness ! Who can be so haughtily and peevishly <lb/>
            arrogant as to expect that this law of nature by which every­ <lb/>
            thing is brought to an end will be set aside in his own case, <lb/>
            and that his own house will be exempted from the ruin <lb/>
            which menaces the whole world itself ? It is, therefore, a <lb/>
            great consolation to reflect that what has happened to us <lb/>
            has happened to every one before us and will happen to <lb/>
            every one after us. In my opinion, nature has made her <lb/>
            cruellest acts affect all men alike, in order that the uni­ <lb/>
            versality of their lot might console them for its hardship.</p>
          <p>II. It will also be no small assistance to you to reflect <lb/>
            that grief can do no good either to him whom you have <lb/>
            lost or to yourself, and you would not wish to protract <lb/>
            what is useless: for if we could gain anything by sorrow, <lb/>
            I should not refuse to bestow upon your misfortunes what­ <lb/>
            ever tears my own have left at my disposal: I would <lb/>
            force some drops to flow from these eyes, exhausted as <lb/>
            they are with weeping over my own domestic afflictions, <lb/>
            were it likely to be of any service to you. Why do you <lb/>
            hesitate ? let us lament together, and I will even make <lb/>
            this quarrel my own :—" Fortune, whom every one thinks <lb/>
            most unjust, you seemed hitherto to have restrained <lb/>
            yourself from attacking one who by your favour had <lb/>
            become the object of such universal respect that-rare <lb/>
            distinction for any one-his prosperity had excited no <lb/>
            jealousy: but now, behold! you have dealt him the <lb/>
            cruellest wound which, while Caesar lives, he could receive, <lb/>
            and after reconnoitring him from all sides you have dis­ <lb/>
            covered that on this point alone he was exposed to your <lb/>
            strokes. What else indeed could you have done to him ? <lb/>
            should you take away his wealth ? he never was its slave: now <lb/>
            he has even as far as possible put it away from him, and the <lb/>
            chief thing that he has gained by his unrivalled facilities <pb n="355"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            for amassing money has been to despise it. Should you <lb/>
            take away his friends ? you knew that he was of so <lb/>
            loveable a disposition that he could easily gain others to <lb/>
            replace those whom he might lose : for of all the powerful <lb/>
            officers of the Imperial household he seems to me to be the <lb/>
            only one whom all men wish to have for their friend with­ <lb/>
            out considering how advantageous his friendship would <lb/>
            be. Should you take away his reputation ? it is so firmly <lb/>
            established, that even you could not shake it. Should you <lb/>
            take away his health? you knew that his mind was so <lb/>
            grounded on philosophical studies, in whose schools he was <lb/>
            born as well as bred, that it would rise superior to any <lb/>
            sufferings of the body. Should you take away his breath ? <lb/>
            how small an injury would that be to him ? fame promised <lb/>
            his genius one of the longest of lives: he himself has <lb/>
            taken care that his better part should remain alive,. and <lb/>
            has guarded himself against death by the composition of <lb/>
            his admirable works of eloquence: as long as literature <lb/>
            shall be held in any honour, as long as the vigour of the <lb/>
            Latin or the grace of the Greek language shall endure, he <lb/>
            will flourish together with their greatest writers, with <lb/>
            whose genius he has measured, or, if his modesty will not <lb/>
            let me say this, has connected his own. This, then, was <lb/>
            the only means you could devise of doing him a great <lb/>
            injury. The better a man is, the more frequently he is <lb/>
            wont to suffer from your indiscriminate rage, you who are <lb/>
            to be feared even when you are bestowing benefits upon <lb/>
            one. How little it would have cost you to avert this blow <lb/>
            from one upon whom your favours seemed to be conferred <lb/>
            according to some regular plan, and not to be flung at <lb/>
            random in your wonted fashion! "</p>
          <p>III. Let us add, if you please, to these grounds of com­ <lb/>
            plaint the disposition of the youth himself, cut off in the <lb/>
            midst of its first growth. He was worthy to be your <lb/>
            brother: you most certainly did not deserve to be given <pb n="356"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            any pain through your brother, even though he had been <lb/>
            unworthy. All men alike bear witness to his merits: <lb/>
            he is regretted for your sake, and is praised for his own. <lb/>
            He had no qualities which you would not be glad to <lb/>
            recognize. You would indeed have been good to a worse <lb/>
            brother, but to him your fraternal love was given all the <lb/>
            more freely because in him it found so fitting a field <lb/>
            for its exercise. No one ever was made to feel his in­ <lb/>
            fluence by receiving wrongs at his hands, he never used <lb/>
            the fact of your being his brother to threaten any one : he <lb/>
            had moulded his character after the pattern of your modesty, <lb/>
            and reflected how great a glory and how great a burden you <lb/>
            were to your family : the burden he was able to sustain; <lb/>
            but, 0 pitiless Fate, always unjust to virtue-before your <lb/>
            brother could taste the happiness of his position, he was <lb/>
            called away. I am well aware that I express my feelings <lb/>
            inadequately; for nothing is harder than to find words <lb/>
            which adequately represent great grief: still, let us again <lb/>
            lament for him, if it be of any use to do so :—" What did <lb/>
            you mean, Fortune, by being so unjust and so savage ? <lb/>
            did you so soon repent you of your favour ? What cruelty <lb/>
            it was to fall upon brothers, to break up so loving a circle <lb/>
            by so deadly an attack ; why did you bring mourning into <lb/>
            a house so plenteously stocked with admirable youths, in <lb/>
            which no brother came short of the high standard of the <lb/>
            rest, and without any cause pluck one of them away ? So, <lb/>
            then, scrupulous innocency of life, old-fashioned frugality, <lb/>
            the power of amassing vast wealth wielded with the greatest <lb/>
            self-denial, a true and imperishable love of literature, a mind <lb/>
            free from the least spot of sin, all avail nothing: Polybius <lb/>
            is in mourning, and, warned by the fate of one brother <lb/>
            what he may have to dread for the rest, he fears for the <lb/>
            very persons who soothe his grief. 0 shame ! Polybius <lb/>
            is in mourning, and mourns even though he still enjoys the <lb/>
            favour of Caesar. No doubt, Fortune, what you aimed at in <pb n="357"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            your impotent rage was to prove that no one could be pro­ <lb/>
            tected from your attacks, not even by Caesar himself."</p>
          <p>IV. We might go on blaming fate much longer, but we <lb/>
            cannot alter it: it stands harsh and inexorable: no one <lb/>
            can move it by reproaches, by tears, or by justice. Fate <lb/>
            never spares any one, never makes allowances to any one. <lb/>
            Let us, then, refrain from unprofitable tears : for our grief <lb/>
            will carry us away to join him sooner than it will bring <lb/>
            him back to us : and if it tortures us without helping us, <lb/>
            we ought to lay it aside as soon as possible, and restore the <lb/>
            tone of our minds after their indulgence in that vain solace <lb/>
            and the bitter luxury of woe : for unless reason puts an end <lb/>
            to our tears, fortune will not do so. Look around, I pray <lb/>
            you, upon all mortals: everywhere there is ample and <lb/>
            constant reason for weeping: one man is driven to daily <lb/>
            labour by toilsome poverty, another is tormented by never- <lb/>
            resting ambition, another fears the very riches that he once <lb/>
            wished for, and suffers from the granting of his own prayer : <lb/>
            one man is made wretched by loneliness, another by labour, <lb/>
            another by the crowds which always besiege his ante­ <lb/>
            chamber. This man mourns because he has children, that <lb/>
            one because he has lost them. Tears will fail us sooner <lb/>
            than causes for shedding them. Do you not see what sort <lb/>
            of a life it must be that Nature has promised to us men <lb/>
            when she makes us weep as soon as we are born ? We <lb/>
            begin life in this fashion, and all the chain of years that <lb/>
            follow it is in harmony with it. Thus we pass our lives, <lb/>
            and consequently we ought to be sparing in doing what we <lb/>
            have to do so often, and when we look back upon the mass <lb/>
            of sorrows that hangs over us, we ought, if not to end our <lb/>
            tears, at any rate to reserve them. There is nothing that <lb/>
            we ought to husband more carefully than this, which we <lb/>
            are so often obliged to expend.</p>
          <p>V. It will also be no small assistance to you to consider <lb/>
            that there is no one to whom your grief is more offensive <pb n="358"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            than he upon whom it is nominally bestowed : he either <lb/>
            does not wish you to suffer or does not understand why you <lb/>
            suffer. There is, therefore, no reason for a service which is <lb/>
            useless if it is not felt by him who is the object of it, and <lb/>
            which is displeasing to him if it is. I can boldly affirm <lb/>
            that there is no one in the whole world who derives any <lb/>
            pleasure from your tears. What then ? do you suppose <lb/>
            that your brother has a feeling against you which no one <lb/>
            else has, that he wishes you to be injured by your self­ <lb/>
            torture, that he desires to separate you from the business <lb/>
            of your life, that is, from philosophy and from Caesar ? <lb/>
            that is not likely: for he always gave way to you as a <lb/>
            brother, respected you as a parent, courted you as a <lb/>
            superior. He wishes to be fondly remembered by you, but <lb/>
            not to be a source of agony to you. Why, then, should <lb/>
            you insist upon pining away with a grief which, if the dead <lb/>
            have any feelings, your brother wishes to bring to an end ? <lb/>
            If it were any other brother about whose affection there <lb/>
            could be any question, I should put all this vaguely, and <lb/>
            say,. " If your brother wishes you to be tortured with <lb/>
            endless mourning, he does not deserve such affection : if <lb/>
            he does not wish it, dismiss the grief which affects you <lb/>
            both : an unnatural brother ought not, a good brother would <lb/>
            not wish to be so mourned for," but with one whose <lb/>
            brotherly love has been so clearly proved, we may be quite <lb/>
            sure that nothing could hurt him more than that you should <lb/>
            be hurt by his loss, that it should agonize you, that your <lb/>
            eyes, most undeserving as they are of such a fate, should <lb/>
            be by the same cause continually filled and drained of <lb/>
            never-ceasing tears.</p>
          <p>Nothing however will restrain your loving nature from <lb/>
            these useless tears so effectually as the reflexion that you <lb/>
            ought to show your brothers an example by bearing this <lb/>
            outrage of fortune bravely. You ought to imitate great <lb/>
            generals in times of disaster, when they are careful to affect <pb n="359"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            a cheerful demeanour, and conceal misfortunes by a counter­ <lb/>
            feited joyousness, lest, if the soldiers saw their leader cast <lb/>
            down, they should themselves become dispirited. This must <lb/>
            now be done by you also. Put on a countenance that does <lb/>
            not reflect your feelings, and if you possibly can, cast out <lb/>
            conceal it within you and hide it away so that it may not be <lb/>
            seen, and take care that your brothers, who will think every­ <lb/>
            thing honourable that they see you doing, imitate you in <lb/>
            this and take courage from the sight of your looks. It is <lb/>
            your duty to be both their comfort and their consoler ; but <lb/>
            you will have no power to check their grief if you humour <lb/>
            your own.</p>
          <p>VI. It may also keep you from excessive grief if you <lb/>
            remind yourself that nothing which you do can be done in <lb/>
            secret: all men agree in regarding you as an important <lb/>
            personage, and you must keep up this character : you are <lb/>
            encompassed by all that mass of offerers of consolation <lb/>
            who all are peering into your mind to learn how much <lb/>
            strength it has to resist grief, and whether you merely <lb/>
            know how to avail yourself cunningly of prosperity, or <lb/>
            whether you can also bear adversity with a manly spirit: <lb/>
            the expression of your very eyes is watched. Those who <lb/>
            are able to conceal their feelings may indulge them more <lb/>
            freely; but you are not free to have any secresy : your fortune <lb/>
            has set you in so brilliant a position, that nothing which <lb/>
            you do can be hid : all men will know how you have borne <lb/>
            this wound of yours, whether you laid down your arms at <lb/>
            the first shock or whether you stood your ground. Long <lb/>
            ago the love of Caesar raised you, and your own literary <lb/>
            pursuits brought you, to the highest rank in the state: <lb/>
            nothing vulgar, nothing mean befits you : yet what can be <lb/>
            meaner or more womanish than to make oneself a victim <lb/>
            to grief ? Although your sorrow is as great as that of your <lb/>
            brothers, yet you may not indulge it as much as they : the <lb/>
            ideas which the public have formed about your philosophic <pb n="360"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            learning and your character make many things impossible <lb/>
            for you. Men demand much, and expect much from you : <lb/>
            you ought not to have drawn all eyes upon yourself, if you <lb/>
            wished to be allowed to act as you pleased: as it is, you <lb/>
            must make good that of which you have given promise. <lb/>
            All those, who praise the works of your genius, who make <lb/>
            copies of them, who need your genius if they do not need your <lb/>
            fortune, are as guards set over your mind: you cannot, <lb/>
            therefore, ever do anything unworthy of the character of a <lb/>
            thorough philosopher and sage, without many men feeling <lb/>
            sorry that they ever admired you. You may not weep <lb/>
            beyond reason : nor is this the only thing that you may <lb/>
            not do : you may not so much as remain asleep after day­ <lb/>
            break, or retreat from the noisy troubles of public business <lb/>
            to the peaceful repose of the country, or refresh yourself <lb/>
            with a pleasure tour when wearied by constant attendance <lb/>
            to the duties of your toilsome post, or amuse yourself with <lb/>
            beholding various shows, or even arrange your day accord­ <lb/>
            ing to your own wish. Many things are forbidden to you <lb/>
            which are permitted to the poorest beggars that lie about <lb/>
            in holes and corners. A great fortune is a great slavery; <lb/>
            you may not do anything according to your wish: you <lb/>
            must give audiences to all those thousands of people, you <lb/>
            must take charge of all those petitions: you must cheer <lb/>
            yourself up, in order that all this mass of business which <lb/>
            flows hither from every part of the world may be offered in <lb/>
            due order for the consideration of our excellent emperor. <lb/>
            I repeat, you yourself are forbidden to weep, that you may <lb/>
            be able to listen to so many weeping petitioners : your own <lb/>
            tears must be dried, in order that the tears of those who <lb/>
            are in peril and who desire to obtain the gracious pardon of <lb/>
            the kindest-hearted of Caesars may be dried.</p>
          <p>VII. These reflexions will serve you as partial remedies <lb/>
            for your grief, but if you wish to forget it altogether, re­ <lb/>
            member Caesar: think with what loyalty, with what <pb n="361"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            industry you are bound to requite the favours which he has <lb/>
            shown you : you will then see that you can no more sink <lb/>
            beneath your burden than could he of whom the myths tells <lb/>
            us, he whose shoulders upheld the world. Even Caesar, <lb/>
            who may do all things, may not do many things for this <lb/>
            very reason : his watchfulness protects all men's sleep, his <lb/>
            labour guarantees their leisure, his toil ensures their <lb/>
            pleasures, his work preserves their holidays. On the day <lb/>
            on which Caesar devoted his services to the universe, he <lb/>
            lost them for himself, and like the planets which ever un­ <lb/>
            restingly pursue their course, he can never halt or attend <lb/>
            to any affair of his own. After a certain fashion this pro­ <lb/>
            hibition is imposed upon you also ; you may not consider <lb/>
            your own interests, or devote yourself to your own studies: <lb/>
            while Caesar owns the world, you cannot allow either joy or <lb/>
            grief, or anything else to occupy any part of you: you owe <lb/>
            your entire self to Caesar. Add to this that, since you <lb/>
            have always declared that Caesar was dearer to you than <lb/>
            your own life, you have no right to complain of misfortune <lb/>
            as long as Caesar is alive: while he is safe all your friends <lb/>
            are alive, you have lost nothing, your eyes ought not only <lb/>
            to be dry, but glad. In him is your all, he stands in the <lb/>
            place of all else to you : you are not grateful enough for <lb/>
            your present happy state (which God forbid that one of <lb/>
            your most wise and loyal disposition should be) if you <lb/>
            permit yourself to weep at all while Caesar is safe.</p>
          <p>VIII. I will now point out to you yet another remedy, <lb/>
            of a. more domestic, though not of a more efficacious <lb/>
            character. Your sorrow is most to be feared when you <lb/>
            have retired to your own home: for as long as your divinity <lb/>
            is before your eyes, it can find no means of access to you, <lb/>
            but Caesar will possess your entire being; when you have <lb/>
            left his presence, grief, as though it then had an opportunity <lb/>
            of attack, will lie in ambush for you in your loneliness, and <lb/>
            creep by degrees over your mind as it rests from its labours. <pb n="362"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            You ought not, therefore, to allow any moment to be un­ <lb/>
            occupied by literary pursuits : at such times let literature <lb/>
            repay to you the debt which your long and faithful love <lb/>
            has laid upon it, let it claim you for its high priest and <lb/>
            worshipper : at such times let Homer1 and Virgil be much <lb/>
            in your company, those poets to whom the human race owes <lb/>
            as much as every one owes to you, and they especially, <lb/>
            because you have made them known to a wider circle than <lb/>
            that for which they wrote. All time which you entrust to <lb/>
            their keeping will be safe. - At such times, as far as you <lb/>
            are able, compile an account of your Caesar's acts, that they <lb/>
            may be read by all future ages in a panegyric written by <lb/>
            one of his own household: for he himself will afford you <lb/>
            both the noblest subject and the noblest example for putting <lb/>
            together and composing a history. I dare not go so far as <lb/>
            to advise you to write in your usual elegant style a version <lb/>
            of iEsop's fables, a work which no Roman intellect has <lb/>
            hitherto attempted. It is hard, no doubt, for a mind which <lb/>
            has received so rude a shock to betake itself so quickly to <lb/>
            these livelier pursuits: but if it is able to pass from more <lb/>
            serious studies to these lighter ones, you must regard it as <lb/>
            a proof that it has recovered its strength, and is itself <lb/>
            again. In the former case, although it may suffer and <lb/>
            hang back, still it will be led on by the serious nature of <lb/>
            the subject under consideration to take an interest in it : <lb/>
            but, unless it has thoroughly recovered, it will not endure <lb/>
            to treat of subjects which must be written of in a cheerful <lb/>
            spirit. You ought, therefore, first toexercise your mind <lb/>
            upon grave studies, and then to enliven it with gayer ones. <note type="footnote"> 1 " The Latins had four versions of Homer (Fabric, torn. i. 1. ii. ch. 3, <lb/>
            p. 297), yet, in spite of the phraises of Seneca, Consol, ch. 26 (viii.), they <lb/>

            Greek poets."-Gibbon's "Decline and Fall," ch. 41, ad init., note. <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> IX. It will also be a great solace to you if you often ask <lb/>
            yourself : " Am I grieving on my own account or on that <lb/>
            of him who is gone ? if on my own, I have no right to <lb/>
            boast of my affectionate sensibility; grief is only excusable <lb/>
            as long as it is honourable ; but when it is only caused by <lb/>
            personal interests, it no longer springs from tenderness : <lb/>
            nothing can be less becoming to a good man than to make <lb/>
            a calculation about his grief for his brother. If I grieve on <lb/>
            his account, I must necessarily take one of the two following <lb/>
            views : if the dead retain no feeling whatever, my brother <lb/>
            has escaped from all the troubles of life, has been restored <lb/>
            to the place which he occupied before his birth, and, <lb/>
            being free from every kind of ill, can neither fear, nor <lb/>
            desire, nor suffer: what madness then for me never to <lb/>
            cease grieving for one who will never grieve again ? If <lb/>
            the dead have any feeling, then my brother is now like one <lb/>
            who has been let out of a prison in which he has long been <lb/>
            confined, who at last is free and his own master, and who <lb/>
            enjoys himself, amuses himself with viewing the works of <lb/>
            Nature, and looks down from above the earth upon all <lb/>
            human things, while he looks at things divine, whose <lb/>
            meaning he has long sought in vain, from a much nearer <lb/>
            standpoint. Why then am I wasting away with grief for <lb/>
            one who is either in bliss or non-existent ? it would be <lb/>
            envy to weep for one who is in bliss, it would be madness <lb/>
            to weep for one who has no existence whatever." Are you <lb/>
            affected by the thought that he appears to have been de­ <lb/>
            prived of great blessings just at the moment when they came <lb/>
            crowding upon him ? after thinking how much he has lost, <lb/>
            call to mind how much more he has ceased to fear : anger <lb/>
            will never more wring his heart, disease will not crush him, <lb/>
            suspicion will not disquiet him, the gnawing pain of envy <lb/>
            which we feel at the successes of others will not attend <lb/>
            him, terror will not make him wretched, the fickleness of <lb/>
            fortune who quickly transfers her favours from one man <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            to another will not alarm him. If you reckon it up pro­ <lb/>
            perly, he has been spared more than he has lost. He will <lb/>
            not enjoy wealth, or your influence at Court, or his own : <lb/>
            he will not receive benefits, and will not confer them : do <lb/>
            you imagine him to be unhappy, because he has lost these <lb/>
            things, or happy because he does not miss them P Believe <lb/>
            me, he who does not need good fortune is happier than he <lb/>
            on whom it attends: all those good things which charm <lb/>
            us by the attractive but unreal pleasures which they afford, <lb/>
            such as money, high office, influence, and many other <lb/>
            things which dazzle the stupid greed of mankind, require <lb/>
            hard labour to keep, are regarded by others with bitter <lb/>
            jealousy, and are more of a menace than an advantage to <lb/>
            those who are bedecked and encumbered by them. They <lb/>
            are slippery and uncertain; one never can enjoy them in <lb/>
            comfort; for, even setting aside anxiety about the future, <lb/>
            the present management of great prosperity is an uneasy <lb/>
            task. If we are to believe some profound seekers after <lb/>
            truth, life is all torment: we are flung, as it were, into <lb/>
            this deep and rough sea, whose tides ebb and flow, at one <lb/>
            time raising us aloft by sudden accessions of fortune, at <lb/>
            another bringing down low by still greater losses, and <lb/>
            for ever tossing us about, never letting us rest on firm <lb/>
            ground. We roll and plunge upon the waves, and some­ <lb/>
            times strike against one another, sometimes are ship­ <lb/>
            wrecked, always are in terror. For those who sail upon <lb/>
            this stormy sea, exposed as it is to every gale, there is no <lb/>
            harbour save death. Do not, then, grudge your brother <lb/>
            his rest: he has at last become free, safe, and immortal: <lb/>
            he leaves surviving him Caesar and all his family, yourself, <lb/>
            and his and your brothers. He left Fortune before she <lb/>
            had ceased to regard him with favour, while she stood still <lb/>
            by him, offering him gifts with a full hand. He now <lb/>
            ranges free and joyous through the boundless heavens ; he <lb/>
            has left this poor and low-lying region, and has soared <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            upwards to that place, whatever it may be, which receives <lb/>
            in its happy bosom the souls which have been set free from <lb/>
            the chains of matter: he'now roams there at liberty, and <lb/>
            enjoys with the keenest delight all the blessings of Nature. <lb/>
            You are mistaken! your brother has not lost the light of <lb/>
            day, but has obtained a more enduring light: whither he <lb/>
            has gone, we all alike must go : why then do we weep for <lb/>
            his fate ? He has not left us, but has gone on before us. <lb/>
            Believe me, there is great happiness in a happy death. We <lb/>
            cannot be sure of anything even for one whole day : since <lb/>
            the truth is so dark and hard to come at, who can tell <lb/>
            whether death came to your brother out of malice or out of <lb/>
            kindness ?</p>
          <p>X. One who is as just in all things as you are, must find <lb/>
            comfort in the thought that no wrong has been done you <lb/>
            by the loss of so noble a brother, but that you have received <lb/>
            a benefit by having been permitted for so long a time to <lb/>
            'enjoy his affection. He who will not allow his benefactor <lb/>
            to choose his own way of bestowing a gift upon him, is <lb/>
            unjust: he who does not reckon what he receives as gain, <lb/>
            and yet reckons what be gives back again as loss, is greedy: <lb/>
            he who says that he has been wronged, because his pleasure <lb/>
            has come to an end, is ungrateful: he who thinks that we <lb/>
            gain nothing from good things beyond the present enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of them, is a fool, because he finds no pleasure in <lb/>
            past joys, and does not regard those which are gone as his <lb/>
            most certain possessions, since he need not fear that they <lb/>
            will come to an end. A man limits his pleasures too nar­ <lb/>
            rowly if he believes that he enjoys those things only which <lb/>
            he touches and sees, if he counts the having enjoyed them <lb/>
            for nothing : for all pleasure quickly leaves us, seeing that <lb/>
            it flows away, flits across our lives, and is gone almost <lb/>
            before it has come. We ought, therefore, to make our <lb/>
            mind travel back over past time, to bring back whatever we <lb/>
            once took pleasure in, and frequently to ruminate over it <pb n="366"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            in our thoughts : the remembrance of pleasures is truer and <lb/>
            more trustworthy than their reality. Regard it, then, among <lb/>
            your greatest blessings that you have had an excellent <lb/>
            brother : you need not think for how much longer you <lb/>
            might have had him, but for how long you did have him. <lb/>
            Nature gave him to you, as she gives others to other brothers, <lb/>
            not as an absolute property, but as a loan : afterwards <lb/>
            when she thought proper she took him back again, and <lb/>
            followed her own rules of action, instead of waiting until <lb/>
            you had indulged your love to satiety. If any one were to <lb/>
            be indignant at having to repay a loan of money, especially <lb/>
            if he had been allowed to use it without having to pay any <lb/>
            interest, would he not be thought an unreasonable man ? <lb/>
            Nature gave your brother his life, just as she gave you <lb/>
            yours: exercising her lawful rights, she has chosen to ask <lb/>
            one of you to repay her loan before the other: she cannot <lb/>
            be blamed for this, for you knew the conditions on which <lb/>
            you received it: you must blame the greedy hopes of <lb/>
            mortal men's minds, which every now and then forget <lb/>
            what Nature is, and never remember their own lot unless <lb/>
            reminded of it. Rejoice, then, that you have had so good <lb/>
            a brother, and be grateful for having had the use and en­ <lb/>
            joyment of him, though it was for a shorter time than you <lb/>
            wished. Reflect that what you have bad of him was most <lb/>
            delightful, that your having lost him is an accident com­ <lb/>
            mon to mankind. There is nothing more inconsistent <lb/>
            than that a man should grieve that so good a brother was <lb/>
            not long enough with him, and should not rejoice that he <lb/>
            nevertheless has been with him.</p>
          <p>XI. " But," you say, "he was taken away unexpectedly." <lb/>
            Every man is deceived by his own willingness to believe <lb/>
            what he wishes, and he chooses to forget that those whom <lb/>
            he loves are mortal: yet Nature gives us clear proofs that <lb/>
            she will not suspend her laws in favour of any one: the <lb/>
            funeral processions of our friends and of strangers alike <pb n="367"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            pass daily before our eyes, yet we take no notice of them, <lb/>
            and when an event happens which our whole life warns us <lb/>
            will some day happen, we call it sudden. This is not, <lb/>
            therefore, the injustice of fate, but the perversity and in­ <lb/>
            satiable universal greediness of the human mind, which is <lb/>
            indignant at having to leave a place to which it was only <lb/>
            admitted on sufferance. How far more righteous was he <lb/>
            who, on hearing of the death of his son, made a speech <lb/>
            worthy of a great man, saying: " When I begat him, I <lb/>
            knew that he would die some day." Indeed, you need not <lb/>
            be surprised at the son of such a man being able to die <lb/>
            bravely. He did not receive the tidings of his son's death <lb/>
            as news : for what is there new in a man's dying, when <lb/>
            his whole life is merely a journey towards death ? "When <lb/>
            I begat him, I knew that he would die some day," said he : <lb/>
            and then he added, what showed even more wisdom and <lb/>
            courage, " It was for this that I brought him up." It is <lb/>
            for this that we have all been brought up : every one who <lb/>
            is brought into life is intended to die. Let us enjoy what <lb/>
            is given to us, and give it back when it is asked for : the <lb/>
            Fates lay their hands on some men at some times, and on <lb/>
            other men at other times, but they will never pass any one <lb/>
            by altogether. Our mind ought always to be on the alert, <lb/>
            and while it ought never to fear what is certain to happen, <lb/>
            it ought always to be ready for what may happen at any <lb/>
            time. Why need I tell you of generals and the children <lb/>
            of generals, of men ennobled by many consulships and <lb/>
            triumphs, who have succumbed to pitiless fate ? whole <lb/>
            kingdoms together with their kings, whole nations with all <lb/>
            their component tribes, have all submitted to their doom. <lb/>
            All men, nay, all things look forward to an end of their <lb/>
            days : yet all do not come to the same end : one man loses <lb/>
            his life in the midst of his career, another at the very <lb/>
            beginning of it, another seems hardly able to free himself <lb/>
            from it when worn out with extreme old age, and eager to <pb n="368"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            be released : we are all going to the same place, but we <lb/>
            all go thither at different times. I know not whether it is <lb/>
            more foolish not to know the law of mortality, or more pre­ <lb/>
            sumptuous to refuse to obey it. Come, take into your <lb/>
            hands the poems1 of whichever you please of those two <lb/>
            authors upon whom your genius has expended so much <lb/>
            labour, whom you have so well paraphrased, that although <lb/>
            the structure of the verse be removed, its charm neverthe­ <lb/>
            less is preserved ; for you have transferred them from one <lb/>
            language to another so well as to effect the most difficult <lb/>
            matter of all, that of making all the beauties of the original <lb/>
            reappear in a foreign speech : among their works you will <lb/>
            find no volume which will not offer you numberless <lb/>
            instances of the vicissitudes of human life, of the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty of events, and of tears shed for various reasons. <lb/>
            Read with what fire you have thundered out their swelling <lb/>
            phrases: you will feel ashamed of suddenly failing and falling <lb/>
            short of the elevation of their magnificent language. Do <lb/>
            not commit the fault of making every one, who according to <lb/>
            his ability admires your writings, ask how so frail a mind <lb/>
            can have formed such stable and well-connected ideas.</p>
          <p>XII. Turn yourself away from these thoughts which <lb/>
            torment you, and look rather at those numerous and <lb/>
            powerful sources of consolation which you possess: look at <lb/>
            your excellent brothers, look at your wife and your son. It is <lb/>
            to guarantee the safety of all these that Fortune2 has struck <lb/>
            you in this this quarter: you have many left in whom you can <lb/>
            take oomfort. Guard yourself from the shame of letting all <lb/>
            men think that a single grief has more power with you than <lb/>
            these many consolations. You see all of them cast down into <lb/>
            the same despondency as yourself, and you know that they <lb/>
            cannot help you, nay, that on the other hand they look to <note type="footnote"> 1 See note ante, ch. viii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Fortune hath parted stakes with thee, in taking away thy brother, <lb/>
            and leaving thee all the rest in securitie and safetie."—LODGE. </note> <pb n="369"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            you to encourage them : wherefore, the less learning and <lb/>
            the less intellect they possess, the more vigorously you <lb/>
            ought to withstand the evil which has fallen upon you all. <lb/>
            The very fact of one's grief being shared by many persons <lb/>
            acts as a consolation, because if it be distributed among <lb/>
            such a number the share of it which falls upon you must <lb/>
            be small. I shall never cease to recall your thoughts to <lb/>
            Caesar. While he governs the earth, and shows how far <lb/>
            better the empire may be maintained by kindnesses than <lb/>
            by arms, while he presides over the affairs of mankind, <lb/>
            there is no danger of your feeling that you have lost any­ <lb/>
            thing : in this fact alone you will find ample help and <lb/>
            ample consolation; raise yourself up, and fix your eyes <lb/>
            upon Caesar whenever tears rise to them; they will become <lb/>
            dry on beholding that greatest and most brilliant light ; <lb/>
            his splendour will attract them and firmly attach them to <lb/>
            himself, so that they are able to see nothing else. He whom <lb/>
            you behold both by day and by night, from whom your <lb/>
            mind never deviates to meaner matters, must occupy your <lb/>
            thoughts and be your defence against Fortune; indeed, so <lb/>
            kind and gracious as he is towards all his followers that he <lb/>
            has already, I doubt not, laid many healing balms upon <lb/>
            this wound of yours, and furnished you with many antidotes <lb/>
            for your sorrow. Why, even had he done nothing of the <lb/>
            kind, is not the mere sight and thought of Caesar in itself <lb/>
            your greatest consolation ? May the gods and goddesses <lb/>
            long spare him to the earth : may he rival the deeds of the <lb/>
            Emperor Augustus, and surpass him in length of days ! as <lb/>
            long as he remains among mortals, may he never be re­ <lb/>
            minded that any of his house are mortal: may he train up <lb/>
            his son by long and faithful service to be the ruler of the <lb/>
            Roman people, and see him share his father's power before <lb/>
            he succeeds to it: may the day on which his kindred shall <lb/>
            claim him for heaven be far distant, and may our grand­ <lb/>
            children alone be alive to see it. <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <pb n="370"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> XIII. Fortune, refrain your hands from him, and show <lb/>
            your power over him only in doing him good: allow him <lb/>
            to heal the long sickness from which mankind has suffered; <lb/>
            to replace and restore whatever has been shattered by the <lb/>
            frenzy of our late sovereign : may this star, which has shed <lb/>
            its rays upon a world overthrown and cast into darkness, <lb/>
            ever shine brightly : may he give peace to Germany, open <lb/>
            Britain to us, and lead through the city triumphs, both <lb/>
            over the nations whom his fathers conquered, and over <lb/>
            new ones. Of these his clemency, the first of his many <lb/>
            virtues, gives me hopes of being a spectator: for he has <lb/>
            not so utterly cast me down that he will never raise me up <lb/>
            again; nay, he has not cast me down at all; rather he has <lb/>
            supported me when I was struck by evil fortune and was <lb/>
            tottering, and has gently used his godlike hand to break <lb/>
            my headlong fall: he pleaded with the Senate on my behalf, <lb/>
            and not only gave me my life but even begged it for me. <lb/>
            He will see to my cause : let him judge my cause to be such <lb/>
            as he would desire; let his justice pronounce it good or his <lb/>
            clemency so regard it: his kindness to me will be equal in <lb/>
            either case, whether he knows me to be innocent or chooses <lb/>
            that I should be thought so. Meanwhile it is a great comfort <lb/>
            to me for my own miseries to behold his pardons travelling <lb/>
            throughout the world: even from the corner in which I am <lb/>
            Confined his mercy has unearthed and restored to light <lb/>
            many exiles who had been buried and forgotten here for <lb/>
            long years, and I have no fear that I alone shall be passed <lb/>
            over by it. He best knows the time at which he ought to <lb/>
            show favour to each man : I will use my utmost efforts to <lb/>
            prevent his having to blush when he comes to me. 0 how <lb/>
            blessed is your clemency, Caesar, which makes exiles live <lb/>
            more peacefully during your reign than princes did in that <lb/>
            of Gaius ! We do not tremble or expect the fatal stroke <lb/>
            every hour, nor are we terrified whenever a ship comes in <lb/>
            sight: you have set bounds to the cruelty of Fortune towards <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            us, and have given us present peace and hopes of a happier <lb/>
            future. You may indeed be sure that those thunderbolts <lb/>
            alone are just which are worshipped even by those who are <lb/>
            struck by them.</p>
          <p>XIV. Thus this prince, who is the universal consoler of all <lb/>
            men, has, unless I am altogether mistaken, already revived <lb/>
            your spirit and applied more powerful remedies to so severe <lb/>
            a wound than I can : he has already strengthened you in <lb/>
            every way: his singularly retentive memory has already <lb/>
            furnished you with all the examples which will produce <lb/>
            tranquillity : his practised eloquence has already displayed <lb/>
            before you all the precepts of sages. No one therefore <lb/>
            could console you as well as he: when he speaks his words <lb/>
            have greater weight, as though they were the utterances of <lb/>
            an oracle: his divine authority will crush all the strength <lb/>
            of your grief. Think, then, that he speaks to you as fol­ <lb/>
            lows :-" Fortune has not chosen you as the only man in <lb/>
            the world to receive so severe a blow : there is no house in <lb/>
            all the earth, and never has been one, that has not something <lb/>
            to mourn for : I will pass over examples taken from the <lb/>
            common herd, which, while they are of less importance, are <lb/>
            also endless in number, and I will direct your attention to <lb/>
            the Calendar and the State Chronicles. Do you see all <lb/>
            these images which fill the hall of the Caesars ? there is <lb/>
            not one of these men who was not especially afflicted by <lb/>
            domestic sorrows : no one of those men who shine there as <lb/>
            the ornament of the ages was not either tortured by grief <lb/>
            for some of his family or most bitterly mourned for by <lb/>
            those whom he left behind. Why need I remind you of <lb/>
            Scipio Africanus, who heard the news of his brother's <lb/>
            death when he was himself in exile ? he who saved his <lb/>
            brother from prison could not save him from his fate. <lb/>
            Yet all men saw how impatient Africanus's brotherly <lb/>
            affection was even of equal law: on the same day on <lb/>
            which Scipio Africanus rescued his brother from the <pb n="372"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            hands of the apparitor, he, although not holding any <lb/>
            office, protested against the action of the tribune of the <lb/>
            people. He mourned for his brother as magnanimously <lb/>
            as he had defended him. Why need I remind you of Scipio <lb/>
            Æmilianus,1 who almost at one and the same time beheld <lb/>
            his father's triumph and the funeral of his two brothers ? <lb/>
            yet, although a stripling and hardly more than a boy, he <lb/>
            bore the sudden bereavement which betel his family at the <lb/>
            very time of Paulus's triumph with all the courage which <lb/>
            beseemed one who was born that Rome might not be with­ <lb/>
            out a Scipio and that she might be without a Carthage.</p>
          <p>XV. Why should I speak of the intimacy of the two <lb/>
            Luculli, which was broken only by their death ? or of the <lb/>
            Pompeii ? whom the cruelty of Fortune did not even allow <lb/>
            to perish by the same catastrophe ; for Sextus Pompeius in <lb/>
            the first place survived his sister,2 by whose death the firmly <lb/>
            knit bond of peace in the Roman empire was broken, and <lb/>
            he also survived his noble brother, whom Fortune had raised <lb/>
            so high in order that she might cast him down from as great <lb/>
            a height as she had already cast down his father; yet after <lb/>
            this great misfortune Sextus Pompeius was able not only <lb/>
            to endure his grief but even to make war. Innumerable <lb/>
            instances occur to me of brothers who were separated by <lb/>
            death: indeed on the other hand we see very few pairs of <lb/>
            brothers growing old together: however, I shall content <lb/>
            myself with examples from my own family. No one can <lb/>
            be so devoid of feeling or of reason as to complain of <lb/>
            Fortune's having thrown him into mourning when he <lb/>
            learns that she has coveted the tears of the Caesars them­ <lb/>
            selves. The Emperor Augustus lost his darling sister <lb/>
            Octavia, and though Nature destined him for heaven, yet <lb/>
            she did not relax her laws to spare him from mourning <lb/>
            while on earth: nay, he suffered every kind of bereave- <note type="footnote"> 1 See " On Benefits," v. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> a Scipio Africanus minor, the son of Paulus Æmilius. </note> <pb n="373"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            ment, losing his sister's son, 1 who was intended to be his <lb/>
            heir. In fine, not to mention his sorrows in detail, he lost <lb/>
            his son-in-law, his children, and his grandchildren, and, <lb/>
            while he remained among men, no mortal was more often <lb/>
            reminded that he was a man. Yet his mind, which was <lb/>
            able to bear all things, bore all these heavy sorrows, and <lb/>
            the blessed Augustus was the conqueror, not only of foreign <lb/>
            nations, but also of his own sorrows. Gaius Caesar,2 the <lb/>
            grandson of the blessed Augustus, my maternal great uncle, <lb/>
            in the first years of manhood, when Prince of the Roman <lb/>
            Youth, as he was preparing for the Parthian war, lost his <lb/>
            darling brother Lucius3 who was also ' Prince of the <lb/>
            Roman Youth,' and suffered more thereby in his mind <lb/>
            than he did afterwards in his body, though he bore both <lb/>
            afflictions with the greatest piety and fortitude. Tiberius <lb/>
            Caesar, my paternal uncle, lost his younger brother Drusus <lb/>
            Germanicus,4 my father, when he was opening out the <lb/>
            innermost fastnesses of Germany, and bringing the fiercest <lb/>
            tribes under the dominion of the Roman empire; he em­ <lb/>
            braced him and received his last kiss, but he nevertheless <lb/>
            restrained not only his own grief but that of others, and <lb/>
            when the whole army, not merely sorrowful but heart- <lb/>
            broken, claimed the corpse of their Drusus for themselves, <lb/>
            he made them grieve only as it became Romans to grieve, <note type="footnote"> 1 Marcellus. See Virgil's well-known lines, Æn. VI., 869, sqq., and <lb/>

            have checked the tears of others had he not first repressed <lb/>
            his own.</p>
          <p>XVI. " Marcus Antonius, my grandfather, who was <lb/>
            second to none save his conqueror, received the news of his <lb/>
            brother's execution at the very time when the state was at <lb/>
            his disposal, and when, as a member of the triumvirate, he <lb/>
            saw no one in the world superior to himself in power, nay, <lb/>
            when, with the exception of his two colleagues, every man <lb/>
            was subordinate to himself. 0 wanton Fortune, what <lb/>
            sport you make for yourself out of human sorrows! At <lb/>
            the very time when Marcus Antonius was enthroned with <lb/>
            power of life and death over his countrymen, Marcus <lb/>
            Antonius's brother was being led to his death: yet <lb/>
            Antonius bore this cruel wound with the same greatness <lb/>
            of mind with which he had endured all his other crosses; <lb/>
            and he mourned for his brother by offering the blood of <lb/>
            twenty legions to his manes. However, to pass by all other <lb/>
            instances, not to speak of the other deaths which have <lb/>
            occurred in my own house, Fortune has twice assailed me <lb/>
            through the death of a brother; she has twice learned that <lb/>
            she could wound me but could not overthrow me. I lost <lb/>
            my brother Germanicus, whom I loved in a manner which <lb/>
            any one will understand if he thinks how affectionate <lb/>
            brothers love one another; yet I so restrained my passion <lb/>
            of grief as neither to leave undone anything which a good <lb/>
            brother could be called upon to do, nor yet to do anything <lb/>
            which a sovereign could be blamed for doing."</p>
          <p>Think, then, that our common parent quotes these <lb/>
            instances to you, and that he points out to you how <lb/>
            nothing is respected or held inviolable by Fortune, who <lb/>
            actually dares to send out funeral processions from the <lb/>
            very house in which she will have to look for gods : so let <lb/>
            no one be surprised at her committing any act of cruelty <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            or injustice; for how could she show any humanity or <lb/>
            moderation in her dealings with private families, when <lb/>
            her pitiless fury has so often hung the very throne1 itself <lb/>
            with black ? She will not change her habits even though <lb/>
            reproached, not by my voice alone, but by that of the entire <lb/>
            nation : she will hold on her course in spite of all prayers <lb/>
            and complaints. Such has Fortune always been, and <lb/>
            such she ever will be in connexion with human affairs : <lb/>
            she has never shrunk from attacking anything, and she <lb/>
            will never let anything alone: she will rage everywhere <lb/>
            terribly, as she has always been wont to do: she will dare <lb/>
            to enter for evil purposes into those houses whose entrance <lb/>
            lies through the temples of the gods, and will hang signs <lb/>
            of mourning upon laurelled door-posts. However, if she has <lb/>
            not yet determined to destroy the human race: if she still <lb/>
            looks with favour upon the Roman nation, may our public <lb/>
            and private prayers prevail upon her to regard as sacred <lb/>
            from her violence this prince, whom all men think to be <lb/>
            sacred, who has been granted them by heaven to give them <lb/>
            rest after their misfortunes: let her learn clemency from <lb/>
            him, and let the mildest of all sovereigns teach her <lb/>
            mildness.</p>
          <p>XVII. You ought, therefore, to fix your eyes upon all <lb/>
            the persons whom I have just mentioned, who have either <lb/>
            been deified or were nearly related to those who have been <lb/>
            deified, and when Fortune lays her hands upon you to bear <lb/>
            it calmly, seeing that she does not even respect those by <lb/>
            whose names we swear. It is your duty to imitate their <lb/>
            constancy in enduring and triumphing over suffering, as <lb/>
            far as it is permitted to a mere man to follow in the footsteps <lb/>
            of the immortals. Albeit in all other matters rank and <lb/>
            birth make great distinctions between men, yet virtue is <lb/>
            open to all; she despises no one provided he thinks himself <note type="footnote"> I Pulvinaria. See note, ch. xvii. </note> <pb n="376"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            worthy* to possess her. Surely you cannot do better than <lb/>
            follow the example of those who, though they might have <lb/>
            been angry at not being exempt from this evil, nevertheless <lb/>
            have decided to regard this, the only thing which brings <lb/>
            them down to the level of other men, not as a wrong done <lb/>
            to themselves, but as the law of our mortal nature, and to <lb/>
            bear what befals them without undue bitterness and wrath, <lb/>
            and yet in no base or cowardly spirit: for it is not human <lb/>
            not to feel our sorrows, while it is unmanly not to bear <lb/>
            them. When I glance through the roll of all the Caesars <lb/>
            whom fate has bereaved of sisters or brothers, I cannot <lb/>
            pass over that one who is unworthy to figure on the list of <lb/>
            Caesars, whom Nature produced to be the ruin and the <lb/>
            shame of the human race, who utterly wrecked and destroyed <lb/>
            the state which is now recovering under the gentle rule of <lb/>
            the most benign of princes. On losing his sister Drusilla, <lb/>
            Gaius Caesar, a man who could neither mourn nor rejoice <lb/>
            ,as becomes a prince, shrank from seeing and speaking to <lb/>
            his countrymen, was not present at his sister's funeral, did <lb/>
            not pay her the conventional tribute of respect, but tried <lb/>
            to forget the sorrows caused by this most distressing death <lb/>
            by playing at dice in his Alban villa, and by sitting on <lb/>
            the judgment-seat, and the like customary engagements. <lb/>
            What a disgrace to the Empire! a Roman emperor <lb/>
            solaced himself by gambling for his grief at the loss of <lb/>
            his sister! This same Gaius, with frantic levity, at <lb/>
            one time let his beard and hair grow long, at another <lb/>
            wandered aimlessly along the coast of Italy and Sicily. <lb/>
            He never clearly made up his mind whether he wished his <lb/>
            sister to be mourned for or to be worshipped, and during <lb/>
            all the time that he was raising temples and shrines 1 in <lb/>
            her honour he punished those who did not manifest sum- <note type="footnote"> 1 Pulvinaria. This word properly means " a conch made of cushions, <lb/>
            and spread over with a splendid covering, for the gods or persons who <lb/>
            received divine honours." </note> <pb n="377"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            dent sorrow with the most cruel tortures:1 for his mind <lb/>
            was so ill-balanced, that he was as much cast down by <lb/>
            adversity as he was unbecomingly elated and puffed up by <lb/>
            success. Far be it from every Roman to follow such an <lb/>
            example, either to divert his mind from his grief by un­ <lb/>
            reasonable amusements, to stimulate it by unseemly squalor <lb/>
            and neglect, or to be so inhuman as to console himself by <lb/>
            taking pleasure in the sufferings of others.</p>
          <p>XVIII. You, however, need change none of your ordinary <lb/>
            habits, since you have taught yourself to love those studies <lb/>
            which, while they are pre-eminently fitted for perfecting <lb/>
            our happiness, at the same time teach us how we may bear <lb/>
            misfortune most lightly, and which are at the same time <lb/>
            a man's greatest honour and greatest comfort. Now, there­ <lb/>
            fore, immerse yourself even more deeply in your studies, <lb/>
            now surround your mind with them like fortifications, so <lb/>
            that grief may not find any place at which it can gain <lb/>
            entrance. At the same time, prolong the remembrance of <lb/>
            your brother by inserting some memoir of him among your <lb/>
            other writings : for that is the only sort of monument that <lb/>
            can be erected by man which no storm can injure, no time <lb/>
            destroy. The others, which consist of piles of stone, masses <lb/>
            of marble, or huge mounds of earth heaped on high, cannot <lb/>
            preserve his memory for long, because they themselves <lb/>
            perish; but the memorials which genius raises are ever­ <lb/>
            lasting. Lavish these upon your brother, embalm him in <lb/>
            these: you will do better to immortalise him by an ever­ <lb/>
            lasting work of genius than to mourn over him with useless <lb/>
            grief. As for Fortune herself, although I cannot just now <note type="footnote"> 1 Merivale, following Suetonius and Dion Cassius, says: " He declared <lb/>
            that if any man dared to mourn for his sister's death, he should be <lb/>
            punished, for she had become a goddess : if any one ventured to rejoice <lb/>
            at her deification, he should be punished also, for she was dead." The <lb/>
            passage in the text, he remarks, gives a less extravagant turn to the <lb/>
            story. </note> <pb n="378"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XII. </note> <lb/>
            plead her cause before you, because all that she has given <lb/>
            us is now hateful to you, because she has taken something <lb/>
            away from you, yet I will plead her cause as soon as time <lb/>
            shall have rendered you a more impartial judge of her <lb/>
            action : indeed she has bestowed much upon you to make <lb/>
            amends for the injury which she has done you, and she <lb/>
            will give more hereafter by way of atonement for it: and, <lb/>
            after all, it was she herself who gave you this brother whom <lb/>
            she has taken away. Forbear, then, to display your <lb/>
            abilities against your own self, or to take part with your <lb/>
            grief against yourself: your eloquence, can, no doubt, make <lb/>
            trifles appear great, and, conversely, can disparage and de­ <lb/>
            preciate great things until they seem the merest trifles; <lb/>
            but let it reserve those powers and use them on some other <lb/>
            subject, and at the present time devote its entire strength <lb/>
            to the task of consoling you. Yet see whether even this <lb/>
            task be not unnecessary. Nature demands from us a certain <lb/>
            amount of grief, our imagination adds some more to it; <lb/>
            but I will never forbid you to mourn at all. I know, <lb/>
            indeed, that there are some men, whose wisdom is of a <lb/>
            harsh rather than a brave character, who say that the <lb/>
            wise man never would mourn. It seems to me that they <lb/>
            never can have been in the position of mourners, for other­ <lb/>
            wise their misfortune would have shaken all their haughty <lb/>
            philosophy out of them, and, however much against their <lb/>
            will, would have forced them to confess their sorrow. <lb/>
            Reason will have done enough if she does but cut off <lb/>
            from our grief all that is superfluous and useless : as for <lb/>
            her not allowing us to grieve at all, that we ought neither <lb/>
            to expect nor to wish for. Let her rather restrain us <lb/>
            within the bounds of a chastened grief, which partakes <lb/>
            neither of indifference nor of madness, and let her keep our <lb/>
            minds in that attitude which becomes affection without <lb/>
            excitement: let your tears flow, but let them some day <lb/>
            cease to flow: groan as deeply as you will, but let your <pb n="379"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVIII.] </note> <lb/>
            groans cease some day: regulate your conduct so that both <lb/>
            philosophers and brothers may approve of it. Make yourself <lb/>
            feel pleasure in often thinking about your brother, talk <lb/>
            constantly about him, and keep him ever present in your <lb/>
            memory; which you cannot succeed in doing unless you <lb/>
            make the remembrance of him pleasant rather than sad: <lb/>
            for it is but natural that the mind should shrink from a <lb/>
            subject which it cannot contemplate without sadness. <lb/>
            Think of his retiring disposition, of his abilities for business, <lb/>
            his diligence in carrying it out, his loyalty to his word. <lb/>
            Tell other men of all his sayings and doings, and remind <lb/>
            your own self of them : think how good he was and how <lb/>
            great you hoped he might become: for what success is <lb/>
            there which you might not safely have wagered that such <lb/>
            a brother would win P</p>
          <p>I have thrown together these reflexions in the best way <lb/>
            that I could, for my mind is dimmed and stupefied with <lb/>
            the tedium of my long exile: if, therefore, you should find <lb/>
            them unworthy of the consideration of a person of your <lb/>
            intelligence, or unable to console you in your grief, re­ <lb/>
            member how impossible it is for one who is full of his own <lb/>
            sorrows to find time to minister to those of others, and how <lb/>
            hard it is to express oneself in the Latin language, when <lb/>
            all around one hears nothing but a rude foreign jargon, <lb/>
            which even barbarians of the more civilised sort regard <lb/>
            with disgust.</p><pb n="380"/>

          <p>I <lb/>
            HAVE determined to write a book upon clemency, <lb/>
            Nero Caesar, in order that I may as it were serve as a <lb/>
            mirror to you, and let you see yourself arriving at the <lb/>
            greatest of all pleasures. For although the true enjoyment <lb/>
            of good deeds consists in the performance of them, and <lb/>
            virtues have no adequate reward beyond themselves, still <lb/>
            it is worth your while to consider and investigate a good <lb/>
            conscience from every point of view, and afterwards to <lb/>
            cast your eyes upon this enormous mass of mankind- <lb/>
            quarrelsome, factious, and passionate as they are; likely, if <lb/>
            they could throw off the yoke of your government, to take <lb/>
            pleasure alike in the ruin of themselves and of one another <lb/>
            -and thus to commune with yourself :—" Have I of all <lb/>
            mankind been chosen and thought fit to perform the office <lb/>
            of a god upon earth ? I am the arbiter of life and death <lb/>
            to mankind: it rests with me to decide what lot and posi­ <lb/>
            tion in life each man possesses : fortune makes use of my <lb/>
            mouth to announce what she bestows on each man: cities <lb/>
            and nations are moved to joy by my words : no region <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            anywhere can flourish without my favour and good will: <lb/>
            all these thousands of swords now restrained by my autho­ <lb/>
            rity, would be drawn at a sign from me : it rests with me <lb/>
            to decide which tribes shall be utterly exterminated, which <lb/>
            shall be moved into other lands, which shall receive and <lb/>
            which shall be deprived of liberty, what kings shall be <lb/>
            reduced to slavery and whose heads shall be crowned, <lb/>
            what cities shall be destroyed and what new ones shall be <lb/>
            founded. In this position of enormous power I am not <lb/>
            tempted to punish men unjustly by anger, by youthful im­ <lb/>
            pulse, by the recklessness and insolence of men, which often <lb/>
            overcomes the patience even of the best regulated minds, <lb/>
            not even that terrible vanity, so common among great sove­ <lb/>
            reigns, of displaying my power by inspiring terror. My sword <lb/>
            is sheathed, nay, fixed in its sheath : I am sparing of the <lb/>
            blood even of the lowest of my subjects : a man who has <lb/>
            nothing else to recommend him, will nevertheless find <lb/>
            favour in my eyes because he is a man. I keep harshness <lb/>
            concealed, but I have clemency always at hand : I watch <lb/>
            myself as carefully as though I had to give an account of <lb/>
            my actions to those laws which I have brought out of <lb/>
            darkness and neglect into the light of day. I have been <lb/>
            moved to compassion by the youth of one culprit, and the <lb/>
            age of another: I have spared one man because of his <lb/>
            great place, another on account of his insignificance: when I <lb/>
            could find no reason for showing mercy, I have had mercy <lb/>
            upon myself. I am prepared this day, should the gods de­ <lb/>
            mand it, to render to them an account of the human race." <lb/>
            You, Caesar, can boldly say that everything which has come <lb/>
            into your charge has been kept safe, and that the state <lb/>
            has neither openly nor secretly suffered any loss at your <lb/>
            hands. You have coveted a glory which is most rare, and <lb/>
            which has been obtained by no emperor before you, that of <lb/>
            innocence. Your remarkable goodness is not thrown away, <lb/>
            nor is it ungratefully or spitefully undervalued. Men feel <pb n="382"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            gratitude towards you: no one person ever was so dear to <lb/>
            another as you are to the people of Rome, whose great and <lb/>
            enduring benefit you are. You have, however, taken upon <lb/>
            yourself a mighty burden: no one any longer speaks of the <lb/>
            good times of the late Emperor Augustus, or the first years <lb/>
            of the reign of Tiberius, or proposes for your imitation <lb/>
            any model outside yourself : yours is a pattern reign. <lb/>
            This would have been difficult had your goodness of heart <lb/>
            not been innate, but merely adopted for a time; for no one <lb/>
            can wear a mask for long, and fictitious qualities soon give <lb/>
            place to true ones. Those which are founded upon truth, <lb/>
            and which, so to speak, grow out of a solid basis, only <lb/>
            become greater and better as time goes on. The Roman <lb/>
            people were in a state of great hazard as long as it was <lb/>
            uncertain how your generous1 disposition would turn out; <lb/>
            now, however, the prayers of the community are sure of <lb/>
            an answer, for there is no fear that you should suddenly <lb/>
            forget your own character. Indeed, excess of happiness <lb/>
            makes men greedy, and our desires are never so moderate as <lb/>
            to be bounded by what they have obtained: great successes <lb/>
            become the stepping-stones to greater ones, and those who <lb/>
            have obtained more than they hoped, entertain even more <lb/>
            extravagant hopes than before; yet by all your country­ <lb/>
            men we hear it admitted that they are now happy, and <lb/>
            moreover, that nothing can be added to the blessings that <lb/>
            they enjoy, except that they should be eternal. Many <lb/>
            circumstances force this admission from them, although it <lb/>
            is the one which men are least willing to make : we enjoy <lb/>
            a profound and prosperous peace, the power of the law has <lb/>
            been openly asserted in the sight of all men, and raised <lb/>
            beyond the reach of any violent interference : the form of <lb/>
            our government is so happy, as to contain all the essentials <lb/>
            of liberty except the power of destroying itself. It is <note type="footnote"> 1 Nobilis. </note> <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III. ] </note> <lb/>
            nevertheless your clemency which is most especially ad­ <lb/>
            mired by the high and low alike : every man enjoys or <lb/>
            hopes to enjoy the other blessings of your rule according <lb/>
            to the measure of his own personal good fortune, whereas <lb/>
            from your clemency all hope alike: no one has so much <lb/>
            confidence in his own innocence, as not to feel glad that in <lb/>
            your presence stands a clemency which is ready to make <lb/>
            allowance for human errors.</p>
          <p>II. I know, however, that there are some who imagine <lb/>
            that clemency only saves the life of every villain, because <lb/>
            clemency is useless except after conviction, and alone of all <lb/>
            the virtues has no function among the innocent. But in <lb/>
            the first place, although a physician is only useful to the <lb/>
            sick, yet he is held in honour among the healthy also ; and <lb/>
            so clemency, though she be invoked by those who deserve <lb/>
            punishment, is respected by innocent people as well. Next, <lb/>
            she can exist also in the person of the innocent, because <lb/>
            sometimes misfortune takes the place of crime; indeed, <lb/>
            clemency not only succours the innocent, but often the <lb/>
            virtuous, since in the course of time it happens that men <lb/>
            are punished for actions which deserve praise. Besides <lb/>
            this, there is a large part of mankind which might return <lb/>
            to virtue if the hope of pardon were not denied them. Yet <lb/>
            it is not right to pardon indiscriminately; for when no <lb/>
            distinction is made between good and bad men, disorder <lb/>
            follows, and all vices break forth ; we must therefore take <lb/>
            care to distinguish those characters which admit of reform <lb/>
            from those which are hopelessly depraved. Neither ought <lb/>
            we to show an indiscriminate and general, nor yet an exclu­ <lb/>
            sive clemency; for to pardon every one is as great cruelty as <lb/>
            to pardon none; we must take a middle course; but as it is <lb/>
            difficult to find the true mean, let us be careful, if we depart <lb/>
            from it, to do so upon the side of humanity.</p>
          <p>III. But these matters will be treated of better in their <lb/>
            own place. I will now divide this whole subject into <pb n="384"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            three parts. The first will be of gentleness of temper: : 1 the <lb/>
            second will -be that which explains the nature and disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of clemency; for since there are certain vices which <lb/>
            have the semblance of virtue, they cannot be separated <lb/>
            unless you stamp upon them the marks which distinguish <lb/>
            them from one another: in the third place we shall inquire <lb/>
            how the mind. may be led to practise this virtue, how it may <lb/>
            strengthen it, and by habit make it its own.</p>
          <p>That clemency, which is the most humane of virtues, is <lb/>
            that which best befits a man, is necessarily an axiom, not <lb/>
            only among our own sect, which regards man as a social <lb/>
            animal, born for the good of the whole community, but <lb/>
            even among those philosophers who give him up entirely <lb/>
            to pleasure, and whose words and actions have no other <lb/>
            aim than their own personal advantage. If man, as they <lb/>
            argue, seeks for quiet and repose, what virtue is there <lb/>
            which is more agreeable to his nature than clemency, which <lb/>
            loves peace and restrains him from violence ? Now clemency <lb/>
            becomes no one more than a king or a prince; for great <lb/>
            power is glorious and admirable only when it is beneficent; <lb/>
            since to be powerful only for mischief is the power of a <lb/>
            pestilence. That man's greatness alone rests upon a secure <lb/>
            foundation, whom all men know to be as much on their <lb/>
            side as he is above them, of whose watchful care for the <lb/>
            safety of each and all of them they receive daily proofs, at <lb/>
            whose approach they do not fly in- terror, as though some <lb/>
            evil and dangerous animal had sprung out from its den, <lb/>
            but flock to him as they would to the bright and health- <lb/>
            giving sunshine. They are perfectly ready to fling them­ <lb/>
            selves upon the swords of conspirators in his defence, to <lb/>
            offer their bodies if his only path to safety must be formed <lb/>
            of corpses : they protect his sleep by nightly watches, they <note type="footnote"> 1 The text is corrupt. I have followed Gertz's conjectural emendation, <lb/>

            surround him and defend him on every side, and expose <lb/>
            themselves to the dangers which menace him. It is not with­ <lb/>
            out good reason that nations and cities thus agree in sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing their lives and property for the defence and the love of <lb/>
            their king whenever their leader's safety demands it; men <lb/>
            do not hold themselves cheap, nor are they insane when so <lb/>
            many thousands are put to the sword for the sake of one <lb/>
            man, and when by so many deaths they save the life of one <lb/>
            man alone, who not unfrequently is old and feeble. Just as <lb/>
            the entire body is commanded by the mind, and although the <lb/>
            body be so much larger and more beautiful while the mind <lb/>
            is impalpable and hidden, and we are not certain as to <lb/>
            where it is concealed, yet the hands, feet, and eyes work <lb/>
            for it, the skin protects it; at its bidding we either lie <lb/>
            still or move restlessly about; when it gives the word, if it <lb/>
            be an avaricious master, we scour the sea in search of <lb/>
            gain, or if it be ambitious we straightway place our right <lb/>
            hand in the flames like Mucius, or leap into the pit like <lb/>
            Curtius, so likewise this enormous multitude which sur­ <lb/>
            rounds one man is directed by his will, is guided by his <lb/>
            intellect, and would break and hurl itself into ruin by its <lb/>
            own strength, if it were not upheld by his wisdom.</p>
          <p>IV. Men therefore love their own safety, when they <lb/>
            draw up vast legions in battle on behalf of one man, when <lb/>
            they rush to the front, and expose their breasts to wounds, <lb/>
            for fear that their leader's standards should be driven back. <lb/>
            He is the bond which fastens the commonwealth together, <lb/>
            he is the breath of life to all those thousands, who by <lb/>
            themselves would become merely an encumbrance and a <lb/>
            source of plunder if that directing mind were withdrawn :— <lb/>
            Bees have but one mind, till their king doth die, <lb/>
            But when he dies, disorderly they fly. <lb/>
            Such a misfortune will be the end of the peace of Rome, <lb/>
            it will wreck the prosperity of this great people; the nation <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <pb n="386"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            will be free from this danger as long as it knows how to <lb/>
            endure the reins: should it ever break them, or refuse to <lb/>
            have them replaced if they were to fall off by accident, then <lb/>
            this mighty whole, this complex fabric of government <lb/>
            will fly asunder into many fragments, and the last day of <lb/>
            Rome's empire will be that upon which it forgets how <lb/>
            to obey. For this reason we need not wonder that princes, <lb/>
            kings, and all other protectors of a state, whatever their <lb/>
            titles may be, should be loved beyond the circle of their <lb/>
            immediate relatives; for since right-thinking men prefer <lb/>
            the interests of the state to their own, it follows that <lb/>
            he who bears the burden of state affairs must be dearer <lb/>
            to them than their own friends. Indeed, the emperor <lb/>
            long ago identified himself so thoroughly with the state, <lb/>
            that neither of them could be separated without injury <lb/>
            to both, because the one requires power, while the other <lb/>
            requires a head.</p>
          <p>V. My argument seems to have wandered somewhat far <lb/>
            from the subject, but, by Hercules, it really is very much <lb/>
            to the point. For if, as we may infer from what has been <lb/>
            said, you are the soul of the state, and the state is your <lb/>
            body, you will perceive, I imagine, how necessary cle­ <lb/>
            mency is ; for when you appear to spare another, you <lb/>
            are really sparing yourself. You ought therefore to spare <lb/>
            even blameworthy citizens, just as you spare weakly <lb/>
            limbs; and when blood-letting becomes necessary, you <lb/>
            must hold your hand, lest you should cut deeper than <lb/>
            you need. Clemency therefore, as I said before, naturally <lb/>
            befits all mankind, but more especially rulers, because in <lb/>
            their case there is more for it to save, and it is dis­ <lb/>
            played upon a greater scale. Cruelty in a private man <lb/>
            can do but very little harm; but the ferocity of princes <lb/>
            is war. Although there is a harmony between all the <lb/>
            virtues, and no one is better or more honourable than <lb/>
            another, yet some virtues befit some persons better than <pb n="387"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            others. Magnanimity befits all mortal men, even the <lb/>
            humblest of all; for what can be greater or braver than to <lb/>
            resist ill fortune ? Yet this virtue of magnanimity occu­ <lb/>
            pies a wider room in prosperity, and shows to greater <lb/>
            advantage on the judgment seat than on the floor of <lb/>
            the court. On the other hand, clemency renders every <lb/>
            house into which it is admitted happy and peaceful ; but <lb/>
            though it is more rare, it is on that account even more <lb/>
            admirable in a palace. What can be more remarkable <lb/>
            than that he whose anger might be indulged without fear <lb/>
            of the consequences, whose decision, even though a harsh <lb/>
            one, would be approved even by those who were to suffer <lb/>
            by it, whom no one can interrupt, and of whom indeed, <lb/>
            should he become violently enraged, no one would dare to <lb/>
            beg for mercy, should apply a check to himself and use <lb/>
            his power in a better and calmer spirit, reflecting: " Any <lb/>
            one may break the law to kill a man, no one but I can <lb/>
            break it to save him" ? A great position requires a great <lb/>
            mind, for unless the mind raises itself to and even above <lb/>
            the level of its station, it will degrade its station and draw <lb/>
            it down to the earth; now it is the property of a great <lb/>
            mind to be calm and tranquil and to look down upon <lb/>
            outrages and insults with contempt. It is a womanish <lb/>
            thing to rage with passion ; it is the part of wild beasts, and <lb/>
            that, too, not of the most noble ones, to bite and worry the <lb/>
            fallen. Elephants and lions pass by those whom they have <lb/>
            struck down ; inveteracy is the quality of ignoble animals. <lb/>
            Fierce and implacable rage does not befit a king, because <lb/>
            he does not preserve his superiority over the man to .whose <lb/>
            level he descends by indulging in rage; but if he grants <lb/>
            their lives and honours to those who are in jeopardy and <lb/>
            who deserve to lose them, he does what can only be done <lb/>
            by an absolute ruler; for life may be torn away even from <lb/>
            those who are above us in station, but can never be granted <lb/>
            save to those who are below us. To save men's lives <pb n="388"/>

            is the privilege of the loftiest station, which never de­ <lb/>
            serves admiration so much as when it is able to act like <lb/>
            the gods, by whose kindness good and bad men alike are <lb/>
            brought into the world. Thus a prince, imitating the <lb/>
            mind of a god, ought to look with pleasure on some of his <lb/>
            countrymen because they are useful and good men, while <lb/>
            he ought to allow others to remain to fill up the roll; he <lb/>
            ought to be pleased with the existence of the former, <lb/>
            and to endure that of the latter,</p>
          <p>VI. Look at this city of Rome, in which the widest <lb/>
            streets become choked whenever anything stops the <lb/>
            Crowds which unceasingly pour through them like raging <lb/>
            torrents, in which the people streaming to three theatres <lb/>
            demand the roads at the same time, in which the produce <lb/>
            of the entire world is consumed, and reflect what a de­ <lb/>
            solate waste it would become if only those were left in <lb/>
            it whom a strict judge would acquit. How few magis­ <lb/>
            trates are there who ought not to be condemned by the <lb/>
            very same laws which they administer ? How few prose­ <lb/>
            cutors are themselves faultless ? I imagine, also, that few <lb/>
            men are less willing to grant pardon, than those who have <lb/>
            often had to beg it for themselves. We have all of us <lb/>
            sinned, some more deeply than others, some of set purpose, <lb/>
            some either by chance impulse or led away by the wicked­ <lb/>
            ness of others; some of us have not stood bravely enough <lb/>
            by our good resolutions, and have lost our innocence, al­ <lb/>
            though unwillingly and after a struggle; nor have we only <lb/>
            sinned, but to the very end of our lives we shall continue <lb/>
            to sin.' Even if there be any one who has so thoroughly <lb/>
            cleansed his mind that nothing can hereafter throw him <lb/>
            into disorder or deceive him, yet even he has reached this <lb/>
            state of innocence through sin.</p>
          <p>VII. Since I have made mention of the gods, I shall <lb/>
            state the best model on which a prince may mould his life <lb/>
            to be, that he deal with his countrymen as he would that <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            the gods may deal with himself. Is it then desirable that <lb/>
            the gods should show no mercy upon sins and mistakes, <lb/>
            and that they should harshly pursue us to our ruin ? In <lb/>
            that case what king will be safe ? Whose limbs will not <lb/>
            be torn asunder and collected by the soothsayers ? If, on <lb/>
            the other hand, the gods are placable and kind, and do not <lb/>
            at once avenge the crimes of the powerful with thunder­ <lb/>
            bolts, is it not far more just that a man set in authority <lb/>
            over other men should exercise his power in a spirit of <lb/>
            clemency and should consider whether the condition of the <lb/>
            world is more beauteous and pleasant to the eyes on a fine <lb/>
            calm day, or when everything is shaken with frequent <lb/>
            thunder-claps and when lightning flashes on all sides ! <lb/>
            Yet the appearance of a peaceful and constitutional reign <lb/>
            is the same as that of the calm and brilliant sky. A cruel <lb/>
            reign is disordered and hidden in darkness, and while all <lb/>
            shake with terror at the sudden explosions, not even he <lb/>
            who caused all this disturbance escapes unharmed. It is <lb/>
            easier to find excuses for private men who obstinately <lb/>
            claim their rights; possibly they may have been injured, <lb/>
            and their rage may spring from their wrongs; besides this, <lb/>
            they fear to be despised, and not to return the injuries <lb/>
            which they have received looks like weakness rather than <lb/>
            clemency; but one who can easily avenge himself, if he <lb/>
            neglects to do so, is certain to gain praise for goodness of <lb/>
            heart. Those who are born in a humble station may with <lb/>
            greater freedom exercise violence, go to law, engage in <lb/>
            quarrels, and indulge their angry passions; even blows <lb/>
            count for little between two equals; but in the case of a <lb/>
            king, even loud clamour and unmeasured talk are unbe­ <lb/>
            coming.</p>
          <p>VIII. You think it a serious matter to take away from <lb/>
            kings the right of free speech which the humblest enjoy. <lb/>
            11 This," you say, " is to be a subject, not a king." What, <lb/>
            do you not find that we have the command, you the sub- <pb n="390"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            jection ? Your position is quite different to that of those who <lb/>
            lie hid in the crowd which they never leave, whose very <lb/>
            virtues cannot be manifested without a long struggle, and <lb/>
            whose vices are shrouded in obscurity; rumour catches up <lb/>
            your acts and sayings, and therefore no persons ought to be <lb/>
            more careful of their reputation than those who are certain <lb/>
            to have a great one, whatsoever one they may have deserved. <lb/>
            How many things there are that you may not do which, <lb/>
            thanks to you, we may do! I am able to walk alone without <lb/>
            fear in any part of Rome whatever, although no companion <lb/>
            accompanies me, though there is no guard at my house no <lb/>
            sword by my side. You must live armed in the peace which <lb/>
            you maintain. 1 You cannot stray away from your position ; <lb/>
            it besets you, and follows you with mighty pomp wherever <lb/>
            you go. This slavery of not being able to sink one's rank <lb/>
            belongs to the highest position of all; yet it is a burden <lb/>
            which you share with the gods. They too are held fast in <lb/>
            heaven, and it is no more possible for them to come down <lb/>
            than it is safe2 for you ; you are chained to your lofty <lb/>
            pinnacle. Of our movements few persons are aware; we <lb/>
            can go forth and return home and change our dress without <lb/>
            its being publicly known; but you are no more able to hide <lb/>
            yourself than the sun. A strong light is all around you, <lb/>
            the eyes of all are turned towards it. Do you think you <lb/>
            are leaving your house ? nay, you are dawning upon the <lb/>
            world. You cannot speak without all nations everywhere <lb/>
            hearing your voice; you cannot be angry, without making <lb/>
            everything tremble, because you can strike no one without <lb/>
            shaking all around him. Just as thunderbolts when they <lb/>
            fall endanger few men but terrify all, so the chastisement <lb/>
            inflicted by great potentates terrify more widely than they <lb/>
            injure, and that for good reasons; for in the case of one <lb/>
            whose power is absolute, men do not think of what he has <lb/>
            done, so much as of what he may do. Add to this that <note type="footnote"> 1 Pace. </note><note type="footnote">2 Tutum. </note> <pb n="391"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            private men endure wrongs more tamely, because they have <lb/>
            already endured others; the safety of kings on the other <lb/>
            hand is more surely founded on kindness, because frequent <lb/>
            punishment may crush the hatred of a few, but excites that <lb/>
            of all. A king ought to wish to pardon while he has still <lb/>
            grounds for being severe; if he acts otherwise, just as lopped <lb/>
            trees sprout forth again with numberless boughs, and many <lb/>
            kinds of crops are cut down in order that they may grow <lb/>
            more thickly, so a cruel king increases the number of his <lb/>
            enemies by destroying them; for the parents and children <lb/>
            of those who are put to death, and their relatives and <lb/>
            friends, step into the place of each victim.</p>
          <p>IX. I wish to prove the truth of this by an example <lb/>
            drawn from your own family. The late Emperor Augustus <lb/>
            was a mild prince, if in estimating his character one reckons <lb/>
            from the era of his reign; yet he appealed to arms while the <lb/>
            state was shared among the triumvirate. When he was just <lb/>
            of your age, at the end of his twenty-second year, he had <lb/>
            already hidden daggers under the clothes of his friends, he <lb/>
            had already conspired to assassinate Marcus Antonius, the <lb/>
            consul, he had already taken part in the proscription. But <lb/>
            when he had passed his sixtieth1 year, and was staying in <note type="footnote"> I Gertz reads sexagesimum, his sixtieth year, which he calls " the not <lb/>
            very audacious conjecture of Wesseling," and adds that he does so because <lb/>
            of the words at the beginning of chap. xi. and the authority of Dion <lb/>
            Cassius. The ordinary reading is quadragesimum, " his fortieth year," <lb/>
            and this is the date to which Cinna's conspiracy is referred to by <lb/>
            Merivale, " History of the Romans under the Empire," vol. iv. ch. 37, <lb/>
            " A plot," he says, " was formed for his destruction, at the head of which <lb/>
            was Cornelius Cinna, described as a son of Faustus Sulla by a daughter <lb/>
            of the Great Pompeius." The story of Cinna's conspiracy is told by <lb/>
            Seneca, de Clem. i. 9, and Dion iv. 14, foil. They agree in the main <lb/>
            fact; but Seneca is our authority for the details of the interview between <lb/>
            Augustus and his enemy, while Dion has doubtless invented his long <lb/>
            conversation between the emperor and Livia. Seneca, however, calls <lb/>
            the conspirator Lucius, and places the event in the fortieth year of <lb/>
            Augustus (A.D. 731), the scene in Gaul: Dion, on the other, gives the </note> <pb n="392"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BE. I. </note> <lb/>
            Gaul, intelligence was brought to him that Lucius Cinna, a <lb/>
            dull man, was plotting against him: the plot was betrayed <lb/>
            by one of the conspirators, who told him where, when, and <lb/>
            in what manner Cinna meant to attack him. Augustus <lb/>
            determined to consult his own safety against this man, and <lb/>
            ordered a council of his own friends to be summoned. He <lb/>
            passed a disturbed night, reflecting that he would be obliged <lb/>
            to condemn to death a youth of noble birth, who was guilty <lb/>
            of no crime save this one, and who was the grandson of <lb/>
            Gnaeus Pompeius. He, who had sat at dinner and heard <lb/>
            M. Antonius 1 read aloud his edict for the proscription, <lb/>
            could not now bear to put one single man to death. With <lb/>
            groans he kept at intervals making various inconsistent <lb/>
            exclamations:—" What! shall I allow my assassin to walk <lb/>
            about at his ease while I am racked by fears ? Shall the <lb/>
            man not be punished who has plotted not merely to slay <lb/>
            but actually to sacrifice at the altar " (for the conspirators <lb/>
            intended to attack him when he was sacrificing), " now <lb/>
            when there is peace by land and sea, that life which so <lb/>
            many civil wars have sought in vain, which has passed un­ <lb/>
            harmed through so many battles of fleets and armies ? "</p>
          <p>Then, after an interval of silence, he would say to himself <lb/>
            in a far louder, angrier tone than he had used to Cinna, Why <lb/>
            do you live, if it be to so many men's advantage that you <lb/>
            should die ? Is there no end to these executions F to this <lb/>
            bloodshed ? I am a figure set up for nobly-born youths to <lb/>
            sharpen their swords on. Is life worth having, if so many <lb/>
            must perish to prevent my losing it?" At last his . wife <lb/>
            Livia interrupted him, saying : " Will you take a woman's <note type="footnote"> names of Gnaeus, and supposes the circumstances to hare occured <lb/>
            twenty-six years later, and at Rome. It may be observed that a son <lb/>
            of Faustus Sulla must have been at least fifty at this latter date, nor do <lb/>
            we know why he should bear the name of Cinna, though an adoption is <lb/>
            not impossible. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See Shakespeare's Julius Caesar," Act IV. Se. 1. </note> <pb n="393"/>

            advice? Do as the physicians do, who, when the usual <lb/>
            remedies fail, try their opposites. Hitherto you have <lb/>
            gained nothing by harsh measures: Salvidienus has been <lb/>
            followed by Lepidus, Lepidus by Muraena, Muraena by <lb/>
            Caepio, and Caepio by Egnatius, not to mention others of . <lb/>
            whom one feels ashamed of their having dared to attempt <lb/>
            so great a deed. Now try what effect clemency will have: <lb/>
            pardon Lucius Cinna. He has been detected, he cannot <lb/>
            now do you any harm, and he can do your reputation much <lb/>
            good." Delighted at finding some one to support his own <lb/>
            view of the case, he thanked his wife, straightway ordered <lb/>
            his friends, whose counsel he had asked for, to be told that <lb/>
            he did not require their advice, and summoned Cinna alone. <lb/>
            After ordering a second seat to be placed for Cinna, he sent <lb/>
            every one else out of the room, and said :—" The first re­ <lb/>
            quest which I have to make of you is, that you will not <lb/>
            interrupt me while I am speaking to you: that you will <lb/>
            not cry out in the middle of my address to you : you shall <lb/>
            be allowed time to speak freely in answer to me. Cinna, <lb/>
            when I found you in the enemy's camp, you who had not <lb/>
            become but were actually born my enemy, I saved your <lb/>
            life, and restored to you the whole of your father's estate. <lb/>
            You are now so prosperous and so rich, that many of the <lb/>
            victorious party envy you, the vanquished one: when you <lb/>
            were a candidate for the priesthood I passed over many <lb/>
            others whose parents had served with me in the wars, and <lb/>
            gave it to you: and now, after I have deserved so well of you, <lb/>
            you have made up your mind to kill me." When at this word <lb/>
            the man exclaimed that he was far from being so insane, <lb/>
            Augustus replied, " You do not keep your promise, Cinna ; <lb/>
            it was agreed upon between us that you should not interrupt <lb/>
            me. I repeat, you are preparing to kill me." He then <lb/>
            proceeded to tell him of the place, the names of his accom­ <lb/>
            plices, the day, the way in which they had arranged to do <lb/>
            the deed, and which of them was to give the fatal stab. <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            When he saw Cinna's eyes fixed upon the ground, and that he <lb/>
            was silent, no longer because of the agreement, but from con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of his guilt, he said, " What is your intention in <lb/>
            doing this ? is it that you yourself may be emperor ? The <lb/>
            Roman people must indeed be in a bad way if nothing but <lb/>
            my life prevents your ruling over them. You cannot even <lb/>
            maintain the dignity of your own house : you have recently <lb/>
            been defeated in a legal encounter by the superior influence <lb/>
            of a freedman : and so you can find no easier task than to <lb/>
            call your friends to rally round you against Caesar. Come, <lb/>
            now, if you think that I alone stand in the way of your <lb/>
            ambition; will Paulus and Fabius Maximus, will the Cossi <lb/>
            and the Servilii and all that band of nobles, whose names <lb/>
            are no empty pretence, but whose ancestry really renders <lb/>
            them illustrious-will they endure that you should rule <lb/>
            over them ? " Not to fill up the greater part of this book by <lb/>
            repeating the whole of his speech-for he is known to <lb/>
            have spoken for more than two hours, lengthening out this <lb/>
            punishment, which was the only one which he intended to <lb/>
            inflict—he said at last: " Cinna, I grant you your life for <lb/>
            the second time: when I gave it you before you were an <lb/>
            open enemy, you are now a secret plotter and parricide.1 <lb/>
            From this day forth let us be friends : let us try which of <lb/>
            us is the more sincere, I in giving you your life, or you in <lb/>
            owing your life to me." After this he of his own accord <lb/>
            bestowed the consulship upon him, complaining of his not <lb/>
            venturing to offer himself as a candidate for that office, and <lb/>
            found him ever afterwards his most grateful and loyal <lb/>
            adherent. Cinna made the emperor his sole heir, and no one <lb/>
            ever again formed any plot against him.</p>
          <p>X. Your great-great-grandfather spared the vanquished: <lb/>
            for whom could he have ruled over, had he not spared them ? <lb/>

            inner circle of his court from the camp of his opponents. <lb/>
            Soon afterwards his clemency gave him a Domitius, a Mes­ <lb/>
            sala, an Asinius, a Cicero, and all the flower of the state. <lb/>
            For what a long time he waited for Lepidus to die: for <lb/>
            years he allowed him to retain all the insignia of royalty, <lb/>
            and did not allow the office of pontifex maximus to be con­ <lb/>
            ferred upon himself until after Lepidus's death; for he <lb/>
            wished it to be called a honourable office rather than a <lb/>
            spoil stripped from a vanquished foe. It was this clemency <lb/>
            which made him end his days in safety and security: this <lb/>
            it was which rendered him popular and beloved, although <lb/>
            he had laid his hands on the neck of the Romans when they <lb/>
            were still unused to bearing the yoke: this gives him even <lb/>
            at the present day a reputation such as hardly any prince <lb/>
            has enjoyed during his own lifetime. We believe him to <lb/>
            be a god, and not merely because we are bidden to do so. We <lb/>
            declare that Augustus was a good emperor, and that he was <lb/>
            well worthy to bear his parent's name, for no other reason <lb/>
            than because he did not even show cruelty in avenging <lb/>
            personal insults, which most princes feel more keenly than <lb/>
            actual injuries; because he smiled at scandalous jests <lb/>
            against himself, because it was evident that he himself suf­ <lb/>
            fered when he punished others, because he was so far from <lb/>
            putting to death even those whom he had convicted of <lb/>
            intriguing with his daughter, that when they were banished <lb/>
            he gave them passports to enable them to travel more safely. <lb/>
            When you know that there will be many who will take <lb/>

          <p>XI. Such was Augustus when an old man, or when <lb/>
            growing old: in his youth he was hasty and passionate, <lb/>
            and did many things upon which he looked back with <lb/>
            regret. No one will venture to compare the rule of the <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            blessed Augustus to the mildness of your own, even if your <lb/>
            youth be compared with his more than ripe old age: <lb/>
            he was gentle and placable, but it was after he had dyed <lb/>
            the sea at Actium with Roman blood; after he had wrecked <lb/>
            both the enemy's fleet and his own at Sicily; after the <lb/>
            holocaust of Perusia and the proscriptions. But I do not <lb/>
            call it clemency to be wearied of cruelty; true clemency, <lb/>
            Caesar, is that which you display, which has not begun from <lb/>
            remorse at its past ferocity, on which there is no stain, <lb/>
            which has never shed the blood of your countrymen : this, <lb/>
            when combined with unlimited power, shows the truest <lb/>
            self-control and all-embracing love of the human race as of <lb/>
            one's self, not corrupted by any low desires, any extravagant <lb/>
            ideas, or any of the bad examples of former emperors into <lb/>
            trying, by actual experiment, how great a tyranny you <lb/>
            would be allowed to exercise over his countrymen, but <lb/>
            inclining rather to blunting your sword of empire. You, <lb/>
            Caesar, have granted us the boon of keeping our state free <lb/>
            from bloodshed, and that of which you boast, that you <lb/>
            have not caused one single drop of blood to flow in any <lb/>
            part of the world, is all the more magnanimous and mar­ <lb/>
            vellous because no one ever had the power of the sword <lb/>
            placed in his hands at an earlier age. Clemency, then, makes <lb/>
            princes safer as well as more respected, and is a glory to <lb/>
            empires besides being their most trustworthy means of <lb/>
            preservation. Why have legitimate sovereigns grown old <lb/>
            on the throne, and bequeathed their power to their children <lb/>
            and grandchildren, while the sway of despotic usurpers is <lb/>
            both hateful and shortlived ? What is the difference be­ <lb/>
            tween the tyrant and the king-for their outward symbols <lb/>
            of authority and their powers are the same-except it be <lb/>
            that tyrants take delight in cruelty, whereas kings are <lb/>
            only cruel for good reasons and because they cannot help it. 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 This whole comparison, which reads so meaninglessly both in Latin <lb/>

            men to death P " They do, but only when that measure is <lb/>
            recommended by the public advantage: tyrants enjoy <lb/>
            cruelty. A tyrant differs from a king in deeds, not in <lb/>
            title: for the elder Dionysius deserves to be preferred <lb/>
            before many kings, and what can prevent our styling <lb/>
            Lucius Bulla a tyrant, since he only left off slaying because <lb/>
            he had no more enemies to slay ? Although he laid down <lb/>
            his dictatorship and resumed the garb of a private citizen, <lb/>
            yet what tyrant ever drank human blood as greedily as he, <lb/>
            who ordered seven thousand Roman citizens to be but­ <lb/>
            chered, and who, on hearing the shrieks of so many thou­ <lb/>
            sands being put to the sword as he sat in the temple of <lb/>
            Bellona, said to the terror-stricken Senate, " Let us attend <lb/>
            to our business, Conscript Fathers ; it is only a few dis­ <lb/>
            turbers of the public peace who are being put to death <lb/>
            by my orders." In saying this he did not lie: they really <lb/>
            seemed few to Sulla. But we shall speak of Sulla presently, <lb/>
            when we consider how we ought to feel anger against our <lb/>
            enemies, at any rate when our own countrymen, members of <lb/>
            the same community as ourselves, have been torn away from <lb/>
            it and assumed the name of enemies : in the meanwhile, as I <lb/>
            was saying, clemency is what makes the great distinction <lb/>
            between kings and tyrants. Though each of them may be <lb/>
            equally fenced around by armed soldiers, nevertheless the <lb/>
            one uses his troops to safeguard the peace of his kingdom, <lb/>
            the other uses them to quell great hatred by great terror: <lb/>
            and yet he does not look with any confidence upon those to <lb/>
            whose hands he entrusts himself. He is driven in opposite <lb/>
            directions by conflicting passions : for since he is hated <lb/>
            because he is feared, he wishes to be feared because he is <note type="footnote"> and the Greek philosophers about <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλεῑς</foreign> and rvpavvou See Plutarch, <lb/>

            hated: and he acts up to the spirit of that odious verse, <lb/>
            which has Cast so many headlong from their thrones­ <lb/>
            " Why, let them hate me, if they fear me too!"— <lb/>
            not knowing how frantic men become when their hatred <lb/>
            becomes excessive: for a moderate amount of fear restrains <lb/>
            men, but a constant and keen apprehension of the worst tor­ <lb/>
            tures rouses up even the most grovelling spirits to deeds of <lb/>
            reckless courage, and causes them to hesitate at nothing. <lb/>
            Just so a string stuck full of feathers1 will prevent wild beasts <lb/>
            escaping: but should a horseman begin to shoot at them <lb/>
            from another quarter, they will attempt to escape over the <lb/>
            very thing that scared them, and will trample the cause of <lb/>
            their alarm underfoot. No courage is so great as that <lb/>
            which is born of utter desperation. In order to keep people <lb/>
            down by terror, you must grant them a certain amount of <lb/>
            security, and let them see that they have far more to hope <lb/>
            for than to fear: for otherwise, if a man is in equal peril <lb/>
            whether he sits still or takes action, he will feel actual plea­ <lb/>
            sure in risking his life, and will fling it away as lightly as <lb/>
            though it were not his own.</p>
          <p>XIII. A calm and peaceful king trusts his guards, <lb/>
            because he makes use of them to ensure the common safety <lb/>
            of all his subjects, and his soldiers, who see that the security <lb/>
            of the state depends upon their labours, cheerfully undergo <lb/>
            the severest toil and glory in being the protectors of the <lb/>
            father of their country: whereas your harsh and mur­ <lb/>
            derous tyrant must needs be disliked even by his own <lb/>
            janissaries. No man can expect willing and loyal service <lb/>
            from those whom he uses like the rack and the axe, as <lb/>
            instruments of torture and death, to whom he casts men <lb/>
            as he would cast them to wild beasts. No prisoner at the <lb/>
            bar is so full of agony and anxiety as a tyrant; for while <lb/>
            he dreads both gods and men because they have witnessed, <note type="footnote"> I De Ira, ii. 11. </note> <pb n="399"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            and will avenge his crimes, he has at the same time so far <lb/>
            committed himself to this course of action that he is not <lb/>
            able to alter it. This is perhaps the very worst quality of <lb/>
            cruelty: a man must go on exercising it, and it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible for him to retrace his steps and start in a better path ; <lb/>
            for crimes must be safeguarded by fresh crimes. Yet who <lb/>
            can be more unhappy than he who is actually compelled to <lb/>
            be a villain ? How greatly he ought to be pitied : I mean, <lb/>
            by himself, for it would be impious for others to pity a man <lb/>
            who has made use of his power to murder and ravage, who <lb/>
            has rendered himself mistrusted by every one at home and <lb/>
            abroad, who fears the very soldiers to whom he flees for <lb/>
            safety, who dare not rely upon the loyalty of his friends or <lb/>
            the affection of his children: who, whenever he considers <lb/>
            what he has done, and what he is about to do, and calls to <lb/>
            mind all the crimes and torturings with which his con­ <lb/>
            science is burdened, must often fear death, and yet must <lb/>
            often wish for it, for he must be even more hateful to him­ <lb/>
            self than he is to his subjects. On the other hand, he who <lb/>
            takes an interest in the entire state, who watches over every <lb/>
            department of it with more or less care, who attends to all <lb/>
            the business of the state as well as if it were his own, who <lb/>
            is naturally inclined to mild measures, and shows, even <lb/>
            when it is to his advantage to punish, how unwilling he is <lb/>
            to make use of harsh remedies; who has no angry or <lb/>
            savage feelings, but wields his authority calmly and bene­ <lb/>
            ficially, being anxious that even his subordinate officers <lb/>
            shall be popular with his countrymen, who thinks his <lb/>
            happiness complete if he can make the nation share his <lb/>
            prosperity, who is courteous in language, whose presence is <lb/>
            easy of access, who looks obligingly upon his subjects, who <lb/>
            is disposed to grant all their reasonable wishes, and does <lb/>
            not treat their unreasonable wishes with harshness—such <lb/>
            a prince is loved, protected, and worshipped by his whole <lb/>
            empire. Men talk of such a one in private in the same <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            words which they use in public ; they are eager to bring up <lb/>
            families under his reign, and they put an end to the child­ <lb/>
            lessness which public misery had previously rendered <lb/>
            general: every one feels that he will indeed deserve that <lb/>
            his children should be grateful to him for having brought <lb/>
            them into so happy an age. Such a prince is rendered <lb/>
            safe by his own beneficence; he has no need of guards, <lb/>
            their arms serve him merely as decorations.</p>
          <p>XIV. What, then, is his duty ? It is that of good <lb/>
            parents, who sometimes scold their children goodnaturedly, <lb/>
            sometimes threaten them, and sometimes even flog them. <lb/>
            No man in his senses disinherits his son for his first offence - <lb/>
            he does not pass this extreme sentence upon him unless his <lb/>
            patience has been worn out by many grievous wrongs, <lb/>
            unless he fears that his son will do something worse than <lb/>
            that which he punishes him for having done; before doing <lb/>
            this he makes many attempts to lead his son's mind into <lb/>
            the right way while it is still hesitating between good and <lb/>
            evil and has only taken its first steps in depravity; it is <lb/>
            only when its case is hopeless that he adopts this extreme <lb/>
            measure. No one demands that people should be executed <lb/>
            until after he has failed to reform them. This which is <lb/>
            the duty of a parent, is also that of the prince whom with <lb/>
            no unmeaning flattery we call " The Father of our Country." <lb/>
            Other names are given as titles of honour: we have styled <lb/>
            some men " The Great," " The Fortunate," or " The August," <lb/>
            and have thus satisfied their passion for grandeur by <lb/>
            bestowing upon them all the dignity that we could : but <lb/>
            when we style a man " The Father of his Country " we give <lb/>
            him to understand that we have entrusted him with a <lb/>
            father's power over us, which is of the mildest character, <lb/>
            for a father takes thought for his children and subordinates <lb/>
            his own interests to theirs. It is long before a father will <lb/>
            cut off a member of his own body: even after he has cut it <lb/>
            off he longs to replace it, and in cutting it off he laments <pb n="401"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            and hesitates much and long : for he who condemns quickly <lb/>
            is not far from being willing to condemn ; and he who <lb/>
            inflicts too great punishment comes very near to punishing <lb/>
            unjustly.</p>
          <p>XV. Within my own recollection the people stabbed in <lb/>
            the forum with their writing-styles a Roman knight named <lb/>
            Tricho, because he had flogged his son to death : even the <lb/>
            authority of Augustus Caesar could hardly save him from <lb/>
            the angry clutches of both fathers and sons : but every one <lb/>
            admired Tarius, who, on discovering that his son meditated <lb/>
            parricide, tried him, convicted him, and was then satisfied <lb/>
            with punishing him by exile, and that, too, to that pleasant <lb/>
            place of exile, Marseilles, where he made him the same <lb/>
            yearly allowance which he had done while he was innocent: <lb/>
            the result of this generosity was that even in a city where <lb/>
            every villain finds some one to defend him, no one doubted <lb/>
            that he was justly condemned, since even the father who was <lb/>
            unable to hate him, nevertheless had condemned him. In <lb/>
            this very same instance I will give you an example of a <lb/>
            good prince, which you may compare with a good father. <lb/>
            Tarius, when about to sit in judgement on his son, invited <lb/>
            Augustus Caesar to assist in trying him: Augustus came <lb/>
            into his private house, sat beside the father, took part in <lb/>
            another man's family council, and did not say, " Nay, let <lb/>
            him rather come to my house," because if he had done so, <lb/>
            the trial would have been conducted by Caesar and not by <lb/>
            the father. When the cause had been heard, after all that <lb/>
            the young man pleaded in his own defence and all that was <lb/>
            alleged against him had been thoroughly discussed, the <lb/>
            emperor begged that each man would write his sentence <lb/>
            (instead of pronouncing it aloud), in order that they might <lb/>
            not all follow Caesar in giving sentence: then, before the <lb/>
            tablets were opened, he declared that if Tarius, who was a <lb/>
            rich man, made him his heir, he would not accept the <lb/>
            bequest. One might say " It showed a paltry mind in him <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <pb n="402"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            to fear that people would think that he condemned the son <lb/>
            in order to enable himself to inherit the estate." I am of <lb/>
            a contrary opinion-any one of us ought to have sufficient <lb/>
            trust in the consciousness of his own integrity to defend <lb/>
            him against calumny, but princes must take great pains to <lb/>
            avoid even the appearance of evil. He swore that he would <lb/>
            not accept the property. On that day Tarius lost two heirs <lb/>
            to his estate, but Caesar gained the liberty of forming an <lb/>
            unbiassed judgement: and when he had proved that his <lb/>
            severity was disinterested, a point of which a prince should <lb/>
            never lose sight, he gave sentence that the son should be <lb/>
            banished to whatever place the father might choose. He <lb/>
            did not sentence him to the sack and the snakes, or to <lb/>
            prison, because he thought, not of who it was upon whom <lb/>
            he was passing sentence, but of who it was with whom <lb/>
            he was sitting in judgement: he said that a father ought <lb/>
            to be satisfied with the mildest form of punishment for <lb/>
            his stripling son, who had been seduced into a crime which <lb/>
            he had attempted so faintheartedly as to be almost innocent <lb/>
            of it, and that he ought to be removed from Rome and out <lb/>
            of his father's sight.</p>
          <p>XVI. How worthy was he to be invited by fathers to <lb/>
            join their family councils : how worthy to be made co-heir <lb/>
            with innocent children! This is the sort of clemency <lb/>
            which befits a prince; wherever he goes, let him make <lb/>
            every one more charitable. In the king's sight, no one <lb/>
            ought to be so despicable that he should not notice whether <lb/>
            he lives or dies: be his character what it may, he is a part <lb/>
            of the empire. Let us take examples for great kingdoms <lb/>
            from smaller ones. There are many forms of royalty : a <lb/>
            prince reigns over his subjects, a father over his children, <lb/>
            a teacher over his scholars, a tribune or centurion over his <lb/>
            soldiers. Would not he, who constantly punished his <lb/>
            children by beating them for the most trifling faults, be. <lb/>
            thought the worst of fathers ? Which is worthier to impart <pb n="403"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            a liberal education: he who flays his scholars alive if their <lb/>
            memory be weak, or if their eyes do not run quickly along <lb/>
            the lines as they read, or he who prefers to improve and <lb/>
            instruct them by kindly warnings and moral influence ? <lb/>
            If a tribune or a centurion is harsh, he will make men <lb/>
            deserters, and one cannot blame them for desertion. It is <lb/>
            never right to rule a human being more harshly and cruelly <lb/>
            than we rule dumb animals; yet a skilled horse-breaker will <lb/>
            not scare a horse by frequent blows, because he will become <lb/>
            timid and vicious if you do not soothe him with pats and <lb/>
            caresses. So also a huntsman, both when he is teaching <lb/>
            puppies to follow the tracks of wild animals, and when he uses <lb/>
            dogs already trained to drive them from their lairs and hunt <lb/>
            them, does not often threaten to beat them, for, if he does, <lb/>
            he will break their spirit, and make them stupid and <lb/>
            currish with fear ; though, on the other hand, he will not <lb/>
            allow them to roam and range about unrestrained. The <lb/>
            same is the case with those who drive the slower draught <lb/>
            cattle, which, though brutal treatment and wretchedness is <lb/>
            their lot from their birth, still, by excessive cruelty may be <lb/>
            made to refuse to draw.</p>
          <p>XVII. No creature is more self-willed, requires more <lb/>
            careful management, or ought to be treated with greater <lb/>
            indulgence than man. What, indeed, can be more foolish <lb/>
            than that we should blush to show anger against dogs <lb/>
            or beasts of burden, and yet wish one man to be most <lb/>
            abominably ill-treated by another ? We are not angry with <lb/>
            diseases, but apply remedies to them : but this also is a <lb/>
            disease of the mind, and requires soothing medicine and a <lb/>
            physician who is anything but angry with his patient. It <lb/>
            is the part of a bad physician to despair of effecting a cure: <lb/>
            he, to whom the care of all men's well-being is entrusted, <lb/>
            ought to act like a good physician, and not be in a hurry to <lb/>
            give up hope or to declare that the symptoms are mortal: <lb/>
            he should wrestle with vices, withstand them, reproach <pb n="404"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            some with their distemper, and deceive others by a soothing <lb/>
            mode of treatment, because he will cure his patient more <lb/>
            quickly and more thoroughly if the medicines which he <lb/>
            administers escape his notice: a prince should take care <lb/>
            not only of the recovery of his people, but also that their <lb/>
            scars should be honourable. Cruel punishments do a king <lb/>
            no honour : for who doubts that he is able to inflict them ? <lb/>
            but, on the other hand, it does him great honour to restrain <lb/>
            his powers, to save many from the wrath of others, and <lb/>
            sacrifice no one to his own.</p>
          <p>XVIII. It is creditable to a man to keep within reasonable <lb/>
            bounds in his treatment of his slaves. Even in the case of <lb/>
            a human chattel one ought to consider, not how much one <lb/>
            can torture him with impunity, but how far such treatment <lb/>
            is permitted by natural goodness and justice, which prompts <lb/>
            us to act kindly towards even prisoners of war and slaves <lb/>
            bought for a price (how much more towards free-born, <lb/>
            respectable gentlemen?), and not to treat them with scorn­ <lb/>
            ful brutality as human chattels, but as persons somewhat <lb/>
            below ourselves in station, who have been placed under our <lb/>
            protection rather than assigned to us as servants. Slaves <lb/>
            are allowed to run and take sanctuary at the statue of a <lb/>
            god, though the laws allows a slave to be ill-treated to <lb/>
            any extent, there are nevertheless some things which the <lb/>
            common laws of life forbid us to do to a human being. Who <lb/>
            does not hate Vedius Polliol more even than his own slaves <lb/>
            did, because he used to fatten his lampreys with human <lb/>
            blood, and ordered those who had offended him in any way <lb/>
            to be cast into his fish-pond, or rather snake-pond ? That <note type="footnote"> 1 Vedius Pollio had a villa on the mountain now called Punta di <lb/>
            Posilippo, which projects into the sea between Naples and Puteoli, which <lb/>
            he left to Augustus, and which was afterwards possessed by the Em­ <lb/>
            peror Trajan. He was a freedman by birth, and remarkable for nothing <lb/>
            except his riches and his cruelty. Of. Dion Cassius, liv. 23; Pliny, H. N. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XIX.] </note> <lb/>
            man deserved to die a thousand deaths, both for throwing <lb/>
            his slaves to be devoured by the lampreys which he himself <lb/>
            meant to eat, and for keeping lampreys that he might feed <lb/>
            them in such a fashion. Cruel masters are pointed at with <lb/>
            disgust in all parts of the city, and are hated and loathed; <lb/>
            the wrong-doings of kings are enacted on a wider theatre : <lb/>
            their shame and unpopularity endures for ages : yet how <lb/>
            far better it would have been never to have been born than <lb/>
            to be numbered among those who have been born to do <lb/>
            their country harm!</p>
          <p>XIX. Nothing can be imagined which is more becoming <lb/>
            to a sovereign than clemency, by whatever title and right <lb/>
            he may be set over his fellow citizens. The greater his <lb/>
            power, the more beautiful and admirable he will confess <lb/>
            his clemency to be : for there is no reason why power <lb/>
            should do any harm, if only it be wielded in accordance <lb/>
            with the laws of nature. Nature herself has conceived <lb/>
            the idea of a king, as you may learn from various animals, <lb/>
            and especially from bees, among whom the king's cell is <lb/>
            the roomiest, and is placed in the most central and safest <lb/>
            part of the hive; moreover, he does no work, but employs <lb/>
            himself in keeping the others up to their work. If the <lb/>
            king be lost, the entire swarm disperses: they never endure <lb/>
            to have more than one king at a time, and find out which <lb/>
            is the better by making them fight with one another: <lb/>
            moreover the king is distinguished by his statelier appear­ <lb/>
            ance, being both larger and more brilliantly coloured than <lb/>
            the other bees. The most remarkable distinction, however, <lb/>
            is the following: bees are very fierce, and for their size are <lb/>
            the most pugnacious of creatures, and leave their stings <lb/>
            in the wounds which they make, but the king himself has <lb/>
            no sting : nature does not wish him to be savage or to seek <lb/>
            revenge at so dear a rate, and so has deprived him of his <lb/>
            weapon and disarmed his rage. She has offered him as a <lb/>
            pattern to great sovereigns : for she is wont to practise <pb n="406"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            herself in small matters, and to scatter abroad tiny models <lb/>
            of the hugest structures. We ought to be ashamed of not <lb/>
            learning a lesson in behaviour from these small creatures, <lb/>
            for a man, who has so much more power of doing harm <lb/>
            than they, ought to show a correspondingly greater amount <lb/>
            of self-control. Would that human beings were subject to <lb/>
            the same law, and that their anger destroyed itself together <lb/>
            with its instrument, so that they could only inflict a wound <lb/>
            once, and would not make use of the strength of others to <lb/>
            carry out their hatreds : for their fury would soon grow <lb/>
            faint if it carried its own punishment with it, and could <lb/>
            only give rein to its violence at the risk of death. Even as <lb/>
            it is, however, no one can exercise it with safety, for he <lb/>
            must needs feel as much fear as he hopes to cause, he must <lb/>
            watch every one's movements, and even when his enemies <lb/>
            are not laying violent hands upon him he must bear in <lb/>
            mind that they are plotting to do so, and he cannot have a <lb/>
            single moment free from alarm. Would any one endure to <lb/>
            live such a life as this, when he might enjoy the privileges <lb/>
            of his high station to the general joy of all men, without <lb/>
            injuring any one, and for that very reason have no one to <lb/>
            fear ? for it is a mistake to suppose that the king can be <lb/>
            safe in a state where nothing is safe from the king: he can <lb/>
            only purchase a life without anxiety for himself by guaran­ <lb/>
            teeing the same for his subjects. He need not pile up lofty <lb/>
            citadels, escarp steep hills, cut away the sides of mountains, <lb/>
            and fence himself about with many lines of walls and <lb/>
            towers : clemency will render a king safe even upon an <lb/>
            open plain. The one fortification which cannot be stormed <lb/>
            is the love of his countrymen. What can be more glorious <lb/>
            than a life which every one spontaneously and without <lb/>
            official pressure hopes may last long? to excite men's fears, <lb/>
            not their hopes, if one's health gives way a little ? to know that <lb/>
            no one holds anything so dear that he would not be glad to <lb/>
            give it in exchange for the health of his sovereign? " 0, may <pb n="407"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XX.] </note> <lb/>
            no evil befall him !" they would cry: "he must live for his <lb/>
            own sake, not only for ours: his constant proofs of good <lb/>
            ness have made him belong to the state instead of the state <lb/>
            belonging to him." Who would dare to plot any danger to <lb/>
            such a king ? Who would not rather, if he could, keep <lb/>
            misfortune far from one under whom justice, peace, decency, <lb/>
            security and merit flourish, under whom the state grows <lb/>
            rich with an abundance of all good things, and looks upon <lb/>
            its ruler in the same spirit of adoration and respect with which <lb/>
            we should look upon the immortal gods, if they allowed us <lb/>
            to behold them as we behold him ? Why! does not that <lb/>
            man come very close to the gods who acts in a god-like <lb/>
            manner, and who is beneficent, open-handed, and powerful <lb/>
            for good ? Your aim and your pride ought to lie in being <lb/>
            thought the best, as well as the greatest of mankind.</p>
          <p>XX. A prince generally inflicts punishment for one of <lb/>
            two reasons: he wishes either to assert his own rights or <lb/>
            those of another. I will first discuss the case in which he is <lb/>
            personally concerned, for it is more difficult for him to act <lb/>
            with moderation when he acts under the impulse of actual <lb/>
            pain than when he merely does so for the sake of the ex­ <lb/>
            ample. It is unnecessary in this place to remind him to be <lb/>
            slow to believe what he hears, to ferret out the truth, to show <lb/>
            favour to innocence, and to bear in mind that to prove it is <lb/>
            as much the business of the judge as that of the prisoner; <lb/>
            for these considerations are connected with justice, not with <lb/>
            clemency: what we are now encouraging him to do is not <lb/>
            to lose control over his feelings when he receives an un­ <lb/>
            mistakeable injury, and to forego punishing it if he possibly <lb/>
            can do so with safety, if not, to moderate the severity of the <lb/>
            punishment, and to show himself far more unwilling to for­ <lb/>
            give wrongs done to others than those done to himself: for, <lb/>
            just as the truly generous man is not he who gives away what <lb/>
            belongs to others, but he who deprives himself of what he <lb/>
            gives to another, so also I should not call a prince clement <pb n="408"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            who looked goodnaturedly upon a wrong done to someone <lb/>
            else, but one who is unmoved even by the sting of a personal <lb/>
            injury, who understands how magnanimous it is for one <lb/>
            whose power is unlimited to allow himself to be wronged, <lb/>
            and that there is no more noble spectacle than that of a <lb/>
            sovereign who has received an injury without avenging it.</p>
          <p>XXI. Vengeance effects two purposes : it either affords <lb/>
            compensation to the person to whom the wrong was done, <lb/>
            or it ensures him against molestation for the future. A <lb/>
            prince is too rich to need compensation, and his power is <lb/>
            too evident for him to require to gain a reputation for <lb/>
            power by causing any one to suffer. I mean, when he is <lb/>
            attacked and injured by his inferiors, for if he sees those <lb/>
            who once were his equals in a position of inferiority to <lb/>
            himself he is sufficiently avenged. A king may be killed <lb/>
            by a. slave, or a serpent, or an arrow: but no one can be <lb/>
            saved except by some one who is greater than him whom he <lb/>
            saves. He, therefore, who has the power of giving and of <lb/>
            taking away life ought to use such a great gift of heaven in <lb/>
            a spirited manner. Above all, if he once obtains this power <lb/>
            over those who he knows were once on a level with himself, <lb/>
            he has completed his revenge, and done all that he need to <lb/>
            towards the punishment of his adversary: for he who owes <lb/>
            his life to another must have lost it, and he who has been <lb/>
            cast down from on high and lies at his enemy's feet with <lb/>
            his kingdom and his life depending upon the pleasure of <lb/>
            another, adds to the glory of his preserver if he be allowed <lb/>
            to live, and increases his reputation much more by remain­ <lb/>
            ing unhurt than if he were put out of the way. In the <lb/>
            former case he remains as an everlasting testimony to the <lb/>
            valour of his conqueror; whereas if led in the procession of <lb/>
            a triumph he would have soon passed out of sight.1 If, <lb/>
            however, his kingdom also may be safely left in his hands <note type="footnote"> ' The conquered princes who were led through Rome in triumphs <lb/>
            were as a rule put to death when the procession was over. </note> <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXII.] </note> <lb/>
            and he himself replaced upon the throne from which he has <lb/>
            fallen, such a measure confers an immense increase of lustre <lb/>
            on him who scorned to take anything from a conquered <lb/>
            king beyond the glory of having conquered him. To do <lb/>
            this is to triumph even over one's own victory, and to <lb/>
            declare that one has found nothing among the vanquished <lb/>
            which it was worth the victor's while to take. As for his <lb/>
            countrymen, strangers, and persons of mean condition, he <lb/>
            ought to treat them with all the less severity because it <lb/>
            costs so much less to overcome them. Some you would be <lb/>
            glad to spare, against some you would disdain to assert your <lb/>
            rights, and would forbear to touch them as you would to <lb/>
            touch little insects which defile your hands when you crush <lb/>
            them : but in the case of men upon whom all eyes are fixed, <lb/>
            whether they be spared or condemned, you should seize the <lb/>
            opportunity of making your clemency widely known.</p>
          <p>XXII. Let us now pass on to the consideration of <lb/>
            wrongs done to others, in avenging which the law has aimed <lb/>
            at three ends, which the prince will do well to aim at <lb/>
            also: they are, either that it may correct him whom it <lb/>
            punishes, or that his punishment may render other men <lb/>
            better, or that, by bad men being put out of the way, the <lb/>
            rest may live without fear. You will more easily correct <lb/>
            the men themselves by a slight punishment, for he who <lb/>
            has some part of his fortune remaining untouched will <lb/>
            behave less recklessly; on the other hand, no one cares about <lb/>
            respectability after he has lost it: it is a species of impunity <lb/>
            to have nothing left for punishment to take away. It is <lb/>
            conducive, however, to good morals in a state, that punish­ <lb/>
            ment should seldom be inflicted : for where there is a mul­ <lb/>
            titude of sinners men become familiar with sin, shame is <lb/>
            less felt when shared with a number of fellow-criminals, and <lb/>
            severe sentences, if frequently pronounced, lose the influence <lb/>
            which constitutes their chief power as remedial measures. <lb/>
            A good king establishes a good standard of morals for his <pb n="410"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            kingdom and drives away vices if he is long-suffering with <lb/>
            them, not that he should seem to encourage them, but to be <lb/>
            very unwilling and to suffer much when he is forced to <lb/>
            chastise them. Clemency in a sovereign even makes men <lb/>
            ashamed to do wrong : for punishment seems far more <lb/>
            grievous when inflicted by a merciful man.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Besides this, you will find that sins which are <lb/>
            frequently punished are frequently committed. Your father <lb/>
            sewed up more parricides in sacks during five years, than <lb/>
            we hear of in all previous centuries. As long as the greatest <lb/>
            of crimes remained without any special law, children were <lb/>
            much more timid about committing it. Our wise ancestors, <lb/>
            deeply skilled in human nature, preferred to pass over this <lb/>
            as being a wickedness too great for belief, and beyond the <lb/>
            audacity of the worst criminal, rather than teach men that <lb/>
            it might be done by appointing a penalty for doing it: <lb/>
            parricides, consequently, were unknown until a law was <lb/>
            made against them, and the penalty showed them the way <lb/>
            to the crime. Filial affection soon perished, for since that <lb/>
            time we have seen more men punished by the sack than by <lb/>
            the cross. Where men are seldom punished innocence be­ <lb/>
            comes the rule, and is encouraged as a public benefit. If a <lb/>
            state thinks itself innocent, it will be innocent : it will be all <lb/>
            the more angry with those who corrupt the general simpli­ <lb/>
            city of manners if it sees that they are few in number. <lb/>
            Believe me, it is a dangerous thing to show a state how <lb/>
            great a majority of bad men it contains.</p>
          <p>XXIV. A proposal was once made in the Senate to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish slaves from free men by their dress: it was then <lb/>
            discovered how dangerous it would be for our slaves to be <lb/>
            able to count our numbers. Be assured that the same <lb/>
            thing would be the case if no one's offence is pardoned : it <lb/>
            will quickly be discovered how far the number of bad men <lb/>
            exceeds that of the good. Many executions are as disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful to a sovereign as many funerals are to a physician: <pb n="411"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXV.] </note> <lb/>
            one who governs less strictly is better obeyed. The human <lb/>
            mind is naturally self-willed, kicks against the goad, and <lb/>
            sets its face against authority; it will follow more readily <lb/>
            than it can be led. As well-bred and high-spirited horses <lb/>
            are best managed with a loose rein, so mercy gives men's <lb/>
            minds a spontaneous bias towards innocence, and the public <lb/>
            think that it is worth observing. Mercy, therefore, does <lb/>
            more good than severity.</p>
          <p>XXV. Cruelty is far from being a human vice, and is <lb/>
            unworthy of man's gentle mind: it is mere bestial madness <lb/>
            to take pleasure in blood and wounds, to cast off humanity <lb/>
            and transform oneself into a wild beast of the forest. <lb/>
            Pray, Alexander, what is the difference between your <lb/>
            throwing Lysimachus into a lion's den and tearing his <lb/>
            flesh with your own teeth? it is you that have the lion's <lb/>
            maw, and the lion's fierceness. How pleased you would be <lb/>
            if you had claws instead of nails, and jaws that were capable <lb/>
            of devouring men! We do not expect of you that your <lb/>
            hand, the sure murderer of your best friends, should restore <lb/>
            health to any one; or that your proud spirit, that inex­ <lb/>
            . haustible source of evil to all nations, should be satisfied <lb/>
            with anything short of blood and slaughter: we rather call <lb/>
            it mercy that your friend should have a human being <lb/>
            chosen to be his butcher. The reason why cruelty is the <lb/>
            most hateful of all vices is that it goes first beyond the <lb/>
            ordinary limits, and then beyond those of humanity; that <lb/>
            it devises new kinds of punishments, calls ingenuity to aid <lb/>
            it in inventing devices for varying and lengthening men's <lb/>
            torture, and takes delight in their sufferings : this accursed <lb/>
            disease of the mind reaches its highest pitch of madness <lb/>
            when cruelty itself turns into pleasure, and the act of killing <lb/>
            a man becomes enjoyment. Such a ruler is soon cast down <lb/>
            from his throne ; his life is attempted by. poison one day <lb/>
            and by the sword the next; he is exposed to as many <lb/>
            dangers as there are men to whom he is dangerous, and he <pb n="412"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. I. </note> <lb/>
            is sometimes destroyed by the plots of individuals, and at <lb/>
            others by a general insurrection. Whole communities are <lb/>
            not roused to action by unimportant outrages on private <lb/>
            persons; but cruelty which takes a wider range, and from <lb/>
            which no one is safe, becomes a mark for all men's weapons. <lb/>
            Very small snakes escape our notice, and the whole country <lb/>
            does not combine to destroy them; but when one of them <lb/>
            exceeds the usual size and grows into a monster, when it <lb/>
            poisons fountains with its spittle, scorches herbage with its <lb/>
            breath, and spreads ruin wherever it crawls, we shoot at it <lb/>
            with military engines. Trifling evils may cheat us and <lb/>
            elude our observation, but we gird up our loins to attack <lb/>
            great ones. One sick person does not so much as disquiet <lb/>
            the house in. which he lies; but when frequent deaths show <lb/>
            that a plague is raging, there is a general outcry, men take <lb/>
            to flight and shake their fists angrily at the very gods <lb/>
            themselves. If a fire breaks out under one single roof, the <lb/>
            family and the neighbours pour water upon it; but a wide <lb/>
            conflagration which has consumed many houses must be <lb/>
            smothered under the ruins of a whole quarter of a city.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The cruelty even of private men has sometimes. <lb/>
            been revenged by their slaves in spite of the certainty that <lb/>
            they will be crucified: whole kingdoms and nations when <lb/>
            oppressed by tyrants or threatened by them, have attempted <lb/>
            their destruction. Sometimes their own guards have risen <lb/>
            in revolt, and have used against their master all the deceit, <lb/>
            disloyalty, and ferocity which they have learned from him. <lb/>
            What, indeed, can he expect from those whom he has <lb/>
            taught to be wicked ? A bad man will not long be obedient, <lb/>
            and.will not do only as much evil as he is ordered. But <lb/>
            even if the tyrant may be cruel with safety, how miserable <lb/>
            his kingdom must be: it must look like a city taken by <lb/>
            storm, like some frightful scene of general panic. Every­ <lb/>
            where sorrow, anxiety, disorder; men dread even their own <lb/>
            pleasures; they cannot even dine with one another in safety <pb n="413"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXVI.] </note> <lb/>
            when they have to keep watch over their tongues even when <lb/>
            in their cups, nor can they safely attend the public shows <lb/>
            when informers are ready to find grounds for their impeach­ <lb/>
            ment in their behaviour there. Although the spectacles be <lb/>
            provided at an enormous expense, with royal magnificence <lb/>
            and with world-famous artists, yet who cares for amusement <lb/>
            when he is in prison ? Ye gods ! what a miserable life it <lb/>
            is to slaughter and to rage, to delight in the clanking of <lb/>
            chains, and to cut off one's countrymen's heads, to cause <lb/>
            blood to flow freely wherever one goes, to terrify people, <lb/>
            and make them flee away out of one's sight! It is what <lb/>
            would happen if bears or lions were our masters, if serpents <lb/>
            and all the most venomous creatures were given power over <lb/>
            us. Even these animals, devoid of reason as they are, and <lb/>
            accused by us of cruel ferocity, spare their own kind, and <lb/>
            wild beasts themselves respect their own likeness : but the <lb/>
            fury of tyrants does not even stop short at their own <lb/>
            relations, and they treat friends and strangers alike, only <lb/>
            becoming more violent the more they indulge their passions. <lb/>
            By insensible degrees he proceeds from the slaughter of in­ <lb/>
            dividuals to the ruin of nations, and thinks it a sign of <lb/>
            power to set roofs on fire and to plough up the sites of <lb/>
            ancient cities: he considers it unworthy of an emperor to <lb/>
            order only one or two people to be put to death, and thinks <lb/>
            that his cruelty is unduly restrained if whole troops of <lb/>
            wretches are not sent to execution together. True happi­ <lb/>
            ness, on the other hand, consists in saving many men's <lb/>
            lives, in calling them back from the very gates of death, <lb/>
            and in being so merciful as to deserve a civic crown.! No <lb/>
            decoration is more worthy or more becoming to a prince's <lb/>
            rank than that crown " for saving the lives of fellow- <lb/>
            citizens " : not trophies torn from a vanquished enemy, not <note type="footnote"> 1 The " civic " crown of oak-leaves was bestowed on him who had saved <lb/>
            the life of a fellow-citizen in war. It was bestowed upon Augustus, and <lb/>

            crowds and by nations, is godlike : the power of extensive <lb/>
            and indiscrimate massacre is the power of downfall and <lb/>

          <p>I <lb/>
            HA VE been especially led to write about clemency, <lb/>
            Nero Caesar, by a saying of yours, which I remember <lb/>
            having heard with admiration and which I afterwards told <lb/>
            to others : a noble saying, showing a great mind and great <lb/>
            gentleness, which suddenly burst from you without pre­ <lb/>
            meditation, and was not meant to reach any ears but your <lb/>
            own, and which displayed the conflict which was raging <lb/>
            between your natural goodness and your imperial duties. <lb/>
            Your prefect Burrus, an excellent man who was born to <lb/>
            be the servant of such an emperor as you are, was about to <lb/>
            order two brigands to be executed, and was pressing you to <lb/>
            write their names and the grounds on which they were to be <lb/>
            put to death : this had often been put off, and he was insist­ <lb/>
            ing that it should then be done. When he reluctantly pro­ <lb/>
            duced the document and put it into your equally reluctant <lb/>
            hands, you exclaimed: " Would that I had never learned <lb/>
            my letters ! " 0 what a speech, how worthy to be heard <lb/>
            by all nations, both those who dwell within the Roman <lb/>
            Empire, those who enjoy a debatable independence upon <lb/>
            its borders, and those who either in will or in deed fight <lb/>
            against it! It is a speech which ought to be spoken <pb n="416"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            before a meeting of all mankind, whose words all kings <lb/>
            and princes ought to swear to obey: a speech worthy of <lb/>
            the days of human innocence, and worthy to bring back <lb/>
            that golden age. Now in truth we ought all to agree to <lb/>
            love righteousness and goodness; covetousness, which is <lb/>
            the root of all evil, ought to be driven away, piety and <lb/>
            virtue, good faith and modesty ought to resume their <lb/>
            interrupted reign, and the vices which have so long and so <lb/>
            shamefully ruled us ought at last to give way to an age of <lb/>
            happiness and purity.</p>
          <p>II. To a great extent, Caesar, we may hope and expect <lb/>
            that this will come to pass. Let your own goodness of <lb/>
            heart be gradually spread and diffused throughout the <lb/>
            whole body of the empire, and all parts of it will mould <lb/>
            themselves into your likeness. Good health proceeds from <lb/>
            the head into all the members of the body: they are all <lb/>
            either brisk and erect, or languid and drooping, according <lb/>
            as their guiding spirit blooms or withers. Both Romans <lb/>
            and allies will prove worthy of this goodness of yours, and <lb/>
            good morals will return to all the world: your hands will <lb/>
            everywhere find less to do. Allow me to dwell somewhat <lb/>
            upon this saying of yours, not because it is a pleasant sub­ <lb/>
            ject for your ears (indeed, this is not my way ; I would <lb/>
            rather offend by telling the truth than curry favour by <lb/>
            flattery). What, then, is my reason P Besides wishing that <lb/>
            you should be as familiar as possible with your own good <lb/>
            deeds and good words, in order that what is now untutored <lb/>
            impulse may grow into matured decision, I remember that <lb/>
            many great but odious sayings have become part of human <lb/>
            life and are familiar in men's mouths, such as that cele­ <lb/>
            brated " Let them hate me, provided that they fear me," <lb/>
            which is like that Greek verse, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έμοῡ θανόντος</foreign> yata <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρί</foreign>, in which a man bids the earth perish in flame after <lb/>
            he is dead, and others of the like sort. I know not how it <lb/>
            is, but certainly human ingenuity seems to have found it <pb n="417"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            easier to find emphatic and ardent expression for monstrous <lb/>
            and cynical sentiments : I have never hitherto heard any <lb/>
            spirited saying from a good and gentle person. What, <lb/>
            then, is the upshot of all this ? It is that, albeit seldom and <lb/>
            against your will, and after much hesitation, you sometimes <lb/>
            nevertheless must write that which made you hate your <lb/>
            letters, but that you ought to do so with great hesitation <lb/>
            and after many postponements, even as you now do.</p>
          <p>III. But lest the plausible word " mercy " should some­ <lb/>
            times deceive us and lead us into the opposite extreme, let <lb/>
            us consider what mercy is, what its qualities are, and <lb/>
            within what limits it is confined.</p>
          <p>Mercy is " a restraining of the mind from vengeance when <lb/>
            it is in its power to avenge itself," or it is " gentleness shown <lb/>
            by a powerful man in fixing the punishment of a weaker one.'' <lb/>
            It is safer to have more than one definition, since one may not <lb/>
            include the whole subject, and may, so to speak, lose its <lb/>
            cause : mercy, therefore, may likewise be termed a tendency <lb/>
            towards mildness in inflicting punishment. It is possible to <lb/>
            discover certain inconsistencies in the definition which <lb/>
            comes nearer the truth than all the rest, which is to call <lb/>
            mercy " self-restraint, which remits some part of a fine <lb/>
            which it deserves to receive and which is due to it." To <lb/>
            this it will be objected that no virtue ever gives any man <lb/>
            less than his due. However, all men understand mercy to <lb/>
            consist in coming short of the penalty which might with <lb/>
            justice be inflicted.</p>
          <p>IV. The unlearned think that its opposite is strictness: <lb/>
            but no virtue is the opposite of another virtue. What, <lb/>
            then, is the opposite of mercy ? Cruelty: which is nothing <lb/>
            more than obstinacy in exacting punishments. " But," <lb/>
            say you, "some men do not exact punishments, and never­ <lb/>
            theless are cruel, such as those who kill the strangers <lb/>
            whom they meet, not in order to rob them, but for killing's <lb/>
            sake, and men who are not satisfied with killing, but kill <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <pb n="418"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            with savage tortures, like the famous Busiris,l and Pro­ <lb/>
            crustes, and pirates who flog their captives and burn them <lb/>
            alive." This appears to be cruelty : but as it is not the <lb/>
            result of vengeance (for it has received no wrong), and is <lb/>
            not excited by any offence (for no crime has preceded it), <lb/>
            it does not come within our definition, which was limited <lb/>
            to " extravagance in exacting the penalties of wrong­ <lb/>
            doing." We may say that this is not cruelty, but ferocity, <lb/>
            which finds pleasure in savagery : or we may call it mad­ <lb/>
            ness ; for madness is of various kinds, and there is no <lb/>
            truer madness than that which takes to slaughtering and <lb/>
            mutilating human beings. I shall, therefore, call those per­ <lb/>
            sons cruel who have a reason for punishing but who punish <lb/>
            without moderation, like Phalaris, who is not said to have <lb/>
            tortured innocent men, but to have tortured criminals with <lb/>
            inhuman and incredible barbarity. We may avoid hair­ <lb/>
            splitting by defining cruelty to be " a tendency of the mind <lb/>
            towards harsh measures." Mercy repels cruelty and bids <lb/>
            it be far from her: with strictness she is on terms of <lb/>
            amity.</p>
          <p>At this point it is useful to inquire into what pity is; for <lb/>
            many praise it as a virtue, and say that a good man is full <lb/>
            of pity. This also is a disease of the mind. Both of these <lb/>
            stand close to mercy and to strictness, and both ought to <lb/>
            be avoided, lest under the name of strictness we be led <lb/>
            into cruelty, and under the name of mercy into pity. It is <lb/>
            less dangerous to make the latter mistake, but both lead us <lb/>
            equally far away from the truth.</p>
          <p>V. Just as the gods are worshipped by religion, but are <lb/>
            dishonoured by superstition, so all good men will show <lb/>
            mercy and mildness, but will avoid pity, which is a vice <lb/>
            incident to weak minds which cannot endure the sight of <lb/>
            another's sufferings. It is, therefore, most commonly <note type="footnote"> 1 A king of Egypt, who sacrificed strangers, and was himself slain by <lb/>
            Hercules. </note> <pb n="419"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            found in the worst people; there are old women and girls 1 <lb/>
            who are affected by the tears of the greatest criminals, and <lb/>
            who, if they could, would let them out of prison. Pity <lb/>
            considers a man's misfortunes and does not consider to <lb/>
            what they are clue: mercy is combined with reason. I <lb/>
            know that the doctrine of the Stoics is unpopular among <lb/>
            the ignorant as being excessively severe and not at all <lb/>
            likely to give kings and princes good advice; it is blamed <lb/>
            because it declares that the wise man knows not how to <lb/>
            feel pity or to grant pardon. These doctrines, if taken <lb/>
            separately, are indeed odious, for they appear to give men <lb/>
            no hope of repairing their mistakes but exact a penalty <lb/>
            for every slip. If this were true, how can it be true <lb/>
            wisdom to bid us put off human feeling, and to exclude <lb/>
            us from mutual help, that surest haven of refuge against <lb/>
            the attacks of Fortune ? But no school of philosophy is <lb/>
            more gentle and benignant, none is more full of love to­ <lb/>
            wards man or more anxious to promote the happiness of <lb/>
            all, seeing that its maxims are, to be of service and assis­ <lb/>
            tance to others, and to consult the interests of each and <lb/>
            all, not of itself alone. Pity is a disorder of the mind <lb/>
            caused by the sight of other men's miseries, or it is a sad­ <lb/>
            ness caused by the evils with which it believes others to be <lb/>
            undeservedly afflicted: but the wise man cannot be affected <lb/>
            by any disorder: his mind is calm, and nothing can pos­ <lb/>
            sibly happen to ruffle it. Moreover, nothing becomes a <lb/>
            man more than magnanimity: but magnanimity cannot co- <lb/>
            exist with sorrow. Sorrow overwhelms men's minds, casts <lb/>
            them down, contracts them : now this cannot happen to the <lb/>
            wise man even in his greatest misfortunes, but he will beat <lb/>
            back the rage of Fortune and triumph over it: he will <note type="footnote"> 1 " Three or four wenches where I stood, cried Alas, good soul!-' <lb/>
            and forgave him with all their hearts : but there's no heed to be taken <lb/>
            of them ; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no <lb/>
            less."-" Julius Caesar," act i. sc. 2. </note> <pb n="420"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            always retain the same calm, undisturbed expression of <lb/>
            countenance, which he never could do were he accessible <lb/>
            to sorrow.</p>
          <p>VI. Add to this, that the wise man provides for the <lb/>
            future and always has a distinct plan of action ready: yet <lb/>
            nothing clear and true can flow from a disturbed source. <lb/>
            Sorrow is awkward at reviewing the position of affairs, at <lb/>
            devising useful expedients, avoiding dangerous courses, <lb/>
            and weighing the merits of fair and just ones : therefore the <lb/>
            wise man will not feel pity, because this cannot happen to <lb/>
            a man unless his mind is disturbed. He will do willingly <lb/>
            and highmindedly all that those who feel pity are wont to <lb/>
            do; he will dry the tears of others, but will not mingle <lb/>
            his own with them; he will stretch out his hand to the <lb/>
            shipwrecked mariner, will offer hospitality to the exile, <lb/>
            and alms to the needy-not in the offensive way in which <lb/>
            most of those who wish to be thought tender-hearted fling <lb/>
            their bounty to those whom they assist and shrink from <lb/>
            their touch, but as one man would give another something <lb/>
            out of the common stock-he will restore children to their <lb/>
            weeping mothers, will loose the chains of the captive, <lb/>
            release the gladiator from his bondage, and even bury the <lb/>
            carcase of the criminal, but he will perform all this with a <lb/>
            calm mind and unaltered expression of countenance. Thus <lb/>
            the wise man will not pity men, but will help them and be <lb/>
            of service to them, seeing that he is born to be a help to all <lb/>
            men and a public benefit, of which he will bestow a share <lb/>
            upon every one. He will even grant a proportional part of <lb/>
            his bounty to those sufferers who deserve blame and cor­ <lb/>
            rection ; but he will much more willingly help those whose <lb/>
            troubles and adversities are caused by misfortune. When­ <lb/>
            ever he is able he will interpose between Fortune and her <lb/>
            victims: for what better employment can he find for his <lb/>
            wealth or his strength than in setting up again what <lb/>
            chance has overthrown? He will not show or feel any <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            disgust at a man's having withered legs, or a flabby <lb/>
            wrinkled skin, or supporting his aged body upon a staff; <lb/>
            but he will do good to those who deserve it, and will, like <lb/>
            a god, look benignantly upon all who are in trouble. Pity <lb/>
            borders upon misery: it is partly composed of it and partly <lb/>
            derived from it. You know that eyes must be weak, if <lb/>
            they fill with rheum at the sight of another's blearedness, <lb/>
            just as it is not real merriment but hysteria which makes <lb/>
            people laugh because others laugh, and yawn whenever <lb/>
            others open their jaws: pity is a defect in the mind of <lb/>
            people who are extraordinarily affected by suffering, and he <lb/>
            who requires a wise man to exhibit it is not far from <lb/>
            requiring him to lament and groan when strangers are <lb/>
            buried.</p>
          <p>VII. But why should he not pardon ?1 Let us decide <lb/>
            by exact definition this other slippery matter, the true <lb/>
            nature of pardon, and we shall then perceive that the wise <lb/>
            man ought not to grant it. Pardon is the remitting of a <lb/>
            deserved punishment. The reasons why the wise man <lb/>
            ought not to grant this remission are given at length by <lb/>
            those of whom this question is specially asked: I will <lb/>
            briefly say, as though it were no concern of mine to decide <lb/>
            this point, " A man grants pardon to one whom he ought <lb/>
            to punish : now the wise man does nothing which he <lb/>
            ought not to do, and omits to no nothing which he ought <lb/>
            to do: he does not, therefore, remit any punishment which <lb/>
            he ought to exact. But the wise man will bestow upon <lb/>
            you in a more honourable way that which you wish to <lb/>
            obtain by pardon, for he will make allowances for you, <lb/>
            will consult your interests, and will correct your bad <lb/>
            habits : he will act just as though he were pardoning you, <lb/>
            but nevertheless he will not pardon you, because he who <lb/>
            pardons admits that in so doing he has neglected a part of <note type="footnote"> L See above, chap. v. </note> <pb n="422"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. II. </note> <lb/>
            his duty. He will only punish some people by reprimand­ <lb/>
            ing them, and will inflict no further penalty if he considers <lb/>
            that they are of an age which admits of reformation: some <lb/>
            people who are undeniably implicated in an odious charge <lb/>
            he will acquit, because they were deceived into committing, <lb/>
            or were not sober when they committed the offence with <lb/>
            which they are charged : he will let his enemies depart <lb/>
            unharmed, sometimes even with words of commendation, <lb/>
            if they have taken up arms to defend their honour, their <lb/>
            covenants with others, their freedom, or on any other <lb/>
            honourable ground. All these doings come under the head <lb/>
            of mercy, not of pardon. Mercy is free to come to what <lb/>
            decision it pleases : she gives her decision, not under any <lb/>
            statute, but according to equity and goodness: she may <lb/>
            acquit the defendant, or impose what damages she pleases. <lb/>
            She does not do any of these things as though she were <lb/>
            doing less than justice requires, but as though the justest <lb/>
            possible course were that which she adopts. On the other <lb/>
            hand, to pardon is not to punish a man whom you have <lb/>
            decided ought to be punished; pardon is the remission <lb/>
            of a punishment which ought to be inflicted. The first <lb/>
            advantage which mercy has over it is that she does <lb/>
            not tell those whom she lets off that they ought to have <lb/>
            suffered : she is more complete, more honourable than <lb/>
            pardon."</p>
          <p>In my opinion, this is a mere dispute about words, and <lb/>
            we are agreed about the thing itself. The wise man will <lb/>
            remit many penalties, and will save many who are wicked, <lb/>
            but whose wickedness is not incurable. He will act like <lb/>
            good husbandmen, who do not cultivate only straight and <lb/>
            tall trees, but also apply props to straighten those which <lb/>
            have been rendered crooked by various causes; they trim <lb/>
            some, lest the luxuriance of their boughs should hinder <lb/>
            their upward growth, they nurse those which have been <pb n="423"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            weakened by being planted in an unsuitable position, and <lb/>
            they give air to those which are overshadowed by the <lb/>
            foliage of others. The wise man will see the several treat- <lb/>
            ments suitable to several dispositions, and how what is <lb/>
            crooked may be straightened....</p>
          <p>THE END.</p>
