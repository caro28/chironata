          <p>THE prose translation of Propertius in the present <lb/>
            volume is based upon the text of the poet's latest and <lb/>
            best editor, Mr. Paley. Subjoined are metrical versions <lb/>
            of some of the Elegies by Nott and Elton. Dr. Nott <lb/>
            is prone to the use of strangely dissonant rhymes, such <lb/>
            as thee, delay; foretell, feel; traduce, house, &amp;c. It has <lb/>
            been attempted in several instances to remove such <lb/>
            blemishes by the substitution of new lines, enclosed <lb/>
            between brackets, the original reading being given in <lb/>
            a footnote,</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>CYNTHIA'S eyes first took me, poor unfortunate, captive, <lb/>
            previously affected by no passion: then did Love3 cast down <lb/>
            my resolute, disdainful eyes, and set foot on my neck: till in <lb/>
            time he taught me, desperate power! to despise chaste maidens,4 <lb/>
            and to live recklessly. Even now, my present mad pursuit <lb/>
            flags not after a whole year, though I am forced to have the <lb/>
            gods opposed to me. Milanion, Tullus, by shrinking from no <note type="footnote"> 1 Book I.] The title of this used to be " Sex. Aurel. Propertii Cynthia, <lb/>
            Monobiblos," the latter epithet being supported by Ovid, Rem. Am. 764, <lb/>
            " Cujus opus Cynthia, sola fuit." It was written and published before <lb/>
            the author's other works, A. u. c. 728, probably when he was about <lb/>
            twenty years of age, and is quoted by the title of Cynthia in ii. 24, 2, <lb/>
            Quum sit toto Cynthia lecta foro. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Elegy I.] The poet laments the obduracy of Cynthia, who is worse, <lb/>
            he says, than Atalanta, who was, in time, won by Meilanion : he desires <lb/>
            the aid of witches, calls on his friends to extricate him, and concludes <lb/>
            by warning such as are happy in love to be faithful, or they will repent it. <lb/>
            This Elegy is addressed to Tullus, a friend and equal in age of Propertius, <lb/>
            for whom see vi., xiv., xxii.; IV. xxii. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Cf. ii. 30, 9, Tollere nusquam Te patietur humo lumina capta. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 To despise chaste maidens.] Castas odisse puellas: that is, says <lb/>
            Paley, to speak and think of female virtue as mere prudery and affectation, <lb/>
            and to dislike it as presenting an obstacle to possession. Kuinoel under- <lb/>
            stands by it, to hate all girls that were not as loose in conduct as Cyn­ <lb/>
            thia. According to others, the " chaste maids" are Minerva and the <lb/>
            Muses. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>B</unclear> </note> <lb/>

            toils, broke down the stubborn cruelty of the daughter of <lb/>
            Iasus : 1 for once he roamed of yore crazed with love, amid <lb/>
            the caves of Parthenius,2 and tracked the steps of shaggy <lb/>
            wild beasts: stricken too by the club of Hylæus,3 he groaned, <lb/>
            in pain, among Arcadian rocks. Therefore was he able to <lb/>
            tame the swift-footed damsel. Such is the force of prayers <lb/>
            and good deeds in love. In me slow-witted Love devises no <lb/>
            plans, and forgets to travel, as before, in the beaten paths. <lb/>
            Come ye, that are skilled in bringing the moon down from <lb/>
            the sky, and whose dread work it is to solemnize sacred rites <lb/>
            with magic fire, come and turn the heart of my mistress, and <lb/>
            make her more pale than myself. Then I may believe you <lb/>
            able to draw down the stars, and turn the course of rivers by <lb/>
            Cytæan 4 spells. And you, my friends, who attempt too late <lb/>
            to cry me back who am already fallen, find some help for my <lb/>
            wounded heart. I will bear the knife and torturing cautery <lb/>
            unflinchingly: let me but have liberty to speak what my <lb/>
            anger wills. Carry me to the end of the world, or over the <lb/>
            seas, whither no woman can know my track. Remain ye, to <lb/>
            whom the god lends a willing ear, and may ye meet with <lb/>
            kindred feelings, and your love fear no danger. Me my Ve­ <lb/>
            nus torments with bitter nights, and Love at no time grants <lb/>
            me a respite. Avoid, I warn you, this woe; let each hold to <lb/>
            his own beloved one, and let no one abandon his wonted love. <lb/>
            But, if any one shall be slow to heed my warnings, alas ! with <lb/>
            how great grief will he remember my words !</p>

          <p>WHY delight, my life, in walking delicately with hair ela­ <lb/>
            borately decked, and in fluttering the transparent folds of a <note type="footnote"> 1 The daughter of Iasus.] Atalanta, who though velox, a swift-footed <lb/>
            huntress, is not to be confounded with her namesake, the daughter of <lb/>
            Schœnus king of Scyros. </note><note type="footnote"> . 2 Parthenius.] A mountain of Arcadia, on which Atalanta had, in <lb/>
            infancy, been exposed. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Hylæus,] <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑλα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>, (wood-man,) a centaur who attempted to violate <lb/>
            Atalanta and was killed by him : see Ovid, Ar. Am. ii. 191, who makes <lb/>
            him use a bow. </note><note type="footnote"> I Cytæan.] Cyta, in Colchis, was the birth-place of Medea, hence <lb/>
            called (infr. ii. 4, 7) Cytæis : the epithet is equivalent to magic. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> 5 Elegy II.] The poet begs Cynthia not to be so fond of dress, ar­ <lb/>
            guing from nature and the example of ancient heroines, and concludes </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            Coan 1 venture ? Why drench your hair with Syrian 2 myrrh ? <lb/>
            Why set yourself off3 by artificial means, to spoil the grace <lb/>
            of nature by purchased adornment, and not suffer your <lb/>
            limbs to shine in their own loveliness. Believe me, there <lb/>
            is no improving beauty like yours by adventitious aid: ge­ <lb/>
            nuine Love likes not a disguised form. See what beauteous <lb/>
            hues the earth produces ; how ivy grows better at its own <lb/>
            free will; how the arbutus springs more fairly in solitary clefts <lb/>
            of the rock; how the stream runs in channels never formed <lb/>
            by art; how the shore produces, of its own accord, pebbles of <lb/>
            varied hue, the growth of itself; and how birds sing not the <lb/>
            more sweetly by any art. Not in that way did Phœbe,4 the <lb/>
            daughter of Leucippus, set Castor's heart on fire; nor did her <lb/>
            sister, Hilaira,4 make Pollux in love with her by her dress. <lb/>
            Not so, in days of yore, did the daughter of Evenus,5 on the <lb/>
            banks of her father's stream, become the subject of strife be­ <lb/>
            tween Idas and the amorous Phoebus: nor did Hippodamia,6 <lb/>
            that was carried off in the chariot of a stranger, attract her <lb/>
            Phrygian husband by artificial beauty; but she had a face in­ <lb/>
            debted to no gems, and a skin like that seen on the canvass of <lb/>
            Apelles. Their aim was not to get lovers from every quarter : <lb/>
            modesty, beauty enough in itself, was theirs. I fear not now <note type="footnote"> by assuring her that he will ever love her for her mental gifts, provided <lb/>
            that she will live more modestly. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Coan.] Cos (Stanco), an island in the Ægean Sea, was celebrated for <lb/>
            its delicate silks. See Hor. Od. iv. 13, 13; Tibull. ii. 3, 57. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Syrian.] Oronteus, from Orontes, the river on which was Antioch, the <lb/>
            capital of Syria. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Vendere. Cf. Juv. vii. 136, Vendunt amethystina. </note><note type="footnote"> * Phœbe—Hilaira.] Phœbe was a priestess of Athena, and Hilaira of <lb/>
            Artemis : they were carried off and married by the Dioscuri, and bore <lb/>
            them children. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The daughter, &amp;c.] Marpesa, the daughter of Evenus, was carried <lb/>
            off by Idas, the son of Aphareus; Phœbus Apollo, who was also her <lb/>
            suitor, chased and overtook them, whereupon Idas and he fought for the <lb/>
            maiden, till separated by Jupiter, who left the decision with Marpesa, and <lb/>
            she chose Idas. Her father had, at the first. pursued Idas and her, to the <lb/>
            banks of the Lycormas, and, on not being able to come up with them, <lb/>
            had thrown himself into the river, which was ever afterwards called by <lb/>
            his name. </note><note type="footnote"> • 6 Hippodamia.] She was the daughter of Œnomaus, king of Pisa <lb/>
            in Elis, and was married by Pelops, after he had treacherously vanquished <lb/>
            her father in the chariot-race, and killed him.: See Eur. Iph. T. ad <unclear/> <lb/>

            lest you appear to me less worthy than these,-if she please <lb/>
            one man a girl is sufficiently adorned,-since Phœbus favours <lb/>
            you especially with his gift of song, and Calliope willingly <lb/>
            adds the Aonian lyre;1 a surpassing sweetness is not want­ <lb/>
            ing in your language, and you have everything that Ve­ <lb/>
            nus or Minerva loves. With these gifts you shall always <lb/>
            be most pleasing to me, provided that you despise paltry <lb/>
            gauds.</p>

          <p>LIKE to the Gnossian maid3 as she lay, exhausted, on the <lb/>
            solitary shore, whilst the ship of Theseus sped away ; like to <lb/>
            Andromeda,4 the daughter of Cepheus, as she slept in her first <lb/>
            sleep, released, at length, from the hard rocks ; or like as <lb/>
            when a Bacchante,5 wearied with constant dancing, falls down <lb/>
            on the banks of the grassy Apidanus :6 like to these did Cyn­ <lb/>
            thia, with her head resting at ease on her hands, seem to me <lb/>
            to breathe softly in her slumber, while I, drunk with much <lb/>
            wine, walked with tottering gait, and the boys shook the <lb/>
            torches at the midnight hour. I tried to lay myself gently on <lb/>
            the couch by her side, having not yet lost all my senses ; and <lb/>
            although doubly fired, and urged on one side by Love, on the <lb/>
            other by Bacchus, each a powerful god, to place my arm un­ <lb/>
            der her gently as she lay, and to put my hand to her lips <note type="footnote"> 1 Aonian lyre.] Aonia was a district in Bœotia, so called after Aon, <lb/>
            the son of Poseidon: hence the Muses, from frequenting Mt. Helicon in <lb/>
            Bœctia, are called Aoniæ sorores. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Elegy III.] The poet, coming home elevated with wine, finds Cyn­ <lb/>
            thia asleep, but will not wake her: the moonlight at length arousing her, <lb/>
            she reproaches him with leaving her so long. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, king of Crete, whom Theseus <lb/>
            deserted at Naxos. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Andromeda.] The daughter of Cepheus, king of Æthiopia, and Cas­ <lb/>
            siopeia: her mother boasted of her beauty, and said that she surpassed <lb/>
            the Nereids; for this the country was inundated, and a sea-monster sent <lb/>
            into the land. The giving of Andromeda to the monster stopped these <lb/>
            two visitations. Perseus found her in that situation; slew the monster; <lb/>
            and married her. See Ovid, Met. iv. 663 seq. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 A Bacchante.] The Edones were a people in Thrace, one of the <lb/>
            principal seats of Bacchantic worship, whence Edonis signifies " a Bac.<lb/>
            abante.”</note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> 6 Apidanus, was a river in Thessaly, tributary to the Peneus; now <lb/>

            and steal a kiss; yet I dared not disturb the rest of my mis­ <lb/>
            tress, fearing her stinging reproaches that I had before expe­ <lb/>
            rienced : but I remained as I was, with my eyes fixed on her <lb/>
            in ardent gaze, as Argus at the first sight of the horns of To <lb/>
            the daughter of Inachus. At one time I loosened the chaplets <lb/>
            from my forehead, and placed them on your temples, Cynthia: <lb/>
            at another I amused myself by confining your truant tresses, <lb/>
            or placing apples, stealthily, in the hollows of your hands: <lb/>
            and I gave all my gifts to thankless sleep, gifts that often <lb/>
            slipt from your slant bosom. And whenever at times your <lb/>
            form moved and you heaved a sigh, my credulous soul was <lb/>
            confounded by the idle presage, lest any unwonted vision was <lb/>
            affrighting you ; lest some one was forcing you against your <lb/>
            will to be his. At length, piercing through the casement op­ <lb/>
            posite her couch, the Moon, the officious Moon, with light <lb/>
            that should have lingered, opened, by its gentle beams, her <lb/>
            closed eyelids. Then resting on her elbow on the downy couch, <lb/>
            " So, at last," she said, " another's contemptuous treatment has <lb/>
            driven you from her closed doors, back to my bed. Where <lb/>
            have you been spending the long hours of a night promised to <lb/>
            me, and now come wearied to me, when the stars are gone ? <lb/>
            May you, wretch, endure the agony of such nights as you are <lb/>
            constantly bidding me have, to my sorrow. At one time I <lb/>
            tried to drive away sleep by my purple embroidery, and when <lb/>
            tired of that, then with playing on my Orphean lyre. At <lb/>
            one time, in my solitude, I kept quietly groaning over the <lb/>
            long time spent by you in another's embrace : until, at last, <lb/>
            slumber fanned me with his soft wings, and bade me yield ; <lb/>
            that was the last remedy for my tears.</p>

          <p>WHY do you try, Bassus, by praising so many maids, to make <lb/>
            me change and leave my mistress ? Why will you not suffer <lb/>

            which I am more accustomed. Though you talk of the beauty <lb/>
            of Antiope,l the daughter of Nycteus, and extol to the skies <lb/>
            the Spartan Hermione,2 and all that an age famed for pro­ <lb/>
            ducing fair women bore, Cynthia will not allow them to have <lb/>
            any name: much less, if she be compared with trivial beauties, <lb/>
            needs she fear the disgrace of being pronounced inferior even <lb/>
            by a fastidious judge. But this forms the slightest portion of <lb/>
            my passion for her ; there are more weighty reasons, Bassus, <lb/>
            for which I am contented to perish with love: her native hue, <lb/>
            the grace in every limb, and the delights that her embraces <lb/>
            yield. Besides, the more you strive to part our loves, the more <lb/>
            will each of us continue to baffle you, as we have pledged our <lb/>
            faith. You shall not have the credit of this with impunity: <lb/>
            the girl, whose love for me approaches to madness, shall know <lb/>
            of it, and she will become your enemy, and no silent one. <lb/>
            Cynthia will no longer, after this, match me with you, nor will <lb/>
            she go to you herself; she will remember so heavy a scandal; <lb/>
            and, in anger, will go round to all the other girls, and inform <lb/>
            of you : alas, you will be welcome at no threshold. No altar <lb/>
            will she pass without shedding tears, and no hallowed stone, <lb/>
            what, and wherever it may be: no loss more heavy can be­ <lb/>
            fall Cynthia, than to have her guardian-goddess leave her, <lb/>
            and carry away her lover, myself especially. May she ever <lb/>
            continue in this mind, I pray, and may I never find anything <lb/>
            in her to complain of.</p>

            and trying to devise something for a stern mistress. I am forced <lb/>
            to obey not so much my natural bent as my woe, and to com­ <lb/>
            plain of my hard fate in life. In this task my allotted span is <lb/>
            consumed; this is my glory; it is from this that I hope my <lb/>
            poetic fame will arise. Let me be celebrated as having been <lb/>
            the sole favourite of an accomplished girl, and as having often <lb/>
            endured her unjust reproaches. Let a despised lover, hence­ <lb/>
            forth, read me constantly, and may the knowledge of my woes <lb/>
            benefit him. If the boy Cupid shall have pierced you also <lb/>

            dle of a stream.3 You are not yet pale, nor touched by a true <lb/>
            flame of love: this is but the first spark of the coming ill. <lb/>
            Then indeed you will be desirous of engaging with Arme­ <lb/>
            nian tigresses, and experiencing the torture of the infernal <lb/>
            wheel,4 rather than feel young Love's shaft so often in your <lb/>
            vitals, and be able to deny your angry fair one nothing. To no <lb/>
            one has any love-affair been so faciles as not to have had its <lb/>
            checks occasionally. Moreover, be not deluded by the thought <lb/>
            that she is quite at your command: for if a woman is one's own, <lb/>
            Ponticus, she makes her way into our affections so much the <lb/>
            more deeply; for in that case one may not turn away one's <lb/>
            eyes, and let them roam, nor does love allow one to keep <lb/>
            awake on any other account ? Love is not manifest, un­ <lb/>
            til one is brought into close contact with the beloved object. <lb/>
            Whoever thou art, shun constant blandishments. To them <lb/>
            flints and oaks must fain yield, much less canst thou resist, 0 <lb/>
            man inconstant as the breeze. Wherefore, if ashamed, confess <lb/>
            your errors as soon as possible. To confess one's pangs, is often <lb/>
            a relief in love. <note type="footnote"> 1 Built by the lyre.] The stones composing the walls of Thebes moved <lb/>

          <p>0 HAPPY night, on which I shared your tears of joy, and <lb/>
            was witness to your first declaration of love ! Oh the delight <lb/>
            that I have in recalling that night! how often is its remem­ <lb/>
            brance to be appealed to in my prayers ! It was then I saw <lb/>
            you, Gallus, dying in the embrace of a maid, and spending <lb/>
            long hours of converse with her. Though sleep was weighing <lb/>
            down my wearied eyes, and the moon was blushing in her <lb/>
            chariot from the middle of the sky; yet I could not withdraw <lb/>
            from witnessing your sport, so ardent was the affection ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in your intercourse. But since you did not fear to <lb/>
            intrust me with your love, accept a token of the pleasure that <lb/>
            I received. Not only have I learnt to be silent on your love­ <lb/>
            pains ; there is something in me, my friend, more than mere <lb/>
            secrecy. I have the power of re-uniting parted lovers ; I can <lb/>
            open the door of a coy mistress; and I can cure the fresh <lb/>
            anxieties of another,-there is no ordinary healing power in <lb/>
            my words. Cynthia has taught me what, on all occasions, <lb/>
            should be made sure of, and what guarded against. Love is <lb/>
            not entirely idle. Beware of desiring to resist a girl if angry, <lb/>
            or of talking big, or of being long silent: and, if she ask any­ <lb/>
            thing, put not on a stern brow and deny it, and let not her <lb/>
            gentle words of blandishment fall in vain on your ear. When <lb/>
            neglected, she becomes angry, and once offended, knows not <lb/>
            how to lay aside her just indignation. But the more humble <lb/>
            and yielding to love you are, the more will you, in many <lb/>
            cases, feel the good effect of it. He will be able to remain <lb/>
            happy with one maid, whose bosom never knows a respite <lb/>
            from love. <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy X.] Gallus (see Elegy v.) had made Propertius his confi­ <lb/>
            dant in a love-affair: the poet expresses his gratitude for that proof of <lb/>

          <p>WHILE enjoying yourself, Cynthia, in central Baiæ,2 where <lb/>
            extends the path3 made by Hercules to the shore, and while <lb/>

            when her guardian is removed, and to forget the gods of mu­ <lb/>
            tual love by which she is bound. I say not this as though you <lb/>
            were not fully known to me, and of approved honour; but <lb/>
            in this point every love brings anxiety with it. Forgive <lb/>

          <p>WHY do you ceaselessly charge me with indolence, as <lb/>
            though I lingered in Rome, the conscious scene of my passion ? <lb/>
            Cynthia is separated from my bed as many miles as the Hy­ <lb/>
            panis2 is from the Venetian Eridanus; she no longer cherishes <lb/>
            my wonted love in her embrace, nor does her sweet voice <lb/>
            sound in my ear. Once I was dear to her: in those days <lb/>
            there was none whose lot it was to love with such true return. <lb/>
            Have I become the mark of envy ? Has some god crushed <lb/>
            me ? Or the herb, which, culled on the peaks of Caucasus,3 <lb/>
            causes separation ? I am not what I once was: a long jour­ <lb/>

            in a short time ! Now for the first time am I compelled to <lb/>
            feel the misery of long lonely nights, and to weary my own ears <lb/>
            with my groans. Happy he, that can weep in presence of his <lb/>
            mistress ; Love takes no little joy in gushing tears.4 If con­ <lb/>
            tempt can alter the warmth of love, there is also pleasure in <lb/>
            changing one's bondage. I can neither love another, nor quit <lb/>
            my present mistress: Cynthia was my first, Cynthia shall be <lb/>

          <p>You will rejoice as usual at my misfortune, Gallus, and at <lb/>
            my being forced, now that my love is taken away, to spend <lb/>
            my time alone. But I will not, traitor, imitate your cry: <lb/>
            may no girl ever wish to deceive you, Gallus. Whilst your <lb/>
            fame grows by deceiving girls, and, true to your principles, <lb/>
            you never care to form a long attachment, already lost in love <lb/>
            for a certain charmer, you are, beginning to pine with cares <lb/>
            that have come upon you at last, and to own yourself beaten <lb/>
            at the first fall.2 This will be welcome vengeance to the <lb/>

            from spiteful gossip, or from divination: I have seen it my­ <lb/>

            the unconquered youthful hero had gone farther to obtain <lb/>
            water, of which there was but little there, from a retired <lb/>
            fountain. Him followed two brothers, the offspring of Aquilo, <lb/>
            Zetes and Calais,2 and flew to snatch kisses as they hung <lb/>
            on balanced wings, to carry off kisses from his upturned <lb/>
            face, each flying away in turn. Now he is lifted from the <lb/>
            ground, and hid beneath the wing of either; now he wards off, <lb/>

            There was in that place a spring, beneath the crest of Mount <lb/>
            Arganthus, a liquid abode, loved by the Thynian Nymphs; <lb/>
            over it from the boughs of the trees in that wilderness hung <lb/>
            dewy apples indebted to no care, and around, in the water- <lb/>
            meadow, rose fair lilies, grouped with purple poppies. At <lb/>
            one time, plucking the tops from these, with delicate hand, in <lb/>
            boyish sport, he preferred the flowers to the task he had <lb/>
            undertaken ; at another, bending, in guileless security, over <lb/>
            the pretty ripples, he lingered in his wanderings to look play­ <lb/>
            fully at himself in the water. At length he prepares to dip <lb/>
            in his hands and draw some of the water, leaning on his <lb/>
            right arm that he might bring up a plentiful supply: immedi­ <lb/>
            ately the Dryad Nymphs, smitten with his beauty, left, in <lb/>
            wonder, their accustomed dances, and gently drew him, as he <lb/>
            leant forward, into the yielding stream. Then Hylas made <lb/>
            a sound with his ravished body: Alcides responded4 again <lb/>
            and again from afar; but the breeze carried the name he <lb/>

            Calliope inspires my strains, nor Apollo ; it is my girl herself <lb/>

            of Coan dye, the whole of the present piece will be of the <lb/>
            Coan dress. If I see her hair flowing in disorder over her <lb/>
            brow, she walks proudly rejoicing in the praises of her <lb/>
            hair. If she has struck a tune on the lyre with fingers <lb/>

            Gifts like those are no fruit of human birth: ten months <lb/>

            my mistress on earth : thy form is the most beauteous, after <lb/>
            Helen, that the earth has seen. Can I now wonder at the <lb/>
            youth burning with love for thee ? It were more glorious for <lb/>
            thee, 0 Troy, to have perished through her. Once I used to <lb/>
            wonder at a girl having been the cause of bringing so many <lb/>
            warriors from Europe and Asia to Troy: now, 0 Paris, I <lb/>

            beauty was worthy even of the death of Achilles : even Priam <lb/>

          <p>You must first complain of many wrongs in your mistress, <lb/>

            to walk as if in health, and suddenly his friends are thunder­ <lb/>

            is a thing against which there is no preservative. For to what <lb/>

          <p>Is it true, Cynthia, that you are becoming the town's talk <lb/>

            Did I deserve this ? You shall pay me the penalty, treacherous <lb/>

            Chastity for maidens' use, when any married woman may be <lb/>
            what she pleases ? The hand that first traced indelicate <lb/>

            corrupted the eyes, hitherto unsullied, of maidens, and would <lb/>

          <p>THINK you not that he had hands of marvellous skill who­ <lb/>
            ever first painted Love as a boy?2 He first saw that lovers <lb/>
            live careless of everything, and that great blessings are lost <lb/>
            with indifference. Not without a meaning did he add supple <lb/>
            pinions, and make the god flit in the human heart. For in <lb/>
            truth we lovers toss up and down on the waves, and the <lb/>
            breeze that wafts us remains settled nowhere. Rightly, too, <lb/>
            is his hand armed with barbed arrows, while his Gnossian <lb/>
            quiver hangs from his two shoulders.3 For he strikes us <lb/>
            before we can see the foe and be on our guard, and from that <lb/>
            wound no one recovers. In me his darts are left; the image <lb/>
            of the boy is also present, but he has certainly lost his wings; <lb/>
            for he never flies from my breast, and is constantly warring <lb/>
            with my heart's blood. What pleasure canst thou find in <lb/>
            dwelling in marrowless bones.? if thou hast any feelings of <lb/>
            shame, transfer thy darts elsewhere. It were more satisfactory <lb/>
            to try that poison of thine on the heart-whole : it is not I, <lb/>
            but my emaciated shadow, that is smarting : if you destroy it, <lb/>
            who will there be to sing of such subjects ? This muse of <lb/>
            mine, low in degree though it is, is a great glory to thee, in <lb/>
            that it sings of the head, and the fingers, and the black eyes <lb/>
            of my mistress, and of her feet that touch the ground so <lb/>
            lightly as she goes. <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy III.] An elegant little poem on the symbolism embodied in <lb/>

            this : the quiver when not in use hung at the back from both shoulders; <lb/>
            when used it was pulled to one side, and so was suspended only from the <lb/>
            opposite shoulder. In this case Love holds the barbed arrow ready in <lb/>
            his hand, because (quoniam) he aims instantaneously, and does not wait <lb/>
            to draw the arrow from the quiver.”—Paley. </note> <pb n="42"/>

            nor was Ulysses so delighted at having brought his wander­ <lb/>
            ings to an end, and touched the dear shores of Ithaca;2 nor did <lb/>
            Orestes' sister Electra joy so much on seeing him safe, whose <lb/>
            bones she fancied that she had held, to her sorrow; nor did <lb/>
            the daughter of Minos see Theseus with so much delight, <lb/>
            after he had made his way safely out of the Labyrinth by <lb/>
            means of a clue: the joys of all these were not so great as what <lb/>
            I experienced last night: as happy as an immortal shall I be, <lb/>
            if I be blessed with another like it. But whilst, in humble <lb/>
            guise, I walked with downcast head, I was called more worth­ <lb/>
            less than a dry tank.4 No longer does she seek to answer me <lb/>
            by cold disdain, nor has she the heart to sit unmoved while I <lb/>
            am weeping. Oh that I had not known this treatment so late ! <lb/>
            it is offering medicine to a man's ashes.-Before my feet, blind <lb/>
            that I was, a path was open as clear as day :-to be sure, <lb/>
            when mad with love no one can see.-This is what I have <lb/>
            found to answer best: Answer contempt with contempt, <lb/>
            lovers; in this way any mistress that has refused yesterday <lb/>
            will come to-day. Others were knocking in vain at her door <lb/>
            and calling for my mistress; the girl was kind to me, and <lb/>
            leaned her head on my bosom. This victory is better in my <lb/>
            eyes than to conquer the Parthians: this shall be my spoils, <lb/>

          <p>On happy I! Oh night, lovely in my eyes ! and oh bed, <lb/>
            made happy by my pleasures ! How many soft words we inter- <lb/>
            changed when the light was by, how we strove together when <lb/>
            it was removed ! Now she wrestled with me with bare breasts : <lb/>
            now she covered them with her dress and delayed me. She <lb/>
            now opened with a kiss my eyes that were closed in slumber, <lb/>
            and said, " Is this the way you mean to lie, sluggard ? " How <lb/>
            variously our embracing arms intertwined! how long did my <lb/>
            kisses linger on your lips! I like not to have the joys of <lb/>
            Venus spoiled by darkness. Let me tell you, if you know it <lb/>
            not, the eyes are the leaders in Love's warfare.</p>
          <p>Paris himself is said to have been smitten with love on see­ <lb/>
            ing Helen naked, as she came from the chamber of Menelaus. <lb/>
            Naked, too, Endymion is said to have captivated the sister of <lb/>
            Phoebus, and to have slept with a naked goddess. So if you <lb/>
            lie down with any clothing on, you shall feel my hands as I <lb/>
            tear it from you. Nay, if my passion carry me any further, <lb/>
            you will have bruised arms to show to your mother.. Yours <lb/>
            are not yet the flaccid breasts that forbid amorous dalli­ <lb/>
            ance ; let any girl, who is ashamed of being a mother, look <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>While the Fates allow, let us feed our eyes with love: a <lb/>
            long night is coming for you, and no returning day. Oh that <lb/>
            you were willing we should be bound thus close : would that <note type="footnote"> 1 Spoils.] Exuviæ signify the favours of Cynthia wrested by Proper­ <lb/>
            tius from his rivals.—Paley. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Elegy VI.] The subject is continued from the last Elegy. The poet <lb/>
            recounts rather freely his amorous enjoyments, reiterates his profession of <lb/>
            ardent affection and fidelity to Cynthia, and extols the j ursuits of low <lb/>
            as the best of all human occupations. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            the Fates might bind us in such a chain1 as never might be <lb/>
            loosed. Take example from a pair of doves, male and female <lb/>
            completely devoted to each other. He that wishes an end to <lb/>
            mad passion is wrong: true love can know no bounds. Sooner <lb/>
            will the land mock farmers by unnatural produce, and the <lb/>
            sun drive his black horses more quickly, the rivers begin <lb/>
            to roll their waters to their source, and the fish be strand­ <lb/>
            ed on the dry channel, than I consent to transfer my pains <lb/>
            elsewhere: hers will I be alive, hers will I be in death. <lb/>
            But if she consent to grant me such nights as the past, even a <lb/>
            year will be a long life for me: if she grant me many, I shall <lb/>
            become immortal by them : in a single night any one may be­ <lb/>
            come equal even to a god. Now if all were willing to live <lb/>
            such a life, and to lie overcome with much wine, we should <lb/>
            have no pitiless steel, nor ships of war; the sea off Actium's 2 <lb/>
            coast would not toss our bones, nor would Rome, so often <lb/>
            beset all round by her own victories, be weary of dishevelling <lb/>
            her hair.3 Posterity may certainly give me this deserved praise, <lb/>
            that I have provoked no god by my intemperance.4 Only, <lb/>
            while it is yet day, do not you fail to grant me the joys of life: <lb/>
            if you give me all the kisses you can, you will give me too <lb/>
            few. Like leaves that drop from the withered garland, and <lb/>
            are seen floating every where in the cups, so, perhaps, to- <lb/>

          <p>THE prætor, Cynthia, a fine prey for you, a source of deepest <lb/>
            vexation to me, is just come from the land of Illyria. Could <lb/>
            he not have lost his life on the Ceraunian rocks ! Oh Nep­ <lb/>
            tune, what gifts would I then offer to thee ! Feasting is now <lb/>
            going on, and tables are piled high, without me : the gate is <lb/>
            now open all night without me. Wherefore, if you are wise, <lb/>
            lose not the chance of the harvest, and pluck the dull brute <lb/>
            while his fleece is thick. Then, when he has spent his sub­ <lb/>
            stance and become poor, bid him sail to some other Illyrias. <lb/>
            Cynthia looks not at rank, nor cares for honours : she always <lb/>
            weighs a lover's purser Venus, help me in my woe, and <lb/>
            make my rival kill himself by incessant indulgence. So then <lb/>
            any one may buy love? Ye gods, it is for unworthy lucre <lb/>
            that a girl loves to perdition. She is constantly sending me to <lb/>
            the ocean to look for gems, and bidding me bring her presents <lb/>
            from Tyre itself. Oh that no one were rich at Rome, and the <lb/>
            emperor himself were content to live in a thatched hut! Mis­ <lb/>
            tresses then could not be bought for gold, and we should <lb/>
            find a girl becoming grey-headed in her attachment to one <lb/>
            man. It is not because you have been away from me for <lb/>
            seven nights, with your fair arms encircling so revolting a <lb/>
            lover, nor because of this one offence of yours, that I appeal <lb/>
            to you, but because, as a general rule, fickleness has always <lb/>
            been allied with beauty. A rude lout is now usurping my <lb/>
            privileges, and, made happy on a sudden, is in possession of <lb/>
            my kingdom. Consider the fatal effect of the present to <lb/>
            Eriphyle,3 and how great the torments with which Creusa4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy VII.] He tells Cynthia that the prætor (i. 8) has returned, <lb/>

            certainly, I should be ashamed, yes, ashamed; unless, as they <lb/>
            say, Love, when disgraceful, has generally deaf ears. Look <lb/>
            at the leader,1 who lately filled the Actian waters with empty <lb/>
            noise, on his soldiers having been denounced. He was com­ <lb/>
            pelled, by infatuated love, to turn his ship about and fly, and <lb/>
            seek a refuge at the end of the empire. This is the valiant <lb/>
            exploit and gallant deed of Cæsar: with the hand that con­ <lb/>
            quered he put an end to war. But all the dresses, emeralds, <lb/>
            and chrysolites of gleaming yellow hue that he has given yon, <lb/>
            may I see fierce storms carry away, and, curses on them, <lb/>
            would that they might become earth or water. Jupiter does <lb/>
            not always smile placidly at lovers' treacheries, nor turn a deaf <lb/>
            ear to prayers. Have you ever heard rumblings all over the <lb/>
            sky, and seen deluges from their lofty abode ? They are not <lb/>
            caused by the Pleiads, nor by watery Orion, nor does the <lb/>
            thunder's wrath fall in that way without a reason: the god <lb/>
            then punishes deceitful girls, since even he has been deceived <lb/>
            and wept. Prize not, then, a dress of Tyrian dye so much <lb/>
            that for its sake you should be filled with fear whenever the <lb/>
            south wind brings clouds.</p>

          <p>DEMOPHOON, you know that, yesterday, many girls pleased <lb/>
            me equally, and you know that many woes are coming upon <lb/>
            me : I walk no streets without suffering: 0 theatres, too fatally <lb/>
            made for my destruction ! If a girl spread her fair arms in <lb/>
            graceful motion, or trill forth varied notes of melody, or if a <lb/>
            fair damsel sit with bosom not entirely covered, or if there <lb/>

            by an Indian gem, my eyes at once look for some object <lb/>
            to smite them fatally. If one of the damsels had looked at all <lb/>
            sternly and forbiddingly on me, a stream like cold water began <lb/>
            to trickle all over my face. Do you ask, Demophoon, why <lb/>

          <p>0 THOU sole object of my care, fairest cause of my sorrow, <lb/>
            since my lot shuts out all hope of "Come often;"2 that <lb/>
            form of thine shall become most celebrated by my writings, <lb/>
            with thy consent, Calvus, and thy leave, Catullus.3 The <lb/>
            soldier, when full of years, lays down his arms and retires, <lb/>
            the time-worn oxen refuse to drag the plough, the rotten <lb/>
            ship rests on the desert shore, and the war-shield, when <lb/>
            battered with age, hangs at ease in the temple; but from <lb/>
            thy love no old age shall part me, live I as long as Tithonus <lb/>
            or Nestor. Were it not better however to serve the stern <lb/>
            tyrant, and to groan in the bull, made by thee, cruel <lb/>
            Perillus ? 4 it were better, too, to have been turned into stone <lb/>
            by the Gorgon's look; nay, even to have endured vultures on <lb/>
            Mount Caucasus. But still will I continue firm : an iron <lb/>
            spear-point wears away with rust, and a flint-rock by re­ <lb/>
            peated drops of water. But love is not worn away5 by ever <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy XVII.] The poet, after declaring that the love-pangs caused <lb/>

            so much sleeping near the threshold of a mistress: it remains <lb/>
            constant, and submits to unmerited threats. Though despised, <lb/>
            it makes overtures of forgiveness ; though hurt, confesses that <lb/>
            it was in the wrong ; and returns of itself, though its feet are <lb/>
            unwilling.1 Thou, too, credulous one, that, in the fulness <lb/>
            of thy amorous fortune, puttest on an air of pride, remember <lb/>
            that no woman has constancy in her long. Does any one <lb/>
            pay vows in the middle of a storm, when even in port a ship is <lb/>
            often wrecked ? Or does any one claim the prize before a race <lb/>
            is finished, before the wheel of his chariot has grazed the goal <lb/>
            for the seventh time ?2 Fallacious are the breezes that seem <lb/>
            to blow favourably in love: if a fall be late in coming, it is <lb/>
            great when it does come. Do thou, meanwhile, though she <lb/>
            may love thee, yet keep thy joy shut up in the silence of thy <lb/>
            heart. For in a love-affair it happens, I know not how, <lb/>
            that a man's proudest words always do him harm. Though <lb/>
            she invite thee repeatedly, be careful to go only once: that <lb/>
            which excites envy does not generally last long. But if the <lb/>
            times of old, and the girls who lived in them, were still in <lb/>
            vogue, I should be what thou art now: I am conquered by <lb/>
            the times. They shall not however change my principles: <lb/>
            let each one know how to follow out his own path. But as <lb/>
            for you that often transfer your attentions from one love to an­ <lb/>
            other, how much does the pain, so caused, torture your eyes! <lb/>
            You see a delicate maid exquisitely fair; you see a brunette ; <lb/>
            either hue attracts you. You see a maid of Grecian form; you <lb/>
            see our own country-women; the beauty of each captivates you. <lb/>
            Be a girl clad in purple, or in plebeian garb; each of them, <lb/>
            individually, inflicts a smarting wound : since one maid brings <lb/>
            quite enough sleeplessness to your eyes, let one be sufficient <lb/>
            evil to every one. <note type="footnote"> 1 Cf. Ovid, Rem. Am. 217, Quanto minus ire voles, magis ire me­ <lb/>

            all the falsehoods that thou hadst told me; and no longer able <lb/>

            sea, perchance, should bear thy name, and the mariner weep, <lb/>
            as he passed over water called after thee! How many were <lb/>
            the vows that I made to Neptune, to Castor and his brother, <lb/>

            If Glaucus had chanced to see thy eyes, thou wouldst have <lb/>
            been made a Nymph of the Ionian main : and the Nereids, fair <lb/>
            Nesæe,4 azure Cymothoë,5 would be carping at thee from <lb/>

            is come when the air is scorchingly hot, and the land is be­ <lb/>

            fault lies not so much in the heat, or in the sky, as in the <lb/>
            frequent contempt cast on the sanctity of the gods. This it <lb/>
            is that destroys hapless maidens, this has destroyed them in <lb/>
            times past; all their vows are carried away by the wind and <lb/>

            those who surpass her in beauty. Have you despised the <lb/>

            suffering the vexations and the many perils of life, a gentler <lb/>
            time will come with your last day. When Io's head was <lb/>
            metamorphosed, she lowed in her youth ; now she is a goddess, <lb/>
            whereas she once drank, as a cow, of the water of the Nile. <lb/>
            Ino, too, was a wanderer on earth in her early years ; her now, <lb/>
            as Leucothoë, the distressed mariner implores. Andromeda <lb/>
            had been made the prey of sea-monsters ; she afterwards <lb/>
            became the glorious wife of Perseus. Callisto3 had wandered, <lb/>
            as a bear, through Arcadian lands; as a star she now directs <lb/>
            the ships by night. But should the Fates bring you speedily <lb/>
            to your last rest, happy will be your lot after burial; you will <lb/>
            be able to tell Semele4 of the danger to which a fair woman <lb/>
            is exposed ; she will believe you, being taught by her own <lb/>
            misfortune; and you will have with unanimous consent the first <lb/>
            place among the Nymphs sung by Homer, and the Heroines. <lb/>
            Now that you are stricken, bear with fate as well as you may; <lb/>
            the divine will, and even the day of doom, can be altered. <note type="footnote"> 1 For the season is come.] The unhealthiness of Rome in summer ant. <lb/>

          <p>As I was tipsily wandering, light of my life, late at night, <lb/>
            without a slave's hand to lead me, I was met by a tiny crowd of <lb/>
            boys,—I know not how many, fear prevented me from counting <lb/>
            them :-some of them seemed to be keeping in store for me <lb/>
            little torches ; others, arrows: some even seemed to be prepar­ <lb/>
            ing bonds for me. They were naked: one of the more mis­ <lb/>
            chievous said, " Seize that man, you know him well. This was <lb/>
            the man: it was for him an angry woman engaged us." He <lb/>
            spoke, and in a minute a rope was round my neck. Thereupon <lb/>
            one bade them pull me into the middle of them: but another said, <lb/>
            " Hang the man for not taking us to be gods. She has been <lb/>
            waiting for you,—more than you deserve,-for whole hours <lb/>
            together; but you, stupid man, are making for I know not <lb/>
            what door. When she has unbound her Sidonian night-cap, <lb/>
            and opened her slumber-laden eyes, there will be wafted to <lb/>
            you odours from no Arabian herbs, but some that Love has <lb/>
            made with his own hands. Spare him now, brothers: see, he <lb/>
            promises to be constant in love ; and, we have now arrived at <lb/>
            the appointed house." So they led me forwards, and put my <lb/>
            garment on me again, and said, " Go now, and learn to stop <lb/>
            at home at nights." It was morning, and I wished to see <lb/>
            whether Cynthia was sleeping by herself: she was alone in bed. <lb/>
            I was thunderstruck: she had never appeared to me more beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, not even when in her purple dress, and when she was <lb/>
            going from her house to tell her dreams to chaste Vesta; <lb/>
            dreams that would hurt neither her nor me. Thus she ap­ <lb/>
            peared when just awake: ah! how powerful, of itself, is a <lb/>
            fair form. " Why act you the spy on your mistress in the <lb/>
            morning?" said she. "Think you that I am like yourself? <lb/>
            I am not so easy: I am contented with one intimate friend, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ten Part of the worship of Io, or Isis, was the abstinence <lb/>
            from conjugal rights for ten nights. See infra, 25, 2. Propertius plainly <lb/>

            either yourself, or some one more truthful than you. There <lb/>
            are no signs of two having been lying in the bed. See, there <lb/>
            is not in my whole body any panting or heaving to indicate <lb/>
            a foregone amorous conflict." She spoke, and preventing me, <lb/>
            with her right hand, from kissing her, bounded away with <lb/>
            her feet in loose slippers. So for my prying work upon so <lb/>
            faithful a mistress, I am turned out of doors. Ever since <lb/>
            then I have not had a happy night.</p>

          <p>WHITHER for flying, madman ? flight is impossible : you <lb/>
            may fly to Tanais, yet Love will ever follow you. Riding in <lb/>

            flight like Mercury's,4 will it be of any use. Love is always <lb/>
            hovering over your head : he hovers over a lover, and alights <lb/>
            with all his weight on free necks. A stern guardian he is, ever <lb/>

            is the crime of love. Let no one charge me with it. Make <lb/>
            up your mind, Cynthia, to dwell with me in a cool grot <lb/>
            on a mossy hill: there shall you see the tuneful Sisters cling <lb/>
            to the rocks, and sing of the delightful thefts of ancient Jove : <lb/>
            of how he was consumed with love for Semele,2 how madly <lb/>
            fond of Io, and how, in the form of a bird,3 he flew to the halls <lb/>
            of Troy. But if there is no one on earth able to resist the <lb/>

          <p>How is it that any one continues to intrust the person of <lb/>
            his mistress to Love ? In that way I have nearly had my girl <lb/>
            snatched from me. I speak from experience ; no one is faith­ <lb/>
            ful in a love matter. Not seldom does every one look after <lb/>
            a beautiful woman as his own prize. That god sets at defiance <lb/>
            laws of kinship, parts friends, and drives to arms perfect <lb/>
            friends. A guest came to the hospitable house of Menelaus, <lb/>
            and proved an adulterer ; and did not the Colchian maid follow <lb/>
            a stranger ? Lynceus, traitor, could you meddle with my dar­ <lb/>
            ling ? did not your hands then fall powerless ? Suppose she <lb/>
            had not been as faithful and true as she was, could you <lb/>
            have lived, and been so guilty? Stab me to the heart, or. <lb/>
            poison me if you please ; only keep off from my mistress. <lb/>
            You shall be my most intimate friend, and closest companion ; <lb/>
            I admit you, my friend, as a master over my property; from <lb/>
            my mistress, from my mistress only, I beg you keep away ; <lb/>
            I cannot bear even Jupiter as a rival. When by myself, I <lb/>
            am jealous of my own shadow, a thing of nought; foolish am <lb/>
            I, and foolish the fear with which I often tremble. The only <lb/>
            reason for my pardoning so great a sin, is that your tongue <lb/>
            erred from excess in wine. Never shall I be deceived by the <lb/>

            sorrowful, and did the servants ply their tasks in melancholy <lb/>

            sort is hurried on by human hands. The earth was too little: <lb/>
            we have added the water to our instruments of death. By art <lb/>
            have we increased the roads to misery provided for us by <lb/>
            Fortune. Can an anchor hold you, whom your own home <lb/>
            could not hold? What, say you, does that man deserve <lb/>
            who finds his native land too little ? All your preparations <lb/>
            are at the mercy of the winds: not a single ship grows old; <lb/>
            even the harbour breaks its faith. With malicious design <lb/>
            did Nature spread out the sea to the avaricious: scarcely <lb/>
            one of your attempts can succeed. The rocks of Capha­ <lb/>
            reus' destroyed the triumphant fleet, when Greece was ship­ <lb/>
            wrecked and dashed on the mighty main. Ulysses, whose <lb/>
            usual skill availed him not on the sea, wept the loss, by de­ <lb/>
            grees, of all his companions. But if Pætus were now con­ <lb/>
            tentedly ploughing his ancestral fields with the oxen, and had <lb/>
            thought that what I am now saying had any weight in it, he <lb/>
            would be living, a welcome guest, under his own roof-tree, <lb/>
            poor, but on land, where a man can have no cause for sorrow. <lb/>
            On land Pætus was not obliged to hear the roaring of the <lb/>

            plank: so many causes united that Pætus might die. Weep­ <lb/>
            ing, he uttered these his last sad words, when the black water <lb/>
            was closing his dying mouth : " Ye gods, in whose power are <lb/>
            the Ægean waves, ye winds, and every wave that is pressing <lb/>
            down my head, whither are ye sweeping me, in the prime of <lb/>

            throw me on the Italian coast: this will be enough for me, if <lb/>
            I do but come to my mother's hands." While saying this, the <lb/>
            wave caught him in an eddy and drew him down : these were <lb/>
            Pætus’ last words, and such was his end. 0 ye hundred <lb/>

          <p>I WAS wondering what the Muses had sent in the morning, <lb/>
            as they stood by my couch at the first blush of day. They <lb/>
            sent a token of my love's birthday, and thrice sounded notes <lb/>
            of joy with their hands. May this day pass without a cloud, <lb/>
            may the winds be hushed in the sky, and may the wave softly <lb/>
            still its violence on the shore. On no sorrowers will I look to- <lb/>

            forget their sorrows and be silent, and let not his mother2 <lb/>

            born with happy omens, arise, and pay to the gods that demand <lb/>
            thy worship their due tribute of prayer. First shake off sleep <lb/>
            by washing with pure water, and curl thy glossy hair with <lb/>
            skilful hand. Next put on the dress with which thou didst first <lb/>
            captivate the eyes of Propertius, and leave not thy head with­ <lb/>
            out a wreath of flowers. And look for the ornaments that set <lb/>
            thee off, that thy beauty may endure, and thy reign with me <lb/>
            last for ever. Then when thou hast crowned the altars and <lb/>
            offered sacrifice of frankincense thereon, and a propitious <lb/>
            flame shall have shone all over the house, prepare a banquet <lb/>
            and let us spend the night in drinking, and let the marble <lb/>
            vase regale the nostrils with essence of saffron. Let the <lb/>
            pipe grow hoarse and breathless with playing for us to <lb/>

            let our festivities drive dull sleep away; and let our merri­ <lb/>

          <p>WHY wonder that a woman sways my life, and deals with <lb/>
            me as her thrall?2 Why charge me with disgraceful want of <lb/>
            spirit because I cannot break the yoke and burst my bonds ? <lb/>
            A sailor predicts the coming of night better than a landsman : <lb/>
            a soldier learns, by his wounds, to fear the conflict. That is <lb/>
            what I used to boast of in my youthful days gone by : do you, <lb/>
            now, learn to fear from my example. It was the Colchian <lb/>
            maid that drove the fire-breathing bulls beneath the adaman­ <lb/>
            tine yoke, and sowed the seeds of fight in the ground that <lb/>
            teemed with armed men,3 and closed the fierce mouth of the <lb/>
            watchful serpent, that the golden fleece might be carried to <lb/>
            the house of Æson. The Mæotian PenthesLea,4 in times gone <lb/>
            by, boldly dared to fight with arrows, on horseback, against <lb/>
            the Grecian crews: after her golden helmet was taken off <lb/>
            and her face was seen, her beauty overcame her conqueror. <lb/>
            Omphale, a Lydian maid that had been dipped in the Gygæan <lb/>
            lake, was so fair that he who had built columns5 as tokens of <lb/>
            having subdued the world, spun at her command;—too soft a <lb/>
            task for a hand hard like his. Semiramis built Babylon, the <lb/>
            city of the Persians, so that she raised a work strengthened <lb/>
            by a brick wall, and two chariots might be driven, in oppo­ <lb/>

            disgrace not to be allowed to die. Those that win are burnt, <lb/>
            and give their person to the flames, and lay their scorched <lb/>

            Happy in days of yore were the peace-loving rustic' youths, <lb/>
            whose orchard and harvest were their wealth. The presents <lb/>
            that they made were quinces1 shaken from the boughs, and <lb/>
            baskets full of scarlet bramble-berries; and violets plucked <lb/>
            with their own hand, shining lilies for the maids to carry in <lb/>
            heaps in their baskets, grapes wrapped in their own leaves, <lb/>
            and a beauteous bird with plumage of various hues. In <lb/>
            those days maids gave secretly, in grots, to woodland men, <lb/>
            kisses bought with such courtesies. A fawn's skin used to <lb/>
            cover lovers completely, and the grass grew high, forming a <lb/>
            natural couch ; the pine waved over them and formed a <lb/>
            pliant shade; it was no sin to see goddesses naked, and the <lb/>
            horned ram, the leader of the flock, brought back, of his own <lb/>
            accord, the sheep, after feeding, to the fold of the shepherd­ <lb/>
            god : and all the gods and goddesses, whose power is in the <lb/>
            country, used to speak encouraging words at the sacrifices <lb/>
            offered in their honour by you, 0 rustics. "Thou shalt2 <lb/>
            hunt the hare, 0 stranger, whoever thou art; and if thou <lb/>
            lookest for a bird in my domain, call me, Pan, from the rock <lb/>
            to join thee, whether thou seekest booty with rod or dog." <lb/>
            But now the groves are deserted and sacrifices are abandoned: <lb/>
            all follow gold, piety being now conquered. Honesty is <lb/>
            driven out by gold: right can be bought by gold : law follows <lb/>
            gold, and decency will soon follow it when law is gone. The <lb/>
            scorched thresholds bear witness to the sacrilege of Brennus3 <lb/>
            while visiting the Pythian abode of the unshorn god. But <lb/>

            the weighty quoits ; she gallops round the course, girds her <lb/>
            snow-white side with the sword, and covers her virgin head <lb/>
            with the hollow brass helmet. She bathes, too, as a warlike <lb/>

            ance with these habits, forbids lovers to retire: one may be with <lb/>
            one's mistress in public. There is no need of anxious fear about <lb/>
            a maid, nor of shutting her up and closely guarding her. No one <lb/>

            road being so thronged. Nor can you find out what look to <lb/>

          <p>So may I, henceforth, know no trouble in love, and never <lb/>
            have to pass a sleepless night without you, as it is true that <lb/>
            when my youthful modesty 3 was covered by the garb of man­ <lb/>
            hood, and I was allowed to tread in the path of love, Lycinna, <lb/>
            influenced (ah me !) by no presents, gave my inexperience <lb/>
            the first nightly lessons in the love in which she was herself <lb/>
            an adept. It is now not much less than three years, during all <lb/>
            which time I scarcely remember ten words passing between <lb/>
            us. Your love has buried all traces of her, and no woman <lb/>

            daughter of Nycteus, the former wife of Lycus, shall be a <lb/>
            warning to you. Ah ! how often did the queen set on fire her <lb/>
            rival's fair hair, and fix her cruel nails in her delicate face : <lb/>
            how often did she make her a handmaiden, and load her with <lb/>
            unfair tasks, and bid her lay her head on the hard ground ! <lb/>
            Often she suffered her to remain in darkness and filth ; often did <lb/>
            she deny her, though fasting, the trifling boon of a cup of water. <lb/>
            "Jupiter," she cried, " wilt thou never help Antiope in such <lb/>
            distress ? the harsh chain galls my hands. If thou art a god, <lb/>
            it is disgraceful to thee that thy damsel should be in bondage : <lb/>

            timid foot, she ran to Cithæron's heights: it was night, and <lb/>
            her wretched bed, the ground, was covered with hoar-frost. <lb/>
            Often, startled by the roar of the swift flowing Asopus, she <lb/>

            the young mother faint and bend her knee. But affection, <lb/>

          <p>IT was midnight, and a letter came to me from my mistress <lb/>
            from Tibur: she bade me come without delay, to where the <lb/>
            hill-tops show the two towers, and where Anio's water falls <lb/>
            into a wide basin. What am I to do ? am I to trust myself <lb/>
            to the darkness that now shrouds the earth, and consequently <lb/>
            fear a violent attack on my person ? But if I put off this <lb/>
            order through fear, the sad result will be more cruel to me <lb/>
            than a nightly enemy. I once offended, and was cast off for <lb/>
            a year: she has no gentle hand for me. But there is no one <lb/>
            able to hurt lovers, for they are charmed; one may walk, then, <lb/>
            in the middle of Sciron's road.2 Any lover may walk in the <lb/>
            middle of the plains of Scythia : no one will be cruel enough <lb/>
            to hurt him. The moon waits on his journey: the stars show <lb/>
            him the rough ground: Love goes before with a torch and <lb/>
            keeps it bright. Fierce and mad dogs turn aside their mouths <lb/>
            though eager to bite: this class of men may walk in safety at <lb/>
            all times. Why, what villain will stain himself with the in­ <lb/>
            significant blood of a lover ?- Venus herself accompanies them <lb/>
            on their solitary way. But if certain death were to follow <lb/>
            any accident that might happen to me, at such a price I would <lb/>
            even buy death. She will bring unguents for my funeral, <lb/>
            and will sit as a guardian at my grave, and deck my remains <lb/>
            with garlands. May the god grant that she lay not my bones <lb/>
            in a crowded spot, where the common herd are constantly <lb/>
            passing. Thus it is that lovers' tombs are dishonoured after <lb/>
            death: may I be laid in a by-path shaded with trees, or may <lb/>
            a heap of sand, in a retired place, fence in my body: I like <lb/>
            not to have my name in the public road. <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy XVI.] The poet, having received at midnight a letter from <lb/>

            Athens here spoken of was ever really made, or even really contemplated. <lb/>
            It may have been a mere threat,-a ruse to alarm the jealousy of Cynthia. <lb/>
            The argument bears some resemblance to the various passages in the first <lb/>

            but one help for it: when I have left the country, love will be <lb/>
            as far from my mind as Cynthia from my eyes. Now, my friends, <lb/>

            farewell, too, 0 damsel, however you feel towards me. Now, <lb/>
            then, I shall ride, a guest of the rude Adriatic waves, and be forced <lb/>
            to approach in prayer the gods that thunder in concert with <lb/>
            the waves. Then, having crossed the Ionian, when my bark <lb/>

            the various charms of your form, so that love feigned you to <lb/>

            compared to the blushing morning, whereas the bloom <lb/>
            on your face has been artificial. What my oldest friends <lb/>

            Naval Phœbus,3 now stands, the cows of Evander strayed <lb/>
            and fed. These temples, now golden, first sprang up in hon­ <lb/>
            our of earthenware gods, and a shrine built in no costly man­ <lb/>
            ner was no disgrace. The Tarpeian sire, too, used to thunder <lb/>

            and of dates varying between A. u. c. 726 and 738. It is the opinion of <lb/>
            Lachmann, in which Hertzberg concurs, that they were not published <lb/>
            during the life of the poet, but collected and edited by his friends; and <lb/>
            he thinks they are generally in a more rude and imperfect state than the <lb/>
            others. However this may be, it is certain that not a few of these post­ <lb/>
            humous poems are of surpassing beauty, and a very high order of poetical <lb/>
            merit. There is a marked difference in style between this Book and the <lb/>
            first, especially in the studied use in the first of long words at the end of <lb/>
            pentameters.—Paley. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Elegy I.] This difficult Elegy, as far as vs. 70, is supposed by Hertz­ <lb/>
            berg to have been designed as a proœmium to a book of Roman Fasti, <lb/>
            undertaken by the poet, probably in the year of the city 726, and just be­ <lb/>
            fore his love for Cynthia, in imitation of the Atria of Callimachus. To <lb/>
            the same work probably belong El. 2, 4, 9, 10, all of which are among <lb/>
            his earliest performances. The latter part of the present Elegy was evi­ <lb/>
            dently added after his attachment had commenced, and was meant as a <lb/>
            kind of apology for not pursuing the historic style of composition further, <lb/>
            but devoting himself to amatory versification. Hence the hospes address­ <lb/>
            ed in vs. 1, originally represented an imaginary stranger to whom the <lb/>
            poet was pointing out the antiquities of the city; the idea of making him <lb/>
            speak in the character of a Babylonian seer seems to have subsequently <lb/>

            itself by steps, was once the brethren's only hearth, and am­ <lb/>
            ple kingdom too. The lofty Curia that is now ornamented <lb/>
            by a prætexta-wearing Senate once held rustic sires, men clad <lb/>
            in coats of skins. The trumpet used to summon the Quirites, <lb/>
            in days of old, to debates: many a time did the original hun­ <lb/>
            dred form a Senate in a meadow. The bellying awnings <lb/>
            were not hanging over the vaulted theatre : the stage did not <lb/>
            smell, as ordinarily now, of saffron. No one busied himself <lb/>
            with looking after foreign gods, when the crowd, all eager at­ <lb/>
            tention, were trembling at the native rite ; their care then was <lb/>
            to celebrate the Palilia 1 with burnt hay, and to perform such <lb/>
            sacrifices as are now renewed from time to time with blood <lb/>
            from the stump of a horse's tail. Vesta was then poor, and <lb/>
            content with a procession of crowned asses : 2 lean oxen used <lb/>
            to drag the humble sacrifices to the temple. Fatted porkers <lb/>
            used to purify the narrow streets, and the shepherd offered, to <lb/>
            the music of a pipe, the entrails of a sheep. The ploughman, <lb/>
            decked with pieces of goat-skin, dealt his leathern blows, from <lb/>
            which custom the licentious Fabian Lupercus3 derives his <lb/>
            rites. The inexperienced soldier shone not then in hostile <lb/>
            armour : they used to fight "naked, and with stakes charred in <lb/>
            the fire. Lycmon, with the goat-skin cap, was the first to <lb/>
            build a general's tent: and the greater part of Tatius' decisions <lb/>
            concerned pastoral matters. Hence came the warlike Titiens, <lb/>
            and Ramnes, and the agricultural Luceres ; hence Romulus <note type="footnote"> casa Romuli, was traditionally said to be the veritable abode of the <lb/>
            founder of Rome, and as such was repaired and kept up even to the time <lb/>
            of the empire. See iii. 7, 20; Ovid, Fast. i. 199. It stood on the Pala­ <lb/>
            tine Hill. Quo sustulit may be simply understood " the spot to which <lb/>
            the hut of Romulus raised itself by steps." This passage confirms Mr. <lb/>
            Macaulay's conjecture (Pref. to Lays of Ancient Rome) that it was re­ <lb/>
            moved from its original site near the Circus.—Paley. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Vs. 18. The Palilia, or Parilia, (pro partu pecorum,) were kept on <lb/>

            made from the coagulated blood of a horse's tail, (whence curtus equus,) <lb/>

            there for the grasping mother: my predictions, .hen, were <lb/>
            true, though I would fain have had it otherwise. I, too, when <lb/>
            Lucina was protracting the labour pains of Cinara, and the <lb/>
            burden of her womb was long in coming forth, said, Offer to <lb/>
            Juno a prayer for deliverance. She is delivered: my books <lb/>
            were in high credit. Such a prediction as this is not put <lb/>
            forth by the sandy cavern-oracle of Jove in Libya,1 nor by <lb/>
            the entrails that declare the will of the gods as revealed to <lb/>
            them, nor by any one skilled in the moving of a raven's wing, <lb/>
            nor does a departed shade declare such from a vessel filled <lb/>
            with magic waters. You must look to the path of the sky, <lb/>
            and its track through the stars, and true oracles must be sought <lb/>
            from the five zones. Calchas shall be a weighty proof of this: <lb/>
            for it was he that loosed from Aulis the ships that were pro­ <lb/>
            perly fast to the rocks, the averters of mischies: 2 he stained a <lb/>
            sword with the blood of the daughter of Agamemnon, and <lb/>
            Atrides, when he started, had his sails defiled with blood. <lb/>
            But the Greeks returned not. 0 plundered Troy, repress thy <lb/>
            tears, and look to the bays of Eubœa. Nauplius3 held up, at <lb/>

            flight to your stars : begin to listen patiently to new themes <lb/>
            of sorrow. Ancient Umbria, well-known district, gave you <lb/>
            birth,—am I false, or have I hit upon your native place ?— <lb/>
            where cloudy Mevania5 sends dews upon the hollow plain, <lb/>

            whereas many oxen used to plough your acres, the melancholy <lb/>
            measuring rod 1 has swept away your carefully-kept lands. In <lb/>
            time, when the golden amulet was taken from your young neck, <lb/>
            and the toga of liberty put on before your mother's gods,2 <lb/>
            then Apollo taught you a little of his own poetry, and forbad <lb/>
            you to thunder forth your eloquence in the jarring forum. <lb/>
            But frame elegies, a tricksome work : make this your camp, <lb/>
            and let the rest of the poet-crowd write after your model. <lb/>
            You will suffer war in Venus' stern campaigns, and will be <lb/>
            a gallant foe to the Loves. For one mistress will render vain <lb/>
            your palms of victory, the produce of all your toil: and <lb/>
            though you may extricate from your chin 3 the firmly-fixed <lb/>
            hook, it will be of no use ; the handle will grasp you with its <lb/>
            knob. At her will you will see light and darkness; no <lb/>
            tear will fall from your eyes, but at her bidding. A thousand <lb/>
            night watches, and the marking of her threshold, will not help <lb/>
            you: for a woman that has made up her mind to deceive, a <lb/>
            keyhole is enough. Now though your ship be tossing in the <lb/>

            or the earth shake and gape from its inmost hollows,fear not: <lb/>

            having deserted the hearths of Volsinium during war-time. <lb/>
            This crowded neighbourhood pleases me: nor do I rejoice in <lb/>
            a temple of ivory: it is enough to be able to see the Roman <lb/>
            forum. The Tiber once flowed this way, and they say that the <lb/>
            sound of oars was heard on the waters. But since he yielded <lb/>
            so much to his nurselings, I am called the god Vertumnus from <lb/>
            the diverting of the stream. Or, again, because we taste the <lb/>
            first fruit of the declining year, a festival is believed to have <lb/>
            been instituted to Vertumnus. For me first does the cluster­ <lb/>
            ing grape grow black and change its colour, and the ears of <lb/>
            corn swell with their milky produce. Here you see sweet <lb/>
            cherries, and autumnal plums, and blood-red mulberries on a <lb/>
            summer's day. The grafter here pays his vows by a chaplet <lb/>
            of apple blossom when the unwilling pear-stock has borne <lb/>
            apples. 0 lying report, you do me wrong. I have another <lb/>
            reason for my name : as regards his own birth, believe a god <lb/>
            only: my nature suits all shapes: change me into any one <lb/>
            that you please ; I shall look well. Dress me in robes of Coan <lb/>
            dye ; I shall become a yielding maid: who can say that I am <lb/>
            not a man when I put on the toga ? Give me a sickle, and <lb/>
            bind my brows with a liay-band ; you will swear that grass has <lb/>
            been cut by my hand. Once I bore arms, and, I recollect, got <lb/>
            praised therefor: with a heavy basket on my head, I was a <lb/>
            reaper. I am not disposed for quarrels ; but put a wreath on <lb/>
            me, and you will cry out that I have got wine in me. Bind <lb/>
            my head with a turban, I shall steal the shape of Bacchus; <lb/>
            also of Phœbus, if you but give me the quill. Throw nets on <lb/>
            my shoulder, and I am a huntsman: but when I take reeds I <lb/>
            am a Faun deity, skilled in catching feathered game. Ver­ <lb/>
            tumnus also adopts the figure of a charioteer, and of one <lb/>
            who nimbly passes his weight from horse to horse. Give <lb/>
            me the means and I will catch fish with a reed: I can also <lb/>
            go as a spruce pedlar with flowing tunics. I can, as a <lb/>
            shepherd, bend me to a staff, or carry roses in baskets in the <lb/>
            middle of the dust of the circus. Why need I add what I get <lb/>
            most credit from, the garden-gifts that my hands approve ? <lb/>
            The blooming cucumber, and the gourd with swelling belly, <lb/>
            and the cabbage tied with the pliant rush, distinguish me: <lb/>
            and not a flower in the meadow buds without first, as is due, <lb/>
            being placed upon my brow to fade. Because, being but one, <lb/>
            I change myself into every shape, my native tongue gave me <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            a name from that circumstance : and thou, 0 Rome, hast given <lb/>
            honour to my fellow Tuscans, whence the Tuscan street has <lb/>
            now its name.1 At the time that the leader Lycomedius came <lb/>
            with his band of allies and crushed the power of the fierce <lb/>
            Sabine Tatius, I saw lines tottering, and weapons brought <lb/>
            low, and foe-men disgracefully turning their backs in flight. <lb/>
            But, 0 father of the gods, grant that, throughout eternity, <lb/>
            the toga-wearing Roman people may pass before my feet. Six <lb/>
            verses remain: you who are hastening on business I will not <lb/>
            detain: this is the extreme end to my descant. I once was <lb/>
            a log of maple, hastily hewn with an adze, and, before Numa's <lb/>
            time, a roughly made god in a city that was dear to me. But, <lb/>
            O Mamurius,3 graver of my statue in brass, may the Oscan soil <lb/>
            not lie heavily on thy clever hands, thou that hadst skill to <lb/>
            cast me so easily and make me take what form thou wouldst. <lb/>
            Thy work is but one, but honour is not given to the work <lb/>
            under one aspect only.</p>

            on all the gates are injurious to me : this is the fourth military <lb/>
            cloak that I am weaving to send to you to the war. Death <lb/>

            all your armour that you have left. Then I grow nervous <lb/>
            because the counterpane slips off the bed, and because the <lb/>

            and how many miles the Parthian steed can run without <lb/>

          <p>I WILL speak of the Tarpeian grove, the disgraceful death <lb/>
            of Tarpeia, and the capture of the ancient shrine of Jove. <lb/>
            There was a grove enclosed within an ivy-clad ravine, with <lb/>
            many a tree rustling in concert with the plash of native <lb/>
            waters, the shady abode of Sylvanus, whither the sweet pipe <note type="footnote"> approved, but not adopted, by Paley. Africus, the old reading, if retained, <lb/>

            called the sheep out of the glare to drink. This fountain <lb/>

            Curia. From this spring Tarpeia drew water for the god­ <lb/>
            dess : an earthenware urn was balanced on her head. And <lb/>
            was one death enough for the wicked girl that wished to de­ <lb/>
            ceive thy fire, 0 Vesta ? She saw Tatius exercising on the <lb/>
            sandy plain, and brandishing his flashing arms about his hel­ <lb/>
            met's yellow plumes. She was struck dumb at the king's <lb/>
            beauty and his royal arms, and her urn fell from her careless <lb/>
            hands. Often she made a pretext of ominous appearances in <lb/>
            the guiltless Moon, and said she must dip her hair in the <lb/>
            stream. Often she took silver-white lilies to propitiate the <lb/>
            Nymphs that the spear of Romulus might not hurt the face <lb/>
            of Tatius: and while ascending the Capitol, built among the <lb/>
            clouds, in the early smoke of evening, and returning thence, <lb/>
            she scratched her arms with the rough brambles: and when <lb/>
            she got back from the Tarpeian citadel she wept over her <lb/>
            love-pangs destined not be tolerated by her neighbour Jove:</p>

            thou, 0 Rome, built on the hills, and Vesta, about to be put <lb/>
            to the blush by my disgrace, farewell. That horse, that horse <lb/>
            shall restore my love to the camp, whose mane Tatius combs, <lb/>
            with his own hands, to the right side. What wonder is it <lb/>

            you no mean dower in the betrayal of Rome. If this please <lb/>
            you not, carry me off, that the Sabine women be not carried <lb/>
            off unavenged, and pay back in turn what you owe them. <lb/>
            I can separate the armies that are in battle-array : ye married <lb/>

          <p>She spoke and dropped her arms in sleep, ignorant, alas, <lb/>
            that she had gone to slumber with fresh furies in her heart. <lb/>
            For Vesta, trusty guardian of fire brought from Troy, fosters <lb/>
            her guilt, and puts more fires into her bones. She rushes <lb/>
            forth like as a Thracian Bacchante, with rent robe and bosom <lb/>

            reek with delicacies, and the drunken rabble leap with their <lb/>
            dirty feet over loose heaps of blazing hay. Romulus ordered <lb/>
            the pickets to rest, the trumpet to cease sounding, and all things <lb/>
            to be silent in the camp. Tarpeia, thinking this was her time, <lb/>
            goes to meet the foe: she makes her compact, and is ready <lb/>
            to accompany her confederates. The hill was difficult in as­ <lb/>

            garrison to sleep : but Jupiter alone determined to keep awake <lb/>
            for thy punishment, Tarpeia. She had betrayed her trust <lb/>
            at the gate, and her sleeping home, and she asked leave to <lb/>
            name a wedding-day at her choice. But Tatius,—for, though <lb/>
            a foe, he paid no honour to villany,—said, " Marry at once <lb/>
            and ascend the marriage-bed of my kingdom." He spoke, and <lb/>

            waters, a bay memorable for the naval victory of the descend­ <lb/>
            ant of Iulus, at Actium, and that is now of easy passage for <lb/>
            sailors. Here met the forces of the world: the pine-built <lb/>
            mass rested on the waves, and favourable omens did not <lb/>
            equally attend both. One fleet was condemned by the Trojan <lb/>
            Quirinus, as were the javelins disgracefully thrown by a <lb/>
            woman's hand. On the other side was the ship of Augustus, <lb/>
            with sails bellying by the good-will of Jupiter, and the stand­ <lb/>
            ards of his country, by this time skilled in conquering. At <lb/>
            length Nereus had divided the fleets into two crescents: the <lb/>

            unwillingly. As to the prows carrying figures that threaten <lb/>

            the murmur from the remote causeway falls faintly on the <lb/>

            and I bewailed the chilly solitude of my bed. She had the <lb/>

            dreams that come from the kindly gates3 of sleep: when <lb/>
            kindly dreams come, they have weight. By night we roam <lb/>
            abroad: night lets loose the incarcerated shades: even Cer­ <lb/>

          <p>LEARN what it was that made the watery Esquiliæ turn out <lb/>
            last night, when the crowd of neighbours came hurrying from <lb/>
            the new park.2 Lanuvium is, of old, protected by an aged <lb/>
            dragon ;-here, where the occasion of an amusement so seldom <lb/>
            occurring is not lost; where is the abrupt descent into a dark <lb/>
            and hallowed cave; where is let down,-maiden, beware of <lb/>
            every such journey,-the honorary tribute to the fasting snake, <lb/>
            when he demands his yearly food, and hisses and twists <lb/>
            deep down in the earth. Maidens, let down for such a rite, <lb/>
            grow pale, when their hand is unprotectedly trusted in the <lb/>
            snake's mouth. He snatches at the delicacies if offered by a <lb/>
            maid, the very baskets tremble in the virgin's hands. If they <lb/>
            are chaste, they return and fall on the necks of their parents, <lb/>
            and the farmers cry " We shall have a fruitful year !” Hither <lb/>
            rode my Cynthia, with her ponies neat and trim: Juno3 <lb/>
            was the cause, but Venus still more so. 0 Appian Road, <lb/>
            tell me, I pray, how triumphantly she rode as you saw her <lb/>
            wheels flying over your rough pavement, when a disgraceful <lb/>
            brawl was heard in a vile pot-house: if without me, at all <lb/>
            events not without a stain on my good name. As she sat, <lb/>
            with all eyes upon her, she leaned over the pole, and daringly <lb/>
            drove at full speed over the rough road. I say nothing of <lb/>
            the silk-lined vehicle of the closely-shaved dandy, and his <lb/>
            Molossian dogs with ornaments on their necks: he will one <lb/>
            day be forced to sell himself to coarse diet, when the beard of <lb/>
            which he is now ashamed will get the mastery over his close- <lb/>
            shaved cheeks. As my rights were so often invaded, I de­ <lb/>
            termined to shift my camp and change my bed. There lives <lb/>

            in her is agreeable. There is another, Tela, who lives near <lb/>
            the Tarpeian groves, a pretty woman, but, when she is tipsy, <lb/>
            one man is not enough for her. I determined to invite these <lb/>
            and enjoy myself in the evening, and with a new mistress to <lb/>
            steal new delights of love. A sofa was set for us three in the <lb/>
            quiet shrubbery: do you ask how we sat ? I was between <lb/>
            the two. Lygdamus was our cupbearer; our goblets were of <lb/>
            glass, as it was summer, and our wine Greek, from Methym­ <lb/>
            næ.1 Thou, 0 Nile, didst supply us with a flute-player. <lb/>
            Phyllis played the castanets, she was neat and simply dressed, <lb/>
            and good-natured to be pelted with roses. A dwarf, too, with <lb/>
            limbs shrunk and short, shook the hollow castanets of box in <lb/>
            his deformed hands. But the flame would not burn steadily, <lb/>
            though the lamps were constantly trimmed, and the table fell <lb/>
            flat off its frame: and when I kept trying to get the Venus <lb/>
            with the lucky dice, the cursed aces always came out. I was <lb/>
            deaf to their singing, blind to their naked charms : I was, alas, <lb/>
            solely at the gate of Lanuvium ; when suddenly the door-posts <lb/>
            shook, and the hinges creaked, and a slight noise was heard at <lb/>
            the entrance of the house: in a moment Cynthia throws back <lb/>
            both the folding doors, with her hair not elaborately decked, but <lb/>
            beautiful in her rage. The cup fell from my paralysed <lb/>
            hands, my lips blanched, though moistened with wine. She <lb/>
            flashed lightning from her eyes, and raged as only a woman <lb/>
            can : the sight was as terrible as the taking of a city. She <lb/>
            angrily dashed her nails into Phyllis' face: Teïa, panic-struck, <lb/>
            cried out to the neighbours to bring watery Lights were <lb/>
            brought out, which roused the sleeping Romans, and every <lb/>
            path rings with the nightly brawl. The first wine-shop on <lb/>
            the dark road sheltered my visitors, with hair torn off their <lb/>
            heads, and garments rent. Cynthia stands exulting amid the <lb/>
            spoils, and, having routed her foes, comes back to me, and, <lb/>
            with ruthless hand, scratches my face, bites my neck and makes <lb/>
            it bloody, and above all strikes at my guilty eyes. When she has <lb/>
            tired her arms with beating me, Lygdamus, hidden near the <lb/>
            hind legs of the sofa, is pulled out, and, on his knees, implores <lb/>

            " I accept the conditions." She laughed, proud of the imperi­ <lb/>

            that the strange girls had touched, and washed the threshold <lb/>
            with pure water. She ordered me too to change all my clothes, <lb/>
            and thrice touched my head with sulphur-smoke. Then we <lb/>
            changed the bed-clothes sheet by sheet; I agreed to do what <lb/>

          <p>AT the time that the son of Amphitryon had driven herds <lb/>
            from thy stalls, 0 Erythea,5 he came to the Palatine moun­ <lb/>
            tain ridge abounding in cattle, and, weary himself, halted his <lb/>
            weary cattle, where the Velabra were overspread by their own <lb/>
            marshy stream, and the boat-man sailed over waters that have <lb/>
            given place to what is now part of the city. But they re­ <lb/>
            mained not safe in the faithless hospitality of Cacus; by <lb/>
            stealing them he profaned the god of hospitality. Cacus lived <lb/>
            hard by, a robber, in a fearful cave, who discharged flames <lb/>
            separately through three mouths. He, to prevent the traces <lb/>
            of his barefaced plunder from being clearly seen, drew the <lb/>
            oxen backwards, by their tails, into the cave, but not with­ <lb/>

            the monster. Cacus fell, stricken by a blow on his three heads <lb/>
            from the Arcadian club. Alcides then said, " Go, my oxen, go, <lb/>
            oxen of Hercules, last toilsome trophy of my club, oxen twice <lb/>
            sought for, twice won by me, and mark this ground as ox-fields <lb/>

            the noble forum of Rome.1 " Thus he spoke, while his mouth <lb/>
            and parched palate were racked with thirst, and no teeming <lb/>
            earth supplied him with water. Suddenly he hears some girls <lb/>
            laughing, in retirement, at a distance, where a grove had <lb/>
            grown into a forest with shady circuit, containing the secret <lb/>
            shrine of the feminine goddess,2 and the springs used in sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and the rites profaned with impunity by none. Purple fil­ <lb/>
            lets covered the retired abodes; the timeworn shrine glowed <lb/>
            with burning incense; the poplar, too, ornamented the temple <lb/>
            with its masses of foliage, and many a shady bower sheltered the <lb/>
            birds as they sang. Hither he rushed, and sweeping the <lb/>
            ground with his beard, dry and matted with dust, he poured <lb/>
            forth, before the door, words beneath the language of a god: <lb/>
            " To you I pray, 0 ye that are sporting in a sacred grotto in <lb/>
            the grove, open your shrine, in hospitality, to weary travellers. <lb/>
            I am wandering in want of water, and that, too, about a <lb/>
            country of murmuring streams, and as much water as I can <lb/>
            hold in the hollow of my hand is enough. Have ye heard of <lb/>
            one who -has borne the world on his back ? I am he : the <lb/>
            rescued earth calls me Alcides. Who has not heard of the bold <lb/>
            deeds of the club of Hercules, and of his arrows powerless <lb/>
            against no beast that is born, and of the Stygian darkness <lb/>
            opened to him only of men ? Receive me: at last this land <lb/>
            is open before me, weary one that I am. Though ye were <lb/>
            offering a sacrifice to Juno my bitter enemy, even she, step­ <lb/>
            mother though she is, would not have shut up her water from <lb/>
            me. But if any one of you is frightened by my looks, or my <lb/>
            lion's skin, and my hair scorched in Libya's sun, I am the same <lb/>
            one that performed servile offices in a purple robe, and spun my <lb/>
            daily task with the Lydian distaff: my hairy breast has been <lb/>
            confined in a soft girdle, and, though my hands are hard, I <lb/>
            made a handy girl."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Alcides: and the venerable priestess answered <lb/>
            him as follows, having her grey hair bound with a purple fillet: <note type="footnote"> 1 The forum.] The part of Rome afterwards called the forum boarium. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The feminine goddess.] The Bona Dea. </note> <lb/>

            Gaze no longer, stranger, and withdraw from the hallowed <lb/>
            grove: quickly begone, and fly from our threshold whilst thou <lb/>
            canst leave it in safety ! The altar that protects itself in a <lb/>
            retired shrine is forbidden to men, and profanation of it is <lb/>
            punished by a fearful penalty. At a great price' did the priest <lb/>
            Tiresias gaze on PaRas, while she laved her stalwart limbs, <lb/>
            having laid aside the Gorgon-shield. May the gods send thee <lb/>
            other fountains: the spring that flows here, out of the way, <lb/>
            and with secret approach, is peculiar to maidens !" Thus said <lb/>
            the old woman : he pushed with his shoulder the door that hid <lb/>
            the fountain from his view, and the closed door was not proof <lb/>
            against his assault, angry and thirsty as he was. But after <lb/>
            lie had fairly drained the stream and quenched his thirst, he <lb/>
            laid down severe laws before drying his lips. " This corner of <lb/>
            the world," said he, "receives me, in the course of fulfilling my <lb/>

            May this great altar, dedicated by me on the recovery of my <lb/>

          <p>I WILL now begin to sing the origin of the name of Jupiter <lb/>
            Feretrius, and the taking of the three suits of armour from <lb/>
            the three chieftains. I am beginning a steep ascent, but glory <lb/>
            gives me strength; a crown gathered from an easy ascent <lb/>
            pleases me not. Thou, 0 Romulus, suppliest the first instance <lb/>
            of this victory, by returning, laden with the foeman's spoils, <lb/>
            what time with thy victorious spear thou felledst Acron 3 of Cce­ <lb/>
            nina, when approaching the gates, and laid low both man and <lb/>
            horse. Acron, descended from Hercules, chief from Cœnina's <lb/>
            citadel, was once a terror to thy boundaries, 0 Rome. He <lb/>
            dared to look for spoils from the shoulders of Quirinus, and <note type="footnote"> I At a great price.] That of blindness. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Elegy X.] The derivation of the obscure title Jupiter Feretrins, <lb/>

             <pb n="136"/>
            gave up his own, still wet with his blood. Romulus saw him <lb/>
            poising his dart before the hollow towers, and, having previ­ <lb/>
            ously registered a vow, closed with him: Jupiter, to-day shall <lb/>
            this victim, Acron, be offered to thee. He had vowed: and <lb/>
            Acron fell, a spoil for Jupiter. This was the way the father <lb/>
            of the Roman city and valour was used to conquer, he who <lb/>
            bore the cold camp, with the sky for his roof. He was <lb/>
            a horseman and skilled in riding ; a husbandman skilled in <lb/>
            ploughing ; his wolf-skin helmet was crested with a shaggy <lb/>
            horse's tail, and his shield was not ornamented or glittering <lb/>
            with plates of bronze. After him comes Cossus,1 who killed <lb/>
            the Veientine Tolumnius, when the conquest of Veii was toil­ <lb/>
            some. Not yet was the sound of war heard beyond the Tiber: <lb/>
            the limit of their booty was Nomentum, and the tripartite <lb/>
            land taken with Cora.2 0 ancient Veii, you, too, were then <lb/>
            a city, and the golden chair of state was placed in your forum. <lb/>
            Now within your walls the pipe of the idle shepherd sounds, <lb/>
            and among your remains fields are mown. By chance the <lb/>
            Veientine chief took up his position over the gate-tower, and <lb/>
            confidently challenged the foe from his own city. So while <lb/>
            the battering-ram was knocking at the wall with its iron <lb/>
            head, where the long penthouse afforded shelter for the work, <lb/>
            Cossus says, " It were better for a brave man to meet his foe on <lb/>
            level ground." Without delay, each is ready on the plain. <lb/>
            The gods helped the arm of the Latin : the severed neck of To­ <lb/>
            lumnius splashed the Roman horses with blood. Next Claudius <lb/>
            Marcellus repulsed the enemy who had passed into the country <lb/>
            from the Rhine, when the shield of the mighty Belgic hero <lb/>
            Virdumarus was brought back. This man boasted his de­ <lb/>
            scent from the god of Rhine himself; right skilled was he in <lb/>
            hurling the javelin, standing upright in the car. To Claudius <lb/>
            there fell, after cutting off his head, a crooked chain from the <lb/>
            hero clad in striped breeches, while hurling the javelin in the <lb/>
            front rank. Now there are three sets of spoils stored up in <lb/>
            the temple: the origin of the name Feretrius is from each <lb/>
            leader striking3 down his opponent by a sure blow. Or else <note type="footnote"> 1 Cossus.] See Livy, iv. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cora.] Cora (Cori) was about 37 miles from Rome, and is mentioned <lb/>

          <p>FORBEAR, Paullus, to dwell continually, with tears, on my <lb/>
            death : the black gate opens to no prayers. When once dead <lb/>
            bodies have entered the infernal domain, egress is barred by <lb/>
            inflexible adamant. Though the god of the gloomy hall may <lb/>
            hear you, it will be in vain, for the shore that cannot hear will <lb/>
            drink in your tears. Prayers move the gods above: but when <lb/>
            the ferryman has received his toll, the gloomy gate is shut <lb/>
            fast upon those who have been committed to the grassy sod. <lb/>
            Such was the note of the mournful trumpet, when the un­ <lb/>
            friendly torch, applied to the foot of the pile, was withdraw­ <lb/>
            ing my head from the bier. What availed my marriage with <lb/>
            Paullus, the triumphs of my ancestors, or the tokens of my <lb/>
            nobility, great though they were ? Did I, a Cornelia though <lb/>
            I was, find the Fates less severe ? Lo, I "am a weight that <lb/>

            which Barth and Kuinoel have bestowed upon it. It assumes the form of <lb/>
            an address from a deceased wife, Cornelia, to her husband, Lucius Æmilius <lb/>
            Paullus, who was censor in the year B. c. 22. Cornelia was the daughter <lb/>
            of Scribonia, formerly wife of P. Cornelius Scipio, but subsequently <lb/>
            married to Augustus. She was divorced by the latter on his marriage <lb/>
            with Livia. He appears, indeed, to have left -her from her unamiable <lb/>
            temper; " Pertæsus," says Suetonius, " ut scribit, morum perversitatem <lb/>

            from the lock, and the door be still. I am pleading1 for my­ <lb/>
            self. If I am deceiving, may the persecuting urn, the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of the sisters,2 press on my shoulders. If the fame of <lb/>
            ancestral trophies was ever an honour to any one, I can boast <lb/>
            that the realms of Africa speak of my Numantine3 ancestors. <lb/>
            Another class comprises my maternal ancestors, the Libones,4 <lb/>
            of equal celebrity, and my family, on both sides, is exalted by <lb/>
            its honours. Afterwards, when the maiden's dress had given <lb/>
            way to the marriage-torch, and a new fillet had bound my <lb/>
            hair as a wedded wife, I was joined in wedlock to you, Paul­ <lb/>
            lus, doomed to be my only husband: on my tombstone I shall <lb/>
            be read of as having been married to you alone. I call to <lb/>
            witness the ashes of my ancestors, to be adored by thee, 0 <lb/>
            Rome, below whose epitaphs, thou, 0 Africa, liest with shorn <lb/>
            hair, and him who crushed Perses,5 pretending to the courage <lb/>
            of his ancestor Achilles, and thy house, 0 Perses, descended <lb/>
            from Achilles, and that I was not the cause for relaxing the <lb/>
            laws of the Censorship, and that your altars never blushed at <lb/>
            any fault of mine. Cornelia did not prove a disgrace to such <lb/>
            great trophies: nay more, she was a praiseworthy member <lb/>
            even of her noble family. Nor did my life alter; the whole <lb/>
            of it is free from guilt: I lived a model from the marriage to <lb/>
            the funeral-torch. Nature gave me principles inherited from <lb/>
            my birth, so that I could not be better from fear of punish­ <lb/>

            Moreover, I gained the ennobling honours of the garment, 4 <lb/>
            and I was not carried off without leaving any children. Thou, <lb/>
            Lepidus, and thou, Paullus, wilt assuage my loss now that I <lb/>
            am dead ; my eyes were closed in your arms. We also saw <lb/>
            our brother5 attain the double honours of the curule chair, at <lb/>
            the time of whose consulship his sister was carried off. My <lb/>

            imitate me, and keep to one husband. Do you, my descend­ <lb/>

            for me, not against my will, since so many of mine are left <lb/>
            to ennoble my lot. This is the highest glory and triumph <lb/>
            for a woman, when report is kind, and praises her after death. <lb/>
            Now I commend to you our children, pledges of our common <lb/>

          <p>CYNTHIA'S insnaring eyes my bondage tied: <lb/>
            Ah wretch ! no loves, till then, had touch'd my breast: <lb/>
            Love bent to earth these looks of stedfast pride, <lb/>
            And on my neck his foot triumphant press'd.</p>
          <p>He taught me, then, to loathe the virtuous fair, <lb/>
            And shameless waste my wild and driftless hours: <lb/>
            Twelve moons this madness lasts; and yet my prayer <lb/>
            Is breathed in hopeless love to adverse powers.</p>
          <p>Minalion, erst, could all adventures brave, <lb/>
            Till Atalanta's barb'rous heart grew mild: <lb/>
            Love-crazed he trod each drear Parthenian cave, <lb/>
            And look'd on shaggy beasts in forests wild.</p>
          <p>Struck by the branch the monstrous Centaur sway'd, <lb/>
            Midst shrill Arcadia's rocks he groaning fell; <lb/>
            And thus he tamed the nimble-footed maid: <lb/>
            Thus love-prayers speed, and acts that merit well.</p>
          <p>In me no arts can tardy Love devise ; <lb/>
            His foot can track no more the beaten ways: <lb/>
            Come ye! that draw the moon from charmed skies! <lb/>
            That bid the hearth in magic orgies blaze! <pb n="142"/>
            </p>
          <p>Come! turn a haughty mistress' marble heart, <lb/>
            And change her cheek, still paler than my own: <lb/>
            Then will I trust, that stars obey your art, <lb/>
            And rivers rush, by mutter'd verse alone.</p>
          <p>Friends ! that too late my sliding feet recall, <lb/>
            Some antidote to this my frenzy bear : <lb/>
            Bring steel; bring flames and racks: I brave them all: <lb/>
            But let me freely vent my fierce despair.</p>
          <p>Oh snatch me to the world's remotest shore! <lb/>
            Oh waft me o'er th' immeasurable main ! <lb/>
            Where never woman may behold me more, <lb/>
            Nor trace my way, to sting with her disdain !</p>
          <p>Stay ye, to whom the listening god consents; <lb/>
            Safe in an equal yoke of fondness move; <lb/>
            But Venus all my bitter nights torments: <lb/>
            No-not a single hour is free from love.</p>
          <p>Beware my sufferings : hold the mistress dear <lb/>
            Whose faith is tried, nor shift th' accustom'd sway: <lb/>
            If to my voice ye bend a slothful ear, <lb/>
            What pangs shall my remember'd words convey! <lb/>

          <p>FIRST Cynthia's eyes this wretched heart subdued, <lb/>
            Which ne'er before had sigh'd with am'rous pain ; <lb/>
            When Love my unrelenting aspect bow'd, <lb/>
            And trampled on my neck with proud disdain.</p>
          <p>At length the tyrant taught me to detest <lb/>
            Chaste nymphs, and banish'd reason from my mind: <lb/>
            Nor one whole year has the dire frenzy ceas'd; <lb/>
            Still Fate forbids my mistress to be kind !</p>
          <p>No toils, 0 Tullus! did Milanion dread, <lb/>
            When Atalanta's pride he forc'd to yield; <lb/>
            Now to Parthenian caves he raging fled, <lb/>
            Now bristly monsters daringly beheld.</p>
          <p>Struck by the pond'rous club which Hylæus bore, <lb/>
            Arcadia's rocks could witness each loud groan; <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            Then braving danger, and the Centaur's power, <lb/>
            The nimble-footed maid he nobly won.</p>
          <p>Thus pray'rs and gen'rous deeds will much avail <lb/>
            In hopeless flames ; yet Love, a tardy friend, <lb/>
            To me no arts, as usual, will reveal, <lb/>
            No wily ways that to affection tend.</p>
          <p>But you, whose spells can draw the toil'd Moon down. <lb/>
            Whose magic pyres can wailing ghosts appease, <lb/>
            0, let my Cynthia's will your influence own ! <lb/>

            That floods, Cytæan incantations rule- <lb/>
            And you, my friends, who warn me when too late, <lb/>
            0, bring relief, and heal my wounded soul!</p>
          <p>Steel and fierce flames with patience I can bear, <lb/>

            Waft me through farthest clinics, through billows, where <lb/>
            No prying nymph can track my distant way !</p>
          <p>You, to whom Cupid with assenting nod <lb/>
            Lends a kind ear, whom mutual love delights, <lb/>
            Be happy still! while me the cruel god <lb/>
            Pursues, and Venus saddens all my nights.</p>
          <p>Be warn'd, ye blissful lovers, by my fate ; <lb/>

            Those who reject my counsel, when too late <lb/>

          <p>BE warn'd by friendship, which thou long hast tried I <lb/>
            Nor let my precepts from thy mem'ry slide: <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            Dire fate attends whoe'er has rashly loved; <lb/>
            Ascanius baleful to the Minyæ proved.</p>
          <p>Alike thy Hylas, both in name and face, <lb/>
            To him who boasts Thiodamantean race : <lb/>
            Then, whether coasting on the wood-hung wave, <lb/>
            Whether thy footsteps Anio's waters lave, <lb/>
            Whether thou roam'st the Giant-peopled shore, <lb/>
            Or fliest, a vagrant guest, where torrents pour; <lb/>
            Still of the am'rous Nymphs, fond thefts beware, <lb/>
            Ausonian Dryads too make love their care: <lb/>
            Not to cool rocks or rugged mountains stray; <lb/>
            Nor to enamour'd lakes e'er bend thy way; <lb/>
            Wand'ring to foreign climes, Alcides tried <lb/>
            All these, and wept by cold Ascanius' side.</p>
          <p>Once from the Pagasean port, 'tis said, <lb/>
            The Argo sail'd, and far as Phasis fled; <lb/>
            Then o'er the Hellespont the vessel pass'd, <lb/>
            And Mysia's rocky haven reach'd at last: <lb/>
            Here the brave throng the grateful shore o'erspread, <lb/>
            And on the turf with leaves they form'd their bed: <lb/>
            Meanwhile th' unconquer'd hero's boy went on, <lb/>
            To find the scarce stream's secret fount alone; <lb/>
            Zethes and Calais, twins from Boreas sprung, <lb/>
            Pursued him close, and pressing round him hung ; <lb/>
            Pois'd by their hands, they bear each kiss supine <lb/>
            Aloft, and snatch by turns the theft divine ; <lb/>
            Uprais'd in air, the youth avoids th' embrace, <lb/>
            And in their wings' last shelter hides his face; <lb/>
            Then with a little bough lie soon removes <lb/>
            The swift attacks of their insidious loves. <lb/>
            And now Orithyia's sons, of Pandion race, <lb/>
            Foil'd in th' attempt, gave o'er their am'rous chase ; <lb/>
            When Hylas onward hasten'd to his doom, <lb/>
            And sought, ah grief ! the Hamadryads' home.</p>
          <p>Beneath Arganthus' lofty height there stood <lb/>
            A fount, the Thynian Naiads' moist abode; <lb/>
            On the wild trees, that deckt its margin, grew, <lb/>

            To cull these flow'rs with artless fingers went <lb/>
            The boy, unmindful of his first intent; <lb/>
            Then near the painted wave unconscious lay, <lb/>
            And his reflected charms prolonged his stay; <lb/>
            At length, with hands plung'd in, the wave he sought; <lb/>
            His right arm lab'ring with the vase full fraught: <lb/>
            The Dryad-maids, whom his fair beauties fir'd, <lb/>
            Forsook their choral frolics, and admir'd ; <lb/>
            As Hylas fell, beneath the yielding flood <lb/>
            They drew the boy, who wept his rape aloud ; <lb/>
            Far off Alcides answer'd as he mourn'd, <lb/>

            Or quivering leaves on wintry gales are cast; <lb/>
            As passion's gust bids woman's promise fly, <lb/>
            Be rage the cause, or be it levity. <lb/>
            Since 'tis thy pleasure, I no more contend: <lb/>
            Ye cruel loves I yet keener arrows bend ; <lb/>
            Right-aiming at my heart, dissolve my life; <lb/>
            My blood the <unclear>palm</unclear> of this your glorious strife. <lb/>
            And must thou thus, Propertius ! in the bloom <lb/>
            Of opening youth descend into the tomb? <lb/>
            Must thou then die? yes, die—that site may view <lb/>
            Thy corse with smiles,- thy fleeting ghost pursue <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            With her tormenting scorn ; disturb thee dead ; <lb/>
            Leap on thy pyre, and on thy ashes tread. <lb/>
            What ? did not Hæmon on his bloody glaive <lb/>
            Fall, by Antigone's untimely grave; <lb/>
            And mix his ashes in the maiden's urn, <lb/>
            Nor would, without her, to his Thebes return ? <lb/>
            Thou shalt not 'scape ; yes, thou my death shalt feel: <lb/>
            Our mingled blood shall trickle from the steel. <lb/>
            Yes—though thy death to ages brand my name, <lb/>
            That death shall reach thee, and I brave the shame. <lb/>
            Witness the stars ! the dews of morning's hour ! <lb/>
            The stealthy door, which open'd to thy bower: <lb/>
            That nought in life more precious was to me, <lb/>
            And still I love thee: yes, in spite of thee! <lb/>
            No other nymph shall on my couch recline; <lb/>
            Alone and loveless, since no longer thine. <lb/>
            Ah! if my life some virtuous years have known, <lb/>
            May he thy arms enfold be turn'd to stone! <lb/>
            Not with more horrid zest and thirst of blood, <lb/>
            Thebes' princes fought, while near their mother stood, <lb/>
            Than I, if Cynthia's presence fired the strife, <lb/>
            Would yield my own to snatch my rival's life. ELTON.</p>

          <p>HAD he not hands of rare device, whoe'er <lb/>
            First painted Love in figure of a boy ? <lb/>
            He saw what thoughtless beings lovers were, <lb/>
            Who blessings lose, whilst lightest cares employ.</p>
          <p>Nor added he those airy wings in vain, <lb/>
            And bade through human hearts the godhead fly; <lb/>
            For we are tost upon a wavering main ; <lb/>
            Our gale, inconstant, veers around the sky.</p>
          <p>Nor, without cause, he grasps those barbed darts, <lb/>
            The Cretan quiver o'er his shoulder cast; <lb/>
            Ere we suspect a foe, he strikes our hearts; <lb/>
            And those inflicted wounds for ever last.</p>
          <p>In me are fix'd those arrows, in my breast; <lb/>
            But sure his wings are shorn, the boy remains; <lb/>
            For never takes he flight, nor knows he rest; <lb/>
            Still, still I feel him warring through my veins.</p>
          <p>In these scorch'd vitals dost thou joy to dwell ? <lb/>
            Oh shame ! to others let thy arrows flee ; <lb/>
            Let veins untouch'd with all thy venom swell; <lb/>

            Nor cried, " 0 death ! why art thou slow to come ?"</p>
          <p>Thou thy lost friend shalt many a time deplore; <lb/>

            Then barter'd gifts can now a mistress move ? <lb/>
            For gifts, 0 Jupiter! she pines in love. <lb/>
            For lucid gems she sends me o'er the main, <lb/>
            And bids me seek in Tyre the purple grain: <lb/>
            Oh that in Rome no lords of wealth we saw; <lb/>
            That e'en the palace-roof were thatch'd with straw I <lb/>
            No venal mistress then would melt to gold : <lb/>

            A stranger tracks the traces of my kiss, <lb/>

            Ah ; Eriphyle's bitter gifts survey! <lb/>
            On Jason's bride see fiery torments prey! <lb/>
            Can then no wrongs forbid my tears to flow, <lb/>

            That a disgraceful passion cannot hear. <lb/>
            Look on the chief, who late with treason's host <lb/>
            Raised empty uproar on the Actian coast: <lb/>
            Love ignominious turn'd his flying prores, <lb/>

            Augustus' brow a double glory wreaths: <lb/>
            The hand that conquer'd now the falchion sheaths. <lb/>
            Oh! may those robes, those emeralds which he gave. <lb/>
            Be snatched by storms through air or o'er the wave: <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>On lovely torment! for my anguish born, <lb/>
            Since oft excluded from thy door in scorn : <lb/>
            Come to these arms; my verse renown can give; <lb/>
            Here thou the fairest of thy sex shalt live: <lb/>
            Let not my boast Catullus' ear offend; <lb/>
            Let gentle Calvus too his pardon lend. <lb/>
            The veteran, gray with service, quits the field; <lb/>
            Their necks no more the age-worn oxen yield ; <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            On the waste sands their mouldering barks remain, <lb/>
            And the cleft shield bangs idle in the fane. <lb/>
            Were it not better crouch, a tyrant's slave, <lb/>
            And in thy brazen bulls, Perillus ! rave: <lb/>
            At Gorgon's visage stiffen into stone, <lb/>
            Or under Caucasus' keen vultures groan. <lb/>
            Still I persist: lo ! rust can steel decay, <lb/>
            And gentle droppings wear the flint away. <lb/>
            Love to the marble threshold clings, nor feels <lb/>
            The wearing stone; though threaten'd, patient kneels ; <lb/>
            Though wrong'd, pleads guilt; implores the foot that <lb/>
            spurns; <lb/>
            And, loth returning, yet, when call'd, returns. <lb/>
            And thou, full-flush'd with bliss! be taught from me, <lb/>
            Fond rival! woman's light inconstancy. <lb/>
            In the mid-storm who pays his thanks to heaven, <lb/>
            When oft, in port, the floating wreck is driven? <lb/>
            Who claims the prize, ere seven times round the goal, <lb/>
            With grazing wheel, the kindling chariot roll ? <lb/>
            In love's fair sky fallacious breezes blow, <lb/>
            And heavy comes the storm, when threatening slow. <lb/>
            E'en though she love thee, be thy joy supprest, <lb/>
            And lock the secret in thy silent breast. <lb/>
            The boastings of successful passion prove, <lb/>
            I know not how, injurious oft in love. <lb/>
            Go once, for many times that she invites; <lb/>
            Short is the bliss, which prying envy blights. <lb/>
            Ob, if the ages past could votaries find, <lb/>
            And if our nymphs were of that ancient kind, <lb/>
            What now thou art, should I, unrivall'd, be; <lb/>
            The time's corruption hath supplanted me. <lb/>
            Not from this age my nature takes its hue; <lb/>
            Each has his path, and I my own pursue. <lb/>
            But thou, whose courtship thus promiscuous roves, <lb/>
            How must thine eyes be tortured by thy loves! <lb/>
            Thou seest the skin with lunar clearness white, <lb/>
            Thou seest the brown of tint, and both delight; <lb/>
            Charm'd by the shape through Grecian robes displayed, <lb/>
            By vestures ravish'd of the Roman maid. <lb/>
            Be russet garments, or the purple, worn, <lb/>
            By both alike thy tender breast is torn, <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>

            A tiny multitude of boys drew near; <lb/>

            Why shines the sun's wheel'd orb with umber'd light, <lb/>
            His golden coursers pall'd in mourning night; <lb/>
            Why turns Boötes slow his starry wain, <lb/>
            Why sparkling throng the Pleiads' cluster'd train; <lb/>
            Why bounded roll the deepening ocean's tides; <lb/>
            Why the full year in parted seasons glides; <lb/>
            If under earth gods judge, and giants rave; <lb/>
            Tisiphone's fierce ringlets snaky wave ; <lb/>
            Furies Alcmæon scourge, and Phineas hungering crave; <lb/>
            Thirst burn in streams, wheels whirl, rocks backward leap, <lb/>
            Or hell's dark mouth three-headed Cerberus keep: <lb/>
            If Tityos' straiten'd limbs nine acres press; <lb/>
            Or fables mock man's credulous wretchedness <lb/>
            Through long tradition's age: nor terror's strife <lb/>
            Survive the pyre :-be such my close of life. <lb/>
            Go ye who list, the Parthian overcome, <lb/>
            Bring Crassus' wrested standards back to Rome. ELTON.</p>

            <title type="sub">ELEGY X. THE BIRTH-DAY OF CYNTHIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I MARVELL'D what the smiling Muses led, <lb/>
            While blush'd the rising sun, beside my bed. <lb/>
            My fair one's birth-day shone; and, standing round, <lb/>
            Thrice with clapp'd hands they gave the signal sound. <lb/>
            May this day cloudless pass, winds breathe no more; <lb/>
            And raging waves roll smoothly to the shore. <lb/>
            Let no sad looks on this blest day appear; <lb/>
            Ev'n Niobe suppress th3 marble tear: <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            The Halcyon's bills lay now their moans aside, <lb/>
            Nor on her son devour'd let Progne chide. <lb/>
            And, dear one ! thou, in light-wing'd moments born, <lb/>
            Rise, pray the heavens for blessings on thy morn. <lb/>
            Disperse the dews of sleep with waters fair, <lb/>
            With parting fingers sleek thy glossy hair; <lb/>
            The robe, that first allured Propertius' eyes, <lb/>
            Assume, nor for thy brow the flower despise. <lb/>
            Pray that those powerful beauties ne'er may fade, <lb/>
            And still my neck may bow, by Cynthia sway'd. <lb/>
            When smoke of purifying incense streams <lb/>
            From the wreath'd altar, and its broadening gleams <lb/>
            Fill all the gilt saloon with happy light, <lb/>
            Arrange the board; let goblets speed the night. <lb/>
            From box of yellow agate sweet dispense <lb/>
            The liquid nard moist breathing on the sense: <lb/>
            Let the sigh'd flute sob hoarse in midnight dance; <lb/>
            Thy wit in libertine gay sallies glance ; <lb/>
            From jocund feast unwelcome sleep retreat, <lb/>
            And ringing echo din the neighbouring street. <lb/>
            Let the dice rattle and the throw denote <lb/>
            Whom that wing'd boy with heaviest pinions smote. <lb/>
            When many an hour has flow'd in bumpers by, <lb/>
            Let Venus lend her nightly ministry: <lb/>
            Let us the yearly solemn love-rites pay, <lb/>
            And crown the pleasures of thy natal-day. ELTON.</p>
