          <p>O<lb/>
            F Pausanias personally we know very little, but that he <lb/>
            lived during the Reign of the Antonines, and travelled <lb/>
            all round Greece, and wrote his famous Tour round Greece, <lb/>
            or Description of Greece, in 10 Books, describing what he <lb/>
            had seen and heard. His chief merit is his showing to us <lb/>
            the state of the works of art still remaining in his day in <lb/>
            the Greek cities, which have since been swept away by the <lb/>
            various invasions that have devastated that once happy <lb/>
            land. " When Pausanias travelled through Greece, during <lb/>
            the age of the Antonines, about 1690 years ago, he found <lb/>
            every city teeming with life and refinement; every Temple <lb/>
            a Museum of Art; and every spot hallowed by some tradi­ <lb/>
            tion which contributed to its preservation. The ruthless <lb/>
            destruction of these works of art, in subsequent ages, has <lb/>
            reduced them to a small number; and the Traveller now <lb/>
            pauses, with a melancholy interest, to reflect upon the <lb/>
            objects described by Pausanias, but which no longer <lb/>
            exist."</p>
          <p>Pausanias' Description of Greece is also full of various <lb/>
            information on many topics. It is for example a mine of <lb/>
            Mythology. For its various matter it has been happily <lb/>
            compared to a " County History." There is often a quiet <lb/>
            vein of humour in Pausanias, who seems to have been <lb/>
            almost equally a believer in Providence and in Homer.</p>
          <p>I have translated from Schubart's Text in the Teubner <note type="footnote"> 1 George Scharf, Esq., F.S.A. 1859. Wordsworth’s Greece, p. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            Series, (1875), but have taken the liberty always, where <lb/>
            the text seemed hopeless, to adopt a reading that seemed <lb/>
            preferable from any other source. I have constantly had <lb/>
            before me the valuable edition of Siebelis, (Lipsiæ, 1827), <lb/>
            to whom I am much indebted, especially for his Illustra­ <lb/>
            tions, still veracity obliges me to state that occasionally he <lb/>
            too gives one reason to remember the famous lines of a <lb/>
            well-known Rector of Welwyn in the Eighteenth Century.</p>
          <p>" The commentators each dark passage shun, <lb/>
            And hold their farthing candle to the Sun."</p>
          <p>In the Index it is hardly necessary to state that I owe <lb/>
            much to Schubart.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            N the mainland of Greece, facing the islands called the <lb/>
            Cyclades and the Ægean sea, the promontory of <lb/>
            Sunium stands out on Attic soil: and there is a harbour <lb/>
            for any one coasting along the headland, and a temple of <lb/>
            Athene of Sunium on the summit of the height. And as <lb/>
            one sails on is Laurium, where the Athenians formerly had <lb/>
            silver mines, and a desert island of no great size called after <lb/>
            Patroclus ; for he had built a wall in it and laid a palisade, <lb/>
            when he sailed as admiral in the Egyptian triremes, which <lb/>
            Plotemy, the son of Lagus, sent to punish the Athenians, <lb/>
            Antigonus, the son of Demetrius, in person making a raid <lb/>
            into their territory with a land force and ravaging it, and <lb/>
            the fleet simultaneously hemming them in by sea. Now the <lb/>
            Piræus was a township in ancient times, but was not a port <lb/>
            until Themistocles ruled the Athenians ; but their port was <lb/>
            Phalerum, (for here the sea is nearest to Athens), and they <lb/>
            say that it was from thence that Menestheus sailed with <lb/>
            the ships to Troy, and before him Theseus to exact ven­ <lb/>
            geance from Minos for the death of Androgeos. But when <lb/>
            Themistocles was in power, because the Piræus appeared to <lb/>
            him to be more convenient as a harbour, and it was cer­ <lb/>
            tainly better to have three harbours than one as at Pha­ <lb/>
            lerum, he made this the port. And even up to my time <lb/>
            there were stations for ships, and at the largest of the three <lb/>
            harbours the tomb of Themistocles; for they say that the <lb/>
            Athenians repented of their conduct to him, and that his <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            relatives exhumed his remains and brought them home <lb/>
            from Magnesia. Certain it is that the sons of Themistocles <lb/>
            returned from exile, and hung up a painting of Themistocles <lb/>
            in the Parthenon. Now of all the things in the Piræus <lb/>
            best worth seeing is the temple of Athene and Zeus ; both <lb/>
            their stable,-, are of gold, and Zeus has a sceptre and Victory, <lb/>
            while Athene is armed with a spear. Here, too, is a paint­ <lb/>
            ing by Arcesilaus of Leosthenes and his sons, that famous <lb/>
            hero who at the head of the Athenians and all the Greeks <lb/>
            defeated the Macedonians in battle in Bœotia, and again <lb/>
            beyond Thermopylae, and drove them into Lamia over <lb/>
            against Mount CEta and shut them up there. And it is in <lb/>
            the long portico, where those near the sea have their <lb/>
            market, (for there is another market for those more inland), <lb/>
            and in the back of the portico near the sea are statues of <lb/>
            Zeus and Demos, the design of Leochares. And near the <lb/>
            sea is a temple erected to Aphrodite by Conon, after his <lb/>
            victory over the Lacedemonian fleet off Cnidus in the <lb/>
            peninsula of Caria. For Aphrodite is the tutelary saint of <lb/>
            the men of Cnidus, and they have several temples of the <lb/>
            goddess; the most ancient celebrates her as Doritis, the <lb/>
            next in date as Acræa, and latest of all that which every­ <lb/>
            body else calls Athene of Cnidus, but the Cnidians them­ <lb/>
            selves call it Athene of the Fair Voyage.</p>
          <p>The Athenians have also another harbour at Munichia, <lb/>
            and a temple of Artemis of Munychia, and another at <lb/>
            Phalerum, as has been stated by me before, and near it a <lb/>
            temple of Demeter. Here too is a temple of Sciradian <lb/>
            Athene, and of Zeus at a little distance, and altars of gods <lb/>
            called unknown, and of heroes, and of the children of <lb/>
            Theseus and Phalerus; for this Phalerus, the Athenians <lb/>
            say, sailed with Jason to Colchis. There is also an altar <lb/>
            of Androgeos the son of Minos, though it is only called <lb/>
            altar of a hero, but those who take pains to know more <lb/>
            accurately than others their country's antiquities are well <lb/>
            aware that it is the altar of Androgeos. And twenty <lb/>
            stades1 further is the promontory Colias; when the fleet of <lb/>
            the Persians was destroyed the tide dashed the wrecks <lb/>
            against it. There is here also a statue of Aphrodite of <lb/>
            Colias and the goddesses who are called Genetyllides. I <note type="footnote"> 1 A stade was about one-eighth of a Roman mile. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            am of opinion that the Phocian goddesses in Ionia, that <lb/>
            they call by the name of Gennaides, are the same as these <lb/>
            at Colias called Genetyllides. And there is on the road to <lb/>
            Athens from Phalerum a temple of Hera without doors or <lb/>
            roof; they say that Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, burnt <lb/>
            it. But the statue there now is (as they say) the work of <lb/>
            Alcamenes ; this, indeed, the Persian cannot have touched.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            S one enters into the city there is a monument of <lb/>
            Antiope the Amazon. Pindar says that this Antiope <lb/>
            was carried oil by Pirithous and Theseus, but the account <lb/>
            by Hegias of Troezen is as follows: that Hercules besieg­ <lb/>
            ing Themiscyra near the river Thermodon could not take <lb/>
            it; but that Antiope being enamoured of Theseus, (who was <lb/>
            besieging the place with Hercules), handed the place over <lb/>
            to him. This is the account Hegias has given. But the <lb/>
            Athenians say that, when the Amazons came, Antiope was <lb/>
            shot by Molpadia with an arrow, and that Molpadia was <lb/>
            slain by Theseus. There is a monument also to Molpadia <lb/>
            among the Athenians. And as one ascends from the <lb/>
            Piræus there are remains of the walls which Conon re- <lb/>
            erected after, the sea-fight off Cnidus; for those which <lb/>
            Themistocles had built after the defeat of the Persians had <lb/>
            been pulled down during the rule of The Thirty Tyrants, as <lb/>
            they were called. And along the way the most notable <lb/>
            tombs are those of Menander the son of Diopeithes, and a <lb/>
            cenotaph of Euripides without the body. For Euripides was <lb/>
            buried in Macedonia, having gone to the court of King <lb/>
            Arcbelaus; and the manner of his death, for it has been <lb/>
            told by many, let it be as they say. Poets even in those <lb/>
            days lived with kings and earlier still, for when Polycrates <lb/>
            was tyrant at Samos Anacreon lived at his court, and <lb/>
            Æschylus and Simonides journeyed to Syracuse to the <lb/>
            court of Hiero; and to Dionysius, who was afterwards <lb/>
            tyrant in Sicily, went Philoxenus; and to Antigonns, king <lb/>
            of the Macedonians, went Antagoras of Rhodes and Aratus <lb/>
            of Soli. On the other hand Hesiod and Homer either did <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            not get the chance of living at kings' courts, or of their <lb/>
            own accord didn't value it, the former because lie lived in <lb/>
            the country and shrank from travelling, and the latter, <lb/>
            having gone on his travels to very distant parts, depreciated <lb/>
            pecuniary assistance from the powerful in comparison with <lb/>
            the glory he had amongst most men, for from him too we <lb/>
            have the description of Demodocus' being at the court <lb/>
            of Alcinous, and that Agamemnon left a poet with his <lb/>
            wife. There is also a tomb not far from the gates, with <lb/>
            the statue of a soldier standing near a horse; who the <lb/>
            soldier is I don't know, but Praxiteles modelled both the <lb/>
            horse and the soldier.</p>
          <p>As one enters into the city there is a building for the <lb/>
            getting ready of processions, which they conduct some <lb/>
            annually, somé at various intervals. And near is the <lb/>
            temple of Demeter, and the statues in it are her and her <lb/>
            daughter and Iacchus with a torch; and it is written on <lb/>
            the wall in Attic letters that they are the production of <lb/>
            Praxiteles. And not far from this temple is Poseidon on <lb/>
            horseback, in the act of hurling his spear at the giant <lb/>
            Polybotes, in respect to whom there is a story among the <lb/>
            Coans as to the promontory of Chelone; but the inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion of our days assigns the statue to another and not to <lb/>
            Poseidon. And there are porticoes from the gates to the <lb/>
            Ceramicus, and in front of them brazen statues of women <lb/>
            and men who have obtained some celebrity. And one of the <lb/>
            porticoes has not only shrines of the gods, but also what is <lb/>
            called the gymnasium of Hermes; and there is in it the <lb/>
            house of Polytion, in which they say the most notable of <lb/>
            the Athenians imitated the 'Eleusinian mysteries. But in <lb/>
            my time it was consecrated to Dionysus. And this Dio­ <lb/>
            nysus they call Melpomenos for the same reason that they <lb/>
            call Apollo Musagetes. Here are statues of Pæonian Athene <lb/>
            and Zeus and Mnemosyne and the Muses, and Apollo (the <lb/>
            votive offering and work of Enbulides), and Acratus a satel­ <lb/>
            lite of Dionysus : his face alone is worked in the wall. And <lb/>
            next to the shrine of Dionysus is a room with statues of <lb/>
            earthenware, Amphictyon the king of the Athenians feast­ <lb/>
            ing Dionysus and all the other gods. Here too is Pegasus <lb/>
            Eleutherensis, who introduced Dionysus to the Athenians; <lb/>
            and he was assisted by the oracle at Delphi, which foretold <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            that the god would come and settle there in the days of <lb/>
            Icarius. And this is the way Amphictyon got the king­ <lb/>
            dom. They say that Actæus was first king of what is now <lb/>
            Attica; and on his death Cecrops succeeded to the king­ <lb/>
            dom having married Actæus’ daughter, and he had three <lb/>
            daughters, Erse, and Aglauros, and Pandrosos, and one <lb/>
            son, Erysichthon. He never reigned over the Athenians, <lb/>
            for he chanced to die in his father's lifetime, and the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Cecrops fell to Cranaus, the foremost of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians in power and influence. And they say that Cranaus <lb/>
            had among other daughters Atthis; from her they named <lb/>
            the country Attica, which was before called Actæa. And <lb/>
            Amphictyon rose up in insurrection against Cranaus, <lb/>
            although he was married to his daughter, and deposed him <lb/>
            from the kingdom; but was himself afterwards ejected by <lb/>
            Erichthonius and his fellow conspirators. And they say that <lb/>
            Erichthonius had no mortal father, but that his parents <lb/>
            were Hephæstus and Mother Earth.</p>

            Ceramus, he too reputed to be the son of Dionysus <lb/>

            statues of earthenware, Theseus hurling Sciron into the sea, <lb/>
            and Aurora carrying off Cephalus, who, being most hand­ <lb/>
            some, was, they say, carried off by enamoured Aurora, and <lb/>
            his son was Phaethon. And he made him sacristan of the <lb/>
            temple. All this has been told by others, and by Hesiod <lb/>
            in his poem about women. And near theportico are <lb/>
            statues of Conon and his son Timotheus, and Evagoras, the <lb/>
            king of the Cyprians, who got the Phœnician triremes <lb/>
            given to Conon by King Artaxerxes: and he acted as an <lb/>
            Athenian and one who had ancestral connection with <lb/>
            Salamis, for his pedigree went up to Teucer and the daughter <lb/>
            of Cinyras. Here too are statues of Zeus, surnamed Eleu­ <lb/>
            therius, and the Emperor Adrian, a benefactor to all the <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            people he ruled over, and especially to the city of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. And the portico built behind has paintings of the <lb/>
            so-called twelve gods. And Democracy and Demos and <lb/>
            Theseus are painted on the wall beyond. The painting <lb/>
            represents These-as restoring to the Athenians political <lb/>
            equality. The popular belief has prevailed almost univer­ <lb/>
            sally that Theseus played into the hands of the people, and <lb/>
            that from his time they remained under a democratical <lb/>
            government, till Pisistratus rose up and became tyrant. <lb/>
            There are other untrue traditions current among the mass <lb/>
            of mankind, who have no research and take for gospel all <lb/>
            they heard as children in the choruses and tragedies. One <lb/>
            such tradition is that Theseus himself was king, and that <lb/>
            after the death of Menestheus his descendants continued <lb/>
            kings even to the fourth generation. But if I had a fancy <lb/>
            for genealogies, I should certainly have enumerated all the <lb/>
            kings from Melanthus to Cleidicus the son of Æsimidas <lb/>
            as well as these.</p>
          <p>Here too is painted the action of the Athenians at Man­ <lb/>
            tinea, who were sent to aid the Lacedemonians. Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon and others have written the history of the entire war, <lb/>
            the occupation of Cadmeia, and the slaughter of the Lace­ <lb/>
            damonians at Leuctra, and how the Boeotians made a raid <lb/>
            into the Peloponnese, and of the help that came to the <lb/>
            Lacedemonians from the Athenians. And in the picture <lb/>
            is the cavalry charge, the most noted officers in which <lb/>
            were on the Athenian side Gryllus, the son of Xenophon, <lb/>
            and in the Boeotian cavalry Epaminondas the Theban. <lb/>
            These paintings were painted for the Athenians by Eu­ <lb/>
            pliranor, and in the temple hard by he represented Apollo <lb/>
            under the name Patrous. And in front of the temple <lb/>
            Leochares represented another Apollo, and Calamis the <lb/>
            Apollo who is called Averter of Evil. And they say the <lb/>
            god got this name by stopping from his oracle at Delphi <lb/>
            the noisome pestilence, that smote them at the same time as <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian war. There is also a temple to the Mother <lb/>
            of the Gods. wrought by Phidias, and next to it a council­ <lb/>
            chamber for those who are called The Five Hundred, who <lb/>
            who are appointed annually. And in the council-chamber <lb/>
            are erected statues to Zeus the Counsellor, and to Apollo <lb/>
            (the artistic design of Pisias), and to Demos (the work of <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            Lyson). And the legislators were painted by the Caunian <lb/>
            Protogenes, but Olbiades painted Callippus, who led the <lb/>
            Athenians to Thermopylae to prevent the invasion of the <lb/>
            Galati into Greece.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW these Galati inhabit the remotest parts of Europe, <lb/>
            near a mighty sea, not navigable where they live: it <lb/>
            has tides and breakers and sea monsters quite unlike those <lb/>
            in any other sea: and through their territory flows the <lb/>
            river Eridanus, by whose banks people think the daughters <lb/>
            of the sun lament the fate of their brother Phaethon. And <lb/>
            it is only of late that the name Galati has prevailed among <lb/>
            them: for originally they were called Celts both by them­ <lb/>
            selves and by all other nations. And an army gathered <lb/>
            together by them marched towards the Ionian Sea, and <lb/>
            dispossessed all the nations of Illyria and all that dwelt <lb/>
            between them and the Macedonians, and even the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians themselves, and overran Thessaly. And when they <lb/>
            got near to Thermopylae most of the Greeks did not inter­ <lb/>
            fere with their onward march, remembering how badly <lb/>
            handled they had formerly been by Alexander and Philip, <lb/>
            and how subsequently Antipater and Cassander had nearly <lb/>
            ruined Greece; so that, on account of their weakness, they <lb/>
            did not consider it disgraceful individually that a general <lb/>
            defence should be abandoned. But the Athenians, although <lb/>
            they had suffered more than any other of the Greeks during <lb/>
            the long Macedonian war, and had had great losses in <lb/>
            battles, yet resolved to go forth to Thermopylae with those <lb/>
            of the Greeks who volunteered, having chosen this Callip­ <lb/>
            pus as their General. And having occupied the narrowest <lb/>
            pass they endeavoured to bar the passage of the barbarians <lb/>
            into Greece. But the Celts having discovered the same <lb/>
            defile by which Ephialtes the Trachinian had formerly <lb/>
            conducted the Persians, and having routed those of the <lb/>
            Phocians who were posted there in battle array, crossed <lb/>
            Mount CEta unbeknown to the Greeks. Then it was that <lb/>
            the Athenians displayed themselves to the Greeks as most <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            worthy, by their brave defence against the barbarians, being <lb/>
            taken both in front and flank. But those suffered most <lb/>
            that were in their ships, inasmuch as the Lamiac Gulf was <lb/>
            full of mud near Thermopylæ ; the explanation is, as it <lb/>
            seems to me, that here warm springs have their outlet into <lb/>
            the sea. Here therefore they suffered much. For, having <lb/>
            taken on board their comrades, they were obliged to sail <lb/>
            over mud in vessels heavy with men and armour. Thus <lb/>
            did the Athenians endeavour to save the Greeks in the <lb/>
            manner I have described. But the Galati having got inside <lb/>
            Pylæ, and not caring to take the other fortified towns, were <lb/>
            most anxious to plunder the treasures of the god at Delphi. <lb/>
            And the people of Delphi, and those of the Phocians who <lb/>
            dwelt in the cities round Parnassus, drew up in battle array <lb/>
            against them. A contingency of the Ætolians also arrived : <lb/>
            and you must know that at that era the Ætolians were <lb/>
            eminent for manly vigour. And when the armies engaged <lb/>
            not only did lightnings dismay the Galati, and fragments <lb/>
            of rock coming down on them from Parnassus, but three <lb/>
            mighty warriors pressed them hard, two, they say, came <lb/>
            from the Hyperboreans, Hyperochus and Amadocus, and <lb/>
            the third was Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles. And in consc­ <lb/>
            quence of this aid the Delphians offer sacrifice to Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            though before they held his tomb in dishonour as that of <lb/>
            an enemy. But the greater part of the Galati having <lb/>
            crossed into Asia Minor in their ships, ravaged its maritime <lb/>
            parts. And some time afterwards the inhabitants of Per­ <lb/>
            gamum, which in old times was called Teuthrania, drove <lb/>
            the Galati from the sea into the region now called Galatia. <lb/>
            They lived in the region east of the river Sangarius, having <lb/>
            captured Ancyra, a city of the Phrygians which Midas the <lb/>
            son of Gordias had formerly built. And the anchor which <lb/>
            Midas found was still, even in my time, in the temple of <lb/>
            Zeus, and the well shown which was called Midas' well: <lb/>
            which Midas, they say, poured wine into that he might <lb/>
            capture Silenus. As well as Ancyra they captured Pessi­ <lb/>
            nus near the mountain Agdistis, where they say Atte was <lb/>
            buried. And the people of Pergamum have spoils of the <lb/>
            Galati, and there is a painting of their action with the <lb/>
            Galati. And the region which the people of Pergamum <lb/>
            inhabit was in old times, they say, sacred to the Cabiri. <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            And they claim to be Arcadians who crossed over with <lb/>
            Telephus into Asia Minor. Of their other wars, if they <lb/>
            fought any, the fame has not universally spread : but three <lb/>
            most notable exploits have been performed by them, their <lb/>
            gaining dominion over the southern part of Asia Minor, and <lb/>
            their expulsion of the Galati from thence, and their venture <lb/>
            under Telephus against the forces of Agamemnon, when <lb/>
            the Greeks, unable to find Ilium, ravaged the Mysian plain, <lb/>
            thinking it was Trojan territory. But I return to where <lb/>
            I made my digression from.</p>

            EAR the council chamber of The Five Hundred is the <lb/>
            room called the Rotunda, and here the Prytanes sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, and there are some'silver statues not very large. And <lb/>
            higher up are some statues of the heroes, from whom the <lb/>
            tribes of the Athenians in later times got their names. <lb/>
            And who made the tribes ten instead of four, and changed <lb/>
            their names from the old ones, has been told by Herodotus. <lb/>
            And of the heroes who gave their names to the tribes, <lb/>
            (Eponymus is the name they give them), are Hippothoon, <lb/>
            the son of Poseidon by Alope the daughter of Cercyon, <lb/>
            and Antiochus, one of the sons of Hercules by Meda the <lb/>
            daughter of Phylas, and the third Ajax, the son of Telamon; <lb/>
            and of the Athenians Leo, who is said to have devoted all <lb/>
            his daughters for the public weal at the bidding of the <lb/>
            oracle. Erechtheus also is among the Eponyini, who con­ <lb/>
            quered the Eleusinians in battle, and slew their commander <lb/>
            Immaradus, the son of Eumolpus ; also iEgius, and Œneus <lb/>
            the illegitimate son of Pandion, and of the sons of Theseus <lb/>
            Acamas. And what Cecrops and Pandion they hold in <lb/>
            honour, (for I saw their statues too among the Eponymi), <lb/>
            I do not know, for there were two of each ; the first Cecrops, <lb/>
            that was king, married the daughter of Actseus, and the <lb/>
            other, who settled at Eubæa, was the son of Erechtheus, the <lb/>
            grandson of Pandion and the great grandson of Erichtho­ <lb/>
            nius, and the two Pandion kings were the son of Erich­ <lb/>
            thonius and the son of Cecrops the younger. The latter <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            was deposed from his kingdom by the Metionidæ, and when <lb/>
            he fled to Megara, the daughter of whose king he had <lb/>
            married, his sons were banished with him. And it is said <lb/>
            that Pandion died there of illness, and his tomb is near the <lb/>
            sea in Megara, on the rock that is called the rock of Athene <lb/>
            the Diver. But his sons returned from exile at Megara, <lb/>
            and expelled the Metionidæ, and Ægeus, being the eldest, <lb/>
            had the sovereignty over the Athenians. Pandion also <lb/>
            reared daughters, but not with good fortune, nor had they <lb/>
            any sons to avenge him. And yet for the love of power he <lb/>
            had made affinity with the king of Thrace. But man has <lb/>
            no power to escape what is willed by the Deity. They say <lb/>
            that Tereus (though married to Procne) dishonoured Phi­ <lb/>
            lomela, not acting according to the law of the Greeks : and, <lb/>
            having still further murdered the damsel, he compelled the <lb/>
            women to punish him. There is also another statue erected <lb/>
            to Pandion in the Acropolis, well worth seeing. These are <lb/>
            the ancient Eponymi of the Athenians. And after these <lb/>
            they have as Eponymi Attalus the Mysian, and Ptolemy <lb/>
            the Egyptian, and, in my time, the Emperor Adrian, who <lb/>
            worshipped the gods more religiously than anyone, and who <lb/>
            contributed most to the individual happiness of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects. And he never willingly undertook any war, only he <lb/>
            punished the revolt of the Hebrews who live beyond the <lb/>
            Syrians. And as to the temples of the gods, part of which <lb/>
            he originally built, and part of which he adorned with <lb/>
            votive offerings and decorations, or of the gifts which he <lb/>
            gave to the Greek cities and to those of the barbarians who <lb/>
            asked for them, all these good deeds of his are written up <lb/>
            at Athens, in the temple common to all the gods.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            S to the actions of Attalus and Ptolemy, not only are <lb/>
            they become more ancient from the progress of time, <lb/>
            so that the fame of them no longer remains, but also those <lb/>
            who lived with those kings in former days neglected to <lb/>
            register their exploits. I thought it well therefore to <lb/>
            record whatever works they did, and how it was that the <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            government of Egypt and of the Mysi, and of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring nations, fell to their fathers. Ptolemy, the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians think, was really the son of Philip the son of <lb/>
            Amyntas, (but putatively the son of Lagus), for his mother, <lb/>
            they say, was pregnant when she was given to Lagus to <lb/>
            wife by Philip. And they say that Ptolemy not only dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself brilliantly in Asia Minor, but, when <lb/>
            danger befel Alexander at Oxydracæ, he of all his com­ <lb/>
            panions was foremost to bring him aid. And upon the <lb/>
            death of Alexander, he it was who mainly resisted those <lb/>
            who wished to give all the dominions of Alexander to <lb/>
            Aridæus the son of Philip, and he again was responsible <lb/>
            for the different nationalities being divided into kingdoms. <lb/>
            And he himself crossed into Egypt and slew Cleomenes, <lb/>
            whom Alexander had made satrap of Egypt, thinking him <lb/>
            friendly to Perdiccas and therefore not loyal to himself, and <lb/>
            persuaded those of the Macedonians who were appointed to <lb/>
            carry the dead body of Alexander to Ægæ to hand it over <lb/>
            to him, and buried him at Memphis with the customary <lb/>
            Macedonian rites; but, feeling sure that Perdiccas would go <lb/>
            to war with him, he filled Egypt with garrisons. And Per­ <lb/>
            diccas, to give a specious colour to his expedition, led about <lb/>
            with him Aridæus the son of Philip, and the lad Alexan­ <lb/>
            der, the son of Alexander by Roxana the daughter of <lb/>
            Oxyartes, but really was plotting to take away the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Egypt from Ptolemy. But having been thrust out <lb/>
            of Egypt, and consequently losing his former prestige as <lb/>
            a general, and having incurred odium among the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians on other grounds, he was assassinated by his body­ <lb/>
            guard. The death of Perdiccas roused Ptolemy to imme­ <lb/>
            diate action : simultaneously he seized Syria and Phoenicia, <lb/>
            welcomed Seleucus the son of Antiochus, a fugitive who <lb/>
            had been driven into exile by Antigonus, and made prepa­ <lb/>
            rations to take the field in person against Antigonus. And <lb/>
            Cassander the son of Antipater, and Lysimachus king of <lb/>
            Thrace, he persuaded to join him in the war, saying that <lb/>
            the exile of Seleucus and the aggrandisement of Antigonus <lb/>
            was a common danger to all of them. Now Antigonus for <lb/>
            a time went on with his preparations, but by no means <lb/>
            courted war. But when he heard that Ptolemy had gone to <lb/>
            Libya to put down a revolt of the people of Cyrene, forthwith <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            he took Syria and Phoenicia by a coup-de-main, and, handing <lb/>
            them over to his son Demetrius, a boy in years a man in <lb/>
            intellect, returned to the Hellespont. But before getting <lb/>
            there, on hearing that Demetrius had been beaten in battle <lb/>
            by Ptolemy, he led his army back again. But <unclear>Demetrius</unclear>, so <lb/>
            far from yielding ground altogether to Ptolemy, planned an <lb/>
            ambush and cut to pieces a few of the Egyptians. And <lb/>
            now, upon Antigonus' coming up, Ptolemy did not wait for <lb/>
            him, but retired into Egypt. And when the winter was <lb/>
            over Demetrius sailed to Cyprus and beat Menelaus, Pto­ <lb/>
            lemy's satrap, in a naval engagement, and then Ptolemy <lb/>
            himself, as he tried to force his way through. And he fled <lb/>
            into Egypt and was blockaded both by land and sea by <lb/>
            Antigonus and Demetrius. But Ptolemy, although in great <lb/>
            straits, yet preserved his kingdom by stationing himself <lb/>
            with his army at Pelusium on the qui vive, and by keeping <lb/>
            the enemy from the river with his fleet. And Antigonus <lb/>
            had no further hope that he could take Egypt in the present <lb/>
            state of affairs, so he despatched Demetrius to the Rhodians <lb/>
            with a large army and ships, hoping that, if he could get <lb/>
            possession of Rhodes, he could use it as his base against <lb/>
            the Egyptians. But not only did the Rhodians exhibit <lb/>
            great daring and ingenuity against their besiegers, but also <lb/>
            Ptolemy himself to the utmost of his power assisted them <lb/>
            in the war. And Antigonus, though unsuccessful with <lb/>
            Rhodes and Egypt, ventured not long afterwards to fight <lb/>
            against Lysimachus and Cassander and the army of Se­ <lb/>
            leucus, and lost the greater part of his forces, and himself <lb/>
            died mainly from being worn out by the length of the war <lb/>
            against Eumenes. And of the kings that put down the <lb/>
            power of Antigonus I think the most unscrupulous was <lb/>
            Cassander, who, having preserved his rule over the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians only owing to Antigonus, went and fought <lb/>
            against a man that had been his benefactor. And after <lb/>
            the death of Antigonus, Ptolemy again took Syria and <lb/>
            Cyprus, and restored Pyrrhus to Thesprotian Epirus. And <lb/>
            when Cyrene revolted, Magas the son of Berenice, who was <lb/>
            at this time the wife of Ptolemy, took it in the fifth <lb/>
            year after the revolt. Now if this Ptolemy was really the <lb/>
            son of Philip the son of Amyntas, it will be clear that he <lb/>
            inherited this madness for women from his father, who, <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            though married to Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, <lb/>
            and having children by her, yet fell in love with Berenice, <lb/>
            (whom Antipater had sent into Egypt as a companion to <lb/>
            Eurydice), and so enamoured was he of her that he had <lb/>
            children by her, and when his end was near wined to reign <lb/>
            over Egypt Ptolemy, (from whom the Athenians name one <lb/>
            tribe), his son by Berenice and not by Eurydice.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HIS Ptolemy being enamoured of Arsinoe, his sister on <lb/>
            both sides, married her, doing what was by no means <lb/>
            usual among the Macedonians, but not uncommon among <lb/>
            his Egyptian subjects. And next he slew his brother Ar­ <lb/>
            gæus plotting against him, as was said. And he brought <lb/>
            the corpse of Alexander from Memphis. And he slew also <lb/>
            another brother, the son of Eurydice, observing that he was <lb/>
            trying to make the Cyprians revolt. And Magas the uterine <lb/>
            brother of Ptolemy, (being the son of Berenice and one <lb/>
            Philip, a Macedonian but one of the common people and <lb/>
            otherwise unknown), who had been chosen by his mother <lb/>
            to be governor of Cyrene, at this time persuaded the people <lb/>
            of Cyrene to revolt from Ptolemy and marched with an <lb/>
            army for Egypt. And Ptolemy, having guarded the ap­ <lb/>
            proaches, awaited the arrival of the men of Cyrene; but <lb/>
            Magas having had news brought him on the road that the <lb/>
            Marmaridæ had revolted from him, (now the Marmaridæ <lb/>
            are a tribe of Libyan Xomads), endeavoured to get back to <lb/>
            Cyrene at once. And Ptolemy, intending to follow him, <lb/>
            was prevented by the following reason. Among some of <lb/>
            his defensive operations aganst Magas, he had invited in <lb/>
            some foreign mercenaries, and among others some 4,000 <lb/>
            Galati; but finding that they were plotting to make them­ <lb/>
            selves masters of Egypt, he sent them down to the -Nile to <lb/>
            a desert island. And here they perished, partly by one <lb/>
            another's sword, partly by famine. And Magas being <lb/>
            the husband of Apame, the daughter of Antiochus the son <lb/>
            of Seleucus, persuaded Antiochus to violate the condi­ <lb/>
            tions which his father Seleucus had made with Pto­ <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            lemy, and to lead an army into Egypt. But as he was <lb/>
            preparing to do so, Ptolemy sent into all parts of Anti­ <lb/>
            chus’ dominions guerilla troops to ravage the country <lb/>
            where the defenders were weak, and more formidable bodies <lb/>
            he checked with his army, so that Antiochus had no longer <lb/>
            the chance to invade'Egypt. I have previously described <lb/>
            how this Ptolemy sent a fleet to aid the Athenians against <lb/>
            Antigonus and the Macedonians; but, indeed, the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians derived no great benefit from it. Now his sons were <lb/>
            not by Arsinoe his sister, but by the daughter of Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus, for although he was married to his sister and lived <lb/>
            with her, she pre-deceased him and was childless, and the <lb/>
            district Arsinoites is named after her.</p>

            UR subject now demands that we should relate the <lb/>
            doings of Attalus, for he is also one of the Athenian <lb/>
            Eponymi. A Macedonian by name Docimus, one of An­ <lb/>
            tigonus' generals, who afterwards gave himself and his <lb/>
            fortune into the hands of Lysimachus, had a Paphlagonian <lb/>
            eunuch called Philetærus. Now all the circumstances of <lb/>
            Philetserus' revolt from Lysimachus, and how he invited <lb/>
            in Seleucus, shall be narrated by me in my account of <lb/>
            Lysimachus. But this Attalus was the son of Attalus, and <lb/>
            nephew of Philetærus, and got the kingdom from Eumenes <lb/>
            his cousin handing it over to him. And this is the greatest <lb/>
            of his exploits, that he compelled the Galati to leave the <lb/>
            coast and go inland to Galatia, the country which they <lb/>
            now inhabit.</p>
          <p>And next to the statues of the Eppnymi are images of <lb/>
            the gods, Amphiaraus and Peace with Wealth as a boy in <lb/>
            her arms. Here, too, are statues in bronze of Lycurgus <lb/>
            the son of Lycophron, and of Callias who negotiated peace, <lb/>
            as most of the Athenians say, between the Greeks and <lb/>
            Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes. Here, too, is Demosthenes, <lb/>
            whom the Athenians drove into exile to Calauria, the island <lb/>
            near Trœzen, and after having recalled him drove him into <lb/>
            exile a second time after the defeat at Lamia. And when <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            Demosthenes went into exile the second time, he crossed <lb/>
            over again to Calauria, where he died by taking poison. <lb/>
            And lie was the only exile who was not handed over to An­ <lb/>
            tipater and the Macedonians by Archias. -Now this Archias, <lb/>
            who was a native of Thurii, acted very inhumanly. All who <lb/>
            had opposed the Macedonians before the disaster which betel <lb/>
            the Greeks in Thessaly, Archias handed over to Antipater <lb/>
            for punishment. Now this was the end of Demosthenes' <lb/>
            excessive affection for the Athenians. And it seems to me <lb/>
            deserving of record, that a man who had been cruelly exiled <lb/>
            for his policy, and had yet believed in the democracy, came <lb/>
            to a bad end.</p>
          <p>And near the statue of Demosthenes is the temple of <lb/>
            Ares, where are two images of Aphrodite, and one of Ares <lb/>
            designed by Alcamenes, and one of Athene designed by a <lb/>
            Parian by name Locrus. Here too is an image of Envo <lb/>
            by the sons of Praxiteles. And round the temple are <lb/>
            statues of Hercules, and Theseus, and Apollo with his long <lb/>
            hair in a fillet : and statues of Calades, who was a legis­ <lb/>
            lator of the Athenians according to tradition, and of Pindar, <lb/>
            who amongst other honour obtained this statue from the <lb/>
            Athenians because he praised them in an Ode. And at no <lb/>
            great distance are statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton, <lb/>
            the murderers of Hipparchus: the motive and manner of <lb/>
            this murder has been told by others. And of these statues <lb/>
            some are by Critias, but the oldest ones by Antenor. And <lb/>
            although Xerxes when he captured Athens, (the Athenians <lb/>
            having left the city), took them off as booty, Antiochus sent <lb/>
            them back afterwards to the Athenians. <lb/>
            And in the theatre, which they call Odeum, there are <lb/>
            statues, in the entrance, of the Egyptian Kings. Their <lb/>
            names are all Ptolemy alike, but each has another distin­ <lb/>
            guishing name also. Thus they call one Philometor, and <lb/>
            another Philadelphus, and the son of Lagus Soter, a name <lb/>
            the Rhodians gave him. Philadelphus is the one whom <lb/>
            I have before made mention of as one of the Eponymi. <lb/>
            And near him is also a statue of his sister Arsinoe.</p><pb n="16"/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW the Ptolemy called Philometor is the eighth in <lb/>
            descent from Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and he got <lb/>
            his name in irony; for none of these kings that we know <lb/>
            of was so hated by their mother as he was ; for though he <lb/>
            was the eldest of her sons she would not allow them to call <lb/>
            him to the kingdom, but got him banished to Cyprus by <lb/>
            his father previously. Now of this dislike of Cleopatra to <lb/>
            her son they allege other motives, but especially this one, <lb/>
            that she thought Alexander, the younger of her sons, would <lb/>
            be more obsequious to her. And therefore she urged the <lb/>
            Egyptians to choose Alexander for their king. And when <lb/>
            the people opposed her in this, she sent Alexander to <lb/>
            Cyprus, nominally as general, but really because she wished <lb/>
            through him to make herself more formidable to Philo­ <lb/>
            metor. And at last having mutilated those of the eu­ <lb/>
            nuchs whom she thought most friendly, she brought <lb/>
            them before the populace, and pretended that she was <lb/>
            plotted against by Philometor, and that the eunuchs had <lb/>
            been treated in that shameful manner by him. And the <lb/>
            Alexandrians were eager to kill Philometor, but, as he got <lb/>
            on shipboard and escaped them, they made Alexander king <lb/>
            on his return from Cyprus. But Cleopatra was punished <lb/>
            eventually for her getting Philometor banished by being <lb/>
            slain by Alexander, whom she had got appointed king over <lb/>
            the Egyptians. And the crime being detected, and Alex­ <lb/>
            ander fleeing from fear of the citizens, Philometor quietly <lb/>
            returned from exile and a second time held Egypt, and <lb/>
            warred against the Tbebans who had revolted. And having <lb/>
            reduced them in the third year after the revolt, he punished <lb/>
            them so severely that there was no vestige left them of <lb/>
            their ancient prosperity, which had reached such a pitch <lb/>
            that they excelled in wealth the wealthiest of the Greeks, <lb/>
            even the treasures of the temple at Delphi and the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians. And Philometor not long after meeting the <lb/>
            common fate, the Athenians who had been well treated by <lb/>
            him in many respects that I need not enumerate, erected a <lb/>
            brazen statue both of him and Berenice, his only legitimate <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            child. And next to the Egyptian kings are statuesofPhilip <lb/>
            and his son Alexander. They performed greater exploits <lb/>
            than to be mere appendages to an account of something <lb/>
            else. To the other Egyptian kings gifts were given as <lb/>
            being of real merit and benefactors, but to Philip and <lb/>
            Alexander more, from the flattery of the community towards <lb/>
            them, for they also honoured Lysimachus by a statue, not so <lb/>
            much out of good will as thinking him useful under ex­ <lb/>
            istine, circumstances.</p>
          <p>Xow this Lysimachus was by birth a Macedonian and <lb/>
            the armour-bearer of Alexander, whom Alexander once in <lb/>
            anger shut up in a building with a lion and found him vic­ <lb/>
            torious over the beast. In all other respects he continued <lb/>
            to admire him, and held him in honour as among the fore­ <lb/>
            most of the Macedonians. And after Alexander's death <lb/>
            Lysimachus ruled over those Thracians who were contigu­ <lb/>
            ous to the Macedonians, over whom Alexander had ruled, <lb/>
            and still earlier Philip. And these would be no very great <lb/>
            portion of Thrace. Now no nations are more populous <lb/>
            than all the Thracians, except the Celts, if one compares <lb/>
            one race with another; and that is why none of the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans ever subdued all Thrace at an earlier period. But all <lb/>
            Thrace is now subject to the Romans, and as much of the <lb/>
            Celtic land as they think useless from the excessive cold <lb/>
            and inferiority of the soil has been purposely overlooked by <lb/>
            them, but the valuable parts they stick to. Now Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus at this period fought with the Odrysæ first of all <lb/>
            his neighbours, and next went on an expedition against <lb/>
            Dromichetes and the Getæ. And fighting with men not <lb/>
            inexperienced in war, and in number far superior, he <lb/>
            himself getting into the greatest danger, fled for his life; <lb/>
            and his son Agathocles, now first accompanying his father <lb/>
            on campaign, was captured by the Getce. And Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus after this, being unfortunate in battles and being <lb/>
            greatly concerned at the capture of his son, made a peace <lb/>
            with Dromichetes, abandoning to Getes his possessions <lb/>
            across the Ister. and giving him his daughter in marriage, <lb/>
            more of necessity than choice. But some say that it was <lb/>
            not Agathocles who was captured, but Lysimachus himself, <lb/>
            and that he was ransomed by Agathocles negotiating with <lb/>
            Getes on his account And when he returned he brought <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            with him for Agathocles a wife in Lysandra, the daughter <lb/>
            of Ptolemy Lagus and Eurydice. And he crossed over into <lb/>
            Asia Minor in his fleet, and destroyed the rule of Antigo­ <lb/>
            nus. And he built the present city of the Ephesians near <lb/>
            the sea, bringing into it as settlers Lebedians and Colopho­ <lb/>
            nians, after destroying their cities, so that Phoenix, the <lb/>
            Iambic writer, laments the capture of Colophon. Her­ <lb/>
            mesianax, the Elegiac writer, could not have lived, it seems <lb/>
            to me, up to this date; for else he would surely have <lb/>
            written an elegy over the capture of Colophon. Lysima­ <lb/>
            chus also waged war against Pyrrhus the son of Æacides. <lb/>
            And watching for his departure from Epirus, as indeed he <lb/>
            was wandering most of his time, he ravaged all the rest of <lb/>
            Epirus, and even meddled with the tombs of the kings. I <lb/>
            can scarce believe it, but Hieronymus of Cardia has recorded <lb/>
            that Lysimachus took up the tombs of the dead and strewed <lb/>
            the bones about. But this Hieronymus has the reputation <lb/>
            even on other grounds of having written with hostility against <lb/>
            all the kings except Antigonus, and of not having been alto­ <lb/>
            gether just even to him. And in this account of the tombs in <lb/>
            Epirus he clearly must have invented the calumny, that a <lb/>
            Macedonian would interfere with the tombs of the dead. And <lb/>
            besides it appears that Lysimachus did not know that the <lb/>
            people of Epirus were not only the ancestors of Pyrrhus <lb/>
            but also of Alexander; for Alexander was not only a native <lb/>
            of Epirus, but on his mother's side one of the Æacidæ. <lb/>
            And the subsequent alliance between Pyrrhus and Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus proves that if they did fight together there was no <lb/>
            irreconcilable animosity between them. But perhaps Hie­ <lb/>
            ronymus had other causes of complaint against Lysimachus <lb/>
            besides the chief one that he destroyed the city of Cardia, <lb/>
            and built instead of it Lysimachia on the Isthmus of the <lb/>
            Thracian Chersonese.</p>

            OW as long as Aridæus, and after him Cassander <lb/>
            and his sons, ruled, there was friendship between <lb/>
            Lysimachus and the Macedonians ; but when the kingdom <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            came to Demetrius the son of Antigonus, then at once <lb/>
            Lysimachus thought war would be waged against him by <lb/>
            Demetrius, and preferred to take the initiative himself, <lb/>
            knowing that it was a family tradition with Demetrius to <lb/>
            wish to be grasping something, and at the same time ob­ <lb/>
            serving that he had come to Macedonia on being sent for <lb/>
            by Alexander the son of Cassander, and on his arrival had <lb/>
            killed Alexander and taken in his stead the kingdom of the <lb/>
            Macedonians. For these reasons he fought with Demetrius <lb/>
            at Amphipolis and was within an ace of being ejected from <lb/>
            Thrace, but through the help of Pyrrhus he retained Thrace <lb/>
            and afterwards ruled the Nestians and Macedonians also. <lb/>
            But the greater part of Macedonia Pyrrhus kept for himself, <lb/>
            coming with a force from Epirus and being useful to Lysi­ <lb/>
            machus at that time. But when Demetrius crossed over <lb/>
            into Asia Minor and fought with Seleucus, as long as the <lb/>
            fortunes of Demetrius lasted the alliance between Pyrrhus <lb/>
            and Lysimachus remained unbroken; but when Demetrius <lb/>
            got into the power of Seleucus the friendship was dissolved, <lb/>
            and Lysimachus fought with Antigonus, the son of Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, and with Pyrrhus himself, and was easily victorious <lb/>
            and got Macedonia and compelled Pyrrhus to return to <lb/>
            Epirus. Now many misfortunes are wont to come on men <lb/>
            through love. For Lysimachus being already advanced in <lb/>
            age, and being reputed fortunate in respect to his offspring, <lb/>
            and although his son Agathocles had children by Lysandra, <lb/>
            yet married Arsinoe Lysandra's sister. And it is said that <lb/>
            this Arsinoe, fearing for her children that after the death <lb/>
            of Lysimachus they would be in the hands of Agathocles, <lb/>
            for these reasons conspired against Agathocles. And some <lb/>
            writers have alleged that Arsinoe was violently in love <lb/>
            with Agathocles, but being disappointed in this plotted <lb/>
            his death. And they say that afterwards Lysimachus <lb/>
            came to know of the awful doings of his wife, when it <lb/>
            was too late to be of any service to him, being entirely <lb/>
            deprived of his friends. For when Lysimachus permitted <lb/>
            Arsinoe to put Agathocles to death, Lysandra fled to <lb/>
            Seleucus, taking with her her sons and brothers, and in <lb/>
            consequence of what had happened they fled for refuge <lb/>
            to Ptolemy. And these fugitives to the court of Seleu­ <lb/>
            cus were accompanied by Alexander also, the son of <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            Lysimachus by his wife Odrysiades. And they, having <lb/>
            got to Babylon, besought Seleucus to go to war with <lb/>
            Lysimachus ; and Philetærus at the same time, who had <lb/>
            had all the money of Lysimachus entrusted to him, indig­ <lb/>
            nant at the death of Agathocles and thinking the conduct <lb/>
            of Arsinoe suspicious, occupied Pergamum beyond the river <lb/>
            Caicus, and sent an envoy and offered himself and his <lb/>
            money to Seleucus. And Lysimachus, learning all this, <lb/>
            crossed into Asia Minor forthwith, and himself began the <lb/>
            war, and encountering Seleucus was badly beaten and him­ <lb/>
            self killed. And Alexander, who was his son by his wife <lb/>
            Odrysiades, after much entreaty to Lysandra recovered <lb/>
            his corpse, and subsequently conveyed it to the Chersonnese <lb/>
            and buried it there, where even now his tomb is to be seen, <lb/>
            between the village Cardia and Pactye. Such was the fate <lb/>
            of Lysimachus.</p>

            HE Athenians also have a statue of Pyrrhus. This <lb/>
            Pyrrhus was only related to Alexander by ancestry. <lb/>
            For Pyrrhus was the son of Æacides the son of Arybbas, <lb/>
            whereas Alexander was the son of Olympias the daughter <lb/>
            of Neoptolemus. Now, Neoptolemus and Arybbas had the <lb/>
            same father, Alcetas the son of Tharypus. And from <lb/>
            Tharypus to Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, are fifteen gene­ <lb/>
            rations. For he first, after the capture of Ilium, neglected <lb/>
            returning home to Thessaly, and removed to Epirus and <lb/>
            dwelt there in accordance with the oracles of Helenus. <lb/>
            And he had no son by Hermione, but by Andromache he <lb/>
            had Molossus and Pielus and the youngest Pergamus. <lb/>
            And Helenus also had a son Cestrinus by Andromache, <lb/>
            whom he married after the death of Pyrrhus at Delphi. <lb/>
            And when Helen-as died having handed over the king­ <lb/>
            dom to Molossus the son of Pyrrhus, Cestrinus with the <lb/>
            Epirotes who volunteered to go with him occcupicd the <lb/>
            region across the river Thyamis, and Pergamus, crossing <lb/>
            into Asia Minor, killed Arius the king of Teuthrania in single <lb/>
            combat for the sovereignty of the country, and gave the <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            city his own name, which it now has. There is also to this <lb/>
            day a temple of Andromache, who accompanied him, in the <lb/>
            city. But Pielus remained at home in Epirus, and it was to <lb/>
            him and not to Molossus that Pyrrhus the son of Æacides <lb/>
            and his fathers traced up their ancestry. Now up to the <lb/>
            days of Alcetas the son of Tharypus Epirus was under one <lb/>
            king; but the sons of Alcetas after some quarrelling <lb/>
            changed the government to an equal share for each, and <lb/>
            remained loyal to that agreement; and afterwards Alex­ <lb/>
            ander the son of Neoptolemus died in Lucania, and Olym­ <lb/>
            pias returned to Epirus from fear of Antipater, and <lb/>
            Æacides, the son of Arybbas, in all respects remained loyal <lb/>
            to Olympias, and even joined her in fighting against <lb/>
            Aridæus and the Macedonians, though the people of Epirus <lb/>
            were unwilling to enter into it. But as Olympias, when <lb/>
            she conquered, had acted infamously in connection with <lb/>
            the death of Aridæus, and far more so to the Macedonians, <lb/>
            and consequently was thought afterwards to have only met <lb/>
            with her deserts from Cassander, the Epirotes would not <lb/>
            receive Æacides for a time owing to their hostility against <lb/>
            Olympias; and when he obtained pardon from them some <lb/>
            time after Cassander again prevented his return to Epirus. <lb/>
            And a battle being fought between Philip (the brother of <lb/>
            Cassander) and Æacides at Œnidæ, iEacides was wounded <lb/>
            and died no long time after. And the people of Epirus <lb/>
            made Alcetas king, the son of Arybbas and elder brother <lb/>
            of AEacides, a man on previous occasions of ungovernable <lb/>
            temper, and for that very reason banished by his father. <lb/>
            And now on his arrival he immediately so madly raged <lb/>
            against the people of Epirus, that they rose up against him <lb/>
            by night and killed him and his sons. And when they had <lb/>
            killed him they brought back from exile Pyrrhus the son <lb/>
            of Æacides. And immediately on his arrival Cassander <lb/>
            marched against him, as being young and not firmly estab­ <lb/>
            lished in the sovereignty. But Pyrrhus, on the invasion of <lb/>
            the Macedonians, went to Egypt to Ptolemy the son of <lb/>
            Lagus; and Ptolemy gave him as wife the uterine sister of <lb/>
            his own children, and restored him with a force of Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians. And Pyrrhus, on becoming king, attacked the <lb/>
            Corcyræans first of the Greeks, seeing that the island of <lb/>
            Corcyra lay opposite to his own territory, and not wishing <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            it to be a base for operations against him. And after the <lb/>
            capture of Corcyra all the defeats he met with fighting <lb/>
            against Lysimachus, and how after he had driven Demetrius <lb/>
            out of Macedonia he ruled there until he in turn was ejected <lb/>
            by Lysimachus,—all these, the most important events <lb/>
            at that time in Pyrrhus' life, have been already narrated <lb/>
            by me in connection with Lysimachus. And we know of <lb/>
            no Greek before Pyrrhus that warred with the Romans. <lb/>
            For there is no record of any engagement between Æneas <lb/>
            and Diomede and the Argives with him ; and the Athenians, <lb/>
            who were very ambitious and desired to reduce all Italy, <lb/>
            were prevented by the disaster at Syracuse from attacking <lb/>
            the Romans; and Alexander the son of Neoptolemus, of <lb/>
            the same race as Pyrrhus but older in age, was prevented <lb/>
            by his death in Lucania from coming to blows with the <lb/>
            Romans.</p>

          <p>s <lb/>
            0 Pyrrhus is the first that crossed the Ionian Sea from <lb/>
            Greece to fight against the Romans. And he crossed <lb/>
            at the invitation of the people of Tarentum, who had <lb/>
            had earlier than this a war of long standing with the <lb/>
            Romans: and being unable to resist them by themselves, <lb/>
            (and they had already done services to Pyrrhus, for they <lb/>
            had aided him with their fleet when he was warring against <lb/>
            Corcyra), their envoys won Pyrrhus over, giving him to <lb/>
            understand that it would be for the happiness of all Greece, <lb/>
            and that it would not be honourable for him to leave them <lb/>
            in the lurch, inasmuch as they were friends and on the <lb/>
            present occasion suppliants. And as the envoys urged <lb/>
            these things, the remembrance of the capture of Ilium <lb/>
            came to Pyrrhus, and he hoped the same would happen to <lb/>
            him: for he, a descendant of Achilles, would be warring <lb/>
            against colonies of Trojans. And as the idea pleased him, <lb/>
            (and he was not the man to loiter at anything he had a <lb/>
            mind for), he forthwith equipped men-of-war and transports <lb/>
            and got ready cavalry and infantry to take with him. Now, <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            there are some books written by men not remarkable for his­ <lb/>
            torical power still extant, called COMMENTARIES OF EVENTS. <lb/>
            As often as I read them I am inclined to marvel, not only <lb/>
            at the daring of Pyrrhus which he displayed in action, but <lb/>
            also at the forethought which he always exhibited. On this <lb/>
            occasion he crossed over into Italy in his ships unbeknown <lb/>
            to the Romans, and his arrival was unknown to them until, <lb/>
            (an attack being made by them upon the people of Taren­ <lb/>
            tum), he first showed himself at the head of his army, and, <lb/>
            attacking them contrary to their expectation, threw them <lb/>
            into confusion as was only likely. And, knowing full well <lb/>
            that he was not a match for the Romans in fighting, <lb/>
            he contrived to let loose elephants upon them. -Now Alex­ <lb/>
            ander was the first European who had elephants, after the <lb/>
            conquest of Porus and India: and on his death other <lb/>
            European kings had them, and Anti-onus a very large <lb/>
            quantity of them : and the elephants of Pyrrhus were cap­ <lb/>
            hIred by him in the battle with Demetrius. And now on <lb/>
            their appearance a panic seized the Romans, who thought <lb/>
            they were something superhuman. For the use of ivory <lb/>
            indeed all nations have clearly known from the earliest <lb/>
            times ; but the animals themselves, until the Macedonians <lb/>
            crossed into Asia, no nations had seen at all except the <lb/>
            Indians and Libyans and the adjacent nations. And Homer <lb/>
            proves this. who has represented the beds and houses of the <lb/>
            wealthier of the kings as decked with ivory, but has made <lb/>
            no mention whatever of the elephant. And if he had seen <lb/>
            or heard of them he would, I think, have recorded them <lb/>
            rather than the battle of the Pygmies and cranes. Pyrrhus <lb/>
            was also invited into Sicily by an embassy of Syracusans. <lb/>
            For the Carthaginians used to cross over and take the <lb/>
            Greek cities in Sicily, and Syracuse the only one left they <lb/>
            were blockading and besieging. And Pyrrhus, hearing this <lb/>
            from the envoys, left Tarentum and the Italians that dwelt <lb/>
            on the headland, and crossed over into Sicily and compelled <lb/>
            the Carthaginians to raise the siege. And, having over­ <lb/>
            weening self-confidence, he was elated to fight on sea against <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, (who were the greatest maritime nation <lb/>
            of all the barbarians of that day, having been originally <lb/>
            Tyrians and Phœnicians), with the natives of Epirus only, <lb/>
            who even after the capture of Ilium were most of them <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            unacquainted with the sea, and knew not the use of salt. <lb/>
            As that line of Homer, in the " Odyssey," bears me out: <lb/>
            " Men who know not the sea, nor eat food seasoned with salt." 1</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HEN Pyrrhus, after his defeat, sailed for Tarentum <lb/>
            with the remnant of his fleet. There his fortunes suf­ <lb/>
            fered great reverses, and he contrived his flight in the <lb/>
            following manner, (for he knew that the Romans would not <lb/>
            let him go scot-free). On his return from Sicily he first <lb/>
            sent letters everywhere to Asia Minor and Antigonus, ask­ <lb/>
            ing for soldiers from some of the kings and for money <lb/>
            from others, and for both from Antigonus. And when <lb/>
            the messengers returned and their letters were given to <lb/>
            him, he called together a council of the chief men of <lb/>
            Epirus and Tarentum, and read none of the letters which <lb/>
            he had with him but merely said that aid would come. <lb/>
            And quickly a report spread among the Romans, that the <lb/>
            Macedonians and other tribes of Asia Minor were going <lb/>
            to come over to the help of Pyrrhus. So the Romans <lb/>
            when they heard this remained quiet, and Pyrrhus under <lb/>
            the shelter of the next night crossed over to the moun­ <lb/>
            tains which they call Ceraunia. And after this reverse <lb/>
            in Italy he remained quiet with his forces for some time, <lb/>
            and then proclaimed war against Antigonus, bringing <lb/>
            other charges against him but mainly because he had <lb/>
            failed to bring reinforcements to Italy. And having beaten <lb/>
            Antigonus' own troops, and the foreign contingent with <lb/>
            him of the Galati, he pursued them to the maritime cities, <lb/>
            and became master of Upper Macedonia and Thessaly. <lb/>
            And the greatness of the battle and the magnitude of <lb/>
            Pyrrhus' victory are shown by the arms of the Galati hung <lb/>
            up in the temple of Athene Itonia between Pheræ and La­ <lb/>
            rissa, and the inscription on them is as follows :</p>
          <p>" Molossian Pyrrhus hung up these shields of the brave <lb/>
            Galati to Itonian Athene, when he had destroyed all the <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xi., 122, 123. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            host of Antigonus. No great wonder. The Æacidæ are <lb/>
            warriors now as formerly.”</p>
          <p>The shields of the Galati he put here, but those of the <lb/>
            Macedonians he hung up to Zens of the Macedonians at <lb/>
            Dodona. And the following is the inscription on them : <lb/>
            These formerly ravaged the wealthy Asian territory, <lb/>
            These also brought slavery to the Greeks; <lb/>
            But now hang up on the pillars in the house of Zeus <lb/>
            The spoils snatched from boasting Macedonia.”</p>
          <p>But Pyrrhus was prevented from overthrowing the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians entirely, though he came within an ace of it, and <lb/>
            was only too ready always to seize whatever was at his feet, <lb/>
            by Cleonymus. Now this Cleonymus, who had persuaded <lb/>
            Pyrrhus to leave Macedonia and come to the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            although a Lacedemonian led a hostile force into the tern­ <lb/>
            tory of the Lacedemonians, for the reason which I shall <lb/>
            give after his pedigree. Pausanias that led the Greeks at <lb/>
            Platæa had a son Pleistoanax, and he a son Pausanias, and <lb/>
            he a son Cleombrotus, who fought against Epaminondas and <lb/>
            the Thebans, and was killed at Leuctra. And Cleombrotus <lb/>
            had two sons Agesipolis and Cleomenes, and the former <lb/>
            dying childless Cleomenes had the kingdom. And he had <lb/>
            two sons, the elder Acrotatus and the younger Cleonymns. <lb/>
            And Acrotatus dying first and after him Cleomenes, there <lb/>
            was a dispute who should be king between Acrotatus' son, <lb/>
            Areus, and Cleonymus. And Cleonymus, determined to <lb/>
            get the kingdom whether or no, called in Pyrrhus into the <lb/>
            country. And the Lacedemonians before Leuctra had met <lb/>
            with no reverse, so that they would not admit they could <lb/>
            be conquered by a land army: for in the case of Leonidas <lb/>
            they said his followers were not sufficient to completely <lb/>
            destroy the Persians, and as for the exploit of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes and the Athenians at the island of Sphacteria, they <lb/>
            said that was a fluke of war and not a genuine victory. <lb/>
            But after their first reverse in Bceotia, they had a second <lb/>
            severe one with Antipater and the Macedonians : and thirdly <lb/>
            the war with Demetrius came on the land as an unexpected <lb/>
            evil. And wheu fourthly Pyrrhus invaded them, when <lb/>
            they saw the enemy's army, they drew up in battle array <lb/>
            together with their allies from Argos and Messene. And <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            Pyrrhus conquered and was within an ace of taking Sparta <lb/>
            at the first assault; but after having ravaged their terri­ <lb/>
            tory and got much booty he rested for awhile. And the <lb/>
            Spartans prepared for a siege, Sparta even before in the war <lb/>
            with Demetrius having been fortified by deep trenches and <lb/>
            strong palisades, and in the weakest parts by special works. <lb/>
            And during this time and the long Laconian war Antigo­ <lb/>
            nus having fortified the towns of the Macedonians pressed <lb/>
            into the Peloponnesse, perceiving that Pyrrhus, if he should <lb/>
            subdue Sparta and most of the Peloponnese, would not go <lb/>
            into Epirus, but into Macedonia again and to the war sure to <lb/>
            come there. And when Antigonus was intending to move <lb/>
            his army from Argos into Spartan territory, Pyrrhus himself <lb/>
            had arrived at Argos. And, being victorious, he followed <lb/>
            the fugitives and entered the city with them, and, as was <lb/>
            likely, his army dispersed into all quarters of the city. And <lb/>
            as they were fighting in the temples and houses and alleys <lb/>
            and in all parts of the city promiscuously, Pyrrhus was left <lb/>
            all alone and got wounded in the head. They say Pyrrhus <lb/>
            was killed by a tile thrown by a woman : but the Argives say <lb/>
            it was not a woman that slew him, but Demcter in the form <lb/>
            of a woman. This is the account which the Argives them­ <lb/>
            selves give of the death of Pyrrhus ; this is also what Lyceas, <lb/>
            the expounder of his country's usages, has written in his <lb/>
            verses. And on the spot where Pyrrhus died was erected a <lb/>
            temple to Demeter in accordance with the oracle of the god : <lb/>
            and in it was Pyrrhus buried. I am astonished that of all <lb/>
            those who were called Æacidæ their end happened in the <lb/>
            same supernatural manner, since Homer .says Achilles was <lb/>
            slain by Alexander the son of Priam and by Apollo; and <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, was ordered to be slain by the <lb/>
            Pythian oracle at Delphi; and this son of Æacides met his <lb/>
            fate as has been recorded by the Argives and sung by <lb/>
            Lyceas. And yet this is different to the account given by <lb/>
            Hieronymus of Cardia : for one that lives with a king must <lb/>
            needs write history like a courtier. And if Philistus, <lb/>
            hoping for a return to Syracuse, was justified in concealing <lb/>
            the most flagitious acts of Dionysius, then Hieronymus, I <lb/>
            ween, had good excuse for writing to please Antigonus. <lb/>
            Such was the end of the glory of Epirus.</p><pb n="27"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            XD as one enters the Odeumat Athens, there is a Dio­ <lb/>
            nysus and other things worth seeing. And near is a <lb/>
            spring called the Nine Springs constructed so by Pisistratus : <lb/>
            for there are wells all over the city but this is the only<lb/>
            springs And two temples have been built over flip, spring, <lb/>
            one to Demeter and the other to Proserpine; in one of them <lb/>
            is a statue to TriptoIemus, about whom I will record the <lb/>
            traditions, omitting what is said about Deiope. Now the <lb/>
            Argives are those of the Greeks who chiefly dispute with <lb/>
            the Athenians their rival claims to antiquity, and assert <lb/>
            that they have received gifts from the gods, just as among <lb/>
            the barbarians the Egyptians have similar disputes with <lb/>
            the Phrygians. The story goes then that when Demeter <lb/>
            came to Argos Pelasgus received her into his house, and <lb/>
            that Chrysanthis, knowing of the rape of Proserpine, in­ <lb/>
            formed her of it: and afterwards Trochilus the initiating <lb/>
            priest fled they say from Argos in consequence of the <lb/>
            hatred of Agenor, and came to Attica, and there married a <lb/>
            wife from Eleusis, and had children by her, Eubules and <lb/>
            Triptolemus. This is the account of the Argives. But <lb/>
            the Athenians and neighbouring tribes know that Triptole­ <lb/>
            mus, the son of Celeus, was the first who sowed corn in the <lb/>
            fields. And it is sung by Musæus, (if indeed the lines are <lb/>
            by Musæus), that Triptolemus was the son of Ocean and <lb/>
            Earth, and it is sung by Orpheus, (if these lines again are <lb/>
            by Orpheus, which I doubt), that Dysaules was the father <lb/>
            of Eubules and Triptolemus, and that Demeter taught them <lb/>
            how to sow corn because they had given her information <lb/>
            about the rape of her daughter. But the Athenian Chceri­ <lb/>
            lus, in the play called "Alope," says that Cercyon and Trip­ <lb/>
            tolemus were brothers, that their mother was a daughter of <lb/>
            Amphictyon, and that the father of Triptolemus was Rharus, <lb/>
            and the father of Cercyon Poseidon. And as I was intend­ <lb/>
            in- to go further into the account, and narrate all things <lb/>
            appertaining to the temple at Athens called the Eleusinium, <lb/>
            a vision in the night checked me : but what it is lawful for <lb/>
            me to write for everybody, to this I will turn. In front of <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            this temple, where is also a statue of Triptolemus, there is­ <lb/>
            a brazen bull being led to sacrifice, and Epimenides the <lb/>
            Gnossian. is pourtrayed in a sitting posture, who is recorded <lb/>
            to have gone into a field and entered into a cave and slept <lb/>
            there, and woke not from that sleep till forty years had <lb/>
            rolled by, and afterwards wrote epic poems and visited <lb/>
            Athens and other cities. And Thales, who stopped the <lb/>
            plague at Lacedemon, was no relation of his, nor of the <lb/>
            same city as Epimenides: for the latter was a Gnossian, <lb/>
            whereas Thales is declared to have been a Gortynian by the <lb/>
            Colyphonian Polymnastus, who wrote a poem on him for <lb/>
            the Lacedemonians. And a little further is the temple of <lb/>
            Euclea, (Fair Fame), a votive'offering for the victory over <lb/>
            the Persians at Marathon. And I think the Athenians <lb/>
            prided themselves not a little on this victory: Æschylus, at <lb/>
            any rate, on his deathbed, remembered none of his other <lb/>
            exploits, though he was so remarkable as a Dramatist and <lb/>
            had fought both at Artemisium and Salamis : and he wrote <lb/>
            in the Poem he then composed his own name and the name <lb/>
            of his city, and that he had as witnesses of his prowess the <lb/>
            grove at Marathon and the Persians who landed there.</p>
          <p>And beyondthe Ceramicus and the portico called The <lb/>
            Royal Portico is a temple of Hephæstus, and that a <lb/>
            statue of Athene was placed in it I was not at all sur­ <lb/>
            prised at when I remembered the story about Erichthonius. <lb/>
            But seeing that the statue of Athene had grey eyes, I <lb/>
            found that this was a legend of the Libyans, who record <lb/>
            that she was the daughter of Poseidon and the Tritonian <lb/>
            Marsh, and that therefore her eyes were grey as those of <lb/>
            Poseidon. And near-is a temple of Celestial Aphrodite, <lb/>
            who was first worshipped by the Assyrians, and after them <lb/>
            by the Paphians of Cyprus, and by the Phœnicians who <lb/>
            dwell at Ascalon in Palestine. And from the Phœnicians <lb/>
            the people of Cythera learned her worship. And among <lb/>
            the Athenians her worship was instituted by Ægeus, think­ <lb/>
            ing that he had no children, (for he had none then), and <lb/>
            that his sisters were unfortunate, owing to the wrath of the <lb/>
            Celestial One. And her statue-is still among us of Parian <lb/>
            stone, the design of Phidias. And the Athenians have a <lb/>
            township of the Athmoneans, who say that Porphyrion, who <lb/>
            reigned even before Actæus, erected among them a temple <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            to the Celestial Aphrodite. But the traditions of townships <lb/>
            and the dwellers in cities are widely different.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as one goes into the portico, which they call The <lb/>
            Painted Chamber from the paintings, there is a brazen <lb/>
            statue of Hermes of the Market-Place, and a gate near, and <lb/>
            by it is a trophy of the Athenians who overcame Plistar­ <lb/>
            chus in a cavalry engagement, who, being the brother of <lb/>
            Cassander, had brought his cavalry and a foreign force <lb/>
            against them. Now, this portico has first the Athenians <lb/>
            drawn up in battle array, at Œnoe in Argive territory, <lb/>
            against the Lacedemonians: and it is painted not in the <lb/>
            height of the action, nor when the time had come for the <lb/>
            display of reckless valour in the heady fight, but at the <lb/>
            commencement of the engagement, and when they were <lb/>
            just coming to blows. And in the middle of the walls are <lb/>
            painted the Athenians and Theseus fighting with the Ama­ <lb/>
            zons. Now these are the only women as it seems from <lb/>
            whom reverses in war did not take away a relish for danger; <lb/>
            for after the capture of Themiscyra by Hercules, and later <lb/>
            on after the destruction of the army which they sent against <lb/>
            Athens, they yet went to Ilium and fought with the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and other Greeks. And next to the Amazons you <lb/>
            may see painted the Greeks at the capture of Ilium, and <lb/>
            the kings gathered together on account of Ajax's violence <lb/>
            to Cassandra: and the painting has Ajax himself, and <lb/>
            Cassandra among the other captive women. And at the <lb/>
            end of the painting are the Greeks that fought at Marathon, <lb/>
            of the Bceotians the Platæans, and all the Attic contingent <lb/>
            are marching against the barbarians. And in this part of <lb/>
            the painting the valour is equal on both sides, but in the <lb/>
            middle of the battle the barbarians are fleeing and pushing <lb/>
            one another into the marsh. And at the end of this paint­ <lb/>
            ing are the Phœnician ships, and the Greeks slaying the <lb/>
            barbarians who are trying to get on board. Here too is a <lb/>
            painting of the hero Marathon from whom the plain is <lb/>
            named, and Theseus in the guise of putting out to sea, and <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            Athene and Hercules : for by the people of Marathon first, <lb/>
            as they themselves allege, was Hercules considered a god. <lb/>
            And of the combatants there stand out most plainly in the <lb/>
            painting Callimachus, who was chosen by the Athenians as <lb/>
            Polemarch, and Miltiades, one of the generals, and the hero <lb/>
            who was called Echetlus, of whom I shall make mention <lb/>
            hereafter. Here also are fixed up brazen shields, and these <lb/>
            have an inscription that they are from the Scionæans and <lb/>
            their allies, and others smeared over with pitch, that neither <lb/>
            time nor rust should hurt them, are said to have belonged <lb/>
            to the Lacedemonians who were captured in the island of <lb/>
            Sphacteria.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND before the portico are brazen statues of Solon, the <lb/>
            Athenian legislator, and a little further Seleucus, to <lb/>
            whom came beforehand clear indications of his future pro­ <lb/>
            sperity. For when he started from Macedonia with Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, as he was sacrificing to Zeus at Pella, the wood laid <lb/>
            on the altar moved to the statue of the god of its own <lb/>
            accord, and burst into a blaze without fire. And on the <lb/>
            death of Alexander Seleucus, fearing the arrival of Anti­ <lb/>
            gonus at Babylon, fled to Ptolemy the son of Lagus, but <lb/>
            returned some time after to Babylon, and on his return de­ <lb/>
            feated the army of Antigonus and slew Antigonus himself, <lb/>
            and afterwards captured Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, <lb/>
            who came against him with an army. And as all these <lb/>
            things succeeded with him, and not long after the power <lb/>
            of Lysimachus collapsed, he handed over all his power in <lb/>
            Asia Minor to his son Antiochus, and himself hurried into <lb/>
            Macedonia, and took with him an army of Greeks and bar­ <lb/>
            barians. But Ptolemy the brother of Lysandra, who had <lb/>
            fled to Seleucus from Lysimachus, and who was generally <lb/>
            speaking a very bold and daring fellow and on that account <lb/>
            called Lightning, when the army of Seleucus reached <lb/>
            Lysimachia privately slew Seleucus, and, allowing the <lb/>
            other kings to take Seleucus' money, became king of Ma­ <lb/>
            cedonia, until venturing first of all the kings we know to <lb/>
            fight against the Galati, he was killed by the barbarians, <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            and Antigonus the son of Demetrius recovered the kingdom. <lb/>
            And Seleucus, I am persuaded, was an especially upright <lb/>
            king, pious and religious. I infer this partly because he re­ <lb/>
            stored to the Milesians at Branchidæ the brazen Apollo, that <lb/>
            had been carried away to Ecbatana in Persia by Xerxes: <lb/>
            and partly because, when he built Seleucia on the river Tigris <lb/>
            and introduced Babylonians to dwell there, he destroyed <lb/>
            neither the wall of Babylon nor the temple of Bel, but <lb/>
            allowed the Chaldæns to dwell in its vicinity.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            XD the Athenians have in the market-place among <lb/>
            other thing's not universally notable an altar of Mercy, <lb/>
            to whom, though most useful of all the gods to the life of <lb/>
            man and its vissitudes, the Athenians alone of all the <lb/>
            Greeks assign honours. And not only is philanthropy <lb/>
            more regarded among them, but they also exhibit more <lb/>
            piety to the gods than others. For they have also an altar­ <lb/>
            toand Rumour, and Energy. And it is clear that <lb/>
            those people who have a larger share of piety than others <lb/>
            have also a larger share of good fortune. And in the gym­ <lb/>
            nasium of the market pla which is not far off and is <lb/>
            called after Ptolemy because he established it, are Hermæ <lb/>
            in stone worth seeing, and a brazen statue of Ptolemy ; <lb/>
            and the Libyan Juba is here, and Chrysippus of Soli. <lb/>
            And near the gymnasium is a temple of Theseus, where <lb/>
            are paintings of the Athenian fighting against the Ama­ <lb/>
            zons. And this war has also been represented on the shield <lb/>
            of Athene, and on the base of Olympian Zeus. And in the <lb/>
            temple of Theseus is also painted the fight between the <lb/>
            Centaurs and Lapithæ. Theseus is represented as just <lb/>
            having slain a Centaur, but with all the rest in the picture <lb/>
            the fight seems to be on equal terms. But the painting on <lb/>
            the third wall is not clear to those who do not know the <lb/>
            story, partly as the painting has faded from age, partly <lb/>
            because Micon has not pourtrayed the whole story. When <lb/>
            Minos took Theseus and the rest of the band of boys to <lb/>
            Crete, he was enamoured of Peribcea, and when Theseus <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            was very opposed to this, he in his rage among other sar­ <lb/>
            casms that he hurled against him said that he was not the <lb/>
            son of Poseidon, for if he threw the ring which he chanced <lb/>
            to be wearing into the sea he could not get it again, Minos <lb/>
            is said at once to have thrown the ring into the sea when <lb/>
            he had said this. And they say that Theseus jumped into <lb/>
            the sea and came up with the ring and a golden crown, the <lb/>
            gift of Amphitrite. And as to the death of Theseus many <lb/>
            varying accounts have been given. For they say that he <lb/>
            was once bound by Pluto until he was liberated by Her­ <lb/>
            cules. But the most credible account I have heard is that <lb/>
            Theseus having invaded Thesprotia, intending to carry off <lb/>
            the wife of the king of the country, lost the greater part of <lb/>
            his army, and himself and Pirithous were taken prisoners, <lb/>
            (for Pirithous also came on the expedition marriage-hunt­ <lb/>
            ing), and confined by the king of Thesprotia at Cichyrus.</p>
          <p>Now among other things worth seeing in Thesprotia are <lb/>
            the temple of Zeus at Dodona, and a beech-tree sacred to <lb/>
            to the god. And near Cichyrus there is a marsh called <lb/>
            Acherusia and the river Acheron, and there too flows <lb/>
            Cocytus with most unpleasant stream. And I fancy that <lb/>
            Homer, having seen these, ventured to introduce them in his <lb/>
            account of the rivers of Hades, and to borrow his names <lb/>
            from these rivers in Thesprotia. However that may be, <lb/>
            Theseus being detained there, the sons of Tyndarus led an <lb/>
            expedition to Aphidna, and captured it, and restored Menes­ <lb/>
            theus to the kingdom. And Menestheus paid no attention <lb/>
            to the sons of Theseus, who had gone to Eubœa for shelter <lb/>
            to Elephenor ; but as to Theseus himself, thinking he would <lb/>
            be a dangerous adversary if ever he returned from Thes­ <lb/>
            protia, he coaxed the people so that if Theseus ever re­ <lb/>
            turned he would be sent back again. Accordingly Theseus <lb/>
            was sent to Crete to Deucalion, and being carried out of <lb/>
            his way by storms to the island Scyrus, the Scyrians gave <lb/>
            him a brilliant reception, both for the splendour of his race <lb/>
            and the renown of his exploits; and it was owing to this <lb/>
            that Lycomedes planned his death. And the shrine of <lb/>
            Theseus at Athens was after the time that the Persians <lb/>
            were at Marathon, for it was Miltiades' son, Cimon, that <lb/>
            drove out the inhabitants of Scyrus to revenge the hero's <lb/>
            death, and that conveyed his bones to Athens.</p><pb n="33"/>

            OW the temple of the Dioscuri is ancient; they are <lb/>
            designed standing, and their sons seated on horse­ <lb/>
            back. Here too is a painting by Polygnotus of the marriage <lb/>
            of the daughters of Leucippus, and by Micon of the Argo­ <lb/>
            nauts who sailed with Jason to Colchi: in this painting <lb/>
            Acastus and his horses stand out remarkably well. And <lb/>
            above the temple of the Dioscuri is the grove of Aglaurus, <lb/>
            to whom and to her sisters Herse and Pandrosus they say <lb/>
            Athene gave Erichthonius, after putting him in a chest <lb/>
            and forbidding them to pry into the contents. Pandrosus <lb/>
            they say obeyed, but the other two opened the chest, and <lb/>
            went mad when they saw Erichthonius, and threw themselves <lb/>
            down the Acropolis at the very steepest place. It was on that <lb/>
            very spot that the Persians landed, and slew those Athenians <lb/>
            who thought they understood the oracle better than Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles, and fortified the Acropolis with wooden palisades. <lb/>
            And next is the Prytaneum, where the laws of Solon are <lb/>
            written up, and where are images of the goddesses Peace <lb/>
            and Vesta, and among other statues one to Autolycus the <lb/>
            pancratiast; for Miltiades and Themistocles have been re­ <lb/>
            moved for a Roman and a Thracian ! As one goes thence <lb/>
            to the lower parts of the city is the temple of Serapis, whose <lb/>
            worship the Athenians introduced to please Ptolemy. Of <lb/>
            the Egyptian temples to Serapis the most famous is that <lb/>
            at Alexandria, but the oldest is that at Memphis, into which <lb/>
            strangers may not enter, nor even priests except during <lb/>
            the ritual in connection with Apis. And not far from <lb/>
            the temple of Serapis is the place where they say Pirithous <lb/>
            and Theseus agreed to go to Lacedæmon, and afterwards <lb/>
            to Thesprotia. And next is a temple erectedto Tlithyia, <lb/>
            who they say came from the Hyperborean regions to <lb/>
            assist Leto in her travail-throes, and of whom other <lb/>
            nations learnt from the people of Delos, who sacrifice to <lb/>
            her and sing at her altar the Hymn of Olen. But the <lb/>
            Cretans consider her to have been born at Amnisus in <lb/>
            Gnossian territory, and to have been the daughter of Hera. <lb/>
            And among the Athenians alone her statues are draped to <lb/>
            the bottom of her feet. Two of her statues the women <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            said were Cretan and votive offerings of Phædra, while the <lb/>
            oldest was brought by Erysichthon from Delos.</p>
          <p>And before going into the temple of Olympian Zeus— <lb/>
            which Adrian the Roman Emperor built, and in which he <lb/>
            placed that remarkable statue of Olympian Zeus (larger <lb/>
            than any works of art except the Colossusses at Rhodes <lb/>
            and Rome); it is in ivory and gold, and elegant if you <lb/>
            consider the size-are two statues of Adrian in Thasian <lb/>
            stone, and two in Egyptian stone : and brazen statues <lb/>
            in front of the pillars of what the Athenians call their <lb/>
            colonial cities. The whole circuit of the temple is about <lb/>
            four stades, and is full of statues; for from each city is a <lb/>
            statue of the Emperor Adrian, and the Athenians outdid <lb/>
            them by the very fine colossal statue of the Emperor <lb/>
            which they erected at the back of the temple. And in' the <lb/>
            temple precincts is an ancient statue of Zeus in brass <lb/>
            and a shrine of Cronos and Rhea, and a grove to Earth <lb/>
            by the title of Olympian. Here there is about a cubit's <lb/>
            subsidence of soil, and they say that after Deucalion's flood <lb/>
            the water came in and escaped there, and they knead every <lb/>
            year a cake of barley meal with honey and throw it into <lb/>
            the cavity. And there is on a pillar a statue of Isocrates, <lb/>
            who left behind him 3 notable examples, his industry <lb/>
            (for though he lived to the age of 98 he never left off <lb/>
            taking pupils), his wisdom (for all his life he kept aloof <lb/>
            from politics and public business), and his love of liberty <lb/>
            (for after the news of the battle of Chæronea he pined <lb/>
            away and died of voluntary starvation). And there are <lb/>
            some Persians in stone holding up a brazen tripod, both <lb/>
            themselves and the tripod fine works of art. And they <lb/>
            say that Deucalion built the old temple of Olympian Zeus, <lb/>
            bringing as evidence that Deucalion lived at Athens his <lb/>
            tomb not far from this very temple. Adrian erected also <lb/>
            at Athens a temple of Hera and Pan-Hellenian Zeus, and <lb/>
            a temple for all the gods in common. But the most remark­ <lb/>
            able things are 100 pillars wrought in Phrygian stone, and <lb/>
            the walls in the porticoes corresponding. And there is a room <lb/>
            here with a roof of gold and alabaster stone, adorned also <lb/>
            with statues and paintings: and books are stored up in it. <lb/>
            And there is a gymnasium called the Adrian gymnasium : <lb/>
            and here too are 100 pillars of stone from Libyan quarries.</p><pb n="35"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next to the temple of Olympian Zens is a statue <lb/>
            of Pythian Apollo, as also a temple of Delphian Apollo. <lb/>
            And they say that, when this temple was completed except <lb/>
            the roof, Theseus came to the city incognito. And having <lb/>
            a long garment down to his feet and his hair being <lb/>
            elegantly plaited, when he came near this temple, those <lb/>
            who were building the roof asked him jeeringly why a <lb/>
            maiden ripe for marriage was wandering about alone. <lb/>
            And his only answer was. it is said, unyoking the oxen <lb/>
            from the waggon which stood by, and throwing it in the <lb/>
            air higher than the roof they were building. And with <lb/>
            respect to the place that they call The Gardens, and the <lb/>
            temple of Aphrodite, there is no account given by the <lb/>
            Athenians, nor in respect to the statue of Aphrodite which <lb/>
            stands next the temple, and is square like the Hermæ, and <lb/>
            the inscription declares that Celestial Aphrodite is the oldest <lb/>
            of those that are called Fates. The statue of Aphrodite <lb/>
            in The Gardens is the work of Alcamenes, and is among <lb/>
            the few things at Athens best worth seeing. There is also <lb/>
            a temple of Hercules called Cynosarges: (i.e., of the white <lb/>
            dog) ; the history of the white do- may be learnt by those <lb/>
            who have read the oracle. And there are altars to Her­ <lb/>
            cules and Hebe, (the daughter of Zeus), who, they think, <lb/>
            was married to Hercules. There is also an altar of Alc­ <lb/>
            mene and Iolaus, who was associated with Hercules in <lb/>
            most of his Labours. And the Lyceum gets its name <lb/>
            from Lycus the son of Pandion, but is now as of old <lb/>
            considered a temple of Apollo, for Apollo was here called <lb/>
            Lyceus originally. And it is also said that the natives of <lb/>
            Termilæ, where Lycus went when he fled from Ægeus, are <lb/>
            called Lycians from the same Lycus. And behind the <lb/>
            Lyceum is the tomb of Nisus who was king of Megara <lb/>
            and slain by Minos, and the Athenians brought his corpse <lb/>
            here and buried it. About this Nisus there is a story that <lb/>
            he had purple hair, and that the oracle said he would die if <lb/>
            it was shorn off. And when the Cretans came into the <lb/>
            land, they took all the other cities of Megaris by storm, but <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            had to blockade Nisæa, into which Nisus had fled for refuge. <lb/>
            And here they say the daughter of Nisus, who was ena­ <lb/>
            moured of Minos, cut off her father's locks. This is the <lb/>
            story. Now the rivers of Attica are the Ilissus and the <lb/>
            Eridanus that flows into it, having the same name as the <lb/>
            Celtic Eridanus. The Ilissus is the river where they say <lb/>
            Orithyia was playing when carried off by the North Wind, <lb/>
            who married her, and because of his affinity with the <lb/>
            Athenians aided them and destroyed many of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians' ships. And the Athenians think the Ilissus <lb/>
            sacred to several gods, and there is an altar also on its <lb/>
            banks to the Muses. The place is also shewn where the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians slew Codrus, the son of Melanthus, the <lb/>
            king of Athens. After you cross the Ilissus is a place <lb/>
            called Agræ, and a temple of Artemis Agrotera, (The <lb/>
            Huntress), for here they say Artemis first hunted on her <lb/>
            arrival from Delos: accordingly her statue has a bow. <lb/>
            And what is hardly credible to hear, but wonderful to <lb/>
            see, is a stadium of white marble; one can easily conjec­ <lb/>
            ture its size in the following manner. Above the Ilissus is <lb/>
            a hill, and this stadium extends from the river to the <lb/>
            hill in a crescent-shaped form. It was built by Herodes <lb/>
            an Athenian, and most of the Pentelican quarry was used <lb/>
            in its construction.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW there is a way from the Prytaneum called The <lb/>
            Tripods, so called from some large temples of the gods <lb/>
            there and some-brazen tripods in them, which contain <lb/>
            many works of art especially worthy of mention. For <lb/>
            there is a Satyr on which Praxiteles is said to have prided <lb/>
            himself very much : and when Phryne once asked which <lb/>
            was the finest- of his works, they say that he offered to give <lb/>
            it her like a lover, but would not say which he thought his <lb/>
            finest work. A servant of Phryne at this moment ran up, <lb/>
            and said that most of Praxiteles' works were destroyed by <lb/>
            a sudden fire that had seized the building where they were, <lb/>
            but that they were not all burnt. Praxiteles at once rushed <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            out of doors, and said he had nothing to show for all his <lb/>
            labour, if the flames had consumed his Satyr and Cupid. <lb/>
            Phryne then bade him stay and be of good cheer, for he <lb/>
            had suffered no such loss, but it was only her artifice to <lb/>
            make him confess which were his finest works. She then <lb/>
            selected the Cupid. And in the neighbouring temple is <lb/>
            a boy Satyr handing a cup to Dionysus. And there is <lb/>
            a painting by Thymilus of Cupid standing near Dionysus. <lb/>
            But the most ancient temple of Dionysus is at--the <lb/>
            theatre. And inside the sacred precincts are two shrines <lb/>
            of Dionysus and two statues of him, one by Eleuthereus, <lb/>
            and one by Alcamenes in ivory and gold. There is a <lb/>
            painting also of Dionysus taking Hephæstus to Heaven. <lb/>
            And this is the story the Greeks tell. Hera exposed <lb/>
            Hephæstus on his birth, and he nursing up his grievance <lb/>
            against her sent her as a gift a golden seat with invisible <lb/>
            bonds, so that when she sat in it she was a prisoner, and <lb/>
            Hephæstus would not obey any of the gods, and Dionysus, <lb/>
            whose relations with Hephæstus were always good, made <lb/>
            him drunk and took him to Heaven. There are paintings <lb/>
            also of Pentheus and Lycurgus paying the penalty for <lb/>
            their insults to Dionysus, and of Ariadne asleep, The­ <lb/>
            seus putting out to sea, and Dionysus coming to carry <lb/>
            her off. And there is near the temple of Dionysus and <lb/>
            the theatre a work of-art, said to have been designed <lb/>
            in imitation of Xerxes' tent. It is a copy, for the <lb/>
            original one was burnt by Sulla the Roman general when <lb/>
            he took Athens. And this is how the war came about. <lb/>
            Mithridates was king of the barbarians in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of the Euxine Sea. Now his pretext for fighting against <lb/>
            the Romans, and how he crossed into Asia, and the <lb/>
            cities he reduced by war or won over by diplomacy, let <lb/>
            those who wish to know the whole history of Mithridates <lb/>
            concern themselves about all this : I shall merely relate the <lb/>
            circumstances attending the capture of Athens. There was <lb/>
            an Athenian called Aristion, whom Mithridates employed <lb/>
            as ambassador to the Greek States : he persuaded the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to prefer the friendship of Mithridates to that of the <lb/>
            Romans. However he persuaded only the democracy and <lb/>
            the fiercer spirits, for as to the more respectable Athenians <lb/>
            they of their own accord joined the Romans. And in the <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            battle that ensued the Romans were easily victorious, and <lb/>
            pursued Aristion and the fleeing Athenians to the city, <lb/>
            and Archelaus and the barbarians to the Pirseus. Now <lb/>
            Archelaus was the general of Mithridates, whom before this <lb/>
            the Magnesians who inhabit Sipylus wounded, as he was <lb/>
            ravaging their territory, and killed many of the barbarians. <lb/>
            So Athens was blockaded, and Taxilus another general of <lb/>
            Mithridates happened to be investing Elatea in the Phocian <lb/>
            district, but when tidings of this came to him he withdrew <lb/>
            his forces into Attica. And the Roman general learning <lb/>
            this left part of his army to continue the siege of Athens, <lb/>
            but himself went with the greater part of his force to en­ <lb/>
            counter Taxilus in Bœotia. And the third day after news <lb/>
            came to both the Roman camps, to Sulla that the walls at <lb/>
            Athens had been carried, and to the force besieging Athens <lb/>
            that Taxilus had been defeated at Chæronea. And when <lb/>
            Sulla returned to Attica, he shut up in the Ceramicus all <lb/>
            his Athenian adversaries, and ordered them to be deci­ <lb/>
            mated by lot. And Sulla's rage against the Athenians not <lb/>
            a whit relaxing, some of them secretly went to Delphi: <lb/>
            and when they enquired if it was absolutely fated that <lb/>
            Athens should be destroyed, the Pythian priestess gave <lb/>
            them an oracular response about the bladder.1 And Sulla <lb/>
            after this had the same complaint with which I learn Phere­ <lb/>
            cydes the Syrian was visited. And the conduct of Sulla <lb/>
            to most of the Athenians was more savage than one would <lb/>
            have expected from a Roman: but I do not consider this <lb/>
            the cause of his malady, but the wrath of Zeus the God <lb/>
            of Suppliants, because when Aristion fled for refuge to the <lb/>
            temple of Athene he tore him away and put him to death. <lb/>
            Athens being thus injured by the war with the Romans <lb/>
            flourished again when Adrian was Emperor.</p>

            OW the Athenians have statues in the theatre of their <lb/>
            tragic and comic dramatists, mostly mediocrities, for <lb/>
            except Menander there is no Comedian of first-rate powers, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plutarch's " Life of Theseus." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            and Euripides and Sophocles are the great lights of Tragedy. <lb/>
            And the story goes that after the death of Sophocles the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians made an incursion into Attica, and their <lb/>
            leader saw in a dream Dionysus standing by him, and bid­ <lb/>
            ding him honour the new Siren with all the honours paid <lb/>
            to the dead: and the dream seemed manifestly to refer to <lb/>
            Sophocles and his plays. And even now the Athenians are <lb/>
            wont to compare the persuasiveness of his poetry and dis­ <lb/>
            courses to a Siren's song. And the statue of Æschylus <lb/>
            was I think completed long after his death, and subse­ <lb/>
            quently to the painting which exhibits the action at Mara­ <lb/>
            thon. And Æschylus used to tell the story that when he <lb/>
            was quite a lad, he slept in a field watching the grapes, and <lb/>
            Dionysus appeared to him and bade him write tragedy : and <lb/>
            when it was day, he wished to obey the god, and found it <lb/>
            most easy work. This was his own account. And on the <lb/>
            South Wall, which looks from the Acropolis to the theatre, <lb/>
            is the golden head of Medusa the Gorgon, with her ægis. <lb/>
            And at the top of the theatre there is a crevice in the rocks <lb/>
            up to the Acropolis : and there is a tripod also here. On <lb/>
            it are pourtrayed Apollo and Artemis carrying off the sons <lb/>
            of Niobe. I myself saw this Niobe when I ascended the <lb/>
            mountain Sipylus : the rock and ravine at near view convey <lb/>
            neither the idea of a woman, nor a woman mourning, but <lb/>
            at a distance you may fancy to yourself that you see a <lb/>
            woman all tears and with dejected mien.</p>
          <p>As you go from the theatre to the Acropolis is the <lb/>
            tomb of Calus. This Calus, his sister's 'son and art-pupil, <lb/>
            Daedalus murdered and fled to Crete : and afterwards es­ <lb/>
            caped into Sicily to Cocalus. And the temple of Æscula <lb/>
            pius, in regard to the statues of the god and his sons and <lb/>
            also the paintings, is well worth seeing. And there is in it <lb/>
            a spring, in which they say Halirrhothius the son of Posei­ <lb/>
            don was drowned by Aresfor haying seduced his daughter, <lb/>
            and this was the first case of trial for murder. Here too <lb/>
            among other things is a Sarmatic coat of mail: anyone <lb/>
            looking at it will say that the Sarmatians come not a whit <lb/>
            behind the Greeks in the arts. For they have neither iron <lb/>
            that they can dig nor do they import it, for they have less <lb/>
            idea of barter than any of the barbarians in those parts. <lb/>
            This deficiency they meet by the following invention. On <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            their spears they have bone points instead of iron, and <lb/>
            bows and arrows of cornel wood, and bone points to their <lb/>
            arrows : and they throw lassoes at the enemy they meet in <lb/>
            battle, and gallop away and upset them when they are en­ <lb/>
            tangled in these lassoes. And they make their coats of mail <lb/>
            in the following manner. Everyone rears a great many <lb/>
            mares, being as they are a nomadic tribe, the land not <lb/>
            being divided into private allotments, and indeed growing <lb/>
            nothing but forest timber. These mares they use not only <lb/>
            for war, and sacrifice to the gods of the country, but also <lb/>
            for food. And after getting together a collection of hoofs <lb/>
            they clean them and cut them in two, and make of them <lb/>
            something like dragons' scales. And whoever has not seen <lb/>
            a dragon has at any rate seen a pine nut still green : anyone <lb/>
            therefore comparing the state of the hoof to the incisions <lb/>
            apparent on pine nuts would get a good idea of what I mean. <lb/>
            These they perforate, and having sewn them together with <lb/>
            ligaments of horses and oxen make them into coats of mail <lb/>
            no less handsome and strong than Greek coats of mail: for <lb/>
            indeed whether they are struck point-blank or shot at they <lb/>
            are proof. But linen coats of mail are not equally useful <lb/>
            for combatants, for they admit the keen thrust of steel, but <lb/>
            are some protection to hunters, for the teeth of lions and <lb/>
            panthers break off against them. And you may see linen <lb/>
            coats of mail hung up in other temples and in the Gryneum, <lb/>
            where is a most beautiful grove of Apollo, where the trees <lb/>
            both cultivated and wild please equally both nose and eye.</p>

            of the guilty love of Phædra, and the bold forwardness of <lb/>
            her nurse, is well known even to any barbarians who know <lb/>
            Greek. There is also a tomb of Hippolytus among the <lb/>
            Træzenians, and their legend is as follows. When Theseus <lb/>
            intended to marry Phædra, not wishing if he had children <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            by her that Hippolytus should either be their subject or <lb/>
            king, he sent him to Pittheus, to be brought up at Træzen <lb/>
            and to be king there. And some time after Pallas and his <lb/>
            sons revolted against Theseus, and he having slain them <lb/>
            went to Træzen to be purified of the murder, and there <lb/>
            Phaedra first saw Hippolytus, and became desperately <lb/>
            enamoured of him, and (being unsuccessful in her suit) <lb/>
            contrived his death. And the people of Træzen have a <lb/>
            myrtle whose leaves are perforated throughout, and they <lb/>
            say it did not grow like that originally, but was the work <lb/>
            of Phædra which she performed in her love-sickness with <lb/>
            her hairpin. And Theseus established the worship of the <lb/>
            Pandemian Aphrodite and of Persuasion, when he combined <lb/>
            the Athenians into one city from several townships. Their <lb/>
            old statues did not exist in my time : but those in my time <lb/>
            were by no mean artists. There is also a temple to Earth, <lb/>
            the Rearer of Children, and to Demeter as Chloe. The <lb/>
            meaning of these names may be learnt from the priests by <lb/>
            enquirers. To the Acropolis there is only one approach: <lb/>
            it allows of no other, being everywhere precipitous and <lb/>
            walled off. The vestibules have a roof of white marble, <lb/>
            and even now are remarkable both for their beauty and <lb/>
            size. As to the statues of the horsemen I cannot say <lb/>
            with precision, whether they are the sons of Xenophon, <lb/>
            or merely put there for decoration. On the right of the <lb/>
            vestibules is the shrine of Wingless Victory. From <lb/>
            it the sea is visible, and there Ægeus drowned himself as <lb/>
            they say. For the ship which took his sons to Crete had <lb/>
            black sails, but Theseus told his father, (for he knew there <lb/>
            was some peril in attacking the Minotaur), that he would <lb/>
            have white sails, if he should sail back a conqueror. But <lb/>
            he forgot this promise in his loss of Ariadne. And Ægeus <lb/>
            seeing the ship with white sails, thinking his son was dead, <lb/>
            threw himself in and was drowned. And the Athenians <lb/>
            have a hero-chapel to his memory. And on the left of <lb/>
            the vestibules is a building with paintings: and among <lb/>
            those that time has not destroyed are Diomede and Odys­ <lb/>
            seus, the one taking away Philoctetes' bow in Lemnos, the <lb/>
            other taking the Palladium from Ilium. Among other paint­ <lb/>
            ings here is Ægisthus being slain by Orestes, and Pylades <lb/>
            slaying the sons of Nauplius that came to AEgisthus' aid. <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            And Polyxena about to have her throat cut near the tomb <lb/>
            of Achilles. Homer did well not to mention this savage <lb/>
            act. He also appears to me to have done well, in his ac­ <lb/>
            count of the capture of Scyrus by Achilles, to have said <lb/>
            not a word about what others relate, of Achilles having <lb/>
            lived at Scyrus among the maidens, which Polygnotus <lb/>
            has painted; who has also painted Odysseus suddenly <lb/>
            making his appearance as Nausicae and her maids were <lb/>
            bathing in the river, just as Homer has described it. And <lb/>
            among other paintings is Alcibiades, and there are traces in <lb/>
            the painting of the victory of his horses at Nemea. There <lb/>
            too is Perseus sailing to Seriphus, carrying to Polydectes <lb/>
            the head of Medusa. But I am not willing to tell the story <lb/>
            of Medusa under ' Attica.' And, among other paintings, to <lb/>
            pass over the lad carrying the waterpots, and the wrestler <lb/>
            painted by Timænetus, is one of Musæus. I have read <lb/>
            verses in which it is recorded that Musæus could fly as <lb/>
            a gift of Boreas, but it seems to me that Onomacritus <lb/>
            wrote the lines, and there is nothing certainly of Musæus’ <lb/>
            composition except the Hymn to Demeter written for <lb/>
            the Lycomidæ. And at the entrance to the Acropolis is a <lb/>
            Hermes, whom they call Propylæus, and the Graces, which <lb/>
            they say were the work of Socrates the son of Sophronis­ <lb/>
            cus, whom the Pythian priestess testified to have been the <lb/>
            wisest of men, a thing which was not said to Anacharsis, <lb/>
            though he went to Delphi on purpose.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW the Greeks among other things say that they had <lb/>
            the seven wise men. And among these they include <lb/>
            the Lesbian tyrant and Periander the son of Cypselus: <lb/>
            and yet Pisistratus and his son Hippias were far more <lb/>
            humane and wise than Periander, both in war and in all <lb/>
            that appertained to citizen life, until Hippias because of <lb/>
            the death of Hipparchus acted with great cruelty, especially <lb/>
            to a woman called Leæna, (Lioness). For after the death <lb/>
            of Hipparchus, (I speak now of what has never before been <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            recorded in history, but yet is generally believed by the <lb/>
            Athenians), Hippias tortured her to death, knowing that <lb/>
            she had been Aristogiton's mistress, and thinking that <lb/>
            she could not have been ignorant of the plot against Hip­ <lb/>
            parchus. In return for this, when the Pisistratidæ had <lb/>
            been deposed from the kingdom, a brazen lioness was <lb/>
            erected by the Athenians to her memory, and near her a <lb/>
            statue of Aphrodite, which they say was a votive offering <lb/>
            of Callias, designed by Calamis.</p>
          <p>And next is a brazen statue of Diitrephes pierced with <lb/>
            arrows. This Diitrephes, among other things which the <lb/>
            Athenians record, led back the Thracian mercenaries who <lb/>
            came too late, for Demosthenes had already sailed for Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse. And when he got to the Euripus near Chalets, and <lb/>
            opposite Mycalessus in Bceotia, he landed and took Mycal­ <lb/>
            essus: and the Thracians slew not only the fighting <lb/>
            men, but also the women and children. And this proves <lb/>
            what I say, that all the cities of the Bœotians, whom the <lb/>
            Thebans had dispossessed, were inhabited in my time by <lb/>
            those who had fled at their capture. Therefore if the <lb/>
            barbarians had not landed and slain all the Mycales­ <lb/>
            sians, those that were left would afterwards have re­ <lb/>
            peopled the city. A very wonderful fact about this <lb/>
            statue of Diitrephes is that it was pierced with arrows, <lb/>
            seeing that it was not customary for any Greeks but the <lb/>
            Cretans to shoot with the bow. For we know that the <lb/>
            Opuntian Locrians were so armed as early as the Persian <lb/>
            war, for Homer described them as coming to Ilium with <lb/>
            bows and slings. But the use of bows did not long remain <lb/>
            even with the Malienses : and I think that they did not use <lb/>
            them before the days of Philoctetes, and soon afterwards <lb/>
            ceased to use them. And next to Diitrephes, (I shall not <lb/>
            mention the more obscure images), are some statues of god­ <lb/>
            desses, as Hygiea, (Health), who they say was the daughter <lb/>
            of Æsculapius, and Athene by the same name of Hygiea. <lb/>
            And there is a small stone such as a little man can sit on, <lb/>
            on which they say Silenus rested, when Dionysus came to <lb/>
            the land. Silenus is the name they give to all old Satyrs. <lb/>
            About the Satyrs I have conversed with many, wishing to <lb/>
            know all about them. And Euphemus a Carian told me <lb/>
            that sailing once on a time to Italy he was driven out <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            of his course by the winds, and earried to a distant sea, <lb/>
            where people no longer sail. And he said that here were <lb/>
            many desert islands, some inhabited by wild men : and at <lb/>
            these islands the sailors did not like to land, as they had <lb/>
            landed there before and had experience of the natives, but <lb/>
            they were obliged on that oecasion. These islands he said <lb/>
            were called by the sailors Satyr-islands, the dwellers in <lb/>
            them were red-haired, and had tails at their loins not much <lb/>
            smaller than horses. When they perceived the sailors they <lb/>
            ran down to the ship, spoke not a word, but began to handle <lb/>
            the women on board. At last the sailors in dire alarm <lb/>
            landed a barbarian woman on the island: and the Satyrs <lb/>
            treated her in such a way as we will not venture to describe.</p>
          <p>I noticed other statues in -the Acropolis, as the boy in <lb/>
            brass with a laver in his hand by Lycius the son of <lb/>
            Myron, and Perseus having slain Medusa by Myron. And <lb/>
            there is a temple of Brauronian Artemis, the statue the <lb/>
            design of Praxiteles, but the goddess gets her name from <lb/>
            Brauron. And the ancient statue is at Brauron, called <lb/>
            Tauric Artemis. And a brazen model of the Wooden <lb/>
            Horse is here, and that this construction of Epeus was a <lb/>
            design to break down the walls, every one knows who does <lb/>
            not consider the Phrygians plainly fatuous. And tradition <lb/>
            says of that Horse that it had inside it the bravest of the <lb/>
            Greeks, and this model in brass corresponds in every par­ <lb/>
            ticular, and Menestheus and Teueer are peeping out of it, <lb/>
            as well as the sons of Theseus. And of the statues next <lb/>
            the Horse, Critias executed that of Epieharinus training to <lb/>
            run in heavy armour. And CEnobius did a kindness to <lb/>
            Thueydides the son of Olorus. For he passed a decree that <lb/>
            Thucydides should be recalled from exile to Athens, and <lb/>
            as he was treacherously murdered on his return, he has <lb/>
            a tomb not far from the Melitian gates. As to Her­ <lb/>
            molyeus the Paneratiast, and Phormio the son of Asopi­ <lb/>
            ehus, as others have written about them I pass them by: <lb/>
            only I have this little bit more to say about Phormio. He <lb/>
            being one of the noblest of the Athenians, and illustrious <lb/>
            from the renown of his ancestors, was heavily in debt. <lb/>
            He went therefore to the Pæanian township, and had his <lb/>
            maintenanee there until the Athenians chose him as <lb/>
            Admiral. He however declined on the score that he <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            owed money, and that he would have no influence with <lb/>
            the sailors till he had paid it. Accordingly the Athenians <lb/>
            paid his debts, for they would have him as Admiral.</p>

          <p>H <lb/>
            ERE too is Athene pourtrayed striking Marsyas the <lb/>
            Silenus, because he would take up her flutes, when <lb/>
            the goddess wished them thrown away. Besides those which <lb/>
            I have mentioned is the legendary figEt between Theseus <lb/>
            and the Minotaur, a man or a beast according to different <lb/>
            accounts. Certainly many more wonderful monsters than <lb/>
            this have been born of woman even in our times. Here <lb/>
            too is Phrixus the son of Athamas, who was carried to <lb/>
            Colchi by the ram. He has just sacrificed the ram to some <lb/>
            god, (if one might conjecture to the god who is called <lb/>
            Laphystius among the Orchomenians), and having cut off <lb/>
            the thighs according to the Greek custom, he is looking <lb/>
            at them burning on the altar. And next, among other <lb/>
            statues, is one of Hercules throttling snakes according to <lb/>
            the tradition. And there is Athene springing out of <lb/>
            the head of Zeus. And there also is a bull, the votive <lb/>
            offering of the council of the Areopagus. Why they offered <lb/>
            it is not known, but one might make many guesses if one <lb/>
            liked. I have said before that the Athenians more than <lb/>
            any other Greeks have a zeal for religion. For they first <lb/>
            called Athene the worker, they first worshipped the muti­ <lb/>
            lated Hermæ, and in their temple along with these they <lb/>
            have a God of the Zealous. And whoever prefers modern <lb/>
            works of real art to the antique, may look at the following. <lb/>
            There is a man with a helmet on, the work of Clecetas, <lb/>
            and his nails are modelled in silver. Here is also a <lb/>
            statue of Earth supplicating to Zeus for rain, either want­ <lb/>
            ing showers for the Athenians, or a drought impending on <lb/>
            all Greece. Here too is Timotheus, the son of Conon, and <lb/>
            Conon himself. Here too are cruel Procne and her son <lb/>
            Itys, by Alcamenes. Here too is Athene represented <lb/>
            showing the olive tree, and Poseidon showing water. <lb/>
            And there is a statue by Leochares of Zeus the Guardian <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            of the city, in recording whose customary rites I do not <lb/>
            record the reasons assigned for them. They put barley on <lb/>
            the altar of this Zeus Guardian of the city, and do not <lb/>
            watch it: and the ox kept and fattened up for the sacrifice <lb/>
            eats the corn when it approaches the altar. And they call <lb/>
            one of the priests Ox-killer, and he after throwing the axe <lb/>
            at the ox runs away, for that is the usage : and (as if they <lb/>
            did not know who had done the deed) they bring the axe <lb/>
            into court as defendant. They perform the rites in the <lb/>
            way indicated.</p>
          <p>And as regards the temple which they call the Parthenon, <lb/>
            ' as you enter it everything pourtrayed on the gaBles relates <lb/>
            to the birth of Athene, and behind is depicted the contest <lb/>
            between Poseidon and Athene forthe soil of Attica. And <lb/>
            this work of art is in ivory and gold. In the middle of <lb/>
            her helmet is an image of the Sphinx-about whom I shall <lb/>
            give an account when I come to Bœotia—and on each side <lb/>
            of the helmet are griffins worked. These griffins, says <lb/>
            Aristus the Proconnesian in his poems, fought with the <lb/>
            Arimaspians beyond the Issedones for the gold of the <lb/>
            soil which the griffins guarded. And the Arimaspians <lb/>
            were all one-eyed men from their birth, and the griffins <lb/>
            were beasts like lions, with wings and mouth like an <lb/>
            eagle. Let so much suffice for these griffins. But the <lb/>
            statue of Athene is full length, with a tunic reaching to her <lb/>
            feet, and on her breast is the head of Medusa worked in <lb/>
            ivory, and in one-hand-she has a Victory four cubits high, <lb/>
            in the other hand a spear, and at her feet a shield, and near <lb/>
            the spear a dragon which perhaps is Erichthonius. And on <lb/>
            the base of the statue is a representation of the birth of <lb/>
            Pandora, the first woman according to Hesiod and other <lb/>
            poets, for before her there was no race of women. Here <lb/>
            too I remember to have seen the only statue here of the <lb/>
            Emperor Adrian, and at the entrance one of Iphicrates <lb/>
            the celebrated Athenian general.</p>
          <p>And outside the temple is a brazen Apollo said to be <lb/>
            by Phidias: and they call it Apollo Averter of Locusts, <lb/>
            because when the locusts destroyed the land the god said <lb/>
            he would drive them them out of the country. And they <lb/>
            know that he did so, but they don't say how. I myself <lb/>
            know of locusts having beeu thrice destroyed on Mount <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            Sipylus, but not in the same way, for some were driven <lb/>
            away by a violent wind that fell on them, and others by a <lb/>
            strong blight that came on them after showers, and others <lb/>
            were frozen to death by a sudden frost. All this came <lb/>
            under my own notice.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE are also in the Acropolis at Athens statues of <lb/>
            Pericles the son of Xanthippus and Xanthippus him­ <lb/>
            self, who fought against the Persians at Mycale. The <lb/>
            statue of Pericles stands by itself, but near that of <lb/>
            Xanthippus is Anacreon of Teos, the first after Lesbian <lb/>
            Sappho who wrote erotic poetry mainly: his appearance <lb/>
            is that of a man singing in liquor. And near are statues <lb/>
            by Dinomenes of Io the daughter of Inachus, and Callisto <lb/>
            the daughter of Lycaon, both of whom had precisely <lb/>
            similar fates, the love of Zeus and the hatred of Hera, <lb/>
            Io being changed into a cow, and Callisto into a she­ <lb/>
            bear. And on the southern wall Attalus has pourtrayed <lb/>
            the legendary battle of the giants, who formerly inhabited <lb/>
            Thrace and the isthmus of Pallene, and the contest be­ <lb/>
            tween the Amazons and the Athenians, and the action at <lb/>
            Marathon against the Persians, and the slaughter of the <lb/>
            Galati in Mysia, each painting two cubits in size. There <lb/>
            too is Olympiodorus, illustrious for the greatness of his <lb/>
            exploits, notably at that period when he infused spirit <lb/>
            in men who had been continually baffled, and on that <lb/>
            account had not a single hope for the future. For the dis­ <lb/>
            aster at Chæronea was a beginning of sorrows for all the <lb/>
            Greeks, and made slaves alike of those who were absent from <lb/>
            it, and of those who fought at it against the Macedonians. <lb/>
            Most of the Greek cities Philip captured, and though he <lb/>
            made a treaty with the Athenians nominally, he really hurt <lb/>
            them most, robbing them of their islands, and putting down <lb/>
            their naval supremacy. And for some time they were <lb/>
            quiet, during the reign of Philip and afterwards of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, but when Alexander was dead and the Macedonians <lb/>
            chose Aridæus as his successor, though the whole power <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            fell to Antipater, then the Athenians thought it no longer <lb/>
            endurable that Greece should be for all time under Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, but themselves took up arms and urged others to do <lb/>
            the same. And the cities of the Pcloponnesians which <lb/>
            joined them were Argos, Epidaurus, Sicyon, Trcezen, <lb/>
            Elis, Phlius, Messene, and outside the Peloponnese the <lb/>
            Locrians, the Phocians, the Thessalians, the Carystians, and <lb/>
            those Acarnanians who ranked with the Ætolians. But the <lb/>
            Boeotians who inhabited the Theban territory which had <lb/>
            been stripped of Thebans, fearing that the Athenians <lb/>
            would eject them from Thebes, not only refused to join the <lb/>
            confederate cities but did all they could to further the inte­ <lb/>
            rests of the Macedonians. Now the confederate cities were <lb/>
            led each by their own general, but the Athenian Leos­ <lb/>
            thenes was chosen generalissimo, partly from his city's re­ <lb/>
            nown, partly from his own reputation for experience in war. <lb/>
            He had besides done good service to all the Greeks. For <lb/>
            when Alexander wished to settle in Persia all of those who <lb/>
            had served for pay with Darius and the satraps, Leosthencs <lb/>
            was beforehand with him and conveyed them back to <lb/>
            Europe in his ships. And now too, after having displayed <lb/>
            more brilliant exploits than they expected, he infused dejec­ <lb/>
            tion in all men by his death, and that was the chief reason <lb/>
            of their failure. For a Macedonian garrison occupied first <lb/>
            Munychia, and afterwards the Piræus and the long walls. <lb/>
            And after the death of Antipater Olympias crossed over <lb/>
            from Epirus and ruled for some time, after putting Aridteus <lb/>
            to death, but not long after she was besieged by Cassander, <lb/>
            and betrayed by the multitude. And when Cassander was <lb/>
            king, (I shall only concern myself with Athenian matters), <lb/>
            he captured Fort Panactus in Attica and Salamis, and <lb/>
            got Demetrius the son of Phanostratus, ( who had his <lb/>
            father's repute for wisdom), appointed king over the <lb/>
            Athenians. He was however, deposed by Demetrius the <lb/>
            son of Antigonus, a young man well disposed to the Greeks : <lb/>
            but Cassander, (who had a deadly hatred against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians), won over Lachares, who had up to this time been <lb/>
            the leader of the democracy, and persuaded him to plot to <lb/>
            be king: and of all the kings we know of he was most <lb/>
            savage to men and most reckless to the gods. But <lb/>
            Demetrius the son of Antigonus, though he had not been <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            on the best of terms with the Athenian democracy, yet was <lb/>
            successful in putting down the power of Lachares. And <lb/>
            when the town was taken Lachares fled into Bceotia. But as <lb/>
            he had taken the golden shields from the Acropolis, and had <lb/>
            stripped the statue of Athene of all the ornaments that <lb/>
            were removable, he was supposed to be very rich, and was <lb/>
            killed for his money's sake by the people of Corone. And <lb/>
            Demetrius the son of Antigonus, having freed the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians from the yoke of Lachares, did not immediately after <lb/>
            the flight of Lachares give up to them the Piraeus, but <lb/>
            after being victorious in war with them put a garrison <lb/>
            in the town, and fortified what is called the Museum. <lb/>
            Now the Museum is within the old town walls, on a hill <lb/>
            opposite the Acropolis, where they say that Musæus sang, <lb/>
            and died of old age, and was buried. And on the same <lb/>
            place afterwards a tomb was erected to a Syrian. This <lb/>
            hill Demetrius fortified.</p>

          <p>s <lb/>
            OME time after a few remembered the fame of their <lb/>
            ancestors, and when they considered what a change <lb/>
            had come over the glory of Athens, they elected Olympio­ <lb/>
            dorus as their general. And he led against the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians old men and lads alike, hoping that by zeal rather <lb/>
            than strength their fortunes in war would be retrieved. <lb/>
            And when the Macedonians came out against him he con­ <lb/>
            quered them in battle, and when they fled to the Museum <lb/>
            he took it. So Athens was delivered from the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians. And of the Athenians that distinguished them­ <lb/>
            selves so as to deserve special mention, Leocritus the <lb/>
            son of Protarchus is said to have displayed most bravery <lb/>
            in action. For he was the first to scale the wall and leap <lb/>
            into the Museum : and as he fell in the fight, among other <lb/>
            honours conferred on him by the Athenians, they dedicated <lb/>
            his shield to Zeus Eleutherius, writing on it his name <lb/>
            and his valour. And this is the greatest feat of Olympio­ <lb/>
            dorus, though he also recovered the Piraeus and Munychia: <lb/>
            and when the Macedonians invaded Eleusis he collected a <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            band of Eleusinians and defeated them. And before this, <lb/>
            when Cassander intended to make a raid into Attica, he <lb/>
            sailed to AEtolia and persuaded the Ætolians to give their <lb/>
            help, and this alliance was the chief reason why they <lb/>
            escaped war with Cassander. And Olympiodorus has <lb/>
            honours at Athens in the Acropolis and Prytaneum, and a <lb/>
            painting at Eleusis. And the Phocians who dwell at Elatea <lb/>
            have erected a brazen statue to him at Delphi, because he <lb/>
            also helped them when they revolted from Cassander.</p>
          <p>And next the statue of Olympiodorus is a brazen image <lb/>
            of Artemis called Leucophryene, and it was erected to her <lb/>
            by the sons of Themistocles : for the Magnesians, over whom <lb/>
            Themistocles ruled, having received that post from the <lb/>
            king, worship Artemis Leucophryene. But I must get on <lb/>
            with my subject, as I have all Greece to deal with. En­ <lb/>
            dæus was an Athenian by race, and the pupil of Dædalus, <lb/>
            and accompanied Daedalus to Crete, when he fled there on <lb/>
            account of his murder of Calus. The statue of Athene <lb/>
            sitting is by him, with the inscription that Callias dedi­ <lb/>
            cated it and Endæus designed it.</p>
          <p>There is also a building called the Erechtheum : and in <lb/>
            the vestibule is an altar of Supreme Zeus, where they offer <lb/>
            no living sacrifice, but cakes without the usual libation of <lb/>
            wine. And as you enter there are three altars, one to <lb/>
            Poseidon, (on which they also sacrifice toErechtheus <lb/>
            according to the oracle,) one to the hero Bates, and the <lb/>
            third to Hephaestus. And on the walls are paintings of <lb/>
            the family of Butes. The building is a double one, and <lb/>
            inside there is sea water in a well. And this is no great <lb/>
            marvel, for even those who live in inland parts have such <lb/>
            wells, as notably the Aphrodisienses in Caria. But this <lb/>
            well is represented as having a roar as of the sea when the <lb/>
            South wind blows. And in the rock is the figure of a <lb/>
            trident. And this is said to have been Poseidon's proof <lb/>
            in regard to the territory Athene disputed with him.</p>
          <p>Sacred to Athene is all the rest of Athens, and similarly <lb/>
            all Attica: for although they worship different gods in <lb/>
            different townships, none the less do they honour Athene <lb/>
            generally. And the most sacred of all is the statue of <lb/>
            Athene in what is now called the Acropolis, but was then <lb/>
            c alled the Polis (city), which was universally worshipped <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            many years before the various townships formed one city: <lb/>
            and the rumour about it is that it fell from heaven. As to <lb/>
            this I shall not give an opinion, whether it was so or not. <lb/>
            And Callimachus made a golden lamp for the goddess. And <lb/>
            when they fill this lamp with oil it lasts for a whole year, <lb/>
            although it burns continually night and day. And the <lb/>
            wick is of a particular kind of cotton flax, the only kind <lb/>
            imperishable by fire. And above the lamp is a palmtree <lb/>
            of brass reaching to the roof and carrying off the smoke. <lb/>
            And Callimachus the maker of this lamp, although he' <lb/>
            comes behind the first artificers, yet was remarkable for in­ <lb/>
            genuity, and was the first who perforated stone, and got <lb/>
            the name of Art-critic, whether his own appellation or given <lb/>
            him by others.</p>

          <p>I <lb/>
            X the temple of Athene Polias is a Hermes of wood, <lb/>
            (said to be a votive offering of Cecrops,) almost hidden <lb/>
            by myrtle leaves. And of the antique votive offerings <lb/>
            worthy of record, is a folding chair the work of Dædalus, and <lb/>
            spoils taken from the Persians, as a coat of mail of Masistius, <lb/>
            who commanded the cavalry at Platæa, and a scimetar said <lb/>
            to have belonged to Mardonius. Masistius we know was <lb/>
            killed by the Athenian cavalry: but as Mardonius fought <lb/>
            against the Lacedæmonians and was killed by a Spartan, <lb/>
            they could not have got it at first hand, nor is it likely that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians would have allowed the Athenians to <lb/>
            carry off such a trophy. And about the olive they have <lb/>
            nothing else to tell but that the goddess used it as a <lb/>
            proof of her right to the country when it was contested <lb/>
            by Poseidon. And they record also that this olive was burnt <lb/>
            when the'Persians set fire to Athens, but though burnt it <lb/>
            grew the same day two cubits. And next to the temple of <lb/>
            Athene is the temple of Pandrosus; who was the only one <lb/>
            of the three sisters who didn't peep into the forbidden <lb/>
            chest. Now the things I most marvelled at are not uni­ <lb/>
            versally known. I will therefore write of them as they <lb/>
            occur to me. Two maidens live not far from the temple of <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            Athene Polias, and the Athenians call them the carriers of <lb/>
            the holy things: for a certain time they live with the god­ <lb/>
            dess, but when her festival comes they act in the following <lb/>
            way by night. Putting upon their heads what the priestess <lb/>
            of Athene gives them to carry, (neither she nor they know <lb/>
            what these things are,) these maidens descend, by a natural <lb/>
            underground passage, from an enclosure in the city sacred <lb/>
            to Aphrodite of the Gardens. In the sanctuary below they <lb/>
            deposit what they carry, and bring back something else <lb/>
            closely wrapped up. And these maidens they henceforth <lb/>
            dismiss, and other two they elect instead of them for the <lb/>
            Acropolis. And near the temple of --At he no is an old <lb/>
            woman, about a cubit in size, well-modelled, with an in­ <lb/>
            scription saying that she is the handmaid Lysimache, and <lb/>
            there are large brazen statues of two men standing apart <lb/>
            as for a fight: the one they call Erechtheus and the other <lb/>
            Eumolpus. And yet all that know Athenian Antiquities <lb/>
            are aware that it was Eumolpus' son, Immaradus, that was <lb/>
            slain by Erechtheus. And at the base are statues of <lb/>
            Tolmides' prophet, and Tolmides himself, who was the <lb/>
            Athenian Admiral, and did great damage especially <lb/>
            to the maritime region of the Peloponnesians, and burnt <lb/>
            the dockyards of the Lacedæmonians at Gythium, and took <lb/>
            Bææ in the neighbouring country, and the island of Cy­ <lb/>
            therus, and made a descent on Sicyonia, and, when the <lb/>
            Sicyonians fought against him as he was ravaging their <lb/>
            land, routed them and pursued them up to the city. And <lb/>
            afterwards when he returned to Athens, he conducted <lb/>
            colonies of the Athenians to Eubœa and Naxos, and at­ <lb/>
            tacked the Boeotians with a land force: and, having laid <lb/>
            waste most of the country, and taken Chaeronea after a, <lb/>
            siege, when he got to Haliartia was himself killed in battle <lb/>
            and his whole army defeated. Such I learnt were the <lb/>
            fortunes of Tolmides. And there are old statues of Athene: <lb/>
            they are entire but rather grimy, and too weak to bear a <lb/>
            knock, for fire passed upon them when Xerxes found the <lb/>
            city bare of fighting men, as they had all gone to man the <lb/>
            fleet. There is also a representation of a boar-hunt, (about <lb/>
            which I know nothing for certain unless it is the Caly­ <lb/>
            donian boar,) and of the fight between Cycnus and Her­ <lb/>
            cules. This Cycnus they say killed among others the <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            Thracian Lycus in a prize fight: but was himself slain by <lb/>
            Hercules near the river Peneus.</p>
          <p>Of the legends that they tell at Trœzen about Theseus <lb/>
            one is that Hercules, visiting Pittheus at Trcezen, threw <lb/>
            down during dinner his lion's skin, and that several Trce­ <lb/>
            zenian lads came into the room with Theseus, who was <lb/>
            seven years of age at most. They say that all the other <lb/>
            boys when they saw the lion's skin fled helter skelter, but <lb/>
            Theseus not being afraid kept his ground, and plucked an <lb/>
            axe from one of the servants, and began to attack it fiercely, <lb/>
            thinking the skin was a live lion. This is the first Trceze­ <lb/>
            nian legend about him. And the next is that Ægeus put <lb/>
            his boots and sword under a stone as means of identifying <lb/>
            his son, and then sailed away to Athens, and Theseus when <lb/>
            lie was eighteen lifted the stone and removed what Ægeus <lb/>
            had left there. And this legend is worked in bronze, <lb/>
            all but the stone, in. the Acropolis. They have also de­ <lb/>
            lineated another exploit of Theseus. This is the legend. <lb/>
            A bull was ravaging the Cretan territory both elsewhere <lb/>
            and by the river Tethris. In ancient times it appears <lb/>
            wild beasts were more formidable to men, as the Nemean <lb/>
            and Parnasian lions, and dragons in many parts of Greece, <lb/>
            and boars at Calydon and Erymanthus and Crommyon in <lb/>
            Corinth, of whom it was said that some sprang out of the <lb/>
            ground, and others were sacred to the gods, and others <lb/>
            sent for the punishment of human beings. And this bull <lb/>
            the Cretans say Poseidon sent into their land, because <lb/>
            Minos, who was master of the Grecian sea, held Poseidon <lb/>
            in no greater honour than any other god., And they say <lb/>
            that this bull crossed over from Crete to the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            and that one of the twelve Labours of Hercules was to <lb/>
            fetch it to Eurystheus. And when it was afterwards let <lb/>
            go on the Argive plain, it fled through the Isthmus of <lb/>
            Corinth, and into Attica to the township of Marathon, and <lb/>
            killed several people whom it met, and among them Andro­ <lb/>
            geos the son of Minos. And Minos sailed to Athens, (for he <lb/>
            could not be persuaded that the Athenians had had no <lb/>
            hand in the death of Androgeos,) and did great damage, <lb/>
            until it was covenanted to send annually seven maidens <lb/>
            and seven boys to Crete to the Minotaur, who was fabled <lb/>
            to live in the Labyrinth at Gnossus. As to the bull that <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            had got to Marathon, it is said to have been driven by <lb/>
            Theseus into the Acropolis, and sacrificed to Athene. And <lb/>
            the township of Marathon has a representation of it.</p>

          <p>W <lb/>
            HY they erected a brazen ,statue to Cylon, although <lb/>
            he plotted for the sovereignty, I cannot clearly tell. <lb/>
            But I conjecture the reason was that he was very hand­ <lb/>
            some in person and not unknown to fame, as he had won <lb/>
            the victory at Olympia in the double course, and it was his <lb/>
            good fortune to wed the daughter of Theagenes the king <lb/>
            of Megara. And besides those I have mentioned there are <lb/>
            two works of art especially famous, made out of Athenian <lb/>
            spoil, a brazen statue of Athene, the work of Phidias, made <lb/>
            out of spoil taken from the Persians who landed at Mara­ <lb/>
            thon: (the battle of the Lapithæ with the Centaurs, and <lb/>
            all the other things represented on her shield, are said to <lb/>
            have been carved by Mys, but Parrhasius is said to have <lb/>
            drawn for Mys the outline of these and of his other works.) <lb/>
            The spearpoint of this Athene, and the plume of her helmet, <lb/>
            are visible from Sunium as you sail in. And there is a <lb/>
            brazen chariot made out of spoil of the Bceotians and Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians in Eubcea. And there are two other votive offer­ <lb/>
            ings, a statue of Pericles the son of Xanthippus, and, (one <lb/>
            of the finest works of Phidias,) a statue of Athene, called <lb/>
            the Lemnian Athene because an offering from the people <lb/>
            of Lemnos. The walls of the Acropolis, (except what <lb/>
            Cimon the son of Miltiades built,) are said to have been <lb/>
            drawn out by Pelasgians who formerly lived under the <lb/>
            Acropolis. Their names were Agrolas and Hyperbius. <lb/>
            When I made enquiries who they were, all that I could <lb/>
            learn of them was that they were originally Sicilians, who <lb/>
            had emigrated to Acarnania.</p>
          <p>As you descend, not into the lower part of the city but <lb/>
            only below the Propylæa, there is a well-of water, and near <lb/>
            it a temple of Apollo in a cave. Here they think Apollo <lb/>
            had an amour with Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus. <lb/>
            And as to Pan, they say that Philippides, (who was sent <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            as a messenger to Lacedæmon when the Persians landed), <lb/>
            reported that the Lacedæmonians were deferring their <lb/>
            march: for it was their custom not to go out on a campaign <lb/>
            till the moon was at its full. But he said that he had met <lb/>
            with Pan near the Parthenian forest, and he had said that <lb/>
            he was friendly to the Athenians, and would come and help <lb/>
            them at Marathon. Pan has been honoured therefore for <lb/>
            this message. Here is also the Areopagus, so called be­ <lb/>
            cause Ares was first tried here. I have before stated how <lb/>
            and why he slew Halirrhothius. And they say that subse­ <lb/>
            quently Orestes was tried here for the murder of his <lb/>
            mother. And there is an altar of Athene Area, which <lb/>
            Orestes erected when he escaped punishment. And the <lb/>
            two white stones, on which both defendants and plaintiffs <lb/>
            stand in this court, are respectively called Rigour-of-the­ <lb/>
            law and Impudence.</p>
          <p>And not far off is the temple of the Goddesses whom the <lb/>
            Athenians call The Venerable Ones, but Hesiod in his <lb/>
            Theogony calls them the Erinnyes. And AEschylus first <lb/>
            represented them with snakes twined in their hair: but in <lb/>
            the statues here, either of these or of any other infernal <lb/>
            gods, there is nothing horrible. Here are statues of Pluto <lb/>
            and Hermes and Earth. Here all that have been acquitted <lb/>
            before the Areopagus offer their sacrifices, besides foreigners <lb/>
            and citizens occasionally. Within the precincts is also <lb/>
            the tomb of (Edipus. After many enquiries I found that <lb/>
            his bones had been brought there from Thebes : for I could <lb/>
            not credit Sophocles' account about the death of (Edipus, <lb/>
            since Homer records that Mecisteus went to Thebes after <lb/>
            the death of CEdipus and was a. competitor in the funeral <lb/>
            games held in his honour there.1</p>
          <p>The Athenians have other Courts of Law, but not so <lb/>
            famous as the Areopagus. One they call Parabystum and <lb/>
            another Trigonum, [that is Crush and Triangle,] the <lb/>
            former being in a low part of the city and crowds of liti­ <lb/>
            gants in very trumpery cases frequenting it, the other gets <lb/>
            its name from its shape. And the Courts called Froggy and <lb/>
            Scarlet preserve their names to this day from their colours. <lb/>
            But the largest Court, which has also the greatest number <lb/>
            of litigants, is called Heliæa. Murder-cases are taken in <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxiii., 677-680. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            the Court they call the Palladium, where are also tried cases <lb/>
            of manslaughter. And that Demophon was the first person <lb/>
            tried here no one disputes: but why he was tried is debated. <lb/>
            They say that Diomede, sailing home after the capture of <lb/>
            Ilium, put into Phalerum one dark night, and the Argives <lb/>
            landed as on hostile soil, not knowing in the dark that <lb/>
            it was Attica. Thereupon they say Demophon rushed <lb/>
            up, being ignorant that the men in the ships were Argives, <lb/>
            and slew several of them, and went off with the Palladium <lb/>
            which he took from them, and an Athenian not recog­ <lb/>
            nized in the melée was knocked down and trodden under­ <lb/>
            foot by Demophon's horse. For this affair Demophon had <lb/>
            to stand his trial, prosecuted some say by the relations of <lb/>
            this Athenian, others say by the Argives generally. And <lb/>
            the Delphinium is the Court for those who plead that they <lb/>
            have committed justifiable homicide, which was the plea of <lb/>
            Theseus when he was acquitted for killing Pallas and his <lb/>
            sons who rose up against him. And before the acquittal of <lb/>
            Theseus every manslayer had to flee for his life, or if he <lb/>
            stayed to suffer the same death as he had inflicted. And <lb/>
            in the Court called the Prytaneum they try iron and <lb/>
            other inanimate things. I imagine the custom originated <lb/>
            when Erechtheus was king of Athens, for then first did <lb/>
            Ox-killer kill an ox at the temple of Zeus Guardian of <lb/>
            the City : and he left the axe there and fled the country, <lb/>
            and the axe was forthwith acquitted after trial, and is <lb/>
            tried annually even nowadays. Other inanimate things <lb/>
            are said to have spontaneously committed justifiable homi­ <lb/>
            cide : the best and most famous illustration of which is <lb/>
            afforded by the scimetar of Cambyses.1 And there is at <lb/>
            the Piræus near the sea a Court called Phreattys : here fu­ <lb/>
            gitives, if (after they have once escaped) a second charge is <lb/>
            brought against them, make their defence on shipboard to <lb/>
            their hearers on land. Teucer first (the story goes) thus <lb/>
            made his defence before Telamon that he had had no hand <lb/>
            in the death of Ajax. Let this suffice for these matters, <lb/>
            that all who care may know everything about, the Athenian <lb/>
            law-courts. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herod., iii., 64. </note></p><pb n="57"/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            EAR the Areopagus is shewn the ship that is made for <lb/>
            the procession at the Panathenæa. And this per­ <lb/>
            haps has been outdone. But the ship at Delos is the finest <lb/>
            I have ever heard of, having nine banks of rowers from the <lb/>
            decks.</p>
          <p>And the Athenians in the townships, and on the roads <lb/>
            outside the city, have temples of the gods, and tombs of <lb/>
            men and heroes. And not far distant is the Academy, once <lb/>
            belonging to a private man, now a gymnasium. And as you <lb/>
            go down to it are the precincts of Artemis, and statues <lb/>
            of her as Best and Beautifullest: I suppose these titles have <lb/>
            the same reference as the lines of Sappho, another account <lb/>
            about them I know but shall pass over. And there is a <lb/>
            small temple, to which they carry every year on appointed <lb/>
            days the statue of Dionysus Eleuthereusis. So many <lb/>
            temples to the gods are there here. There are also tombs, <lb/>
            first of Thrasybulus the son of Lycus, in all respects one <lb/>
            of the most famous of the Athenians either since his day <lb/>
            or before him. Most of his exploits I shall pass by, but <lb/>
            one thing will be enough to prove my statement. Starting <lb/>
            from Thebes with only sixty men he put down the Thirty <lb/>
            Tyrants, and persuaded the Athenians who were in fac­ <lb/>
            tions to be reconciled to one another and live on friendly <lb/>
            terms. His is the first tomb, and near it are the tombs of <lb/>
            Pericles and Chabrias and Phormio. And all the Athenians <lb/>
            have monuments here that died in battle either on land or <lb/>
            sea, except those that fought at Marathon. For those have <lb/>
            tombs on the spot for their valour. But the others lie on <lb/>
            the road to the Academy, and slabs are on their tombs <lb/>
            recording the name and township of each. First come <lb/>
            those whom the Edoni unexpectedly fell upon and slew in <lb/>
            Thrace, when they had made themselves masters of all the <lb/>
            country up to Drabescus: and it is said also that hailstones <lb/>
            fell on them. And among generals are Leagrus, who <lb/>
            had the greatest amount of power committed to him, and <lb/>
            Sophanes of Decelea, who slew the Argive Eurybates, <lb/>
            (who was helping the Æginetans), the victor in five con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            tests at Nemea. And this is the third army the Athenians <lb/>
            sent out of Greece. For all the Greeks by mutual consent <lb/>
            fought against Priam and the Trojans: but the Athenians <lb/>
            alone sent an army into Sardinia with Iolaus, and again <lb/>
            to Ionia, and the third time to Thrace. And before the <lb/>
            monument is a pillar with a representation of two cavalry <lb/>
            officers fighting, whose names are Melanopus and Macar­ <lb/>
            tatus, who met their death contending against the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians and Boeotians, at the border of the Eleonian and <lb/>
            Tanagræan territory. And there is the tomb of the Thes­ <lb/>
            salian cavalry who remembered their ancient friendship to <lb/>
            Athens, when the Peloponnesians under Archidamas first <lb/>
            invaded Attica: they are near the Cretan archers. And again <lb/>
            there are tombs of the Athenians, as of Clisthenes, (-who <lb/>
            made the regulations for the tribes which are observed even <lb/>
            now,) and the cavalry who were slain on that day of danger, <lb/>
            when the Thessalians brought aid. Here too are the Cleonæi, <lb/>
            who came with the Argives into Attica: why they came I <lb/>
            shall tell when I come to Argos. Here too is the tomb of <lb/>
            the Athenians who fought with the Æginetans before the <lb/>
            Persian War. And that was I ween a just decree of the <lb/>
            people that, if the Athenians gave a public burial to the <lb/>
            slaves, their names should be written on a pillar. And this <lb/>
            proves that they behaved well to their masters in the wars. <lb/>
            And there are also monuments of other valiant men, who <lb/>
            fell fighting in various places : the most illustrious of those <lb/>
            that fought at Olynthus, and Melesander (who sailed in his <lb/>
            ships up the Mæander in Upper Caria), and those who fell <lb/>
            in the war with Cassander, and those Argives who were <lb/>
            formerly theallies of the Athenians. This alliance came <lb/>
            about (they say) in the following manner. There was an <lb/>
            earthquake at Lacedæmon, and the Helots revolted and <lb/>
            went to Ithome: and when they revolted the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians sent for aid to the Athenians and others: and they <lb/>
            despatched to them picked men under Cimon the son of <lb/>
            Miltiades. These the Lacedaemonians sent back moved by <lb/>
            suspicion. And the Athenians thought such an outrage <lb/>
            insufferable, and, on their return home again, made an <lb/>
            offensive and defensive alliance with the Argives, who had <lb/>
            always been the enemies of the Lacedæmonians. And after­ <lb/>
            wards, when a battle between the Athenians and Bœotians <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            and Lacedæmonians was on the eve of taking place at <lb/>
            Tanagra, the Argives came to the aid of the Athenians. <lb/>
            And when the Argives were having the better of it, night <lb/>
            came on and took away the certainty of victory, and the <lb/>
            next day the Lacedæmonians won the victory, the Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians having betrayed the Athenians. I ought also to men­ <lb/>
            tion Apollodorus the leader of the mercenaries, who was an <lb/>
            Athenian, but had been sent by Arsites, the satrap of <lb/>
            Phrygia-near the Hellespont, and had relieved Perinthia, <lb/>
            when Philip attacked it with an army. He is buried here, <lb/>
            with Eubulus the son of Spintharus, and other men who <lb/>
            although they deserved it did not meet with good fortune; <lb/>
            some fell conspiring against the tyrant Lachares, and others <lb/>
            counselled the seizure of the Piræus when the Macedonians <lb/>
            guarded it, but before. they could carry out their plan they <lb/>
            were informed against by their fellow-conspirators and put <lb/>
            to death. Here too are the tombs of those who fell at <lb/>
            Corinth : and it was palpably shewn here (and afterwards <lb/>
            at Leuctra) by the Deity, that those whom the Greeks call <lb/>
            brave were nothing without good fortune, since the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians who had formerly conquered the Corinthians <lb/>
            and Athenians, and moreover the Argives and Boeotians, <lb/>
            were afterwards so completely routed at Leuctra by the <lb/>
            Bceotians alone. And next to the tombs of those that fell <lb/>
            at Corinth, some elegiac lines testify that the pillar was <lb/>
            erected not only to them, but also to those that died at <lb/>
            Eubœa and Chios, as also to some whom it declares were slain <lb/>
            in the remote parts of the continent of Asia Minor, and <lb/>
            in Sicily. And all the Generals are inscribed on it except <lb/>
            Nicias, and the Platæan soldiers and citizens together. <lb/>
            Nicias was passed over for the following reason: I give <lb/>
            the same account as Philistus, who said that Demosthenes <lb/>
            made conditions of surrender for everybody but himself, <lb/>
            and when he was taken attempted suicide, whereas Xicias <lb/>
            surrendered voluntarily. And so his name was not written <lb/>
            on the pillar, as he was shewn to be a willing captive and <lb/>
            not a man fit for war. On another pillar are the names of <lb/>
            those who fought in Thrace, and at Megara, and when <lb/>
            Alcibiades persuaded the Mantinæans and Eleans to revolt <lb/>
            from the Lacedæmonians, and those who conquered the <lb/>
            Syracusans before Demosthenes came to Sicily. Those also <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            are buried here who fought the naval engagement at the <lb/>
            Hellespont, and those who fought against the Macedonians <lb/>
            at Chæronea, and those who served with Cleon at Ampbi­ <lb/>
            polis, and those who fell at Delium in the territory of the <lb/>
            Tanagræans, and those whom Leosthenes led to Thessaly, <lb/>
            and those who sailed to Cyprus with Cimon, and those, <lb/>
            thirteen only, who with Olympiodorus drove out the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian garrison. And the Athenians say that, when the <lb/>
            Romans were fighting against one of their neighbours, they <lb/>
            sent a small force to their aid, and certainly afterwards <lb/>
            there were five Attic triremes present at the seafight <lb/>
            between the Romans and Carthaginians. These also have <lb/>
            their tomb here. The exploits of Tolmides and his men, <lb/>
            and the manner of their death, I have already described: <lb/>
            but let any one to whom their memory is dear know that <lb/>
            they too lie buried on this road. They too lie here who on <lb/>
            the same day won under Cimon a glorious victory both <lb/>
            by land and sea. Here too lie Conon and Timotheus, father <lb/>
            and son, second only to Miltiades and Cimon in their brilliant <lb/>
            feats. Here too lie Zeno the soil of Mnaseas, and Chrysippus <lb/>
            of Soli, and Nicias the son of Nicomedes, (the best painter <lb/>
            of animals in his day,) and Harmodius and Aristogiton who <lb/>
            murdered Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, and the orators <lb/>
            Ephialtes, (who did his best to discredit the legislation of <lb/>
            the Areopagus,) and Lycurgus the son of Lycophron. This <lb/>
            Lycurgus put into the public treasury 6,500 talents more <lb/>
            than Pericles the son of Xanthippus got together, and fur­ <lb/>
            nished elaborate apparatus for the processions of Athene, <lb/>
            and golden Victories, and dresses for 100 maidens, and for <lb/>
            war arms and darts, and 400 triremes for naval engage­ <lb/>
            ments. And as for buildings he finished the theatre though <lb/>
            others began it, and during his term of office built docks <lb/>
            at the Piræus, and a gymnasium at the Lyceum. All his <lb/>
            silver and gold work Lachares plundered when he was in <lb/>
            power : but the buildings remain to this day.</p><pb n="61"/>

          <p>B <lb/>
            EFORE the entrance into the Academy is an altar <lb/>
            of Eros, with the inscription that Charmus was the <lb/>
            first of the Athenians to offer votive offerings to Eros. <lb/>
            And they say that the altar in the city called the altar of <lb/>
            Anteros is the offering of the resident aliens, for Meles an <lb/>
            Athenian, tired of Timagoras, a resident alien who was <lb/>
            enamoured of him, bade him go to the highest part of the <lb/>
            rock and throw himself down. And Timagoras careless of <lb/>
            his life, and wishing in all things to gratify the stripling's <lb/>
            commands, threw himself down accordingly. But Meles, <lb/>
            when he saw that Timagoras was dead, was so stricken <lb/>
            with remorse, that he threw himself down from the same <lb/>
            rock, and so perished. And in consequence it was ordained <lb/>
            that the resident aliens should worship as a god Anteros, <lb/>
            the avenger of Timagoras. And in the Academy is an <lb/>
            altar of Prometheus, and they run from it to the city with <lb/>
            lighted torches. The game is to keep the torch alight <lb/>
            as they run. And if the torch goes out there is no longer <lb/>
            victory to the first, but the second wins instead. And if <lb/>
            his is out, then the third. And so on. And if the torches <lb/>
            of all go out, then there is no one who can win the <lb/>
            game. There is also an altar of the Muses, and another of <lb/>
            Hermes, and in the interior one of Athene, and another of <lb/>
            Hercules. And there is an olive-tree, which is said to have <lb/>
            been the second that ever was. And not far from the <lb/>
            Academy is the tomb of Plato, to whom the Deity foretold <lb/>
            that he would be most excellent in Philosophy, and foretold <lb/>
            it in the following way. Socrates, the night before Plato <lb/>
            was going to be his pupil, dreamed that a swan flew into <lb/>
            his bosom. Now the swan is a bird that has a fame for <lb/>
            music, for they say that Cycnus [Swan], king of the Ligyans <lb/>
            across the Eridanus in Celtic territory, was fond of music, <lb/>
            and when he died was at Apollo's desire changed into a <lb/>
            bird. I daresay a musical man reigned over the Ligyans, <lb/>
            but I can hardly believe that a man became a bird. Here <lb/>
            too is seen the tower of Timon, who was the only person <lb/>
            who thought one can be happy in no way except by shun­ <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            ning one's kind. There is also shewn here a place called <lb/>
            Colonus, sacred to Poseidon the creator of horses, the first <lb/>
            place in Attica which they say (Edipus came to: this is <lb/>
            however different from the account of Homer, still it is the <lb/>
            account they give. There is also an altar of Poseidon God <lb/>
            of Horses and of Athene Goddess of Horses, and a hero- <lb/>
            chapel of Pirithous and Theseus and (Edipus and Adrastus. <lb/>
            But Poseidon's grove and temple were burnt by Antigonus, <lb/>
            when he invaded Attica and ravaged it with his army.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW the small townships of Attica, founded by hap­ <lb/>
            hazard, have the following records. The Alimusii <lb/>
            have a temple to Lawgiving Demeter and her daughter <lb/>
            Proserpine; and in Zoster [Belt] by the sea is an altar to <lb/>
            Athene and Apollo and Artemis and Leto. They say that <lb/>
            Leto did not give birth to her children here, but loosed her <lb/>
            belt as if she were going to, and that was why the place got <lb/>
            that name. The Prospaltii also have a temple to Proserpine <lb/>
            and Demeter, and the Anagyrasians have a temple to the <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods. And at Cephalæ Castor and Pollux <lb/>
            are held in highest honour: for they call them the Great <lb/>
            Gods.</p>
          <p>And the people of Prasiæ have a temple of Apollo : here <lb/>
            came (they say) the firstfruits of the Hyperboreans, handed <lb/>
            over by them to the Arimaspians, and by the Arimaspians <lb/>
            to the Issedones, and brought thence by the Scythians to <lb/>
            Sinope, and thence carried by the Greeks to Prasiæ, and <lb/>
            by the Athenians to Delos: these firstfruits are hidden <lb/>
            in an ear of wheat, and may be looked at by nobody. <lb/>
            At Prasiæ there is also a monument to Erysichthon, who <lb/>
            died on his passage home, as he sailed back from Delos after <lb/>
            his mission there. That Cranaus the king of the Athenians <lb/>
            was expelled by Amphictyon, though he was his kins­ <lb/>
            man, I have before narrated: and they say that when he <lb/>
            fled with his adherents to the Lamprian township he was <lb/>
            killed and buried there: and his tomb is there to this day. <lb/>
            And Ion the son of Xuthus, (for he too dwelt in Attica, <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            and commanded the Athenians in the war against the <lb/>
            Eleusinians,) has a tomb in the place called Potami.</p>
          <p>So far tradition goes. And the Phlyenses have altars to <lb/>
            Dionysus-giving Apollo and Lightgiving Artemis, and to <lb/>
            Dionysus Crowned with flowers, and to the Nymphs of the <lb/>
            River Ismenus, and to Earth whom they call the Great <lb/>
            Goddess: and another temple has altars to Fruitbearing <lb/>
            Demeter, and Zens the Protector of Property, and Tithro­ <lb/>
            nian Athene, and Proserpine the Firstborn, and to the god­ <lb/>
            desses called The Venerable Ones, (i.e. the Eumenides.) And <lb/>
            at Myrrhinus there is a statue to Colænian Artemis. And the <lb/>
            Athmonenses worship Amarynthian Artemis. And when I <lb/>
            enquired of the Interpreters and Experts as to these God­ <lb/>
            desses, I could obtain no accurate information, but I conjec­ <lb/>
            ture as follows. Amarynthus is in Eubœa, and there too <lb/>
            they worship the Amarynthian Artemis. And the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians at her feast bestow as much honour on her as the <lb/>
            Eubceans. In this way I think she got her name among <lb/>
            the Athmonenses, and Colænian Artemis at Myrrhinus from <lb/>
            Colænus. I have written already elsewhere that it is the <lb/>
            opinion of many in the townships that there were kings <lb/>
            at Athens before Cecrops. Now Colænus is the name of a <lb/>
            king who ruled at Athens before Cecrops, according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the people of Myrrhinus. And there is a town­ <lb/>
            ship atAcharnæ : the Acharnians worship among other gods <lb/>
            Apollo of the Streets and Hercules. And there is an altar <lb/>
            to Athene Hygiea: they also worship Athene by the name <lb/>
            of Horse-lover, and Dionysus by that of Songster, and Ivy- <lb/>
            God, for they say ivy grew here first.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the mountains of Attica are Pentelicus, famous <lb/>
            for its stonequarries, and Parnes, which affords good <lb/>
            hunting of wild boars and bears, and Hymettus, which is <lb/>
            the best place for bees next to the territory of the Ala­ <lb/>
            zones. For among, the Alazones the bees are so tame that <lb/>
            they live with the people, and go freely about for their food <lb/>
            anywhere, and are not confined in hives: and they make <lb/>
            honey anywhere, and it is so firm and compact that you <lb/>
            i <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            cannot separate it from the comb. And on the moun­ <lb/>
            tains of Attica also are statues of the gods. At Pentelicus <lb/>
            there is a statue of Athene, and at Hymettus one of Zeus of <lb/>
            Hymettus: there are altars also to Rainy Zeus, and Apollo <lb/>
            the Fore-seer. And at Parnes there is a brazen statue <lb/>
            of Parnesian Zeus, and an altar to Semalean Zeus. There <lb/>
            is also another altar at Parnes, and they sacrifice on it some­ <lb/>
            times to Zeus the Rainy, sometimes to Zeus the Averter of <lb/>
            Ill. There is also the small mountain called Anchesmus, <lb/>
            and on it the statue of Anchesmian Zeus.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to the description of the islands, I will <lb/>
            enter again into the history of the townships. The town­ <lb/>
            ship of Marathon is about equi-distant from Athens and <lb/>
            Carystus in Eubœa. It was this part of Attica that the <lb/>
            Persians landed at, and were defeated, and lost some of <lb/>
            their ships as they were putting out to sea in retreat. And <lb/>
            in the plain is the tomb of the Athenians, and on it are <lb/>
            pillars with the names of the dead according to their tribes. <lb/>
            And another for the Platæans of Bœotia and their slaves : <lb/>
            for this was the first engagement in which slaves fought. <lb/>
            And there is apart a monument to Miltiades the son of <lb/>
            Cimon, whose death occurred afterwards, when he failed to <lb/>
            capture Pares, and was on that account put on his trial by <lb/>
            the Athenians. Here every night one may hear horses neigh­ <lb/>
            ing and men fighting: those who come on purpose to <lb/>
            see the sight suffer for their curiosity, but if they are there <lb/>
            as spectators accidentally the wrath of the gods harms <lb/>
            them not. And the people of Marathon highly honour <lb/>
            those that fell in the battle, calling them heroes, as also <lb/>
            they pay honours to Marathon (from whom the township <lb/>
            gets its name), and Hercules, whom they say they first <lb/>
            of all the Greeks worshipped as a god. And it chanced, <lb/>
            as they say, in the battle that a man of rustic appear­ <lb/>
            ance and dress appeared, who slew many of the Persians <lb/>
            with a ploughshare, and vanished after the fight: and <lb/>
            when the Athenians made enquiry of the oracle, the god <lb/>
            gave no other answer, but bade them honour the hero <lb/>
            Echetlæus. And atrophy of white stone was erected there. <lb/>
            And the Athenians say that they buried the Persians, (it <lb/>
            being a matter of decency to bury in the ground a man's <lb/>
            corpse,) but I could find no tomb. For there was no mound <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            nor any other visible trace of burial. So they must have <lb/>
            carried them to some hole and thrown them in pell-mell. <lb/>
            And there is at Marathon a fountain called Macaria, and <lb/>
            this is the tradition abont it. When Hercules fled from <lb/>
            Eurystheus at Tiryns, he went to his friend Ceyx the king <lb/>
            of rachis. And when Hercules left mankind Eurystheus <lb/>
            asked for his children, and Ceyx sent them to Athens, plead­ <lb/>
            ing his own weakness, and suggesting that Thesens might <lb/>
            be able to protect them. And coming to Athens as suppliants, <lb/>
            they brought abont the first war between the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            and the Athenians, as Theseus would not give them up to <lb/>
            Eurystheus, though he begged hard for them. And they <lb/>
            say that an oracle told the Athenians that one of the chil­ <lb/>
            dren of Hercules mnst voluntarily die, or else they would <lb/>
            not get the victory. Hereupon Macaria, the daughter of <lb/>
            Deianira and Hercnles, sacrificed herself that the Athenians <lb/>
            might conqner in the war, and the fountain gets its name <lb/>
            from her. And there is at Marathon a lake for the most <lb/>
            part mnddy : into it the fugitive Persians fell not knowing <lb/>
            the way, and most of the slaughter happened they say here. <lb/>
            And above the lake are the mangers of the horses of Arta­ <lb/>
            phernes in stone, and among the rocks vestiges of a tent. <lb/>
            And a river flows from the lake, affording pleasant water <lb/>
            to the herds that come to the lake, bnt at its ontlet into the <lb/>
            sea it is salt and fnll of sea fish. And at a little distance <lb/>
            from the plain is a mountain of Pan, and a cave well worth <lb/>
            seeing. The entrance to it is narrow, bnt when you get <lb/>
            well in there are rooms and baths, and what is called Pan's <lb/>
            herd of goats, rocks very like goats in shape.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND not far from Marathon is Branron, where they <lb/>
            A say Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, landed <lb/>
            in her flight from the Tanri, bringing with her the statue <lb/>
            of Artemis, and, having left it here, went on to Athens <lb/>
            and afterwards to Argos. Here is indeed an ancient statue <lb/>
            of Artemis. But those who have the Tauric statue of the <lb/>
            goddess in my opinion. I shall show in another part of my <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            work. And about sixty stades from Marathon is Rhamnus, <lb/>
            as you go along the shore to Oropus. And there are build­ <lb/>
            ings near the sea for men, and a little way from the sea on <lb/>
            the cliff is a temple of Nemesis, who is the most implacable <lb/>
            of all the gods to haughty men. And it seems that those <lb/>
            Persians who landed at Marathon met with vengeance <lb/>
            from this goddess : for despising the difficulty of capturing <lb/>
            Athens, they brought Parian marble to make a trophy of, <lb/>
            as if they had already conquered. This marble Phidias made <lb/>
            into a statue of Nemesis, and on the goddess' head is a <lb/>
            crown with some figures of stags, and some small statues of <lb/>
            Victory: in one hand she has a branch of an apple tree, in <lb/>
            the other a bowl, on which some Ethiopians are carved. <lb/>
            As to these Ethiopians I could not myself conjecture <lb/>
            what they referred to, nor could I accept the account of <lb/>
            those who thought they knew, who say that they were <lb/>
            carved on the bowl because of the river Oceanus : for the <lb/>
            Ethiopians dwelt by it, and Oceanus was Nemesis' father. <lb/>
            For indeed Oceanus is not a river but a sea, the remotest <lb/>
            sea sailed on by men, and on its shore live the Spaniards and <lb/>
            Celts, and in it is the island of Britain. But the remotest <lb/>
            Ethiopians live beyond Syene by the Red Sea, and are <lb/>
            fisheaters, from which circumstance the gulf near which <lb/>
            they live is called Fish-eater. But the most upright ones1 <lb/>
            inhabit the city Meroe, and what is called the Ethiopian <lb/>
            plain: these shew the Table of the Sun, but have no sea <lb/>
            or river except the Nile. And there are other Ethiopians <lb/>
            (who live near the Mauri), that extend to the territory of <lb/>
            the Nasamones. For the Nasamones, whom Herodotus <lb/>
            calls the Atlantes, but geographers call Lixitæ, are the <lb/>
            remotest of the Libyans who live near Mount Atlas. <lb/>
            They sow nothing, and live on wild vines. And neither <lb/>
            these Ethiopians nor the Nasamones have any river. For <lb/>
            the water near Mount Atlas, though it flows in three <lb/>
            directions, makes no river, for the sand sucks it all in. <lb/>
            So the Ethiopians live by no river or ocean. And the <lb/>
            water from Mount Atlas is muddy, and at its source <lb/>
            there are crocodiles two cubits long, and when men ap­ <lb/>
            proach they dive down into the water. And many have <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps a reminiscence of Horn. II. i. 423. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            the idea that this water coming up again out of the sand <lb/>
            makes the river Nile in Egypt. Now Mount Atlas is <lb/>
            so high that its peaks are said to touch the sky, and it <lb/>
            is inaccessible from the water and trees which are every­ <lb/>
            where. The neighbourhood of the Nasamones has been <lb/>
            explored, but we know of no one who has sailed by the <lb/>
            parts near the sea. But let this account suffice. Neither <lb/>
            this statue of Nemesis nor any other of the old statues <lb/>
            of her are delineated with wings, not even the most holy <lb/>
            statues at Smyrna: but in later times . people, wishing to <lb/>
            shew this goddess as especially following upon Love, gave <lb/>
            Nemesis wings as well as Love. I shall describe what is <lb/>
            at the base of the statue, only clearing up the following <lb/>
            matter. They say Nemesis was the mother of Helen, but <lb/>
            Leda suckled her and brought her up: but her father <lb/>
            the Greeks generally think was Zeus and not Tyndareus. <lb/>
            Phidias having heard this represented on the base of the <lb/>
            statue Helen being carried by Leda to Nemesis, and Tyn­ <lb/>
            dareus and his sons, and a man called Hippeus with a <lb/>
            horse standing by. There too are Agamemnon and Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, and Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, the first husband <lb/>
            of Hermione, the daughter of Helen. Orestes was passed <lb/>
            over for the murder of his mother, though Hermione <lb/>
            remained with him all her life and bore him a son. And <lb/>
            next come Epochus, and another young man. I have <lb/>
            heard nothing else of them than that they are the brothers <lb/>
            of CEnoe, who gave her name to the township.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE land about Oropus between Attica and Tanagra, <lb/>
            which originally belonged to Boeotia, is now Athe­ <lb/>
            nian. The Athenians fought for it continually, but got <lb/>
            no firm hold of it till Philip gave it them after the <lb/>
            capture of Thebes. The city is near the sea and has <lb/>
            played no great part in history: about 12 stades from it <lb/>
            is the temple of Amphiaraus. And it is said that, when <lb/>
            Amphiaraus fled from Thebes, the earth opened and swal­ <lb/>
            lowed up him and his chariot: but it did not they say <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            happen here but at a place called Harma (Chariot), on the way <lb/>
            from Thebes to Chalets. And the Oropians first made Amphi­ <lb/>
            araus a god, and since all the Greeks have so accounted him. <lb/>
            I can mention others who were once men, who have honours <lb/>
            paid to them as gods, and cities dedicated to them, as <lb/>
            Eleus in the Chersonnese to Protesilaus, and Lebadea in <lb/>
            Bœotia to Trophonius: so Amphiaraus has a temple <lb/>
            at Oropus, and a statue in white stone. And the altar <lb/>
            has five divisions: one belongs to Hercules and Zeus and <lb/>
            Paeonian Apollo, and another is dedicated to heroes and <lb/>
            heroes' wives. And the third belongs to Vesta and Hermes <lb/>
            and Amphiaraus and the sons of Amphilochus: but Alc­ <lb/>
            mæon, owing to the murder of Eriphyle, has no honour with <lb/>
            Amphiaraus, nor with Amphilochus. And the fourth divi­ <lb/>
            sion of the altar belongs to Aphrodite and Panacea, and <lb/>
            also to Jason and Hygiea and Pæonian Athene. And the <lb/>
            fifth has been set apart for the Nymphs and Pan, and <lb/>
            the rivers Achelous and Cephisus. And Amphilochus <lb/>
            has also an altar at Athens, and at Mallus in Cilicia an <lb/>
            oracle most veracious even in my day. And the Oro­ <lb/>
            pians have a fountain near the temple, which they call <lb/>
            Amphiaraus', but they neither sacrifice at it, nor use it for <lb/>
            lustrations or washing their hands. But when any disease <lb/>
            has been cured by means of the oracle, then it is cus­ <lb/>
            tomary to throw into the fountain some gold or silver coin: <lb/>
            and here they say Amphiaraus became a god. And the <lb/>
            Gnossian Iophon, one of the interpreters of Antiquities, <lb/>
            has preserved some oracular responses of Amphiarus in <lb/>
            Hexameters, given he says to the Argives who were de­ <lb/>
            spatched to Thebes. These lines had irresistible attrac­ <lb/>
            tion for the general public. Now besides those who are <lb/>
            said of old to have been inspired by Apollo, there was <lb/>
            no oracle-giving seer, but there were people good at ex­ <lb/>
            plaining dreams, and inspecting the flights of birds and the <lb/>
            entrails of victims. Amphiaraus was I think especially <lb/>
            excellent in divination by dreams : and it is certain when <lb/>
            he became a god that he instituted divination by dreams. <lb/>
            And whoever comes to consult Amphiaraus has first (such <lb/>
            is the custom) to purify himself, that is to sacrifice to <lb/>
            the god. They sacrifice then to all the other gods whose <lb/>
            names are on the altar. And after all these preliminary <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            rites, they sacrifice a ram, and wrapping themselves up in <lb/>
            its skin go to sleep, and expect divine direction through <lb/>
            a dream.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the Athenians have various islands not far from <lb/>
            A Attica, one called after Patroclus, about which I have <lb/>
            already given an account, and another a little beyond <lb/>
            Sunium, as you sail leaving Attica on the left: here they <lb/>
            say Helen landed after the capture of Ilium, so the Island <lb/>
            is called Helena. And Salamis lies over against Eleusis <lb/>
            and extends towards Megaris. The name Salamis was they <lb/>
            say originally given to this island from Salamis the mother <lb/>
            of Asopus, and afterwards the Æginetans under Telamon <lb/>
            inhabited the island: and Philæus, the son of Enrysaces <lb/>
            and grandson of Ajax, became an Athenian and handed it <lb/>
            over to Athens. And many years afterwards the Athenians <lb/>
            expelled the people of Salamis, condemning them for hav­ <lb/>
            ing been slack of duty in the war with Cassander, and for <lb/>
            having surrendered their city to the Macedonians more <lb/>
            from choice than compulsion: and Ascetades (who had <lb/>
            been chosen as Governor of Salamis) they condemned to <lb/>
            death, and swore that for all time they would remember <lb/>
            this treason of the people of Salamis. And there are yet <lb/>
            ruins of the market, and a temple of Ajax, and his statue <lb/>
            in ebony. And divine honours are to this day paid by the <lb/>
            Athenians to Ajax and Eurysaces: the latter has also an <lb/>
            altar at Athens. And a stone is shown at Salamis not far <lb/>
            from the harbour: on which they say Telamon sate and <lb/>
            crazed at the vessel in which his sons were sailing away to <lb/>
            Aulis, to join the general expedition of the Greeks against <lb/>
            Ilium. And the natives of Salamis say that after the death <lb/>
            of Ajax a flower first appeared on their island: white and <lb/>
            red, smaller than the lily especially in its petals, with the <lb/>
            same letters on it as the hyacinth.1 And I have heard the <lb/>
            tradition of the Æolians (who afterwards inhabited Ilium) <note type="footnote"> I See Verg. Eel. 3. 106. Theocr. x. 28. And especially Ovid. <lb/>
            Metamorph. x. 210-219. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            as to the controversy about the arms of Achilles, and they <lb/>
            say that after the shipwreck of Odysseus these arms were <lb/>
            washed ashore by the sea near the tomb of Ajax. And <lb/>
            some particulars as to his great size were given me by a <lb/>
            Mysian. He told me that the sea washed his tomb which <lb/>
            was on the seashore, and made entrance to it easy, and he <lb/>
            bade me conjecture the huge size of his body by the follow­ <lb/>
            ing detail. His kneepaus, (which the doctors call mills,) <lb/>
            were the size of the quoits used by any lad practising for <lb/>
            the Pentathlum. I do not wonder at the size of those who <lb/>
            are called Cabares, who, remotest of the Celts, live in a <lb/>
            region thinly peopled from the extreme cold, for their <lb/>
            corpses are not a bit bigger than Egyptian ones. I will now <lb/>
            relate some remarkable cases of dead bodies. Among the <lb/>
            Magnesians at Lethæum one of the citizens, called Proto­ <lb/>
            phanes, was victor on the same day at Olympia in the <lb/>
            pancratium and in the wrestling: some robbers broke into <lb/>
            his tomb, thinking to find something valuable there, and <lb/>
            after them came others to see his corpse : his ribs were not <lb/>
            separated as is usual, but he was all bone from his shoulders <lb/>
            to the lowest ribs, which are called by the doctors false ribs. <lb/>
            And the Milesians have in front of their city the island Lade, <lb/>
            which breaks off into two little islands, one of which is <lb/>
            called Asterius. And they say that Asterius was buried <lb/>
            here, and that he was the son of Anax, and Anax was the <lb/>
            son of Earth: his corpse is two cubits, no less. The follow­ <lb/>
            ing circumstance also appears to me wonderful. In Upper <lb/>
            Lydia there is a small town called the Gates of Temenus. <lb/>
            Some bones were discovered here, when a piece of cliff <lb/>
            broke off in a storm, in shape like those of a man, but on <lb/>
            account of their size no one would have thought them a <lb/>
            man's. And forthwith a rumour spread among the popu­ <lb/>
            lace that it was the dead body of Geryon the son of Chrysaor, <lb/>
            and that a man's seat fashioned in stone on the hillside was <lb/>
            his seat. And they called the mountain torrent Oceanus, <lb/>
            and said that people ploughing often turned up horns of <lb/>
            oxen, for the story goes that Geryon bred most excellent <lb/>
            oxen. But when I opposed their theory, and proved to <lb/>
            them that Geryon lived at Gades, and that he has no known <lb/>
            tomb but a tree of various forms, hereupon the Lydian <lb/>
            Antiquarians told the real truth, that it was the dead body <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            of Hyllus, and that Hyllus was the son of Earth, and gave <lb/>
            his name to the river Hyllus. They said also that Hercules <lb/>
            on account of his former intercourse with Omphale called <lb/>
            his son Hyllus after the same river.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            T Salamis, to return to my subject, there is a temple <lb/>
            of Artemis, and a trophy erected for the victory <lb/>
            which Themistocles the son of Neocles won for the Greeks. <lb/>
            There is also a temple to Cychreus. For when the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were fighting the naval engagement with the Persians <lb/>
            it is said that a dragon was seen in the Athenian fleet, and <lb/>
            the oracle informed the Athenians that it was the hero <lb/>
            Cychreus. And there is an island facing Salamis called <lb/>
            Psyttalea, on which they say as many as 400 Persians <lb/>
            landed: who after the defeat of Xerxes' fleet were they <lb/>
            say slain by the Greeks who passed over into Psyttalea. <lb/>
            There is not one statue in the island which is a work of art, <lb/>
            but there are some rude images of Pan made anyhow.</p>
          <p>And as you go to Eleusis from Athens, by the way <lb/>
            which the Athenians call the Sacred Way, is the tomb of <lb/>
            Anthemocritus, to whom the Megarians acted most unscru­ <lb/>
            pulously, inasmuch as they killed him though he came as a <lb/>
            herald, to announce to them that henceforth they were not <lb/>
            to cultivate the sacred land. And for this act of theirs <lb/>
            the wrath of the two goddesses 1 still abides, since they are <lb/>
            the only Greeks that the Emperor Adrian was not able to <lb/>
            aggrandise. And next to the column of Anthemocritus is <lb/>
            the tomb of Molottus, who was chosen as General of the <lb/>
            Athenians when they crossed over into Eubcei to the aid of <lb/>
            Plutarch. And near this is a village called Scirus for the­ <lb/>
            following reason. When the people of Eleusis were at war <lb/>
            with Erechtheus, a prophet came from Dodona Scirus by <lb/>
            name, who also built at Phalerum the old temple of <lb/>
            Sciradian Athene. And as he fell in battle the Eleusinians <lb/>
            buried him near a mountain torrent, and both the village <lb/>
            and torrent get their name from the hero. And near <note type="footnote"> 1 Demeter and Proserpine. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            is the tomb of Cephisodorus, who was the leader of the <lb/>
            people, and especially opposed Philip the son of Demetrius, <lb/>
            the king of the Macedonians. And Cephisodorus got as <lb/>
            allies for the Athenians the Mysian king Attains, and the <lb/>
            Egyptian king Ptolemy, and independent nations as the <lb/>
            Ætolians, and islanders as the Rhodians and Cretans. And <lb/>
            as the succours from Egypt and Mysia and Crete came for <lb/>
            the most part too late, and as the Rhodians (fighting by sea <lb/>
            only) could do little harm to heavy-armed soldiers like the <lb/>
            Macedonians, Cephisodorus sailed for Italy with some of <lb/>
            the Athenians, and begged the Romans to aid them. And <lb/>
            they sent them a force and a general, who so reduced Philip <lb/>
            and the Macedonians that eventually Perseus, the son of <lb/>
            Philip, lost his kingdom, and was carried to Italy as a <lb/>
            captive. This Philip was the son of Demetrius : who was <lb/>
            the first of the family who was king of Macedonia, after <lb/>
            slaying Alexander the son of Cassander, as I have before <lb/>
            related.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next to the tomb of Cephisodorus are buried Helio­ <lb/>
            dorus the Aliensian, (you may see a painting of him <lb/>
            in the large temple of Athene) : and Themistocles the son <lb/>
            of Poliarchus, the great grandson of the Themistocles that <lb/>
            fought the great seafight against Xerxes and the Medes. <lb/>
            All his other descendants except Acestius I shall pass by. <lb/>
            But she the daughter of Xenocles, the son of Sophocles, <lb/>
            the son of Leo, had the good fortune to have all her ances­ <lb/>
            tors torchbearers even up to her great grandfather Leo, and <lb/>
            in her life she saw first her brother Sophocles a torchbearer, <lb/>
            and after him her husband Themistocles, and after his death <lb/>
            her son Theophrastus. Such was the good fortune she is <lb/>
            said to have had.</p>
          <p>And as you go a little further is the grove of the hero <lb/>
            Lacius, who gives his name to a township. There too is <lb/>
            the tomb of Nicocles of Tarentum, who won the greatest <lb/>
            fame of all harpers. There is also an altar to Zephyrus, <lb/>
            and a temple of Demeter and Proserpine: Athene and <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            Poseidon have joint honours with them. Here they say <lb/>
            Phytalus received Demeter into his house, and the goddess <lb/>
            gave him in return a figtree. My account is confirmed by <lb/>
            the inscription on Phytalus' tomb. <lb/>
            " Here Phytalus king-hero once received <lb/>
            Holy Demeter, when she first vouchsafed <lb/>
            The fruit that mortals call the fig : since when <lb/>
            The race of Phytalus has deathless fame."</p>
          <p>And before crossing over the river Cephisus, is the tomb <lb/>
            of Theodorus, one of the best tragic actors of his day. And <lb/>
            there are two statues near the river, Mnesimaches, and his <lb/>
            son cutting off his hair as a votive offering to the Cephisus. <lb/>
            That it was an ancient custom for all the Greeks to cut off <lb/>
            locks of their hair to rivers one would infer from the verses <lb/>
            of Homer, who describes Peleus as vowing to cut off his <lb/>
            hair to the river Spercheus if his son Achilles returned <lb/>
            safe from Troy.1</p>
          <p>On the other side of the Cephisus is an ancient altar <lb/>
            to Milichian (i.e. mild) Zeus, where Theseus got purified <lb/>
            after slaying the progeny of Phytalus. He had slain other <lb/>
            robbers, and Sinis, who was his relation by Pittheus his <lb/>
            maternal grandfather. And there are the tombs here of <lb/>
            Theodectes the son of Phaselites, and of Mnesitheus. This <lb/>
            last they say was a noted doctor, and dedicated several <lb/>
            statues, and among them one of Iacchus. And by the <lb/>
            roadside is a small temple called the temple of Cyamites <lb/>
            (Bean-man): but I have no certain information, whether <lb/>
            he first sowed beans, or whether they gave the name to <lb/>
            some hero, because it was not lawful to ascribe the invention <lb/>
            of beans to Demeter. And whoever has seen the Eleusinian <lb/>
            mysteries, or has read the Orphic poems, knows what I mean. <lb/>
            And of the tombs that are finest for size and beauty are <lb/>
            two especially, one of a Rhodian who had migrated to <lb/>
            Athens, the other of Pythionice, made by Harpalus a Mace­ <lb/>
            donian, who had fled from Alexander and sailed to Europe <lb/>
            from Asia, and coming to Athens was arrested by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, but escaped by bribing the friends of Alexander and <lb/>
            others, and before this had married Pythionice, whose extrac­ <lb/>
            tion I don't know, but she was a courtesan both at Athens <lb/>
            and Corinth. He was so enamoured of her that, when she <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad xxiii. 144-148. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            died, he raised this monument to her, the finest of all the <lb/>
            ancient works of art in Greece.</p>
          <p>And there is a temple in which are statues of Demeter <lb/>
            and Proserpine and Athene and Apollo : but originally the <lb/>
            temple was built to Apollo alone. For they say that <lb/>
            Cephalus the son of Deioneus went with Amphitryon to the <lb/>
            Teleboæ, and was the first dweller in the island which is <lb/>
            now called from him Cephallenia: and that he fled from <lb/>
            Athens, and lived for some time at Thebes, because he had <lb/>
            murdered his wife Procris. And in the tenth generation <lb/>
            afterwards Chalcinus and Dætus his descendants sailed to <lb/>
            Delphi, and begged of the god permission to return to <lb/>
            Athens: and he ordered them first to sacrifice to Apollo <lb/>
            on the spot where they should see a trireme on land moving. <lb/>
            And when they got to the mountain called Pœcilus a dragon <lb/>
            appeared eagerly running into its.hole : and here they sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to Apollo, and afterwards on their arrival at Athens <lb/>
            the Athenians made them citizens. Next to this is a temple <lb/>
            of Aphrodite, and before it a handsome wall of white stone.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW the channels called Rheti are like rivers only in <lb/>
            their flow, for their water is sea water. And one <lb/>
            might suppose that they flow from the Euripus near Chalcis <lb/>
            underground, falling into a sea with a lower level. These <lb/>
            Rheti are said to be sacred to Proserpine and Demeter, and <lb/>
            their priests only may catch the fish in them. And they <lb/>
            were, as I hear, in old times the boundaries between the <lb/>
            territory of the Eleusinians and Athenians. And the first <lb/>
            inhabitant on the other side of the Rheti was Crocon, <lb/>
            and that district is called to this day the kingdom of <lb/>
            Crocon. This Crocon the Athenians say married Sæsara <lb/>
            the daughter of Celeus. This at least is the tradition of the <lb/>
            occupants of the township of Scambonidæ. Crocon's tomb <lb/>
            indeed I could not find, but Eumolpus' tomb the Athenians <lb/>
            and Eubœans both show. This Eumolpus they say came <lb/>
            from Thrace, and was the son of Poseidon and Chione: <lb/>
            and Chione was they say the daughter of Boreas and <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            Orithyia. Homer has not indeed given us his pedigree, <lb/>
            but he calls him in his poem a noble man. And in the <lb/>
            battle between the people of Eleusis and the Athenians <lb/>
            Erechtheus the king of Athens was slain, and also Imma­ <lb/>
            radus the son of Eumolpus: and peace was concluded on <lb/>
            these conditions, that the people of Eleusis should be in <lb/>
            all other respects Athenians, but should have the private <lb/>
            management of their Mysteries. And the rites of the two <lb/>
            goddesses, Demeter and Proserpine, were performed by the <lb/>
            daughters of Celeus. Pamphus and Homer alike call them <lb/>
            by the names Diogenea, and Pammerope, and Sæsara. But <lb/>
            on the death of Eumolpus Ceryx the youngest son was the <lb/>
            only one left, who (the heralds say) was not the son of <lb/>
            Eumolpus at all, but the son of Hermes by Aglaurus the <lb/>
            daughter of Cecrops.</p>
          <p>There is also a hero-chapel to Hippothoon, from whom a <lb/>
            tribe gets its name, and near it one to Zarex, who is said to <lb/>
            have learnt music of Apollo. But my own idea is that <lb/>
            Zarex was a stranger, a Lacedaemonian who had come into <lb/>
            Attica, and that the city Zarex in Laconia by the sea was <lb/>
            called after him. But if the hero Zarex was a native of <lb/>
            Attica, I know nothing about him. And the river Cephisus <lb/>
            flows near the Eleusinian territory with greater speed than <lb/>
            before: and here is a place called Erineus, where Pluto <lb/>
            they say descended, when he carried off Proserpine. On the <lb/>
            banks of this river Theseus slew the robber Polypemon, <lb/>
            who was surnamed Procrustes. And the Eleusinians have <lb/>
            a temple to Triptolemus, and to Propylæan Artemis, and <lb/>
            to Father Poseidon, and a well called Callichorus, where <lb/>
            the Eleusinian women first danced and sang songs to <lb/>
            the goddess. And the Rharian plain was the first sown <lb/>
            and the first that produced crops according to tradition, <lb/>
            and this is the reason why it is the custom to use barley <lb/>
            from it to make cakes for the sacrifices. Here is shown <lb/>
            Triptolemus' threshing-floor and altar. But what is inside <lb/>
            the sacred wall I am forbidden by a dream to divulge, for <lb/>
            those who are uninitiated, as they are forbidden sight of <lb/>
            them, so also clearly may not hear of the mysteries. And <lb/>
            the hero Eleusis, from whom the city gets its name, was <lb/>
            according to some the son of Hermes and Daira the daugh­ <lb/>
            ter of Oceanus, others make him the son of Ogygus. For <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            the ancients, when they had no data for their pedigrees, <lb/>
            invented fictitious ones, and especially in the pedigrees of <lb/>
            heroes.</p>
          <p>And as you turn from Eleusis to Bceotia the boundary <lb/>
            of Attica is the Platæan district. That was the old boun­ <lb/>
            dary between the Athenians and the people of Eleutheræ. <lb/>
            But when the people of Eleutheræ became Athenians then <lb/>
            Mount Cithæron in Bceotia became the boundary. And <lb/>
            the people of Eleutheræ became Athenians not by com­ <lb/>
            pulsion, but from hatred to the Thebans and a liking <lb/>
            for the Athenian form of government. In this plain too is <lb/>
            a temple of Dionysus, and a statue of the god was removed <lb/>
            thence to Athens long ago: the one at Eleutheræ now is <lb/>
            an imitation of it. And at some distance is a small grotto, <lb/>
            and near it a spring of cold water. And it is said that <lb/>
            Antiope gave birth to twins and left them in this grotto, <lb/>
            and a shepherd finding them near the spring gave them <lb/>
            their first bath in it, having stript them of their swaddling <lb/>
            clothes. And there was still in my day remains of a wall <lb/>
            and buildings at Eleutheræ. This makes it clear that it <lb/>
            was a town built a little above the plain towards Mount <lb/>
            Cithæron.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND another road leads from Eleusis to Megara: as you <lb/>
            - go along this road is a well called the Well of Flowers. <lb/>
            Pamphus records that it was at this well that Demeter sat <lb/>
            in the guise of an old woman after the rape of Proserpine: <lb/>
            and that she was taken thence as an old woman of the <lb/>
            country by the daughters of Celeus to their mother, and <lb/>
            that Metanira entrusted her with the education of her son. <lb/>
            And not far from the well is the temple of Metanira, <lb/>
            and next to it the tombs of those that fell at Thebes. For <lb/>
            Creon, who was at that time the ruler at Thebes (being <lb/>
            Regent for Laodamas the son of Etcocles), would not allow <lb/>
            their relations to bury the dead: and Adrastus having sup­ <lb/>
            plicated Theseus, and a battle having been fought between <lb/>
            the Athenians and Boeotians, when Theseus was the victor, <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            he conveyed the dead bodies to Eleusis and there buried <lb/>
            them. But the Thebans say that they surrendered the <lb/>
            dead bodies of their own free will, and did not fight on this <lb/>
            question. And next to the tombs of the Argives is the <lb/>
            monument of Alope, who they say was the mother of Hip­ <lb/>
            pothoon by Poseidon, and was in consequence put to death <lb/>
            by her father Cercyon. Now this Cercyon is said in other <lb/>
            respects to have been harsh to strangers, and especially to <lb/>
            those who would not contend with him in wrestling: and <lb/>
            this place was called even in my day Cercyon's wrestling <lb/>
            ground, at a little distance from the tomb of Alope. And <lb/>
            Cercyon is said to have killed all that wrestled with him <lb/>
            but Theseus. But Theseus wrestled against him cunningly <lb/>
            throw for throw and beat him: for he was the first who <lb/>
            elevated wrestling into a science, and afterwards established <lb/>
            training schools for wrestling: for before the time of Theseus <lb/>
            only size and strength were made use of in wrestling.</p>
          <p>Such in my opinion are the most noteworthy among <lb/>
            Athenian traditions or sights. And in my account I have <lb/>
            selected out of a mass of material that only which was im­ <lb/>
            portant enough to be considered history.</p>
          <p>Next to Eleusis is the district called Megaris: it too be­ <lb/>
            longed originally to the Athenians, having been bequeathed <lb/>
            to Pandion by (its) king Pylas. Proofs of what I assert <lb/>
            are the tomb of Pandion in that district, and the fact that <lb/>
            Nisus, though he conceded the kingdom of Attica to Ægeus <lb/>
            the head of the family, yet himself was selected te be king <lb/>
            of Megara and the whole district up to Corinth: and even <lb/>
            now the Megarians have a dock-yard called Nisæa after <lb/>
            him. And afterwards, when Codrus was king, the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians marched against Athens: and not having any <lb/>
            brilliant success there they went home again, but took <lb/>
            Megara from the Athenians, and gave it to the Corinthians <lb/>
            and others of their allies that wished to dwell in it. Thus <lb/>
            the Megarians changed their customs and dialect and <lb/>
            became Dorians. And they say the city got its name in <lb/>
            the days of Car, the son of Phoroneus, who was king in this <lb/>
            district: in his day they say first temples were built to <lb/>
            Demeter among them, and the inhabitants called them <lb/>
            Halls.1 This is at any rate the tradition of the Megarians. <note type="footnote"> ' The Greek is Megara. Hence the paronomasia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            But the Boeotians say that Megareus the son of Poseidon <lb/>
            lived at Onchestus, and went with an army of Bœotians to <lb/>
            aid Nisus in his war against Minos, and that he fell in the <lb/>
            battle, and got buried there, and the city which had been <lb/>
            formerly called Nisa, got its name Megara from him. <lb/>
            And years afterwards, in the 12th generation from Car, the <lb/>
            son of Phoroneus, the Megarians say Lelex came from <lb/>
            Egypt and became king, and during his reign the Mega­ <lb/>
            rians were called Leleges. And he had a son Cleson, and a <lb/>
            grandson Pylas, and a greatgrandson Sciron, who married <lb/>
            the daughter of Pandion, and afterwards, (Sciron having a <lb/>
            controversy with Nisus the son of Pandion about the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty), Æacus was arbitrator, and gave his decision that <lb/>
            the kingdom was to belong to Nisus and his descendants, <lb/>
            but the command of the army was to devolve upon Sciron. <lb/>
            And Megareus the son of Poseidon, having married Iphinoe <lb/>
            the daughter of Nisus, succeeded Nisus they say in the <lb/>
            kingdom. But of the Cretan war, and the capture of <lb/>
            the city in the days of King Nisus, they pretend to know <lb/>
            nothing.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE is in the city a conduit erected by Theagenes, <lb/>
            of whom I mentioned before that he married his <lb/>
            daughter to Cylon an Athenian. This Theagenes when he <lb/>
            was king erected this conduit, well worth seeing for its size <lb/>
            and beauty and the number of its pillars. And the water <lb/>
            that flows into is called after the Sithnidian Nymphs, who, <lb/>
            according to the Megarian tradition, are natives, and one <lb/>
            of them bare a son to Zeus, whose name was Megarus, and <lb/>
            who escaped Deucalion's flood by getting to the top of Mount <lb/>
            Geraneia (Cranemountain), which was not the original name <lb/>
            of the mountain, but was so called because he followed in <lb/>
            his swimming the flight of some cranes by their cry. And <lb/>
            not far from this conduit is an ancient temple, and there <lb/>
            are some statues in it of Roman Emperors, and an image of <lb/>
            Artemis in brass by the name of Saviour. The story goes <lb/>
            that some men in the army of Mardonius who had overrun <lb/>
            Megaris wished to return to Thebes to join Mardonius, but <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            by the contrivance of Artemis wandered about all night, <lb/>
            and lost their way, and got into the mountainous part <lb/>
            of the country, and, endeavouring to ascertain if the <lb/>
            enemy Is army was about, shot some arrows, and the rock <lb/>
            shot at returned a groan, and they shot again and again <lb/>
            furiously. And at last their arrows were expended in <lb/>
            shooting at their supposed foes. And when day dawned, <lb/>
            and the Megarians really did attack them, (well armed <lb/>
            against men badly armed and now minus ammunition), they <lb/>
            slew most of them. And this is why they put up an image <lb/>
            to Artemis the Saviour. Here too are images of the so- <lb/>
            called 12 gods, the production of Praxiteles. He also <lb/>
            made an Artemis of the Strongylii. And next, as you enter <lb/>
            the sacred enclosure of Zeus called the Olympieum, there <lb/>
            is a temple well worth seeing: the statue of Zeus is not <lb/>
            finished in consequence of the war between the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians and the Athenians, in which the Athenians every <lb/>
            year by land and by sea injured the Megarians both pub­ <lb/>
            licly and privately, ravaging their territory, and bringing <lb/>
            them individually to the greatest poverty. And the head <lb/>
            of this statue of Zeus is of ivory and gold, but the other <lb/>
            parts are of clay and earthenware: and they say it was <lb/>
            made by Theocosmus a native, assisted by Phidias. And <lb/>
            above the head of Zeus are the Seasons and the Fates: <lb/>
            it is plain to all that Fate is his servant, and that he orders <lb/>
            the Seasons as is meet. In the back part of the temple <lb/>
            there are some wooden figures only half finished: Theo­ <lb/>
            cosmus intended to finish them when he had adorned the <lb/>
            statue of Zeus with ivory and gold. And in the temple <lb/>
            there is the brazen ram of a trireme, which was they say <lb/>
            taken at Salamis, in the sea fight against the Athenians. <lb/>
            The Athenians do not deny that there was for some time <lb/>
            a defection on the part of Salamis to the Megarians, <lb/>
            but Solon they say by his elegiac verses stirred the <lb/>
            Athenians up, and they fought for it, and eventually re­ <lb/>
            took it. But the Megarians say that some of their exiles, <lb/>
            called Doryclei, mixed themselves among the inhabitants <lb/>
            and betrayed Salamis to the Athenians. And next to the <lb/>
            enclosure of Zeus, as you ascend the Acropolis still called <lb/>
            the Carian from Car the son of Phoroneus, is the temple <lb/>
            of Nyctelian Dionysus, and the temple of Aphrodite the <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            Procuress, and the Oracle of Night, and a roofless temple <lb/>
            of dusty Zeus. And statues of Æsculapius and Hygiea, <lb/>
            both the work of Bryaxis. Here too is the sacred Hall of <lb/>
            Demeter : which they say was erected by Car when he was <lb/>
            king.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XLI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            S you descend from the Acropolis in a Northerly direc­ <lb/>
            tion, you come to the sepulchre of Alcmene near the <lb/>
            Olympieum. She died they say at Megara on her journey <lb/>
            from Argos to Thebes, and the sons of Hercules had a <lb/>
            dispute, some wishing to take her dead body to Argos, <lb/>
            others to Thebes : for the sons of Hercules by Megara were <lb/>
            buried at Thebes, as also Amphitryon's sons. But Apollo at <lb/>
            Delphi gave the oracular response that it would be better <lb/>
            for them to bury Alcmena at Megara. From this place <lb/>
            the interpreter of national Antiquities took me to a place <lb/>
            called Rhun (Flow), so called because some water flowed <lb/>
            here from the hills above the city, but Theagenes when he <lb/>
            was king diverted the water into another direction, and <lb/>
            erected here an altar to Achelous. And at no great distance <lb/>
            is the monument of Hyllus the son of Hercules, who <lb/>
            fought in single combat with the Arcadian Echemus, the <lb/>
            son of Aeropus. Who this Echemus was that slew Hyllus I <lb/>
            shall shew in another place, but Hyllus is buried at Megara. <lb/>
            The expedition to the Peloponnese, when Orestes was king, <lb/>
            might rightly be called an expedition of the sons of Hercules. <lb/>
            And not far from the monument of Hyllus is the temple of <lb/>
            Isis, and near it the temple of Apollo and Artemis. This <lb/>
            last they say was built by Alcathous, after he had slain the <lb/>
            lion that was called the lion of Mount Cithæron. This lion <lb/>
            had they say devoured several Megarians and among them <lb/>
            the king's son Euippus : whose elder brother Timalcus had <lb/>
            been killed by Theseus still earlier, when he went with <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux to the siege of Aphidna. Megareus <lb/>
            therefore promised his daughter in marriage, and the suc­ <lb/>
            cession to the kingdom, to whoever should kill the lion of <lb/>
            Mount Cithæron. So Alcathous (the son of Pelops) attacked <lb/>
            the beast and slew him, and, when he became king built <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            this temple, dedicating it to Huntress Artemis and Hunter <lb/>
            Apollo. This at any rate is the local tradition. But though <lb/>
            I don't want to contradict the Megarians, I cannot find myself <lb/>
            in agreement with them entirely, for though I quite admit <lb/>
            that the lion of Mount Cithæron was killed by Alcathous, <lb/>
            yet who ever recorded that Timalcus the son of Megareus <lb/>
            went to Aphidna with Castor and Pollux ? And how (if he <lb/>
            had gone there) could he have been thought to have been <lb/>
            killed by Theseus, seeing that Alcman in his,Ode to Castor <lb/>
            and Pollux, recording how they took Athens, and carried <lb/>
            away captive the mother of Theseus, yet says that Theseus <lb/>
            was away ? Pindar also gives a very similar account, and <lb/>
            says that Theseus wished to be connected by marriage with <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux, till he went away to help Pirithous <lb/>
            in his ambitious attempt to wed Proserpine. But whoever <lb/>
            drew up the genealogy plainly knew the simplicity of the <lb/>
            Megarians, since Theseus was the descendant of Pelops. But <lb/>
            indeed the Megarians purposely hide the real state of things, <lb/>
            not wishing to own that their city was captured when Nisus <lb/>
            was king, and that Megareus who succeeded to the kingdom <lb/>
            was the son in law of Nisus, and that Alcathous was the <lb/>
            son in law of Megareus. But it is certain that it was not <lb/>
            till after the death of Nisus, and a revolution at Megara, <lb/>
            that Alcathous came there from Elis. And this is my <lb/>
            proof. He built up the wall anew, when the whole of the <lb/>
            old wall had been demolished by the Cretans. Let this <lb/>
            suffice for Alcathous and the lion, whether he slew the lion <lb/>
            on Mount Cithæron or somewhere else, before he erected the <lb/>
            temple to Huntress Artemis and Hunter Apollo.</p>
          <p>As you descend from this temple is the hero-chapel of <lb/>
            Pandion, who, as I have already shewn, was buried at what <lb/>
            is called the rock of Athene the Diver. He has also divine <lb/>
            honours paid to him at Megara. And near the hero- <lb/>
            chapel of Pandion is the monument of Hippolyta. This <lb/>
            is the Megarian tradition about her. When the Amazons, <lb/>
            on account of Antiope, made an expedition against the <lb/>
            Athenians, they were beaten by Theseus, and most of them <lb/>
            (it so happened) fell in battle, but Hippolyta (the sister <lb/>
            of Antiope), who was at that time leader of the Amazons, <lb/>
            fled to Megara with the remnant of them, and there, having <lb/>
            been unsuccessful with her army, and dejected at the pre- <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            sent state of things, and still more despondent about get­ <lb/>
            ting safe home again to Themiscyra, died of grief and was <lb/>
            buried. And the device on her tomb is an Amazon's shield. <lb/>
            And not far distant is the tomb of Tereus, who married <lb/>
            Procne the daughter of Pandion. Tereus was king (ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the Megarian tradition) of Pagæ in Megaris, <lb/>
            but in my opinion (and there are still extant proofs of what <lb/>
            I state) he was king of Daulis N.W. of Chseronea : for <lb/>
            most of what is now called Hellas was inhabited in old <lb/>
            time by barbarians. And his subjects would no longer obey <lb/>
            Tereus after his vile conduct to Philomela, and after the <lb/>
            murder of Itys by Procne and Philomela. And he com­ <lb/>
            mitted suicide at Megara, and they forthwith piled up a <lb/>
            tomb for him, and offer sacrifices to him annually, using <lb/>
            pebbles in the sacrifice instead of barley. And they say the <lb/>
            hoopoe was first seen here. And Procne and Philomela <lb/>
            went to Athens, and lamenting what they had suffered and <lb/>
            done melted away in tears : and the tradition that they <lb/>
            were changed into a nightingale and swallow is, I fancy, <lb/>
            simply that these birds have a sorrowful and melancholy <lb/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE is also another citadel at Megara that gets its <lb/>
            name from Alcathous. As one goes up to it, there is on <lb/>
            the right hand a monument of Megareu's, who started from <lb/>
            Onchestus to aid the Megarians in the Cretan War. There <lb/>
            is also shown an altar of the gods called Prodromi: and <lb/>
            they say that Alcathous first sacrificed to them when he <lb/>
            was commencing to build his wall. And near this altar <lb/>
            is a stone, on which they say Apollo put his harp down, <lb/>
            while he assisted Alcathous in building the wall. And the <lb/>
            following fact proves that the Megarians were numbered <lb/>
            among the Athenians: Periboea the daughter of Alcathous <lb/>
            was certainly sent by him to Crete with Theseus in <lb/>
            connection with the tribute. And Apollo, as the Megarians <lb/>
            say, assisted him in building the wall, and laid his harp <lb/>
            down on the stone: and if one chances to hit it with a <lb/>
            pebble, it sounds like a harp being played. This inspired <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            great wonder in me, but not so much as the Colossus in <lb/>
            Egypt. At Thebes in Egypt, when you cross the Nile, at a <lb/>
            place called the Pipes (Syringes), there is a seated statue <lb/>
            that has a musical sound, most people call it Memnon : for <lb/>
            he they say went from Ethiopia to Egypt and even to Susa. <lb/>
            But the Thebans say it was a statue not of Memnon, but <lb/>
            Phamenophes a Theban, and I have heard people say-it <lb/>
            was Sesostris. This statue Cambyses cut in two: and now <lb/>
            the head to the middle of the body lies on the ground, but <lb/>
            the lower part remains in a sitting posture, and every morn­ <lb/>
            ing at sunrise resounds with melody, and the sound it most <lb/>
            resembles is that of a harp or lyre with a chord broken.</p>
          <p>And the Megarians have a council chamber, which was <lb/>
            once as they say the tomb of Timalcus, who, as I said a little <lb/>
            time back, was killed by Theseus. And on the hill where <lb/>
            the citadel stands is a temple of Athene, and a brazen <lb/>
            statue of the goddess, except the hands and the toes, which <lb/>
            as well as the face are of ivory. And there is another <lb/>
            temple here of Athene called Victory, and another of her <lb/>
            as Aiantis. As regards the latter, all mention of it is <lb/>
            passed over by the interpreters of curiosities at Megara, <lb/>
            but I will write my own ideas. Telamon the son of Æacus <lb/>
            married Periboea the daughter of Alcathous. I imagine <lb/>
            then that Aias, having succeeded to the kingdom of Alca­ <lb/>
            thous, made this statue of Athene Aiantis.</p>
          <p>The old temple of Apollo was made of brick: but <lb/>
            afterwards the Emperor Adrian built it of white stone. <lb/>
            The statues called Apollo Pythius and Apollo Decata­ <lb/>
            phorus are very like Egyptian statues, but the one they <lb/>
            call Archegetes is like Æginetan handiwork. And all alike <lb/>
            are made of ebony. I heard a Cyprian, a cunning herbalist, <lb/>
            say that the ebony has neither leaves nor fruit, and that it <lb/>
            is never seen exposed to the sun, but its roots are under­ <lb/>
            ground, and the Ethiopians dig them up, and there are <lb/>
            men among them who know how to find it. There is also <lb/>
            a temple of lawgiving Demeter. And as you go down <lb/>
            from thence is the tomb of Callipolis the son of Alca­ <lb/>
            thous. Alcathous had also an elder son called Ischepolis, <lb/>
            whom his father sent to assist Meleager in AEtolia <lb/>
            against the Calydonian boar. And when he was killed <lb/>
            Callipolis heard the news first in this place: and he ran <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            to the citadel, where his father was sacrificing to Apollo, and <lb/>
            threw down the wood from the altar. And Alcathous, not <lb/>
            having yet heard the news about Ischepolis, was vexed with <lb/>
            Callipolis for his irreverence, and in his wrath killed him <lb/>
            instantaneously by striking him on the head with one of <lb/>
            the pieces of wood he had thrown down from the altar.</p>
          <p>On the road to the Prytaneum there is a hero-chapel of <lb/>
            Ino, and a cornice of stone round it. Some olive-trees also <lb/>
            grow there. The Megarians are the only Greeks that say that <lb/>
            the dead body of Ino was cast on the shore of Megaris, and <lb/>
            that Cleso and Tauropolis, the daughters of Cleso and <lb/>
            granddaughters of Lelex, found it and buried it. And they <lb/>
            say that Ino was called by them first Leucothea, and they <lb/>
            sacrifice to her every year.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HEY also lay claim to the possession of a mortuary­ <lb/>
            chapel of Iphigenia, for she too they say died at Me­ <lb/>
            gara. But 1 have heard a different account of Iphigenia <lb/>
            from the Arcadians, and I know that Hesiod in his Cata­ <lb/>
            logue of Women describes Iphigenia as not dying, but <lb/>
            being changed into Hecate by the will of Artemis. And <lb/>
            Herodotus1 wrote not dissimilarly to this, that the Tauric <lb/>
            people in Scythia after shipwreck sacrifice to a virgin, <lb/>
            who is they say Iphigenia the daughter of Agamemnon. <lb/>
            Adrastus also has divine honours among the Megarians: <lb/>
            he too they say died among them (when he was leading <lb/>
            the army back after the capture of Thebes), of old age and <lb/>
            sorrow for the death of AEgialeus. And Agamemnon erected <lb/>
            an altar to Artemis at Megara, when he went to Calchas, <lb/>
            a native of the place, to persuade him to join the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion to Ilium. And in the Prytaneum they say Euippus <lb/>
            the son of Megareus was buried, and also Ischepolis the son <lb/>
            of Alcathous. And there is a rock near the Prytaneum <lb/>
            called The Galling Rock, because Demeter (if there is any <lb/>
            truth in the tale), when she wandered about seeking her <lb/>
            daughter, called out for her here. And the Megarian <note type="footnote"> 1 Herod. iv. 99, and 103. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            women still perform a kind of mimic representation of <lb/>
            this. And the Megarians have tombs in the city: one <lb/>
            they erected for those who fell fighting against the Medes, <lb/>
            the other, called Æsymnian, is a monument to heroes. For <lb/>
            when Hyperion, the last king of Megara, the son of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon, was killed by Sandion on account of his greed and <lb/>
            haughtiness, they chose no longer to be under kingly go­ <lb/>
            vernment, but to have chief magistrates annually chosen, so <lb/>
            as to be under one another's authority by turn. Then it <lb/>
            was that Æsymnus, second to none of the Megarians in fame <lb/>
            and influence, went to Apollo at Delphi, and asked how they <lb/>
            were to have prosperity. And the god among other things <lb/>
            told them they would fare well if they deliberated on affairs <lb/>
            with the majority. Thinking these words had reference to <lb/>
            the dead, they built here a council chamber, that the tomb <lb/>
            of the heroes might be inside their council chamber. As <lb/>
            you go from thence to the hero-chapel of Alcathous, which <lb/>
            the Megarians now use as a Record Office, there are two <lb/>
            tombs, one they say of Pyrgo, the wife of Alcathous <lb/>
            before he married Euæchma the daughter of Megareus, the <lb/>
            other of Iphinoe the daughter of Alcathous, who they say <lb/>
            died unmarried. At her tomb it is the custom of maidens <lb/>
            before marriage to pour libations, and sacrifice some of their <lb/>
            long hair, as the maidens of Delos used to do to Hecaerge and <lb/>
            Opis. And near the entrance to the temple of Dionysus <lb/>
            are the tombs of Astycratea and Manto, the daughters of <lb/>
            Polyidus, (the son of Cœranus, the son of Abas, the son of <lb/>
            Melampus,) who went to Megara, and purged Alcathous for <lb/>
            the murder of his son Callipolis. And Polyidus also built the <lb/>
            temple of Dionysus, and erected a statue of the god veiled <lb/>
            in my day except the face : that is visible. And a Satyr is <lb/>
            near Dionysus, the work of Praxiteles in Parian marble. <lb/>
            And this they call Tutelary Dionysus, and another they call <lb/>
            Dionysus Dasyllius (the Vine-ripener), and this statue they <lb/>
            say was erected by Euchenor the son of Cœranus the son of <lb/>
            Polyidus. And next to the temple of Dionysus is the shrine <lb/>
            of Aphrodite, and a statue of the goddess in ivory, under the <lb/>
            title Praxis (Action). This is the oldest statue in the <lb/>
            shrine. And Persuasion and another goddess whom they <lb/>
            call Consolation are by Praxiteles : and by Scopas Love and <lb/>
            Desire and Yearning, each statue expressing the particular <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            shade of meaning marked by the words. And near the <lb/>
            shrine of Aphrodite is the temple of Chance : this too is by <lb/>
            Praxiteles. And in the neighbouring temple Lysippus has <lb/>
            made the Muses and a brazen Zeus.</p>
          <p>The Megarians also have the tomb of Corcebus: the <lb/>
            verses about him I shall relate here though they are also <lb/>
            Argive intelligence. In the days when Crotopus was king <lb/>
            in Argos, his daughter Psamathe they say had a child by <lb/>
            Apollo, and being greatly afraid of her father knowing it <lb/>
            exposed the child. And some sheep dogs of Crotopus lit <lb/>
            upon the child and killed it, and Apollo sent upon the city <lb/>
            Punishment, a monster who took children away from their <lb/>
            mothers (they say), till Corœbus killed it to ingratiate him­ <lb/>
            self with the Argives. And after killing it, as a second <lb/>
            plague came on them and vexed them sore, Corœbus of <lb/>
            his own accord went to Delphi, and offered to submit to <lb/>
            the punishment of the god for killing Punishment. The <lb/>
            Pythian priestess forbade Corcebus to return to Argos, <lb/>
            but told him to carry a tripod from the temple, and wher­ <lb/>
            ever the tripod should fall, there he was to build a temple <lb/>
            to Apollo and himself dwell. And the tripod slipt out of <lb/>
            his hand and fell (without his contrivance) on the mountain <lb/>
            Gerania, and there he built the village Tripodisci. And <lb/>
            his tomb is in the market-place at Megara: and there <lb/>
            are some elegiac verses on it that relate to Psamathe and <lb/>
            Corcebus himself, and a representation on the tomb of <lb/>
            Corcebus killing Punishment. These statues are the oldest <lb/>
            Greek ones in stone that I have myself seen.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XLIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            EXT Corcebus is buried Orsippus, who, though the <lb/>
            athletes according to olden custom had girdles round <lb/>
            their loins, ran naked at Olympia in the race and won the <lb/>
            prize. And they say that he afterwards as general cut off <lb/>
            a slice of his neighbours' territory. But I think at <lb/>
            Olympia he dropped his girdle on purpose, knowing that <lb/>
            it is easier for a man to run naked than with a girdle on. <lb/>
            And as you descend from the market-place by the way called <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Straight, there is on the right hand a temple of Protecting <lb/>
            Apollo : you can find it by turning a little out of the way. <lb/>
            And there is in it a statue of Apollo well worth seeing, and <lb/>
            an Artemis and Leto, and other statues, and Leto and her <lb/>
            sons by Praxiteles. And there is in the ancient gymna­ <lb/>
            sium, near the gates called Nymphades, a stone in shape <lb/>
            like a small pyramid. This they call Apollo Carinus, and <lb/>
            there is here a temple to Ilithyia also. Such are the notable <lb/>
            things the city contains. And as you descend to the dock­ <lb/>
            yard, which is still called Nisæa, is a temple of Demeter the <lb/>
            Wool-bearer. Several explanations are given of this title, <lb/>
            among them that those who first reared sheep in this <lb/>
            country gave her that name. And one would conjecture <lb/>
            that the roof had fallen from the temple by the lapse of time. <lb/>
            There is here also a citadel called Nisæa. And as you descend <lb/>
            from it there is near the sea a monument of Lelex the king, <lb/>
            who is said to have come from Egypt, and to have been the <lb/>
            son of Poseidon by Libye the daughter of Epaphus. There <lb/>
            is an island too near Nisæa of no great size called Minoa. <lb/>
            Here the navy of the Cretans was moored in the war with <lb/>
            Nisus. And the mountainous part of Megaris is on the <lb/>
            borders of Bœotia, and contains two towns, Pagæ and <lb/>
            Ægosthena. As you go to Pagæ, if you turn a little off <lb/>
            from the regular road, there is shewn the rock which has <lb/>
            arrows fixed in it everywhere, into which the Modes once <lb/>
            shot in the night. At Pagæ too well worth seeing is a <lb/>
            brazen statue of Artemis under the title of Saviour, in size <lb/>
            and shape like the statues of the goddess at Megara. <lb/>
            There is also here a hera-chapel of AEgialeus the son of <lb/>
            Adrastus. He, when the Argives marched against Thebes <lb/>
            the second time, was killed in the first battle at Glisas, and <lb/>
            his relations carried him to Pagæ in Megaris, and buried <lb/>
            him there, and the hero-chapel is still called after his name. <lb/>
            And at Ægosthena is a temple of Melampus the son of <lb/>
            Amythaon, and a man of no great size is carved on a pillar. <lb/>
            And they sacrifice to Melampus and have a festival to him <lb/>
            every year. But they say that he has no prophetic powers <lb/>
            either in dreams or in any other way. And I also heard at <lb/>
            Erenea a village of Megaris, that Autonoe the daughter of <lb/>
            Cadmus, excessively grieving at the death of Actæon, and <lb/>
            the circumstances of it which tradition records, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            general misfortunes of her father's house, migrated there <lb/>
            from Thebes : and her tomb is in that village.</p>
          <p>And as you go from Megara to Corinth there are several <lb/>
            tombs, and among them that of the Samian fluteplayer <lb/>
            Telephanes. And they say that this tomb was erected by <lb/>
            Cleopatra, the daughter of Philip the son of Amyntas. And <lb/>
            there is a monument of Car the son of Phoroneus, origi­ <lb/>
            nally only a mound of earth, but afterwards in consequence <lb/>
            of the oracle it was beautified with a shell-like stone. And <lb/>
            the Megarians are the only Greeks who possess this pecu­ <lb/>
            liar kind of stone, and many things in their city are made <lb/>
            of it. It is very white, and softer than other stone, and <lb/>
            seashells are everywhere in it. Such is this kind of stone. <lb/>
            And the road, called the Scironian road after Sciron, is so <lb/>
            called because Sciron, when he was commander in chief of <lb/>
            the Megarians, first made it a road for travellers according <lb/>
            to tradition. And the Emperor Adrian made it so wide <lb/>
            and convenient that two chariots could drive abreast.</p>
          <p>Now there are traditions about the rocks which project <lb/>
            in the narrow part of the road ; with regard to the Molu­ <lb/>
            rian rock, that Ino threw herself into the sea from it with <lb/>
            Melicerta, the younger of her sons : for Learchus the oldest <lb/>
            was killed by his father. Athamas also is said to have acted <lb/>
            in the same way when mad, and to have exhibited un­ <lb/>
            governable rage to Ino and her children, thinking that the <lb/>
            famine which befell the Orchomenians, which also appa­ <lb/>
            rently caused the death of Phrixus, was not the visitation of <lb/>
            God, but a stepmother's contrivance against them all. So <lb/>
            she to escape him threw herself and her boy Melicerta into <lb/>
            the sea from the Molurian rock. And the boy, being carried <lb/>
            it is said by a dolphin to the Isthmus of Corinth, had <lb/>
            various honours paid to him under the name of Palæmon, <lb/>
            and the Isthmian games were celebrated in his honour. <lb/>
            This Molurian rock they consider sacred to Leucothea <lb/>
            and Palæmon, but the rocks next to it they consider ac­ <lb/>
            cursed, because Sciron lived near them, who threw into the <lb/>
            sea all strangers that chanced to come there. And a tor­ <lb/>
            toise used to swim about near these rocks, so as to devour <lb/>
            those that were thrown in: these sea tortoises are like <lb/>
            land tortoises, except in size and the shape of their feet <lb/>
            which are like those of seals. But the whirligig of time <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            which brought on Sciron punishment for all this, for he <lb/>
            himself was thrown by Theseus into the same sea. And <lb/>
            on the top of the mountain is a temple to Zeus called <lb/>
            the Remover. They say that Zeus was so called because <lb/>
            when a great drought once happened to the Greeks, and <lb/>
            Æacus in obedience to the oracle prayed to Pan-Hel­ <lb/>
            lenian Zeus at Ægina, he took it away and removed it. <lb/>
            Here are also statues of Aphrodite and Apollo and Pan. <lb/>
            And as you go on a little further is the tomb of Eurystheus. <lb/>
            They say that he fled here from Attica after the battle with <lb/>
            the Heraclidæ, and was killed by Iolaus. As you descend <lb/>
            this road is a temple of Latoan Apollo, and near to it the <lb/>
            boundaries between Megaris and Corinth, where they say <lb/>

            HE Corinthian territory, a part of Argolis, gets its <lb/>
            name from Corinthus, and that he was the son of <lb/>
            Zeus I know of none who seriously assert but most Corin­ <lb/>
            thians, for Eumelus the son of Amphilytus of the race <lb/>
            called Bacchidæ, who is also said to have been a poet, says <lb/>
            in his History of Corinth (if indeed he is the author of <lb/>
            it), that Ephyre the daughter of Oceanus, dwelt first in <lb/>
            this land, and that afterwards Marathon the son of Epopeus, <lb/>
            the son of Aloeus, the son of the Sun, fled from the lawless <lb/>
            insolence of his father, and took a colony into the maritime <lb/>
            arts of Attica, and when Epopeus was dead returned to <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, and after dividing the kingdom among <lb/>
            his sons went back into Attica, and from his son Sicyon <lb/>
            Asopia got the name of Sicyonia, and Ephyrea got called <lb/>
            Corinth from his son Corinthus.</p>
          <p>Now Corinth is inhabited by none of the ancient Corin­ <lb/>
            thians, but by colonists who were sent there by the Romans. <lb/>
            And this is owing to the Achæan confederacy. For the <lb/>
            Corinthians joined it, and took their part in the war with <lb/>
            the Romans which Critolaus, who had been appointed com­ <lb/>
            mander in chief of the Achæans, brought about, having <lb/>
            persuaded the Achæans and most of the Greeks outside <lb/>
            the Peloponnese to revolt against Rome. And the Ro­ <lb/>
            mans, after conquering all the other Greeks in battle, <lb/>
            took away from them their arms, and razed the fortifica­ <lb/>
            tions of all the fortified cities : but they destroyed Corinth <lb/>
            under Mummius the General of the Roman army, and they <lb/>
            say it was rebuilt by Julius Cæsar, who instituted the pre­ <lb/>
            sent form of government at Rome, (the Imperial). Carthage <lb/>
            also was rebuilt in his term of power.</p>
          <p>Now the place called Crommyon in the Corinthian terri­ <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            tory is so called from Cromus the son of Poseidon. Here <lb/>
            they say was the haunt of the Phæan boar, and the scene of <lb/>
            Theseus' legendary exploits against Pityocamptes, (the <lb/>
            Pinebender). As you go forward the famous pine was to <lb/>
            be seen even in my time near the seashore ; and there was <lb/>
            an altar to Melicerta there, for it was here they say that <lb/>
            he was conveyed by the dolphin : and Sisyphus, finding him <lb/>
            lying dead on the shore, buried him at the Isthmus, and <lb/>
            established the Isthmian games in honour of him. Now it <lb/>
            is at the head of the Isthmus that the robber Sinis took <lb/>
            two pinetrees and bent them down to the ground : and who­ <lb/>
            ever he conquered in battle he tied to these pinetrees, and let <lb/>
            the pines go up into the air again : and each of these pines <lb/>
            dragged the poor fellow tied to it, and (neither yielding but <lb/>
            pulling with equal vigour) the victim tied to them was torn <lb/>
            asunder. In this way Sinis himself was killed by Theseus. <lb/>
            For Theseus cleared all the road from Trcezen to Athens of <lb/>
            evildoers, having killed those whom I mentioned before, <lb/>
            and, at Epidaurus the Holy, Periphetes the putative son of <lb/>
            Hephæstus, whose weapon in fighting was a brazen club. <lb/>
            The Isthmus of Corinth extends in one direction to the sea <lb/>
            near Cenchreæ, and in the other to the sea near Lechæum. <lb/>
            This Isthmus makes the Peloponnese a Peninsula. And <lb/>
            whoever attempted to make the Peloponnese an island died <lb/>
            before the completion of a canal across the Isthmus. And <lb/>
            where they began to dig is now plainly visible, but they <lb/>
            didn't make much progress because of the rock. The Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese remains therefore what it was by nature main land. <lb/>
            And when Alexander, the son of Philip, wished to make a <lb/>
            canal through Mimas, the work was all but completed. But <lb/>
            the oracle at Delphi forbade the navvies to complete the <lb/>
            work. So difficult is it for man to oppose the divine ordi­ <lb/>
            nances. And the Corinthians are not alone in their boasting <lb/>
            about their country, but it seems to me that the Athenians <lb/>
            even earlier used tall talk in regard to Attica The <lb/>
            Corinthians say that Poseidon had a controversy with the <lb/>
            Sun about their land, and that Briareus was the Arbi­ <lb/>
            trator, awarding the Isthmus and all in that direction to <lb/>
            Poseidon, and giving the height above the city to the <lb/>
            Sun. From this time they say the Isthmus belongs to <lb/>
            Poseidon.</p><pb n="92"/>
            
          <p>The great sights at Corinth are the Theatre, and the <lb/>
            Stadium of white stone. And as you approach the temple <lb/>
            of the god, there are statues of the Athletes who have been <lb/>
            conquerors in the Isthmian games on one side, and on the <lb/>
            other pinetrees planted in a row, mostly in a straight line. <lb/>
            And at the temple, which is not very large, there stand <lb/>
            some Tritons in brass. And there are statues in the porch <lb/>
            two of Poseidon, and one of Amphitrite, and a brazen Sea. <lb/>
            And inside Herod <unclear>aw</unclear>. Athenian placed in our time 4 <lb/>
            horses all gold except the hoofs, which are of ivory. And <lb/>
            two golden Tritons are near the horses, ivory below the <lb/>
            waist. And Amphitrite and Poseidon are standing in <lb/>
            a chariot, and their son Palæmon is seated bolt upright <lb/>
            on the dolphin's back : and these are made of ivory and <lb/>
            gold. And on the middle of the base, on which the chariot <lb/>
            rests, is the Sea supporting the child Aphrodite rising <lb/>
            from it, and on each side are the so-called Nereids, who <lb/>
            have I know altars in other parts of Greece, and some <lb/>
            have temples dedicated to them as Shepherdesses, in places <lb/>
            where Achilles is also honoured. And at Doto among the <lb/>
            Gabali there is a holy temple, where the peplus is still <lb/>
            kept, which the Greeks say Eriphyle took for her son <lb/>
            Alcmæon. And on the base of Poseidon's statue are in <lb/>
            bas-relief the sons of Tyndareus, because they are the <lb/>
            patron saints of ships and sailors. And the other statues <lb/>
            are Calm and Sea, and a horse like a sea-monster below the <lb/>
            waist, and Ino and Bellerophon and Pegasus.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND inside the precincts there is on the left hand a <lb/>
            temple of Palæmon, and some statues in it of Poseidon <lb/>
            and Leucothea and Palæmon himself. And there is also a <lb/>
            crypt, approached by an underground passage, where they <lb/>
            say Palæmon is buried : whatever Corinthian or foreigner <lb/>
            commits perjury here has no chance of escaping punish­ <lb/>
            ment. There is also an ancient temple called the altar of <lb/>
            the Cyclopes, to whom they sacrifice upon it. But the <lb/>
            tombs of Sisyphus and Neleus, (for they say that Neleus <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            came to Corinth, and died there of some disease, and was <lb/>
            buried near the Isthmus), no one could find from the account <lb/>
            in the poems of Eumelus. As to Neleus they say that his <lb/>
            tomb was not even shewn to Nestor by Sisyphus : for it was <lb/>
            to be unknown to all alike. But that Sisyphus was buried <lb/>
            at the Isthmus, and indeed the very site of his tomb, a <lb/>
            few Corinthians who were his contemporaries know. And <lb/>
            the Isthmian games did not fall into disuse when Corinth <lb/>
            was taken by Mummius, but as long as the city lay deso­ <lb/>
            late, these games took place at Sicyon, and when the city <lb/>
            was rebuilt the old honour came back to Corinth.</p>
          <p>The Corinthian seaports got their names from Leches <lb/>
            and Cenchrias, who were reputed to be the sons of Poseidon <lb/>
            by Pirene the daughter of Achelous : though in Hesiod's <lb/>
            poem the great Eææ Pirene is said to be the daughter of <lb/>
            Œbalus. And there is at Lechæum a temple and brazen <lb/>
            statue of Poseidon, and as you go to Cenchreæ from the <lb/>
            Isthmus a temple of Artemis, and old wooden statue of the <lb/>
            goddess. And at Cenchreæ there is a shrine of Aphrodite <lb/>
            and her statue in stone, and next it, on the breakwater <lb/>
            near the sea, a brazen statue of Poseidon. And on the <lb/>
            other side of the harbour are temples of Æsculapius and <lb/>
            Isis. And opposite Cenchreæ is the bath of Helen : where <lb/>
            much salt water flows into the sea from the rock, like water <lb/>
            just with the chill off.</p>
          <p>As you go up the hill to Corinth there are several <lb/>
            tombs along the wayside, and at the gate is buried Dio­ <lb/>
            genes of Sinope, whom the Greeks nickname the Cynic. <lb/>
            And in front of the city is a grove of cypress trees called <lb/>
            Craneum. Here is a temple of Bellerophon, and a shrine of <lb/>
            Melænian Aphrodite, and the tomb of Lais, with a lioness <lb/>
            carved on it with a ram in its front paws. And there is <lb/>
            another monument of Lais said to exist in Thessaly: for <lb/>
            she went to Thessaly when she was enamoured of Hippo­ <lb/>
            stratus. She is said to have come originally from Hyccara <lb/>
            in Sicily, and to have been taken prisoner as a child by <lb/>
            Nicias and the Athenians, and to have been sold at Corinth, <lb/>
            and to have outstripped in beauty all the courtesans there, <lb/>
            and so admired was she by the Corinthians that even now <lb/>
            they claim her as a Corinthian.</p>
          <p>The notable things in the city are partly the remains <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            of antiquity still to be seen there, partly works of art more <lb/>
            recent, when Corinth was at the height of all her glory. Inthe <lb/>
            market-place, for most of the temples are there, is Ephesian <lb/>
            Artemis, and there are two wooden statues of Dionysus <lb/>
            gilt except the faces, which are painted with red paint, <lb/>
            one they call Lysian Dionysus, and the other Dionysus the <lb/>
            Reveller. The tradition about these statues I will record. <lb/>
            Pentheus they say, whence outraged Dionysus, among other <lb/>
            acts of reckless darinb actually at last went to Mount <lb/>
            Cithæron to spy the women, and climbed up into a tree to <lb/>
            see what they were doing: and when they detected him, <lb/>
            they forthwith dragged him down, and tore him limb from <lb/>
            limb. And afterwards, so they say at Corinth, the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess told them to discover that tree and pay it divine <lb/>
            honours. And that is why these statues are made of that <lb/>
            very wood. There is also a Temple of Fortune: her statue <lb/>
            is in a standing posture, in Parian marble. And near it is <lb/>
            a temple to all the gods. And near it is a conduit, and a <lb/>
            brazen Poseidon on it, and a dolphin under Poseidon's feet <lb/>
            passing the water. And there is a brazen statue of Apollo <lb/>
            called the Clarian, and a statue of Aphrodite by Hermogenes <lb/>
            of Cythera. And both the statues of Hermes are of brass <lb/>
            and in a stending posture, and one of them has a shrine <lb/>
            built for it. And there are three statues of Zeus in the open <lb/>
            air, one has no special title, the second is called Zeus of the <lb/>
            Nether World, and the third Zeus of Highest Heaven.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND in the middle of the market-place is a statue of <lb/>
            Athene in brass : on the base are sculptured effigies of <lb/>
            the Muses. And above the market-place is a temple of Oc­ <lb/>
            tavia, the sister of Augustus, who was Emperor of the <lb/>
            Romans after Cæsar, the founder of modern Corinth.</p>
          <p>And as you go from the market-place towards Lechæum <lb/>
            there are vestibules, on which are golden chariots, one <lb/>
            with Phaethon in it (the son of the Sun), and the other with <lb/>
            the Sun himself in it. And at a little distance from the <lb/>
            vestibules on the right as you enter is a brazen statue <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            of Hercules. And next to it is the approach to the well of <lb/>
            Pirene. They say that Pirene became a well from a woman <lb/>
            through the tears she shed, bewailing the death of her <lb/>
            son Ceuchrias at the hands of Artemis. And the well <lb/>
            is beautified with white stone, and there are cells like <lb/>
            caves to match, from which the water trickles into that <lb/>
            part of the well which is in the open air, and it has a <lb/>
            sweet taste, and they say that Corinthian brass when hiss­ <lb/>
            in- hot is dipped into this water. There is also a statue <lb/>
            of Apollo near Pirene, and some precincts of the god. <lb/>
            There is also a painting of Odysseus taking vengeance on <lb/>
            the suitors.</p>
          <p>And as you go straight on for Lechæum, you will see a <lb/>
            brazen Hermes in a sitting posture, and by it a ram, for <lb/>
            Hermes more than any of the gods is thought to watch <lb/>
            over and increase flocks, as indeed Homer has represented <lb/>
            him in the Iliad " The son of Phorbas rich in flocks and <lb/>
            herds, whom Hermes loved most of the Trojans, and in­ <lb/>
            creased his substance." 1 But the tradition about Hermes <lb/>
            and the ram in the rites of the Great Mother (though I <lb/>
            know it) I purposely pass over. And next to the statue of <lb/>
            Hermes are Poseidon and Leucothea, and Palæmon on the <lb/>
            dolphin's back. And there are several baths in various <lb/>
            parts of Corinth, some erected at the public expense, and <lb/>
            others by the Emperor Adrian. And the most famous of <lb/>
            them is near the statue of Poseidon. It was erected by <lb/>
            Eurycles a Spartan, who beautified it with various stones, <lb/>
            amongst others by the stone they dig at Croceæ in Laconia. <lb/>
            On the left of the entrance is a statue of Poseidon, and <lb/>
            next to him one of Artemis hunting. And many conduits <lb/>
            have been built in various parts of the city, as there is <lb/>
            abundance of water, as well as the water which the Emperor <lb/>
            Adrian brought from Stymphelus : the handsomest is the <lb/>
            conduit by the statue of Artemis, and on it is a figure of <lb/>
            Bellerophou, and the water flows by the hoof of Pegasus.</p>
          <p>As you go from the market-place towards Sicyon, there <lb/>
            is visible on the right of the road a temple and brazen <lb/>
            statue of Apollo, and at a little distance a well called the <lb/>
            well of Glance: for she threw herself into it, thinking <lb/>
            the water would be an antidote against the poison of <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad xvi. 490. 491. cf. also Hes. Th. 444. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            Medea. Above this well is what is called the Odeum. <lb/>
            And near it is the tomb of the sons of Medea, whose <lb/>
            names were Mermerus and Pheres, who are said to have <lb/>
            been stoned by the Corinthians because of the gifts which <lb/>
            they took Glauce. But because their death was violent <lb/>
            and unjust, the children of the Corinthians wasted away <lb/>
            in consequence, until at the oracular response of the god <lb/>
            yearly sacrifices were ordained for them, and a statue <lb/>
            of Panic erected. This statue still remains to our day, <lb/>
            the figure of a woman represented as feeling the greatest <lb/>
            terror. But since the capture of Corinth by the Romans <lb/>
            and the decay of the old Corinthians, the sacrifices are <lb/>
            no longer continued by the new settlers, nor do their <lb/>
            children continue to shear their hair, or wear black rai­ <lb/>
            ment. And Medea when she went to Athens, lived with <lb/>
            Ægeus, but some time after (being detected plotting <lb/>
            against Theseus) she had to fly from Athens also, and <lb/>
            going to the country which was then called Aria, gave <lb/>
            her name to its inhabitants, so that they were called Medes <lb/>
            from her. And the son whom she carried off with her <lb/>
            when she fled to the Arians was they say her son by <lb/>
            .,.Egeus, and his name was Medus. But Hellanicus calls <lb/>
            him Polyxenus, and says Jason was his father. And <lb/>
            there are poems among the Greeks called Naupactian: <lb/>
            in which Jason is represented as having migrated from <lb/>
            Iolcus to Corcyra after the death of Pelias, and Mermerus <lb/>
            (the elder of his sons) is said to have been torn to pieces <lb/>
            by a lioness, as he was hunting on the mainland opposite: <lb/>
            but about Pheres nothing is recorded. And Cinæthon <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian, who also wrote Genealogical Poems, <lb/>
            said that Jason had by Medea a son Medeus and a daughter <lb/>
            Eriopis: but of any children more he too has made no <lb/>
            mention. But Eumcelus' account is that the Sun gave <lb/>
            Asopia to Aloeus, and Ephyræa to Æetes : and Æetes <lb/>
            went to Colchis, and left the kingdom to Bunus the son <lb/>
            of Hermes and Alcidamea, and after Bunus' death, Epo­ <lb/>
            peus reigned over the Ephyræans. And when in after <lb/>
            days Corinthus the son of Marathon died childless, the <lb/>
            Corinthians sent for Medea from Iolcus to hand over the <lb/>
            kingdom to her: and it was through her that Jason <lb/>
            became king of Corinth, and Medea had children, by <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            Jason, but whenever each was born she took it to the <lb/>
            temple of Hera and hid it there, for she thought that by <lb/>
            hiding them they would be immortal: but eventually she <lb/>
            learned that she was wrong in this expectation, and, being <lb/>
            at the same time detected by Jason, he would not forgive <lb/>
            her though she pleaded hard for forgiveness, but sailed away <lb/>
            to Iolcus. Eventually Medea herself went away too, and <lb/>
            handed over the kingdom to Sisyphus. This is the account <lb/>
            I have read.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            AND not far from the tomb of Mermerus and Pheres is <lb/>
            the temple of Athene the Bridler: who they say <lb/>
            helped Bellerophon more than any of the gods in various <lb/>
            ways, and gave him Pegasus, after having broken it in and <lb/>
            bridled it herself. Her statue is of wood, but the head and <lb/>
            hands and toes are of white stone. That Bellerophon was <lb/>
            not absolute king at Corinth, but limited in his power by <lb/>
            Proetus and the Argives I am positive, as every one will be <lb/>
            who has read Homer carefully. And when Bellerophon <lb/>
            migrated into Lycia, the Corinthians seem just the same to <lb/>
            have obeyed those who were in power at Argos or Mycenæ. <lb/>
            And they had no separate commander-in-chief of their own <lb/>
            in the expedition against Troy, but took part in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition only as a contingent with the men of Mycenæ ; <lb/>
            and Agamemnon's other troops. And Sisyphus had as <lb/>
            sons not only Glaucus the father of Bellerophon, but also <lb/>
            Ornytion, and Thersander, and Almus. And Phocus was <lb/>
            the son of Ornytion, though nominally the son of Poseidon. <lb/>
            And he colonized Tithorea in what is now called Phocis, <lb/>
            but Thoas, the younger son of Ornytion, remained at <lb/>
            Corinth. And Demophon was the son of Thoas, Propodas <lb/>
            the son of Demophon, Doridas and Hyanthidas the sons of <lb/>
            Propodas. During the joint reign of Doridas and Hyan­ <lb/>
            thidas the Dorians led an expedition against Corinth, under <lb/>
            the command of Aletes the son of Hippotas, (the son of <lb/>
            Phylas, the son of Antiochus, the son of Hercules). <lb/>
            Doridas and Hyanthidas handed over the kingdom to <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            Aletes, and were permitted to remain at Corinth, but the <lb/>
            Corinthian people were expelled, after being beaten in battle <lb/>
            by the Dorians. And Aletes himself and his descendants <lb/>
            reigned for five generations, down to Bacchis the son of <lb/>
            Prumnis, and his descendants the Bacchidæ reigned five <lb/>
            more generations, down to Telestes the son of Aristodemus. <lb/>
            And Telestes was slain by Arieus and Perantas out of <lb/>
            hatred, and there were no longer any kings, but Presidents <lb/>
            elected annually from the Bacchidæ, till Cypselus the son <lb/>
            of Eetion drove out the Bacchidæ, and made himself king. <lb/>
            He was the descendant of Melas the son of Antasus. And <lb/>
            when Melas joined the Dorian expedition against Corinth <lb/>
            from Gonussa beyond Sicyon, Aletes at first according to <lb/>
            the oracle told him' to go to other Greeks, but afterwards <lb/>
            disregarded the oracle and took him as associate. Such <lb/>
            is the result of my researches about the kings of the <lb/>
            Corinthians.</p>
          <p>Now the temple of Athene the Bridler is near the theatre, <lb/>
            and not far off is a wooden statue of a naked Hercules, <lb/>
            which they say is the work of Dædalus. All the works <lb/>
            of Dædalus are somewhat odd to look at, but there is a <lb/>
            wonderful inspiration about them. And above the theatre <lb/>
            is a temple of Jupiter Capitolinus in the Roman diction, <lb/>
            in Greek it would be Zeus Coryphæus. And not far <lb/>
            from this theatre is an old gymnasium, and a well called <lb/>
            Lerna. And there are pillars round it, and seats to <lb/>
            refresh those who come in in summertime. In this gym­ <lb/>
            nasium there are shrines of the gods, one of Zeus, one of <lb/>
            Æsculapius: and statues of .Esculapius and Hygiea <lb/>
            (Health) in white stone, and one of Zeus in brass. As <lb/>
            you ascend to Acro-Corinthus, (it is the top of the hill <lb/>
            above the city, Briareus gave it to the Sun, after litiga­ <lb/>
            tion, and the Sun, as the Corinthians say, let Aphrodite <lb/>
            have it), there are two temples of Isis, one they call the <lb/>
            Pelagian and the other the Egyptian, and two of Serapis, <lb/>
            one under the name of Canobus. And next them are <lb/>
            altars to the Sun, and a temple of Necessity and Force, <lb/>
            into which it is not customary to enter. Above this is a <lb/>
            temple of the Mother of the Gods, and a stone pillar and <lb/>
            seat. The temples of the Fates and Demeter and Proser­ <lb/>
            pine have statues rather dim with age. Here too is a <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            temple of Bunæan Hera, which Bunns the son of Hermes <lb/>
            erected. Hence the goddess got the title Bunæan.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p><lb/>
            ON the ascent to Acro-Corinthus there is also a temple <lb/>
            of Aphrodite : and statues of her in full armour, and <lb/>
            the Sun, and Cupid with a bow. And the fountain behind <lb/>
            the temple is they say the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus: for <lb/>
            he, though he knew that Zeus had carried off Ægina the <lb/>
            daughter of Asopus, refused to tell him unless he would <lb/>
            give him this water on Acro-Corinthus. And Asopus giving <lb/>
            this water he vouchsafed the required information, and for <lb/>
            his information pays the penalty in Hades, if indeed this is <lb/>
            credible. But I have heard people say that this fountain is <lb/>
            Pirene, and that the water in the city flows down from it. <lb/>
            This river Asopus has its rise in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Phlius, flows through the Sicyonian district, and has its <lb/>
            outlet in the Corinthian Gulf. And the people of Phlius <lb/>
            say that Asopus' daughters were Corcyra and Ægina and <lb/>
            Thebe: and that from Corcyra and Ægina the islands <lb/>
            Scheria and Œnone got their present names, and that Thebe <lb/>
            gave its name to Thebes the city of Cadmus. But the <lb/>
            Thebans do not admit this, for they say that Thebe was the <lb/>
            daughter of the Bœotian Asopus, and not the Asopus that <lb/>
            has its rise at Phlius. The Phliasians and Sicyonians say <lb/>
            further about this river that it is foreign and not indigenous, <lb/>
            for Mæander they say flowing down from Celænæ through <lb/>
            Phrygia and Caria, and falling into the sea at Miletus, <lb/>
            travelled to the Peloponnese and made the river Asopus. <lb/>
            And I remember to have heard something of the same <lb/>
            kind from the people of Delos of the river Inopus, which <lb/>
            they say came to them from the Nile. And moreover <lb/>
            there is a tradition that the same Nile is the river <lb/>
            Euphrates, which was lost in a lake and re-emerged as <lb/>
            the Nile in the remote part of Ethiopia. This is what I <lb/>
            heard about the Asopus. As you turn towards the moun­ <lb/>
            tains from Acro-Corinthus is the Teneatic gate, and a <lb/>
            temple of Ilithyia. Now Tenea is about 60 stades from <lb/>
            Corinth. And the people of Tenea say that they are Trojans, <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            and were carried away captive by the Greeks from Tenedos, <lb/>
            and located here by Agamemnon : and accordingly Apollo <lb/>
            is the god they hold in highest honour.</p>
          <p>And as you go from Corinth along the coast in the <lb/>
            direction of Sicyon there is a temple, which was burnt <lb/>
            down, not far from the city on the left hand of the way. <lb/>
            There have been several wars in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Corinth, and fire has consumed, as one would indeed ex­ <lb/>
            pect, both houses and temples outside the city walls : this <lb/>
            was they say a temple of Apollo, and burnt down by <lb/>
            Pyrrhus the son of Achilles. I have also heard another <lb/>
            account, that the Corinthians erected this temple to Olym­ <lb/>
            pian Zeus, and that it was some accidental fire that burnt <lb/>
            it down. And the people of Sicyon, who are near neigh­ <lb/>
            bours to the Corinthians, say of their region that Ægialeus <lb/>
            the Autochthon first dwelt there, and that what is now <lb/>
            called Ægialus in the Peloponnese was called after him <lb/>
            its king, and that he was founder of Ægialea a city in <lb/>
            the plain: and that the site of the temple of Apollo <lb/>
            was the citadel. And they say that the son of Ægia­ <lb/>
            leus was Europs, and the son of Europs Telchis, and the <lb/>
            son of Telchis Apis. Now this Apis had grown to such <lb/>
            magnitude before Pelops came to Olympia, that all the land <lb/>
            inside the Isthmus was called after him Apian. And the <lb/>
            son of Apis was Thelxion, and the son of Thelxion was <lb/>
            Ægyrus, and his son was Thurimachus, and the son of <lb/>
            Thurimachus was Leucippus, and Leucippus had no male <lb/>
            children, and only one daughter Ohalcinia, who they say <lb/>
            bore a child to Poseidon, who was called Peratus, and <lb/>
            was brought up by Leucippus, and on his death succeeded <lb/>
            to the kingdom as his heir. And the history of Plem­ <lb/>
            næus the son of Peratus seems to me most marvellous. <lb/>
            All his children died that his wife bare to him directly <lb/>
            they were born and had uttered the first cry, till Demeter <lb/>
            took compassion on him, and coming to Ægialea as a <lb/>
            stranger to Plemnæus reared his child Orthopolis. And <lb/>
            Orthopolis had a daughter Chrysorthe: she had a child, <lb/>
            supposed to be Apollo's, called Coronas. And Coronus <lb/>
            had Corax and a younger son Lamedon.</p><pb n="101"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Corax dying childless, about this time Epopeus <lb/>
            came from Thessaly and obtained the kingdom. In <lb/>
            his reign first (they say did a hostile army ever come into <lb/>
            their country, as they had heretofore in all time lived in <lb/>
            peace. And the origin of the war was this. Antiope the <lb/>
            daughter of Nycteus had- a great reputation for beauty <lb/>
            among the Greeks, and there was a rumour about her that <lb/>
            she was the daughter of Asopus, the river that forms the <lb/>
            boundary between Thebes and Platæa, and not the daughter <lb/>
            of Nycteus. I know not whether Epopeus asked her in mar­ <lb/>
            riage, or carried her off with more audacious designs from <lb/>
            the beginning. But the Thebans came with an army, and <lb/>
            Nycteus was wounded, and Epopeus too (though he won the <lb/>
            victory). Nycteus though very bad they took back to Thebes, <lb/>
            and, when he was on the point of death, he gave orders <lb/>
            that Lycus his brother should be ruler of the Thebans for <lb/>
            the present: for Nycteus himself was Regent for Labdacus, <lb/>
            (the son of Polydorus, the son of Cadmus), who was still a <lb/>
            child, and now he left the Regency to Lycus. , He also <lb/>
            begged Lycus to go with a larger force to Ægialea and <lb/>
            punish Epopeus, and even to illtreat Antiope if he could <lb/>
            get hold of her. And Epopeus at first offered sacrifices for <lb/>
            his victory and- built a temple to Athene, and when it was <lb/>
            finished prayed that the goddess would shew by some sign <lb/>
            if it was to her mind, and after the prayer they say oil <lb/>
            trickled in front of the temple. But afterwards Epopeus <lb/>
            chanced to die of his wound which had been originally <lb/>
            neglected, so Lycus had no longer any need of war, for <lb/>
            Lamedon (the son of Coronus) the king after Epopeus gave <lb/>
            Antiope up. And she, as she was being conducted to Thebes, <lb/>
            gave birth to a child on the road near Eleutheræ. And <lb/>
            it is in reference to this event that Asius the son of Amphi­ <lb/>
            ptolemus has written the lines, " Antiope, the daughter of <lb/>
            the deep-eddying river Asopus, bare Zethus and divine <lb/>
            Amphion, being pregnant both by Zeus, and Epopeus <lb/>
            shepherd of his people." <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            But Homer1 has given them a finer pedigree, and says that <lb/>
            they first built Thebes, distinguishing as it seems to me the <lb/>
            lower city from the city built by Cadmus. And King <lb/>
            Lamedon married a wife from Athens, Pheno the daughter <lb/>
            of Clytius : and afterwards, when there was war between <lb/>
            him and Archander and Architeles, the sons of Achæus, he <lb/>
            invited Sicyon from Attica to help him, and gave him his <lb/>
            daughter Zeuxippe in marriage, and when he became king <lb/>
            the region got called after him Sicyonia, and the town <lb/>
            Sicyon instead of Ægialea. And the Sicyonians say that <lb/>
            Sicyon was not the son of Marathon the son of Epopeus, but <lb/>
            the son of Motion the son of Erechtheus. And Asius agrees <lb/>
            with them. But Hesiod has represented Sicyon as the son <lb/>
            of Erechtheus, and lbycus says he was the son of Pelops. <lb/>
            However Sicyon bad a daughter Chthonophyle, who is said <lb/>
            to have had a son Polybus by Hermes : and afterwards Phlias <lb/>
            the son of Dionysus married her, and she had a son Andro­ <lb/>
            damas. And Polybus gave his daughter Lysianassa to Talaus, <lb/>
            the son of Bias, the king of the Argives : and when Adras­ <lb/>
            tus fled from Argos he went to Polybus at Sicyon, and after <lb/>
            Polybus' death he obtained the chief power at Sicyon. But <lb/>
            when Adrastus was restored to Argos, then Ianiscus the <lb/>
            descendant of Clytius, the father in law of Lamedon, came <lb/>
            from Attica and became king, and on his death Phæstus, <lb/>
            who was reputed to be one of the sons of Hercules. And <lb/>
            Phæstus having migrated to Crete in accordance with an <lb/>
            oracle, Zeuxippus, the son of Apollo and the nymph Syllis, <lb/>
            is said to have become king. And after the death of Zeu­ <lb/>
            xippus Agamemnon led an army against Sicyon and its king <lb/>
            Hippolytus, the son of Rhopalus, the son of Phæstus. And <lb/>
            Hippolytus fearing the invading army agreed to be subject <lb/>
            to Agamemnon and Mycenæ. And this Hippolytus had a <lb/>
            son Lacestades. And Phalces, the son of Temenus, having <lb/>
            seized Sicyon by night in conjunction with the Dorians, <lb/>
            did no harm to Lacestades (as being himself also a de­ <lb/>
            scendant of Hercules), but shared the royal power with <lb/>
            him. <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyss., xi. 261-65. </note></p><pb n="103"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the Sicyonians became Dorians after this, and a part <lb/>
            of Argolis. And their city, built by Ægialeus in the <lb/>
            plain, Demetrius the son of Anti-onus razed to the ground, <lb/>
            and built the present city on the site of what was in former <lb/>
            times the citadel. And the reason of the low fortunes of <lb/>
            the Sicyonians one could not find out by investigation, but <lb/>
            one would have to be content with what is said by Homer <lb/>
            about Zeus,1 <lb/>
            “Who hath brought down the pride of many cities." <lb/>
            And when they were in a far from favourable condition an <lb/>
            earthquake came on them, and made the city almost bare of <lb/>
            men, and robbed them of many works of art. This earth­ <lb/>
            quake also injured the cities of Caria and Lycia, and the <lb/>
            island of Rhodes suffered especially, insomuch that the <lb/>
            oracle of the Sibyl about Rhodes was fulfilled.</p>
          <p>And as you go from Corinth towards Sicyon you come <lb/>
            to the tomb of Messenian Lycus, whoever this Lycus was. <lb/>
            For I find no Messenian Lycus that practised in the <lb/>
            pentathlum, or carried off the prize at Olympia. This <lb/>
            tomb is a mound of earth, and the Sicyonians mostly <lb/>
            bury in the following manner. The body they deposit in <lb/>
            the ground, and over it a stone slab with pillars on the <lb/>
            top, on which are figures, generally like the eagles in the <lb/>
            temples. But they write no epitaph, but simply the name <lb/>
            of the deceased, not even his parentage, and bid the dead <lb/>
            farewell. And next to the tomb of Lycus, when you have <lb/>
            crossed over the Asopus, is on the right hand the temple of <lb/>
            Olympian Zeus, and a little further on, on the left side of <lb/>
            the road, is the tomb of Eupolis the Athenian Comedian. <lb/>
            Further on in the direction of the city is the tomb <lb/>
            of Xenodice, who died in child-birth: it is unlike the <lb/>
            tombs in this part of the country, and has a painting, <lb/>
            which is very fine. A little further is the tomb of the <lb/>
            Sicyonians, who died at Pellene, and Dyme in Achaia, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 117. </note> <lb/>

            at Megalopolis and Sellasia, whose exploits I shall relate <lb/>
            fully later on. And they have near the gate a well in a cave, <lb/>
            which oozes through the roof of the cave, so it is called the <lb/>
            Dripping Well.</p>
          <p>And in the present citadel there is a temple to Fortune <lb/>
            Dwelling on the Heights, and next it one to the Dioscuri. <lb/>
            Both these and the statue of Fortune are of wood. And in <lb/>
            the theatre built under the citadel the person represented <lb/>
            on the stage-curtain is, they say, Aratus the son of Clinias. <lb/>
            And next to the theatre is a temple of Dionysus: the <lb/>
            god is fashioned in gold and ivory, and near him some <lb/>
            Bacchantes in white stone. These women they say are <lb/>
            sacred to Dionysus, and full of Bacchic fury. And the <lb/>
            Sicyonians have other statues in a secret place, which <lb/>
            one night in every year they bring to the temple of <lb/>
            Dionysus from the place called Ornament Room, and they <lb/>
            bring them with lighted torches and national Hymns. The <lb/>
            leader of the procession is called Baccheus, this functionary <lb/>
            was appointed by Androdamas the son of Phlias, and the <lb/>
            next- in the procession is called Lysius, whom the Theban <lb/>
            Phanes brought from Thebes at the bidding of the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess. And Phanes came to Sicyon, when Aristoma­ <lb/>
            chus the son of Cleodæus, mistaking the oracle, lost thereby <lb/>
            his return to the Peloponnese. And as you go from the <lb/>
            temple of Dionysus to the marketplace there is a shrine of <lb/>
            Artemis Limnæa on the right hand. And that the roof has <lb/>
            fallen in is clear to the spectator. But as to the statue of <lb/>
            the goddess-for there is none now-the people of Sicyon <lb/>
            do not say whether it was carried away to some other place, <lb/>
            or how it was destroyed (if destroyed).</p>
          <p>And as you enter the marketplace is a temple of Persua­ <lb/>
            sion, also without a statue. Persuasion is worshipped by <lb/>
            them on the following ground. Apollo and Artemis after <lb/>
            slaying Pytho went to Ægialea to purify themselves. <lb/>
            But being seized with some panic fear in the place which <lb/>
            they now call Fear, they turned aside to Crete to. Car­ <lb/>
            manor, and a pestilence came upon the people at Ægialea, <lb/>
            and they were ordered by the seers to propitiate Apollo and <lb/>
            Artemis. And they sent 7 lads and 7 maidens to the river <lb/>
            Sythas to supplicate Apollo and Artemis, and persuaded <lb/>
            by them these deities went to what was then the citadel, <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            and the place they first reached was the temple of Persua­ <lb/>
            sion. A Pageant of all this goes on to this day. On the <lb/>
            Festival of Apollo the lads go to the river Sythas, and, after <lb/>
            bringing Apollo and Artemis to the temple of Persuasion, <lb/>
            take them back again to the temple of Apollo. And <lb/>
            that temple is in the middle of the present marketplace, <lb/>
            and they say it was originally built by Prcetus, because <lb/>
            his daughters got cured of madness here. They say also <lb/>
            that Meleager hung up in this temple the spear with which <lb/>
            he killed the Calydonian boar: here too (they say) are <lb/>
            deposited the flutes of Marsyas: for after his awful death <lb/>
            the river Marsyas carried them to Mæander, and they <lb/>
            turned up again at the Asopus and were landed at Sicyon, <lb/>
            and given to Apollo by a shepherd who found them. Of <lb/>
            these votive offerings there is no vestige: for they were <lb/>
            burnt with the temple. And the temple and statue were <lb/>
            re-erected in my time by Pythocles.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE sacred enclosure near the temple of Persuasion, <lb/>
            consecrated to the Roman emperors, was formerly the <lb/>
            house of Clean the king. For Clisthenes the son of Iris­ <lb/>
            tonymus, the son of Myro, was king of the Sicyonians in <lb/>
            the lower part of the city, but Cleon in what is now the <lb/>
            city (i.e. the upper part). In front of this house is a hero- <lb/>
            chapel to Aratus, who did the greatest exploits of all the <lb/>
            Greeks in his time: and this is what he did. After the <lb/>
            death of Cleon there came on those in authority such <lb/>
            unbridled lust for power, that Euthydemus and Timo­ <lb/>
            clidas usurped the chief power. These the people after­ <lb/>
            wards drove out, and put in their place Clinias the father <lb/>
            of Aratus : and not many years afterwards Abantidas got <lb/>
            the chief power, (after the death of Clinias), and either <lb/>
            exiled Aratus, or Aratus retired of his own free will. How­ <lb/>
            ever the men of the country killed Abantidas, and Pascas <lb/>
            his father succeeded him, and Nicocles killed him, and <lb/>
            reigned in his room. Against him came Aratus with some <lb/>
            Sicyonian refugees and mercenaries from Argos, and slipping <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            by some of the garrison in the darkness (for he made his <lb/>
            attack by night), and forcing others back, got inside the <lb/>
            walls : and (for by now it was day) leading his men to <lb/>
            the tyrant's house, he made a fierce attack on it. And he <lb/>
            took it by storm with no great difficulty, and Nicocles slipt <lb/>
            out at a back door and fled. And Aratus granted the <lb/>
            Sicyonians isonomy, reconciling them to the refugees, and <lb/>
            giving back to the refugees all their houses and goods that <lb/>
            had been sold, but not without full compensation to former <lb/>
            purchasers. And because all the Greeks were greatly <lb/>
            afraid of the Macedonians and Antigonus (the Regent for <lb/>
            Philip the son of Demetrius), he forced the Sicyonians, <lb/>
            though they were Dorians, into the Achæan league. And <lb/>
            forthwith he was chosen commander in chief by the Achaeans, <lb/>
            and he led them against the Locrians that live at Amphissa, <lb/>
            and into the territory of the hostile Ætolians, and ravaged <lb/>
            it. And although Antigonus held Corinth with a Mace­ <lb/>
            donian garrison, he dismayed them by the suddenness of <lb/>
            his attack, and in a battle defeated and killed many of <lb/>
            them, and among others Persæus the head of the garrison, <lb/>
            who had been a disciple of Zeno (the son of Mnaseas) in <lb/>
            philosophy. And when Aratus had set Corinth free, then <lb/>
            the Epidaurians and the Trcezenians who occupy the coast <lb/>
            of Argolis, and the Megarians beyond the Isthmus, joined <lb/>
            the Achæan league, and Ptolemy also formed an alliance <lb/>
            with them. But the Lacedaemonians and Agis (the son of <lb/>
            Eudamidas) their king were beforehand with them, and <lb/>
            took Pellene by a coup de main, but when Aratus and his <lb/>
            army came up they were beaten in the engagement, and <lb/>
            evacuated Pellene, and returned home again on certain <lb/>
            conditions. And Aratus, as things had prospered so well in <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, thought it monstrous that the Piræus <lb/>
            and Munychia, and moreover Salamis and Sunium, should <lb/>
            be allowed to continue in Macedonian hands, and, as he <lb/>
            did not expect to be able to take them by storm, he per­ <lb/>
            suaded Diogenes, who was Governor of these Forts, to <lb/>
            surrender them for 150 talents, and of this money he <lb/>
            himself contributed one sixth part for the Athenians. He <lb/>
            also persuaded Aristomachus, who was king at Argos, to <lb/>
            give a democratical form of government to the Argives, <lb/>
            and to join the Achæan league. And he took Mantinea from <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            the Lacedæmonians. But indeed all things do not answer <lb/>
            according to a man's wish, since even Aratus was obliged <lb/>
            eventually to become the ally of the Macedonians and <lb/>
            Antigonus. This is how it happened.</p>

            LEOMENES, the son of Leonidas, and grandson of Cleo­ <lb/>
            nymus, when he succeeded to the kingdom in Sparta, <lb/>
            imitated Pausanias in desiring to be an autocrat, and not to <lb/>
            obey the established laws. And as he was more impetuous <lb/>
            than Pausanias, and brave as a lion, he quickly moulded <lb/>
            everything to his will by his sagacity and boldness, and <lb/>
            took off by poison Eurydamidas, the king of the other royal <lb/>
            branch, while quite a lad, and vested the power of the Ephors <lb/>
            in his brother Epiclidas, and having put down the power <lb/>
            of the Senate, he established instead of them The Great <lb/>
            Council of Patronomi (as they were called). And being very <lb/>
            ambitious of greater fortunes, and even the supremacy over <lb/>
            Greece, he attacked the Achæans first, hoping to have them <lb/>
            as allies if he conquered them, and not wishing to give <lb/>
            them the chance to hinder his actions. And he attacked <lb/>
            them and beat them at Dyme above Patræ, Aratus being in <lb/>
            this action the Achæan general, and this defeat it was that <lb/>
            compelled Aratus to invite the aid of Antigonus, being afraid <lb/>
            for the chæans, and even for the safety of Sicyon. And <lb/>
            Cleomenes having violated his conditions with Antigonus, <lb/>
            (having openly acted against the terms of the treaty in <lb/>
            other respects, and especially by turning out the inhabitants <lb/>
            of Megalopolis,) Antigonus crossed into the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            and in concert with the Achæans attacked Cleomenes at <lb/>
            Sellasia. And the Achæans were victorious, and Sellasia <lb/>
            was enslaved, and Lacedæmon captured. Antigonus and <lb/>
            the Achæans then gave back to the Lacedæmonians their <lb/>
            old Polity: and of Leonidas's sons, Epiclidas was killed <lb/>
            in battle, and Cleomenes, (who fled to Egypt and received <lb/>
            the greatest honours from Ptolemy), was cast into prison <lb/>
            subsequently for inciting the Egyptians to revolt. And <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            he escaped out of prison, and caused some trouble at Alex­ <lb/>
            andria : but at last he was taken and committed suicide. <lb/>
            And the Lacedæmonians, glad to get rid of Cleomenes, <lb/>
            chose to submit to kingly government no longer, but from <lb/>
            thenceforth until now had the republican form of govern­ <lb/>
            ment. And Antigonus continued friendly to Aratus, as he <lb/>
            had done him many good and splendid services. But <lb/>
            when Philip took the government into his own hands, <lb/>
            because Aratus did not praise his frequent exhibition of <lb/>
            temper to his subjects, and sometimes even checked him in <lb/>
            his outbursts, he murdered him, giving him poison when <lb/>
            he didn't expect it. And from Ægium, for here fate took <lb/>
            him, they took his body to Sicyon and buried him, and the <lb/>
            hero-chapel Arateum is still called after him. And Philip <lb/>
            acted in just the same way to Euryclides and Micon, who <lb/>
            were Athenians : for them too, (being orators and not un­ <lb/>
            persuasive with the people), he took off by poison. But <lb/>
            poison was it seems destined to bring disaster to Philip <lb/>
            himself : for his son Demetrius was poisoned by Perseus, his <lb/>
            youngest brother, and so caused his father's death by <lb/>
            sorrow. And I have gone out of my way to give this <lb/>
            account, remembering the divine saying of Hesiod, that <lb/>
            he who plots mischief for another brings it first on his <lb/>
            own pate.1</p>
          <p>And next to the hero-chapel of Aratus is an altar to <lb/>
            Poseidon Isthmius, and rude statues of Milichian Zeus <lb/>
            and Tutelary Artemis. Milichian Zeus is in the shape of <lb/>
            Pyramid, Artemis in that of a Pillar. Here too has been <lb/>
            built a Council Chamber, and a Porch called the Clisthenic <lb/>
            from its builder Clisthenes, who built it out of spoil which <lb/>
            he took in the war against Cirrha, as an ally of the <lb/>
            Amphictyones. And in the part of the marketplace which <lb/>
            is in the open air there is a Zeus in brass, the work <lb/>
            of Lysippus, and near it a golden Artemis. And next is <lb/>
            the temple of Lycian (Wolf-god) Apollo, in a very dilapi­ <lb/>
            dated condition. When wolves used to devour the flocks <lb/>
            so that there was no profit in keeping sheep, Apollo pointed <lb/>
            out a certain place where some dry wood lay, and ordered <lb/>
            the bark of this wood and flesh to be laid together before <lb/>
            the wolves. And this bark killed the wolves immediately <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesiod. Works and Days. 265. Cf. also Ovid, A.A. i. 655, 656. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            they tasted it. This wood is kept stored up in the temple <lb/>
            of the Wolf-god : but what tree it is of none of the Sicy­ <lb/>
            onian antiquaries know. And next are some brazen statues, <lb/>
            said to be the daughters of Prcetus, but the inscription <lb/>
            has other women's names. There is also a Hercules in <lb/>
            brass, by Sicyonian Lysippus. And near it is a statue of <lb/>
            Hermes of the Market.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OT far from the marketplace in the gymnasium is <lb/>
            a Hercules in stone, the work of Scopas. There <lb/>
            is also elsewhere a temple of Hercules: the precincts of <lb/>
            which they call Pædize, and the temple is in the middle of <lb/>
            the precincts, and in it is an old wooden statue of Hercules <lb/>
            by Laphaes of Phlius. And the sacrifices they are wont <lb/>
            to conduct as follows. They say that Phæstus, when he <lb/>
            went to Sicyon, found that the people there offered victims <lb/>
            to Hercules as a hero, whereas he thought they ought to <lb/>
            sacrifice to him as to a god. And now the Sicyonians sacri­ <lb/>
            fice lambs and burn their thighs on the altar, and part of <lb/>
            the meat they eat and part they offer as to a hero. And <lb/>
            the first of the days of the Feast which they keep to <lb/>
            Hercules they call Names, and the second Hercules' Day.</p>
          <p>A road leads from here to the temple of Æsculapius. <lb/>
            In the precincts there is on the left hand a double build­ <lb/>
            ing : in the outer room is a statue of Sleep, and there <lb/>
            is nothing of it remaining but the head. And the <lb/>
            inner room is dedicated to Carnean Apollo, and none but <lb/>
            the priests may enter it. In the Porch is the huge bone <lb/>
            of a sea-monster, and next it the statue of Dream, and <lb/>
            Sleep, called the Bountiful, lulling a lion to rest. And as <lb/>
            you go up to the temple of Æsculapius, on one side is <lb/>
            a statue of Pan seated, on the other one of Artemis erect. <lb/>
            At the entrance is the god himself (Æsculapius) beardless, <lb/>
            in gold and ivory, the work of Calamis : he has his sceptre <lb/>
            in one hand, and in the other the fruit of the pine-tree. <lb/>
            And they say that the god was brought to them from <lb/>
            Epidaurus by a pair of mules, and that he was like a <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            dragon, and that he was brought by Nicagora a native of <lb/>
            Sicyon, the mother of Agasicles, and the wife of Echetimus. <lb/>
            There are also some small statues fastened to the ceiling. <lb/>
            The woman seated on the dragon is they say Aristodama <lb/>
            the mother of Aratus, and they consider Aratus the son <lb/>
            of Æsculapius. Such are the notable things to be seen <lb/>
            in these precincts.</p>
          <p>And there are other precincts there sacred to Aphrodite : <lb/>
            and in them first is the statue of Antiope. For they say <lb/>
            her sons were born at Sicyon, and this is the connection <lb/>
            with Antiope. Next is the temple of Aphrodite. None <lb/>
            may enter into it but a maiden Sacristan, who must never <lb/>
            marry, and another maiden who performs the annual rites. <lb/>
            This maiden they call bath-carrier. All others alike must <lb/>
            only look at the goddess from the porch and worship her <lb/>
            there. Her figure seated is the design of Canachus a <lb/>
            native of Sicyon, (who also designed the Didymæan Apollo <lb/>
            for the Milesians, and the Ismenian Apollo for the The­ <lb/>
            bans). It is in gold and ivory. The goddess wears on her <lb/>
            head a cap, and in one hand holds a poppy, in the other an <lb/>
            apple. And they offer in sacrifice to her the thighs of any <lb/>
            victims but wildboars, all other parts they burn with <lb/>
            juniper wood, and when they burn the thighs they burn <lb/>
            up together with them the leaves of pæderos; which is a <lb/>
            plant that grows in the precincts of the goddess' temple <lb/>
            in the open air, and grows in no other land, nor in any <lb/>
            other part of Sicyonia. And its leaves are smaller than <lb/>
            the leaves of the beech, but larger than those of the holm <lb/>
            oak, and their shape is that of the oak-leaf, partly black, <lb/>
            partly white like the silvery white of the poplar tree.</p>
          <p>And as you go hence to the gymnasium, on the right <lb/>
            is the temple of Pheræan Artemis: the wooden statue <lb/>
            of the goddess was they say brought from Pherme. Clinias <lb/>
            built this gymnasium, and they educate boys there still. <lb/>
            There is an Artemis also in white stone, carved only down <lb/>
            to the waist, and a Hercules in his lower parts like the <lb/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you turn from thence to the gate called The <lb/>
            Holy Gate, not far from the gate is a shrine of <lb/>
            Athene, which Epopeus formerly erected, in size and beauty <lb/>
            surpassing those of its time. But time has obscured its <lb/>
            fame. The god struck it with lightning : and now there <lb/>
            remains only the altar, for the lightning did not light on <lb/>
            it. And in front of the altar is the tomb of Epopeus, <lb/>
            and near his tomb are the Gods the Averters of Evil, to <lb/>
            whom they sacrifice (as the Greeks generally) to avert <lb/>
            evil. And they say that Epopeus built the neighbouring <lb/>
            temple to Artemis and Apollo, and Adrastus the one next to <lb/>
            Hera: but no statues remain in either temple. Adrastus <lb/>
            also built behind the temple of Hera two altars, one to <lb/>
            Pan, and one to the Sun God in white stone. And as you <lb/>
            descend to the plain is a temple of Demeter, and they say <lb/>
            Plemnseus built it in gratitude to the goddess for rearing <lb/>
            his son. And at a little distance from the temple of Hera, <lb/>
            which Adrastus built, is the temple of Carnean Apollo. <lb/>
            There are only the pillars of it left, you will find neither <lb/>
            walls nor roof nor anything else there-nor in the temple <lb/>
            of Hera the Guide: which was built by Phalces the son <lb/>
            of Temenus, who said that Hera was his guide on the <lb/>
            way to Sicyon. And as you go from Sicyon on the <lb/>
            straight road to Phlius, about ten stades, and then turn <lb/>
            off to the left, is the grove called Pyræa, and in it a <lb/>
            temple of Demeter Prostasia, and Proserpine. Here the <lb/>
            men have a festival to themselves, and give up what is <lb/>
            called the Nymphon to the women to celebrate their fes­ <lb/>
            tival in, and there are statues of Dionysus and Demeter <lb/>
            and Proserpine (showing only their faces) in theNymphon. <lb/>
            And the road to Titane is sixty stades, and because of its <lb/>
            narrowness it is impassable by a carriage and pair: and <lb/>
            20 stades further you cross the Asopus, and see on the <lb/>
            left a grove of holm-oaks, and a temple of the Goddesses <lb/>
            whom the Athenians call the Venerable, but the Sicv­ <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            onians the Eumenides. And every year they keep a feast <lb/>
            to them on one day, sacrificing ewes big with young, <lb/>
            and they are wont to pour libations of honey and milk, <lb/>
            and to use flowers as chaplets. They go through the <lb/>
            same rites on the altar of the Fates in the open air, <lb/>
            in the grove. And as you turn back again to the road, and <lb/>
            cross the Asopus again, you come to a mountain-top, <lb/>
            where the natives say Titan first dwelt, who was the bro­ <lb/>
            ther of the Sun, and gave the name Titane to this place. <lb/>
            This Titan seems to me to have been wonderfully clever <lb/>
            in watching the seasons of the year, as when the Sun <lb/>
            fructified and ripened seeds and fruit, and this was why <lb/>
            he was considered the Sun's brother. And afterwards <lb/>
            Alexanor, the son of Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            came to Sicyon, and built a temple of Æsculapius at <lb/>
            Titane. A few people dwell there, but for the most part <lb/>
            only the suppliants of the god, and there are within the pre­ <lb/>
            cincts some old cypress trees. But it is not possible to learn <lb/>
            of what wood or metal Æsculapius’ statue is made, nor do <lb/>
            they know who made it, though some say Alexanor himself. <lb/>
            The only parts of the statue that are visible are the face and <lb/>
            fingers and toes, for a white woollen tunic and cloak are <lb/>
            thrown round it. And there is a statue of Hygiea some­ <lb/>
            what similar. You can not see it either easily, so hidden is <lb/>
            it by the hair of the women which they shear to the goddess, <lb/>
            and by the folds of a Babylonish garment. And which­ <lb/>
            ever of these any one wishes to propitiate, he is instructed <lb/>
            to worship Hygiea. Alexanor and Euamerion have also <lb/>
            statues, to the former they offer sacrifices after sunset <lb/>
            as to a hero, but to the latter they sacrifice as to a god. <lb/>
            And (if my conjecture is correct) this Euamerion is called <lb/>
            Telesphorus (according to some oracle) by the people of <lb/>
            Pergamum, but by the people of Epidaurus Acesis. There <lb/>
            is also a wooden statue of Coronis, but not anywhere in the <lb/>
            temple: but when bull or lamb or pig are sacrificed to the <lb/>
            goddess, then they take Coronis to the temple of Athene <lb/>
            and honour her there. Nor are they contented merely <lb/>
            with cutting off the thighs of the victims, but they burn <lb/>
            all the victims whole on the ground except birds, and <lb/>
            these they burn on the altar. On the gable ends are figures <lb/>
            of Hercules, and several Victories. And in the porch <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            are statues of Dionysus and Hecate and Aphrodite and The <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods and Fortune: these are all in wood, <lb/>
            and one of Gortynian AEsculapius in stone. And people <lb/>
            are afraid to approach the sacred dragons: but if their <lb/>
            food is put at the entrance they give no further trouble. <lb/>
            There is also within the precincts a statue of Granianus, <lb/>
            a native of Sicyon, in brass. He won two victories at <lb/>
            Olympia in the pentathlum, and a third in the stadium, <lb/>
            and two in the doublecourse, which he ran both in armour <lb/>
            and out of armour.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER. XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND at Titane there is also a temple of Athene, into <lb/>
            which they carry the statue of Coronis. And in it is <lb/>
            an old wooden statue of Athene. This too is said to have <lb/>
            been struck by lightning. As you descend from the hill, <lb/>
            for the temple is built on the hill, is the altar of the winds, <lb/>
            on which the priest sacrifices to them one night in every <lb/>
            year. And he performs mysterious rites at four pits, to <lb/>
            tame their violence, chanting, so they say, the incantations <lb/>
            of Medea.</p>
          <p>And as you go from Titane to Sicyon, and descend towards <lb/>
            the sea, there is on the left a temple of Hera, with neither <lb/>
            statue nor roof. They say Prcetus the son of Abas built <lb/>
            it. And as you go down to what is called the harbour of <lb/>
            the Sicyonians, and turn to Aristonautæ, the port of the <lb/>
            people of Pellene, there is, a little above the road, on the <lb/>
            left a temple of Poseidon. And as you go on along the <lb/>
            high road you come to the river Helisson, and next the <lb/>
            river Sythas, both rivers flowing into the sea.</p>
          <p>Next to Sicyonia is Phliasia. Its chief town Phlius is <lb/>
            40 stades at most distant from Titane, and the road to it <lb/>
            from Sicyon is straight. That the Phliasians have no con­ <lb/>
            nection with the Arcadians is plain from the catalogue of <lb/>
            the Arcadians in Homer's Iliad, for they are not included <lb/>
            among them. And that they were Argives originally, and <lb/>
            became Dorians after the return of the Heraclidæ to the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, will appear in the course of my narrative. As <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            I know there are many different traditions about among <lb/>
            the Phliasians, I shall give those which are most generally <lb/>
            accepted among them. The first person who lived in this <lb/>
            land was they say Aras an Autochthon, and he built a city <lb/>
            on that hill which is still in our time called the Arantine <lb/>
            hill, (not very far from another hill, on which the Phli. <lb/>
            asians have their citadel and a temple of Hebe.) Here he <lb/>
            built his city, and from him both land and city got called <lb/>
            of old Arantia. It was in his reign that Asopus (said to <lb/>
            be the son of Celusa and Poseidon) found the water of <lb/>
            the river which they still call Asopus from the name of <lb/>
            the person who found it.1 And the sepulchre of Aras is in <lb/>
            a place called Celeæ, where they say also Dysaules, an <lb/>
            Eleusinian, is buried. And Aras had a son Aoris and a <lb/>
            daughter Aræthyrea, who the Phliasians say were cunning <lb/>
            hunters and brave in war. And, Aræthyrea dying first, <lb/>
            Aoris changed the name of the city into Aræthyrea. <lb/>
            Homer has made mention of it (when recording those who <lb/>
            went with Agamemnon to Ilium) in the line <lb/>
            " They lived at Orneæ and lovely Aræthyrea.” 2 <lb/>
            And I think the tombs of the sons of Aras are on the Aran­ <lb/>
            tine hill. And at their tombs are some remarkable pillars, <lb/>
            and before the rites which they celebrate to Ceres they <lb/>
            look at these tombs, and call Aras and his sons to the liba­ <lb/>
            tions. As to Phlias, the third who gave his name to the <lb/>
            land, I cannot at all accept the Argive tradition that he <lb/>
            was the son of Cisus the son of Temenus, for I know that <lb/>
            he was called the son of Dionysus, and was said to have <lb/>
            been one of those who sailed in the Argo. And the lines <lb/>
            of the Rhodian poet bear me out, " Phlias also came with <lb/>
            the men of Aræthyrea, where he dwelt, wealthy through <lb/>
            his sire Dionysus, near the springs of Asopus." And <lb/>
            Aræthyrea was the mother of Phlias and not Chthonophyle, <lb/>
            for Chthonophyle was his wife and he bad Andromedas <lb/>
            by her. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Inventus forsan eodem modo est quo Eurotas, in. i." Siebelis. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Iliad, ii. 571. </note></p><pb n="115"/>

          <p>B <lb/>
            Y the return of the Heraclidæ all the Peloponnese <lb/>
            was disturbed except Arcadia, for many of the cities <lb/>
            had to take Dorian settlers, and frequent changes of in­ <lb/>
            habitants took place. The following were the changes <lb/>
            at Phlius. Rhegnidas a Dorian (the son of Phalces the <lb/>
            son of Temenus) marched against it from Argos and <lb/>
            Sicyon. And some of the Phliasians were content with <lb/>
            his demands, that they should remain in their own land, <lb/>
            that he should be their king, and that the Dorians and <lb/>
            he should have lands assigned to them. But Hippasus <lb/>
            and his party stood out for a vigorous defence, and not <lb/>
            for yielding up to the Dorians their numerous advan­ <lb/>
            tages without a fight. But as the people preferred the <lb/>
            opposite view, Hippasus and those who agreed with him <lb/>
            fled to Samos. And the great grandson of this Hippasus <lb/>
            was Pythagoras, surnamed the Wise: who was the son <lb/>
            of Mnesarchus, the son of Euphron, the son of Hippasus. <lb/>
            This is the account the Phliasians give of their own <lb/>
            history, and in most particulars the Sicyonians bear them <lb/>
            out.</p>
          <p>The most notable public sights are as follows. There <lb/>
            is in the citadel at Phlius a cypress grove, and a temple <lb/>
            hoary from old antiquity. The deity to whom the temple <lb/>
            belongs is said by the most ancient of the Phliasians <lb/>
            to have been Ganymeda, but by later ones Hebe: of <lb/>
            whom Homer has made mention in the single combat <lb/>
            between Menelaus and Paris, saying that she was the cup­ <lb/>
            bearer of the gods, and again in the descent of Odysseus <lb/>
            to Hades he has said that she was the wife of Hercules. <lb/>
            But Olen in his Hymn to Hera says that she was reared <lb/>
            by the Seasons, and was mother of Ares and Hebe. And <lb/>
            among the Phliasians this goddess has various honours and <lb/>
            especially in regard to slaves; for they give them entire <lb/>
            immunity if they come as suppliants here, and when pri­ <lb/>
            soners are loosed of their fetters they hang them up on <lb/>
            the trees in the grove. And they keep a yearly feast <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            which they call Ivy-cuttings. But they have no statue in <lb/>
            any secret crypt, nor do they display one openly : and they <lb/>
            have a sacred reason for acting so, for on the left as you go <lb/>
            out there is a temple of Hera with a statue in Parian <lb/>
            marble. And in the citadel there are some precincts sacred <lb/>
            to Demeter, and in them a temple and statue of Demeter <lb/>
            and Persephone, and also a brazen statue of Artemis, <lb/>
            which seemed to me ancient. And as you go down from <lb/>
            the citadel there is on the right a temple and beardless <lb/>
            statue of Æsculapius. Under this temple is a theatre. <lb/>
            And not far from it is a temple of Demeter, and some old <lb/>
            statues of the goddess in a sitting posture.</p>
          <p>And in the market-place there is a brazen she-goat, <lb/>
            mostly gilt. It got honours among the Phliasians for <lb/>
            the following reason. The constellation which they call <lb/>
            the She-Goat does continuous harm to vines at its rise. <lb/>
            And that no serious detriment might result from it, they <lb/>
            paid various honours to this brazen goat, and decked its <lb/>
            statue with gold. Here too is a monument of Aristias the <lb/>
            son of Pratinas. The Satyrs carved by Aristias and Pra­ <lb/>
            tinas are reckoned the best carving next to that of Æchy­ <lb/>
            lus. In the back part of the market-place is a house called <lb/>
            by the Phliasians the seer's house. Into it Amphiaraus <lb/>
            went (so they say) and lay all night in sleep before giving <lb/>
            his oracular responses : and according to their account he <lb/>
            for some time lived there privately and not as a seer. <lb/>
            And since his time the building has been shut up entirely. <lb/>
            And not far off is what is called Omphalus, the centre <lb/>
            of all the Peloponnese, if indeed their account is correct. <lb/>
            Next you come to an ancient temple of Dionysus, and an­ <lb/>
            other of Apollo, and another of Isis. The statue of Dio­ <lb/>
            nysus may be seen by anybody, as also that of Apollo: but <lb/>
            that of Isis may only be seen by the priests. The follow­ <lb/>
            ing is also a tradition of the Phliasians, that Hercules, <lb/>
            when he returned safe from Libya with the apples of the <lb/>
            Hesperides, went to Phlius for some reason or other, and <lb/>
            when he was living there was visited by CEneus, who was <lb/>
            a connexion by marriage. On his arrival from Ætolia <lb/>
            either he feasted Hercules, or Hercules feasted him. How­ <lb/>
            ever this may be, Hercules struck the lad Cyathus, the <lb/>
            oupbearer of CEneus, on the head with one of his fingers, <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            not being pleased with the drink he offered him: and as <lb/>
            this lad died immediately from the blow, the Phliasians <lb/>
            erected a chapel to his memory. It was built near the <lb/>
            temple of Apollo, and has a stone statue of Cyathus in <lb/>
            the act of handing the cup to Hercules.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            OW Celeæ is about five stades from Phlius, and they <lb/>
            sacrifice to Demeter there every fourth year and not <lb/>
            annually. Nor is the presiding priest appointed for life, <lb/>
            but a different one is chosen on each occasion, who may <lb/>
            marry if he chooses. In this respect they differ from <lb/>
            the Eleusinian mysteries, though generally speaking, as the <lb/>
            Phliasians themselves admit, their mysteries are an imi­ <lb/>
            tation of those. They say that Dysaules the brother of <lb/>
            Celeus came to their country and established these rites, <lb/>
            when he was driven from Eleusis by Ion the son of <lb/>
            Xuthus, who had been chosen commander in chief by <lb/>
            the Athenians in the war against the people of Eleusis. <lb/>
            This statement of the Phliasians I cannot assent to, that <lb/>
            an Eleusinian should have been conquered in battle and <lb/>
            gone into exile, when before the war was fought out the <lb/>
            matter was submitted to arbitration, and Eumolphus re­ <lb/>
            mained at Eleusis. But it is quite possible that Dysaules <lb/>
            may have gone to Celeæ for some other reason, and not <lb/>
            that which the Phliasians allege. Nor indeed had he, as <lb/>
            it seems to me, any other relation with the Eleusinian <lb/>
            chiefs than as brother of Celeus, for else Homer would <lb/>
            not have passed him over in his Hymn to Demeter: <lb/>
            where in his list of those who were taught the mysteries <lb/>
            by the goddess he ignores Dysaules. These are his lines. <lb/>
            " She shewed Triptolemus, and Diodes tamer of horses, <lb/>
            and powerful Eumolpus, and Celeus leader of the people, <lb/>
            the due performance of her rights and mysteries.”1 How­ <lb/>
            ever, according to the Phliasian tradition, this Dysaules <lb/>
            established the mysteries here, and also gave the name <lb/>
            Celeæ to the place. There is also here as I have said <note type="footnote"> 1 Hymn to Demeter, 474-476. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            the tomb of Dysaules, but subsequent to the date of the <lb/>
            tomb of Aras : for according to the Phliasian account <lb/>
            Dysaules came after the days when Aras was king. For <lb/>
            they say Aras was a contemporary of Prometheus the <lb/>
            son of Iapetus, and lived three generations earlier than <lb/>
            Pelasgus the son of Areas, and those who were called <lb/>
            the Autochthons at Athens. And they say the chariot of <lb/>
            Pelops is attached to the roof of the temple called the <lb/>
            Anactorum. Such are the most important traditions of <lb/>
            the Phliasians.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            N the road from Corinth to Argos you come to the <lb/>
            small town of Cleonæ. Some say Cleone was the <lb/>
            daughter of Pelops, others that she was one of the <lb/>
            daughters of Asopus, the river that flows by Sicyon: how­ <lb/>
            ever the town got its name from her. There is a temple <lb/>
            of Athene there, and a statue of the goddess by Scyllis and <lb/>
            Dipœnus, pupils of Dædalus. But some say that Dædalus <lb/>
            took a wife from Gortyns, and that Dipcenus and Scyllis <lb/>
            were his sons by her. At Cleonæ beside this temple is the <lb/>
            tomb of Eurytus and Cteatus, who had gone from Elis to <lb/>
            be spectators of the Isthmian games, and whom Hercules <lb/>
            shot with arrows there, charging them with having fought <lb/>
            against him in the battle with Augeas.</p>
          <p>From Cleonæ there are two roads to Argos, one conve­ <lb/>
            nient for rapid walkers and the shorter route, the other <lb/>
            called Tretus (Bored), more convenient for a carriage, <lb/>
            though it too is narrow and has mountains on both sides. <lb/>
            Among these mountains is still shown the lair of the <lb/>
            Nemean lion, for Nemea is only about 15 stades distant.</p>
          <p>At Nemea is a temple well worth seeing of Nemean <lb/>
            Zeus, only the roof has tumbled in, and there is no <lb/>
            longer any statue there : but there is a cypress grove near <lb/>
            the temple, where they say that Opheltes, placed on the grass <lb/>
            there by his nurse, was devoured by a dragon. The <lb/>
            Argives also sacrifice to Zeus at Nemea. and select the <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            priest of Nemean Zens, and have a contest in running <lb/>
            for men in armour at the winter meeting at Nemea. <lb/>
            Here too is the tomb of Opheltes, and round it a wall <lb/>
            of stones, and altars within the precincts : and there is <lb/>
            a piled up mound of earth as a monument to Lycurgus <lb/>
            the father of Opheltes. And the fountain they call Adras­ <lb/>
            tea, whether for some other reason or because Adrastus <lb/>
            discovered it. And they say the name Xemea was given <lb/>
            to the place by Xemea the daughter of Asopus. And <lb/>
            above Nemea is the Mountain Apesas, where they say <lb/>
            Perseus sacrificed first to Apesantian Zeus. And as you <lb/>
            go up to Argos by the road called Tretus you will see on the <lb/>
            left hand the ruins of Mycenæ. All Greeks know that <lb/>
            Perseus founded Mycenæ, and I shall relate the circum­ <lb/>
            stances of the founding, and why the Argives afterwards <lb/>
            dispossessed the old inhabitants. For in what is now <lb/>
            called Argolis they mention no older town, and they say <lb/>
            that Inachus the king gave his name to the river, and <lb/>
            sacrificed to Hera. They also say that Phoroneus was <lb/>
            the first mortal in this land, and that Inachus his father <lb/>
            was not a man but a river: and that he and Cephisus <lb/>
            and Asterion were the arbitrators between Poseidon and <lb/>
            Hera in their dispute about the land: and when they <lb/>
            judged that it was Hera's, then Poseidon took away all <lb/>
            their water. And this is the reason why neither Inachus <lb/>
            nor any other of these rivers mentioned have any water <lb/>
            except after rain. And in summer their streams are dry <lb/>
            except at Lerna. And Phoroneus the son of Inachus first <lb/>
            gathered men together in communities, who before lived <lb/>
            scattered and solitary : so the city in which they were <lb/>
            first gathered together was called Phoronicum.</p><pb n="120"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Argos his daughter's son, who reigned after Phoro­ <lb/>
            neus, gave Argos his own name. And to Argos were <lb/>
            born Pirasus and Phorbas, and to Phorbas Triopas, and to <lb/>
            Triopas Iasus and Agenor. Io the daughter of Iasus went <lb/>
            to Egypt, either as Herodotus tells the story or as the <lb/>
            Greeks tell the story, and Crotopus the son of Agenor had <lb/>
            the rule after Iasus, and the son of Crotopus was Sthenelas. <lb/>
            And Danaus sailed from Egypt against Gelenor the son of <lb/>
            Sthenelas, and expelled from the kingdom the descendants <lb/>
            of Agenor. All the world knows the history, how his <lb/>
            daughters acted to their cousins, and how after his death <lb/>
            Lynceus had the kingdom. And his grandsons, the sons of <lb/>
            Abas, divided the kingdom, Acrisius remained at Argos, <lb/>
            and Prœtus had Heræum and Midea and Tiryns and all the <lb/>
            maritime parts of Argolis: and there are to this day <lb/>
            remains of Prœtus’ palace at Tiryns. And some time <lb/>
            afterwards Acrisius, hearing that Perseus was alive and <lb/>
            a mighty man of valour, retired to Larissa by the river <lb/>
            Peneus. And Perseus, as he wished excessively to see <lb/>
            his mother's father and greet him with kind words and <lb/>
            deeds, went to him to Larissa. And being in the prime of <lb/>
            life, and rejoicing in the invention of the game of quoits, <lb/>
            he displayed his prowess to all, and by fatality Acrisius <lb/>
            was unintentionally killed by the throw of his quoit. Thus <lb/>
            was the prophecy of the god fulfilled to Acrisius, nor did <lb/>
            his contrivances against his daughter and her son turn <lb/>
            away his fate. But when Perseus returned to Argos, for he <lb/>
            was ashamed of the infamy of this murder of his grandfather, <lb/>
            he persuaded Megapenthes the son of Prœtus to exchange <lb/>
            kingdoms with him, and founded Mycenæ, where the scab­ <lb/>
            bard of his sword fell off, for he thought this an indi­ <lb/>
            cation that he should build a city there. Another tradi­ <lb/>
            tion is that when thirsty he took up a fungus from the <lb/>
            ground, and when some water flowed from it he drank it <lb/>
            and was pleased, and called the name of the place Mycenas <lb/>
            [which means both scabbard and fungus.] Homer indeed in <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            the Odyssey 1 has recorded the lady Mycene in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing line, <lb/>
            " Tyro and Alcmene and Mycene adorned with garlands;" <lb/>
            and the poem called the Great Eœæ, by Hesiod, represents <lb/>
            her as the daughter of Inachus and the wife of Arestor: <lb/>
            and from her some say the city got its name. But the <lb/>
            tradition of Acusilaus which they also add, that Myceneus <lb/>
            was the son of Sparton, and Sparton the son of Phoroneus, <lb/>
            I could not accept, far less would the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            For they have at Amyclæ the image of a woman called <lb/>
            Sparta, and if they heard that Sparton was the son of <lb/>
            Phoroneus they would marvel at once.</p>
          <p>Now the Argives destroyed Mycenæ in jealousy. For <lb/>
            though they took no part against the Medes, the people of <lb/>
            Mycenæ sent to Thermopylae 80 men, who shared in the <lb/>
            glory of the famous 300. This public spirit brought about <lb/>
            their destruction, by provoking the Argives to jealousy. But <lb/>
            there are still some remains of the precincts and the gate, <lb/>
            and there are some lions on it: which were they say executed <lb/>
            by the Cyclopes, who built the wall at Tiryns for Prcetus. <lb/>
            And among the ruins at Mycenæ is a fountain called Per­ <lb/>
            seus', and some underground buildings belonging to Atreus <lb/>
            and his sons, where their treasures were. And there is the <lb/>
            tomb of Atreus, and of those whom Ægisthus slew at a ban­ <lb/>
            quet on their return from Ilium with Agamemnon. As to <lb/>
            Cassandra's tomb the Lacedæmonians of Amyclæ claim <lb/>
            that they have it. And there is the tomb of Agamemnon <lb/>
            there, and that of Eurymedon the charioteer, and the <lb/>
            joint-tomb of Teledamus and Pelops, who were twins of <lb/>
            Cassandra, and were butchered by AEgisthus (while still <lb/>
            babes) after their parents. There is also the tomb of <lb/>
            Electra, who married Pylades, and Orestes gave her away. <lb/>
            And Hellanicus has recorded that Medon and Strophius <lb/>
            were the issue of the marriage. And Clytæmnestra and <lb/>
            Ægisthus were buried a little outside the walls, for they <lb/>
            were thought unworthy to lie within the city, and mingle <lb/>
            their ashes with Agamemnon and those who were murdered <lb/>
            with him. <note type="footnote"> 1 ii. 120. </note></p><pb n="122"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            BOUT fifteen stages from Mycenæ on the left is a <lb/>
            temple of Hera. By the road flows the river Eleu­ <lb/>
            therius. And the priestesses use it for lustrations and <lb/>
            for private sacrifices. And this temple is on the more <lb/>
            level part of Euboea, for Euboea is a mountain, and they <lb/>
            say the daughters of the river god Asterion were Euboea <lb/>
            and Prosymna and Acræa, and that they were nurses of <lb/>
            Hera. And Acræa gave her name to all the mountain <lb/>
            opposite the temple of Hera, and Euboea to the mountain <lb/>
            near the temple, and Prosymna to the ground below the <lb/>
            temple. And this Asterion flows above the temple of Hera <lb/>
            and falls into a ravine and so disappears. And the flower <lb/>
            called Asterion grows on its banks : they carry this flower <lb/>
            to Hera and plait her crowns of its leaves. The architect <lb/>
            of the temple was they say Eupolemus the Argive : and all <lb/>
            the carved work above the pillars relates partly to the birth <lb/>
            of Zeus and the gods and the battle with the Giants, and <lb/>
            partly to the Trojan war and the capture of Ilium. And <lb/>
            there are some statues in the porch, of the priestesses of <lb/>
            Hera, and of Orestes and other heroes. For they say the <lb/>
            one bearing the inscription that it is the Emperor Augus­ <lb/>
            tus is really Orestes. In the Ante-chapel are some old <lb/>
            statues of The Graces, and on the right hand the bed of <lb/>
            Hera, and a votive offering, the spear which Menelaus took <lb/>
            from Euphorbus at Ilium. And there is a huge statue of <lb/>
            Hera seated on a throne, in gold and ivory, the design of <lb/>
            Polycletus. And she has a crown on her head composed <lb/>
            of Graces and Seasons, and in one hand she has the fruit <lb/>
            of the pomegranate, and in the other her sceptre. As to <lb/>
            the pomegranate let me pass that over, for I am forbid to <lb/>
            speak of it. But as to the cuckoo which sits on the sceptre, <lb/>
            they say that Zeus, when he was enamoured of Hera while <lb/>
            still a maid, changed himself into that bird, and that Hera <lb/>
            chased the supposed cuckoo in sport. This tradition and simi­ <lb/>
            lar ones about the gods I do not record because I believe <lb/>
            them, but I record them just the same. And near Hera is <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            a statue of Hebe said to be by Naucydes, this too in ivory <lb/>
            and gold. And near it on a pillar is an old statue of <lb/>
            Hera. But the oldest statue of Hera was made of wild <lb/>
            pear tree, and was placed at Tiryns by Pirasus the son of <lb/>
            Argus, and the Argives when they took Tiryns conveyed it <lb/>
            to the temple of Hera, and I myself have seen it, a statue <lb/>
            not very large seated. And the votive offerings worthy <lb/>
            of record are a silver altar, with the legendary marriage of <lb/>
            Hebe and Hercules carved upon it, and a peacock of gold <lb/>
            and precious stones, an offering of the Emperor Adrian : <lb/>
            he made this present because the peacock is sacred to Hera. <lb/>
            There is also a golden crown and purple robe, the offerings <lb/>
            of Nero. And there are above this temple the foundations <lb/>
            of an older one and whatever the flames have spared. That <lb/>
            temple was burnt by Chryseis, the priestess of Hera, falling <lb/>
            asleep, and her lamp first setting fire to the decorations. And <lb/>
            Chryseis went to Tegea and supplicated Alean Athene: <lb/>
            and the Argives, although such a misfortune had befallen <lb/>
            them. did not remove the effigy of Chryseis, but it is there to <lb/>
            this day in front of the burnt temple.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you go from Mycenæ to Argos there is on the <lb/>
            left hand a hero-chapel of Perseus near the road. He <lb/>
            has honours here from the people in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            but the greatest honours are paid him at Seriphus. and he <lb/>
            has also a temple among the Athenians, and in it an altar <lb/>
            to Dictys and Clymene, who are called the Saviours of <lb/>
            Perseus. And as you advance on the road to Argos a little <lb/>
            way from this hero-chapel is the tomb of Thyestes on the <lb/>
            right hand: and on it is a ram in stone, for Thyestes <lb/>
            stole the golden sheep, when he seduced his brother's wife. <lb/>
            And Atreus could not be satisfied with the law of Tit for <lb/>
            Tat, but slaughtered the children of Thyestes and served <lb/>
            them up to him at table. But afterwards I cannot pronounce <lb/>
            decidedly whether Ægisthus began the injury, or whether <lb/>
            it began with the murder of Tantalus the son of Thyestes <lb/>
            by Agamemnon : for they say he married Clytaemnestra as <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            her first husband having received her from Tyndareus. <lb/>
            And I do not wish to accuse them of wickedness incarnate. <lb/>
            But if the crime of Pelops and the ghost of Myrtilus haunted <lb/>
            the family so ruthlessly, it reminds one of the answer of the <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess to Glaucus the son of Epicydes the Spar­ <lb/>
            tan, when he purposed perjury, that punishment would <lb/>
            come on his descendants.</p>
          <p>As you go on a little to the left from the Manu, for so <lb/>
            they call the tomb of Thyestes, is a place called Mysia, <lb/>
            and a temple of Mysian Demeter, so called from a man <lb/>
            called Mysius, who was as the Argives say a host of De­ <lb/>
            meter. It has no roof. And in it is a shrine of baked <lb/>
            brick, and images of Proserpine and Pluto and Demeter. <lb/>
            And a little further is the river Inachus, and on the other <lb/>
            side of the river is an altar of the Sun. And you will go <lb/>
            thence to the gate called from the neighbouring temple, <lb/>
            the temple of Ilithyia.</p>
          <p>The Argives are the only Greeks I know of who were <lb/>
            divided into three kingdoms. For in the reign of Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras, the son of Argos, the son of Megapenthes, a mad­ <lb/>
            ness came on the women, they went from their homes and <lb/>
            wandered up and down the country, till Melampus the son <lb/>
            of Amythaon cured them of that complaint, on condition <lb/>
            that he and his brother Bias should share alike with Anaxa­ <lb/>
            goras. And five kings of Bias' race reigned for four <lb/>
            generations to Cyanippus the son of Ægialeus, being all <lb/>
            descended from Neleus on the mother's side, and from <lb/>
            Melampus six generations and six kings to Amphilo­ <lb/>
            chus the son of Amphiaraus. But the native race, the <lb/>
            descendants of Anaxagoras, reigned longer. For Iphis, the <lb/>
            son of Alector, the son of Anaxagoras, left the kingdom to <lb/>
            Sthenelus the son of his brother Capaneus : and Amphilo­ <lb/>
            chus after the capture of Ilium having migrated to what is <lb/>
            now called Amphilochi, and Cyanippus dying childless, <lb/>
            Cylarabes the son of Sthenelus had the kingdom alone. <lb/>
            And he too had no children, and so Orestes the son of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon got Argos, as he was a near neighbour, and besides <lb/>
            his hereditary sway had added to his dominions much Ar­ <lb/>
            cadian territory, and as he had also got the kingdom in <lb/>
            Sparta, and had ever ready help in the alliance of the <lb/>
            Phocians. And he was king of the Lacedaemonians at <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            their own request. For they thought the sons of Tyndareus' <lb/>
            daughters better entitled to the kingdom than Nicostratus <lb/>
            and Megapenthes, the sons of Menelaus by a bondmaid. <lb/>
            And when Orestes died Tisamenus, the son of Orestes by <lb/>
            Hermione the daughter of Menelaus, had the kingdom. <lb/>
            And Penthilus, Orestes' bastard son by Erigone the daughter <lb/>
            of Ægisthus, is mentioned by Cinæthon in his Verses. It <lb/>
            was in the reign of this Tisamenus that the Heraclidæ re­ <lb/>
            turned to the Peloponnese, viz. Temenus and Cresphontes <lb/>
            the sons of Aristomachus, and, as Aristodemus had died <lb/>
            earlier, his sons came too. And they laid claim to Argos <lb/>
            and its kingdom on it seems to me the justest grounds, <lb/>
            for Tisamenus was a descendant of Pelops, but the He­ <lb/>
            raclidæ derived from Perseus. And they represented that <lb/>
            Tyndareus had been turned out by Hippocoon, and they <lb/>
            said that Hercules had slain Hippocoon and his sons, and <lb/>
            had given the country back to Tyndareus. Similarly they <lb/>
            said about Messenia, that it was given to Nestor as a <lb/>
            charge by Hercules when he took Pylos. They turned out <lb/>
            therefore Tisamenus from Lacedæmon and Argos, and the <lb/>
            descendants of Nestor from Messenia, viz. Alcmæon the son <lb/>
            Sillus the son of Thrasymedes, and Pisistratns the son of <lb/>
            of Pisistratus, and the sons of Pæon the son of Antilochus, <lb/>
            and besides them Melanthus the son of Andropompus, the son <lb/>
            of Borus, the son of Penthilus, the son of Periclymenus. <lb/>
            So Tisamenus and his sons went to what is now called Achaia <lb/>
            with his army: and all the other sons of Neleus but Pisis­ <lb/>
            tratus, (for I don't know to what people he betook him­ <lb/>
            self), went to Athens, and the Pæonidæ and the Alcmæ­ <lb/>
            onidæ were called after them. Melanthus also had the <lb/>
            kingdom, after driving out Thymcetes, the son of Oxyntas, <lb/>
            who was the last of the descendants of Theseus that <lb/>
            reigned at Athens.</p><pb n="126"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            S to Cresphontes' and the sons of Aristodemus there <lb/>
            is nothing pressing to narrate about them. But <lb/>
            Temenus openly made use of Deiphontes (the son of Anti­ <lb/>
            machus, the son of Thrasyanor, the son of Ctesippus, the son <lb/>
            of Hercules) as general for his battles instead of his sons, and <lb/>
            made him his associate in all things, and gave him as wife <lb/>
            his daughter Hyrnetho whom he loved more than all his <lb/>
            children, and was suspected of intending to make her and <lb/>
            Deiphontes his heirs in the kingdom. And for these <lb/>
            reasons he was slain by his sons, and Cisus the eldest of <lb/>
            them became king. But the Argives, who had from the <lb/>
            most ancient times loved equality and home rule, reduced <lb/>
            the kingly power so low, that Medon, the son of Cisus, <lb/>
            and his descendants were left the royal title only. And <lb/>
            Meltas the son of Lacedas, the 10th descendant of Medon, <lb/>
            the people sentenced to deprivation of his kingdom alto­ <lb/>
            gether.</p>
          <p>Of the temples in the city of the Argives the most notable <lb/>
            is that of Lycian (Wolf-God) Apollo. The statue in our day <lb/>
            was the work of an Athenian, Attalus, but originally the <lb/>
            temple and wooden statue was the offering of Danaus. I <lb/>
            think all statues were wooden in those days, and especially <lb/>
            Egyptian ones. Now Danaus built a temple to Apollo the <lb/>
            Wolf-God for the following reason. When he came to <lb/>
            Argos, he and Gelanor the son of Sthenelas were rival com­ <lb/>
            petitors for the kingdom. And many'ingratiating words <lb/>
            having been spoken by both of them to the people, and <lb/>
            Gelanor's speech seeming rather the best, the people, <lb/>
            they say, put off the decision to the next day. And at <lb/>
            break of day a wolf attacked a herd of cattle that were <lb/>
            feeding near the walls, and had a fierce encounter with <lb/>
            the bull, the leader of the herd. And it occurred to <lb/>
            the Argives that Gelanor was like the bull, Danaus like <lb/>
            the wolf, for just as this animal does not live with human <lb/>
            beings so Danaus had not up to that time lived with them. <lb/>
            And as the wolf mastered the bull, so Danaus got the <lb/>
            kingdom. And he thinking that Apollo had sent that <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            wolf against the herd, built a temple to Apollo the Wolf- <lb/>
            God. In it is the throne of Danaus, and an image of <lb/>
            Biton, the man who carried a bull on his shoulders (as <lb/>
            Lyceas has represented), for, when the Argives were sacrific­ <lb/>
            ing to Zeus at Nemea, Biton took up a bull by sheer strength <lb/>
            and carried it to the altar. And they light the fire close to <lb/>
            this image, and they call it the fire of Phoroneus : for they <lb/>
            do not admit that Prometheus grave fire to men, but they <lb/>
            attribute the invention of fire to Phoroneus. Here also are <lb/>
            wooden statuesof Aphrodite and Hermes, the latter the <lb/>
            work of Epeus,and the former the offering of Hypermnestra. <lb/>
            For she, the only one of his daughters who disobeyed his <lb/>
            cruel order, was brought to trial by Danaus, partly because <lb/>
            he thought his own safety compromised by that of Lynceus, <lb/>
            and partly because her not joining with her sisters in their <lb/>
            atrocious deed augmented the disgrace of the contriver of <lb/>
            the deed. And, being acquitted by the Argives, she erected <lb/>
            as a votive offering in this temple a statue of Victorious <lb/>
            Aphrodite. And there is inside the temple a statue of <lb/>
            Ladas, who excelled all his contemporaries in fleetness of <lb/>
            foot, and one of Hermes making a lyre out of a tortoise. <lb/>
            And there is in front of the temple an amphitheatre with a <lb/>
            representation of the fight between the bull and the wolf, <lb/>
            and a maiden throwing a stone at the bull. They think <lb/>
            this maiden represents Artemis. Danaus had all this con­ <lb/>
            structed, and some pillars near, and wooden statues of Zens <lb/>
            and Artemis.</p>
          <p>Here also are the tombs of Linus the son of Apollo, and <lb/>
            of Psamathe the daughter of Crotopus, and this is that <lb/>
            Linus they say who wrote poetry. I pass him by now <lb/>
            as more meet to be discussed in another place, and as <lb/>
            regards Psamathe I have already given a full account <lb/>
            of her in what I have written about Megara. Next is <lb/>
            a statue of Apollo the Guardian of the Streets, and the <lb/>
            altar of Rainy Zeus, where those who conspired the return <lb/>
            of Polynices to Thebes swore that they would die if un­ <lb/>
            successful in taking Thebes. As to the sepulchre of Pro­ <lb/>
            metheus, the Argives seem to me to give a less credible <lb/>
            account than the Opuntians, but they stick to their account <lb/>
            all the same.</p><pb n="128"/>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND passing by the effigy of Creux the boxer, and the <lb/>
            trophy erected over the Corinthians, you come to the <lb/>
            statue of Milichian Zeus seated, the work of Polycletus in <lb/>
            white stone. I ascertained that the following was the <lb/>
            reason why it was made. When the Lacedæmonians began <lb/>
            the war with the Argives, they continued hostilities till <lb/>
            Philip the son of Amyntas compelled them to remain <lb/>
            within their original boundaries. For during all previous <lb/>
            time the Lacedemonians never interfered outside the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese, but were always cutting a slice off Argolis, or the <lb/>
            Argives, if the Lacedaemonians were engaged in war, would <lb/>
            at such a time make a swoop on their borders. And when <lb/>
            their mutual animosity was at its height, the Argives re­ <lb/>
            solved to keep a standing army of 1000 picked men, <lb/>
            and their captain was Bryas the Argive, who in other re­ <lb/>
            spects was insolent to the people, and outraged a maiden, <lb/>
            who was being led in procession to her bridegroom's house, <lb/>
            tearing her away from her escort. But during the night <lb/>
            catching him asleep she blinded Bryas: and being arrested <lb/>
            at daybreak implored protection from the people. As <lb/>
            they would not abandon her to the vengeance of the thou­ <lb/>
            sand, there ensued a fight, and the people were vic­ <lb/>
            torious, and in the heat of victory left not one of the <lb/>
            1000 alive. But afterwards they made expiation for this <lb/>
            shedding of kinsmen's blood, and erected a statue to Mili­ <lb/>
            chian Zeus. And near are statues in stone of Cleobis and <lb/>
            Bito, who themselves drew the car with their mother in it <lb/>
            to the temple of Hera.1 And opposite these is the temple <lb/>
            of Nemean Zeus, and in it a brazen statue of the god erect, <lb/>
            the design of Lysippus. And next to it, as you go forward, on <lb/>
            the right hand, is the tomb of Phoroneus: to whom they <lb/>
            still offer victims. And opposite the temple of Nemean <lb/>
            Zeus is a temple of Fortune of most ancient date, since <lb/>
            Palamedes the inventor of dice made a votive offering of <lb/>
            his dice to this temple. And the tomb near they call <lb/>
            that of the Mænad Chorea, who they say with the other <lb/>
            women accompanied Dionysus to Argos, and Perseus being <note type="footnote"> 1 See the story told by. Addison, Spectator, No. 483. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            victorious in the battle slew most of the women : the others <lb/>
            they buried all together, but for her they had a tomb sepa­ <lb/>
            rately, as she excelled the others in merit. And at a little <lb/>
            distance is a temple of the Seasons. And as you go on <lb/>
            there are some full-length statues of Polynices, the son of <lb/>
            CEdipus, and all the chief warriors that died with him in <lb/>
            battle fighting against Thebes. These men AEschylus has <lb/>
            described as only seven in number, though more must have <lb/>
            come from Argos and Messene and Arcadia. And near <lb/>
            these seven, (for the Argives also follow the description of <lb/>
            Æschylus), are the statues of those that took Thebes, <lb/>
            Ægialeus the son of Adrastus, and Promachus the son of <lb/>
            Parthenopæus the son of Talaus, and Polydorus the son of <lb/>
            Hippomedon, and Thersander, and Alcmæon and Amphi­ <lb/>
            lochus the sons of Amphiaraus, and Diomede and Sthenelus : <lb/>
            also Euryalus the son of Mecisteus, and Adrastus and <lb/>
            Timeas, the sons of Polynices. And not far from these <lb/>
            statues is exhibited the sepulchre of Danaus, and a cenotaph <lb/>
            of the Argives whom fate seized in Ilium or on the journey <lb/>
            home. And there is here also a temple of Zeus Soter, at <lb/>
            a little distance from which is a building where the Argive <lb/>
            women bewail Adonis. And on the right hand of the <lb/>
            entrance a temple has been built to the river Cephissus: <lb/>
            the water of this river they say was not altogether dried <lb/>
            up by Poseidon, but flowed under ground on the site of <lb/>
            the temple. Aud near the temple of the Cephissus is a <lb/>
            head of the Medusa in stone : this also they say is the work <lb/>
            of the Cyclopes. And the place behind they call to this <lb/>
            day Judgement Hall, because they say that Hypermnestra <lb/>
            was put upon her trial there by Danaus. And not far dis­ <lb/>
            tant is a theatre: and in it among other things well worth <lb/>
            seeing is Perilaus the Argive, the son of Alcenor, slaying <lb/>
            Othryades the Spartan. Perilaus before this had had the <lb/>
            good luck to carry off the prize for wrestling in the Nemean <lb/>
            games. And beyond the theatre is a temple of Aphrodite, <lb/>
            in front of which is a statue of Telesilla the poetess on a <lb/>
            pillar: at her feet lie her volumes of poetry, and she her­ <lb/>
            self is looking at a helmet, which she holds in her hand <lb/>
            and is about to put on her head. This Telesilla was other­ <lb/>
            wise remarkable among women, besides being honoured <lb/>
            for her poetic gifts. For when upon the Argives fell <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            disaster untold at the hands of Cleomenes (the son of <lb/>
            Anaxandrides) and the Lacedaemonians, and most of <lb/>
            them perished in the battle, and when all that fled for <lb/>
            refuge to the grove at Argos perished also, at first coming <lb/>
            out for quarter, but when they found that the promised <lb/>
            quarter was not granted, setting themselves and the grove <lb/>
            on fire together, then Cleomenes led the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            to an Argos stript of men. Then it was that Telesilla <lb/>
            manned the walls with all the slaves who through youth or <lb/>
            age were reckoned unfit to carry arms, and herself getting <lb/>
            together all the arms which were left in the houses or the <lb/>
            temples, and mustering all the women in the prime of life, <lb/>
            armed them, and drew them up in battle array where she <lb/>
            knew the enemy would approach. And when the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians came up, and the women so far from being dis­ <lb/>
            mayed at their war cry received their attack stoutly, then <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians considering that if they killed all the <lb/>
            women their victory would be discreditable, and if they <lb/>
            themselves were beaten their reverse would be disgraceful, <lb/>
            yielded to the women. Now the Pythian Priestess had <lb/>
            foretold this, and Herodotus, whether understanding the <lb/>
            oracle or not, had recorded it as follows.1 " But when the <lb/>
            female conquering the male shall drive him out and win <lb/>
            fame for the Argives, then shall the god make many of <lb/>
            the Argive women wretched." These words of the oracle <lb/>
            describe the action of the women.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you descend from thence and turn to the market­ <lb/>
            place you see the tomb of Cerdo, the wife of Phoro­ <lb/>
            neus, and the temple of Æsculapius. And the temple of <lb/>
            Artemis, under the name Persuasion, was erected also by <lb/>
            Hypermnestra, when she was victorious over her father <lb/>
            in the trial about Lynceus. There is also a brazen statue <lb/>
            of JEneas, and a place called Delta, but why it is called <lb/>
            Delta I purposely pass over, for I didn't like the explana­ <lb/>
            tion. And in front of it is a temple of Zeus Promoter of <note type="footnote"> 1 Hdt. vi. 77. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            Flight, and near it is the sepulchre of Hypermnestra the <lb/>
            mother of Amphiaraus, and the sepulchre of Hypermnestra <lb/>
            the daughter of Danaus, who lies in the same grave with <lb/>
            Lynceus. And opposite them is the tomb of Talaus the son <lb/>
            of Bias, about whom and his descendants I have spoken <lb/>
            already. And there is a temple of Athene under the name <lb/>
            of Trumpet, which they say Hegeleus built. This Hegeleus <lb/>
            they say was the son of Tyrsenus, who was the son of <lb/>
            Hercules and a Lydian woman, and Tyrsenus was the first <lb/>
            who invented the trumpet, and Hegeleus his son taught the <lb/>
            Dorians who followed Temenus the use of it, and that was <lb/>
            why he called Athene Trumpet. And before the temple of <lb/>
            Athene is they say the tomb of Epimenides : for the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians when they fought against the Gnossians took <lb/>
            Epimenides alive, but killed him afterwards because he did <lb/>
            not prophesy auspiciously for them, and they say they <lb/>
            brought his remains, and buried them, here. And the <lb/>
            building of white stone, nearly in the middle of the market­ <lb/>
            place, is not a trophy over Pyrrhus the king of Epirus, <lb/>
            as the Argives say. but a memorial that his body was burnt <lb/>
            here, inasmuch as elephants and all other things which he <lb/>
            used in battle are represented here. This was the building <lb/>
            for his funeral pyre: but his bones lie in the temple of <lb/>
            Demeter, where in my account of Attica I have shown <lb/>
            that he died. And at the entrance of this temple of <lb/>
            Demeter you may see his brazen shield hanging over the <lb/>
            door.</p>
          <p>And not far from the building in the marketplace of the <lb/>
            Argives is a mound of earth. They say the head of the <lb/>
            Gorgon Medusa lies under it. To omit fable, it has been <lb/>
            recorded of her that she was the daughter of Phorcus, and <lb/>
            that after the death of her father she ruled over the people <lb/>
            that live near the Tritonian marsh, and used to go out <lb/>
            hunting and led the Libyans in battle, and moreover resisted <lb/>
            with her army the power of Perseus, though picked men <lb/>
            followed him from the Peloponnese, but she was treache­ <lb/>
            rously slain by night, and Perseus, marvelling at her beauty <lb/>
            even after death, cut her head off and brought it home to <lb/>
            display to the Greeks. But Procles the Carthaginian, the <lb/>
            son of Eucrates, has another account more plausible than <lb/>
            this one. The desert of Libya produces monsters scarce <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            credible to those that hear of them, and there both wild men <lb/>
            and wild women are born : and Procles said he had seen one <lb/>
            of those wild men that had been taken to Rome. He con­ <lb/>
            jectured therefore that Medusa was a woman who had <lb/>
            wandered from them, and gone to the Tritonian marsh, <lb/>
            and illtreated the inhabitants till Perseus slew her: and <lb/>
            Athene he thought-assisted Perseus in the work, because <lb/>
            the men in the neighbourhood of the Tritonian marsh <lb/>
            were sacred to her. And in Argos close to this monument <lb/>
            of the Gorgon is the tomb of the Gorgon-slayer Perseus. <lb/>
            Why she was called Gorgon is plain to the hearer at once.1 <lb/>
            They say she was the first woman who ever married a second <lb/>
            husband, for she married one CEbalus, when her husband <lb/>
            Perieres the son of Æolus was dead, with whom she had <lb/>
            lived from her virginity. Previously it was customary for <lb/>
            women to remain widows if their husband died. And be­ <lb/>
            fore this tomb is a trophy erected in stone to the Argive <lb/>
            Laphaes, whom, according to the Argive tradition, the <lb/>
            people rose up against and expelled when he was king, and <lb/>
            when he fled to Sparta the Lacedaemonians endeavoured to <lb/>
            restore him, but the Argives being victorious in the battle <lb/>
            slew Laphaes and most of the Lacedæmonians. And not <lb/>
            far from this trophy is the temple of Leto, and a statue of <lb/>
            her by Praxiteles. And the figure near the goddess is the <lb/>
            maiden they call Chloris, who they say was the daughter of <lb/>
            Niobe, and was originally called Melibœa. And when the <lb/>
            children of Amphion and Niobe were slain by Apollo and <lb/>
            Artemis, she alone and Amyclas were saved alive, as they <lb/>
            supplicated Leto. But fear turned Melibœa so pale that <lb/>
            she remained so all the rest bf her life, insomuch that her <lb/>
            name was changed from Melibœa into Chloris (pale). This <lb/>
            Chloris and Amyclas the Argives say built the original <lb/>
            temple of Leto. But I myself am of opinion, (for I lean <lb/>
            more than most people to the authority of Homer,) that <lb/>
            none of the children of Niobe survived. The following <lb/>
            line bears me out.</p>
          <p>" Two arrows only slew the whole family." 2</p>
          <p>Homer therefore describes the whole family of Amphion. <lb/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW the temple of Flowery Hera is on the right hand <lb/>
            of the temple of Leto, and in front of it is the tomb of <lb/>
            the women who fell in the fight between the Argives and <lb/>
            Perseus, and had marched with Dionysus from the islands <lb/>
            in the Ægean, and who were called Marines from that cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance. And right opposite the sepulchre of those <lb/>
            women is the temple of Demeter, surnamed Pelasgian be­ <lb/>
            cause Pelasgus the son of Triopas built it, and at no great <lb/>
            distance from the temple is Pelasgus' tomb. And beyond <lb/>
            the tomb is a brazen shrine not very large, which contains <lb/>
            old statues of Artemis and Zeus and Athene. Lyceas in his <lb/>
            verses has represented it as a votive offering to Zeus the <lb/>
            Contriver, and said that the Argives who went on the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion to Ilium swore here that they would not give over fight­ <lb/>
            ing, till they should either capture Ilium or be killed fighting <lb/>
            there. But others have said that the remains of Tantalus <lb/>
            are in that brazen shrine. I will not dispute that the Tan­ <lb/>
            talus who was the son of Thyestes or Broteus, (for both <lb/>
            traditions are current), who married Clytæmnestra before <lb/>
            Agamemnon, was buried here. But the Tantalus who was <lb/>
            said to be son of Zeus or Pluto was buried at Sipylus in a <lb/>
            very handsome tomb which I have myself seen. And more­ <lb/>
            over there was no necessity for him to flee from Sipylus, as <lb/>
            happened afterwards to Pelops when Ilus the Phrygian <lb/>
            came against him with an army. But let the enquiry pro­ <lb/>
            ceed no further. As for the rites which take place at <lb/>
            the neighbouring trench, they say they were instituted by <lb/>
            Nicostratus, a man of those parts. To this day they place <lb/>
            in the trench lighted torches to Proserpine the daughter of <lb/>
            Demeter. There too is a temple of Poseidon under the <lb/>
            name of the Flood-god-for Poseidon flooded most of the <lb/>
            region, because Inachus and the other arbitrators decided <lb/>
            that the land was Hera's and not his. But Hera after­ <lb/>
            wards got Poseidon to draw the water off : and the Argives, <lb/>
            at the place where the stream retired, built a temple to <lb/>
            Poseidon the Flood-god. And as you go a little further is <lb/>
            the tomb of Argos. who was reputed to be the son of Zeus <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            and Niobe the daughter of Phoroneus: and next is the <lb/>
            temple of the Dioscuri. And there are statues of them and <lb/>
            their sons, Anaxis and Mnasinus, and with them their <lb/>
            mothers Hilaira and Phoebe, in black ebony wood, by <lb/>
            Dipcenus and Scyllis. Even the horses are mostly made of <lb/>
            ebony, though partly of ivory. And near this temple of the <lb/>
            Dioscuri is a temple of Ilithyia, the offering of Helen, when <lb/>
            Theseus went with Pirithous to Thesprotia, and Aphidna <lb/>
            was captured by the Dioscuri, and Helen was taken to Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon. For they say she was pregnant by Theseus, and <lb/>
            bare a child in Argos and built this temple to Ilithyia, and <lb/>
            gave the child to Clytæmnestra, who was now the wife of <lb/>
            Agamemnon, and the child afterwards became the wife of <lb/>
            Menelaus. Euphorion the Chalcidian and Alexander the <lb/>
            Pleuronian have mentioned it in their poems, and still <lb/>
            earlier Stesichorus of Himera, and they say like the Argives <lb/>
            that Iphigenia was the daughter of Theseus by Helen. <lb/>
            And beyond the temple of Ilithyia is the temple of Hecate, <lb/>
            and the statue is the work of Scopas. It is of stone and <lb/>
            right opposite are two brazen statues of Hecate, one by <lb/>
            Polycletus, and the other by his brother Naucydes the son <lb/>
            of Mothon. And as you go straight for the gymnasium, <lb/>
            which is called Cylarabis after Cylarabus, the son of <lb/>
            Sthenelus, you come to the tomb of Licymnius the son of <lb/>
            Electryon. Homer says he was slain by Tleptolemus the <lb/>
            son of Hercules, who had to fly from Argos in consequence <lb/>
            of this murder. And, as you turn off a little towards <lb/>
            Cylarabis and the gate in this direction, is the sepulchre of <lb/>
            Sacades, who was the first who played the Hymn to Apollo <lb/>
            at Delphi on the flute: and it seems the anger of Apollo <lb/>
            against fluteplayers (which he had in consequence of the <lb/>
            contest with Marsyas the Silenus) was appeased by this <lb/>
            Sacadas. In this gymnasium of Cylarabus is a bust of <lb/>
            Athene Capanea, and they show the tomb of Sthenelus, and <lb/>
            of Cylarabus himself. And not far from this gymnasium <lb/>
            is a monument to the Argives who sailed with the Athenians <lb/>
            to reduce Syracuse and Sicily.</p><pb n="135"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            S you go thence on the road called the Hollow Way, <lb/>
            there is on the right hand a temple of Dionysus : the <lb/>
            statue of the god they say came from Eubœa. For when the <lb/>
            Greeks returning from Ilium were shipwrecked at Cap­ <lb/>
            hareus, those of the Argives who contrived to escape to <lb/>
            shore were in evil plight from cold and hunger. But when <lb/>
            they prayed that one of the gods would save them in <lb/>
            their present emergency, immediately as they went forward <lb/>
            they saw a cave of Dionysus, and a statue of the god in the <lb/>
            cave, and some wild goats that had taken refuge from the <lb/>
            cold were huddled together in it. These the Argives killed, <lb/>
            and eat their flesh, and used their skins for clothing. And <lb/>
            when the winter was over, they repaired their vessels and <lb/>
            sailed homewards, and took with them the wooden statue <lb/>
            from the cave, and worship it to this day. And very near <lb/>
            the temple of Dionysus you will see the house of Adrastus, <lb/>
            and at some distance from it the temple of Amphiaraus, <lb/>
            and beyond that the tomb of Eriphyle. And next these is <lb/>
            the shrine of AEsculapius, and close to it the temple of <lb/>
            Bato, who was of the family of Amphiaraus and one of the <lb/>
            Melampodidæ, and was Amphiaraus' charioteer when he <lb/>
            went out to battle : and when the rout from Thebes came <lb/>
            about, the earth opened and swallowed up Amphiaraus and <lb/>
            the chariot and Bato all together. And as you return from <lb/>
            the Hollow Way you come to the reputed tomb of Hyrnetho. <lb/>
            If it is a cenotaph and merely in memory of her, their <lb/>
            account is probable enough, but if they say that the body <lb/>
            of Hyrnetho lies there I cannot believe them, but let him <lb/>
            believe them who knows nothing about Epidaurus. The <lb/>
            most famous of the temples of AEsculapius at Argos has a <lb/>
            statue still to be seen, AEsculapius seated, in white stone, <lb/>
            and next to him a statue of Hygiea. There are also seated <lb/>
            near them those who designed these statues, Xenophilus <lb/>
            and Strato. That temple was originally built by Sphyrus, <lb/>
            the son of Machaon, and the brother of the Alexanor who <lb/>
            has honours among the Sicyonians at Titane. And the <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            statue of Pheræan Artemis, (for the Argives worship <lb/>
            Pheræan Artemis as well as the Athenians and Sicyonians,) <lb/>
            was they say brought from Pheræ in Thessaly. But I <lb/>
            cannot agree with the Argives who say that they have at <lb/>
            Argos the tombs of Deianira the daughter of CEneus, and of <lb/>
            Helenus the son of Priam, and that they have the statue of <lb/>
            Athene that was carried away from Ilium, and whose loss <lb/>
            caused its fall. The Palladium, for that is its name, was <lb/>
            certainly carried by Æneas to Italy. As to Deianira, we <lb/>
            know she died at Trachis and not at Argos, and her tomb <lb/>
            is near that of Hercules on Mount CEta. And as to Helenus <lb/>
            the son of Priam, I have already shown that he went with <lb/>
            Pyrrhus the son of Achilles to Epirus, and married Andro­ <lb/>
            mache, and was Regent for the sons of Pyrrhus, and that <lb/>
            Cestrine in Epirus took its name from his son Cestrinus. <lb/>
            Not that the Argive antiquarians are ignorant that all <lb/>
            their traditions are not true, still they utter them : for it is <lb/>
            not easy to get the mass of mankind to change their pre­ <lb/>
            conceived opinions. There are other things at Argos worth <lb/>
            seeing, as the underground building, (in which is the <lb/>
            brazen chamber which Acrisius formerly got constructed <lb/>
            for the safe custody of his daughter, Perilaus deposed and <lb/>
            succeeded him,) and the tomb of Crotopus, and the temple <lb/>
            of Cretan Dionysus. For they say that Dionysus, after he <lb/>
            had warred with Perseus and got friendly again with him, <lb/>
            was highly honoured by the Argives in various respects, <lb/>
            and was given as a special honour this enclosure. And <lb/>
            afterwards it was called the temple of Cretan Dionysus, <lb/>
            because they buried Ariadne here. And Lyceas says that <lb/>
            when the temple was restored an earthenware cinerary urn <lb/>
            was found that contained the ashes of Ariadne : which he <lb/>
            said several Argives had seen. And near this temple of <lb/>
            Dionysus is the temple of Celestial Aphrodite.</p><pb n="137"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the citadel they call Larissa from the daughter of <lb/>
            Pelasgus, and from two cities of that name in Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, one on the coast, and one by the river Peneus. And <lb/>
            as you go up to the citadel there is a temple of Hera <lb/>
            Dwelling on the Heights, there is also a temple of Apollo, <lb/>
            which Pythæus, who first came from Delphi, is said to <lb/>
            have erected. The statue is of brass erect, and is called <lb/>
            Apollo of the Ridgeway, for the place is called Ridge. <lb/>
            Oracular responses, for there is an oracle there even to our <lb/>
            day, are given in the following manner. The prophetess is <lb/>
            debarred from marriage : and when a lamb is sacrificed <lb/>
            every month, she tastes of the blood and becomes possessed <lb/>
            by the god. And next to the temple of Apollo of the <lb/>
            Ridgeway is the temple of Athene called Sharp-eyed, the <lb/>
            votive offering of Diomede, because when he was fighting <lb/>
            at Ilium the goddess upon one occasion took a mist from <lb/>
            his eyes.1 And close by is the race-course where they hold <lb/>
            the games to Nemean Zeus and to Hera. On the left of <lb/>
            the road to the citadel is a monument to the sons of <lb/>
            Ægyptus. Their heads are here apart from their bodies, <lb/>
            for the bodies are at Lerna where the murder of the young <lb/>
            men was perpetrated, and when they were dead their <lb/>
            wives cut their heads off, to show their father their des­ <lb/>
            perate deed. And on the summit of Larissa is the temple <lb/>
            of Larissæan Zeus, which has no roof to it: and the <lb/>
            statue, which is made of wood, stands no longer on its <lb/>
            base. And there is a temple of Athene well worth seeing. <lb/>
            There are several votive offerings there, and a wooden statue <lb/>
            of Zeus, with the usual two eyes, and a third in the fore­ <lb/>
            head. This Zeus they say was the tutelary god of Priam <lb/>
            the son of Laomedon, and was placed in his hall in the <lb/>
            open air, and when Ilium was taken by the Greeks, it was <lb/>
            to his altar that Priam fled for refuge. And when they <lb/>
            divided the spoil Sthenelus the son of Capaneus got it, and <lb/>
            placed it here. One might conjecture that the god has <lb/>
            three eyes for the following reason. That he reigns in <note type="footnote"> 1 See II. v. 127, 128. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            heaven is the universal tradition of all mankind. And that <lb/>
            he reigns also under the earth the line of Homer proves, <lb/>
            speaking of him as <lb/>
            " Zeus the lord of the under world, and dread Proserpine.”1 <lb/>
            And AEschylus the son of Euphorion calls him also Zeus of <lb/>
            the sea. The sculptor therefore whoever he was repre­ <lb/>
            sented him with three eyes to denote that the god rules <lb/>
            in these three departments of the universe.</p>
          <p>Among the roads from Argos to various parts of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, is one to Tegea a town in Arcadia. On the <lb/>
            right of this road is the mountain Lycone, full of cypress <lb/>
            trees. And on the top of the mountain is a temple to <lb/>
            Orthian Artemis, and there are statues of Apollo and Leto <lb/>
            and Artemis in white stone; said to be by Polycletus. And <lb/>
            as you go down from the mountain there is on the left of <lb/>
            the road a temple of Artemis. And at a little distance on <lb/>
            the right is the mountain called Chaon. And underneath <lb/>
            it trees are planted, and manifestly here the Erasinus has <lb/>
            its rise : for a while it flows from Stymphalus in Arcadia, <lb/>
            as the Rheti flow from Euripus to Eleusis and so to the <lb/>
            sea. And where the river Erasinus gushes out on the <lb/>
            mountain-side they sacrifice to Dionysus and Pan, and keep <lb/>
            the feast of Dionysus called Medley. And as you return <lb/>
            to the Tegean road, you come to Cenchreæ on the right <lb/>
            of what is called Trochus. Why it was called Cenchreæ <lb/>
            they do not tell us, except the name came from Cenchreus <lb/>
            the son of Pirene. There is here a general tomb of the. <lb/>
            Argives who conquered the Lacedaemonians in battle near <lb/>
            Hysiæ. I ascertained that this battle was fought when <lb/>
            Pisistratus was ruler at Athens, and in the 4th year of the <lb/>
            Olympiad in which Eurybotus the Athenian won the prize <lb/>
            in the course. And as you descend to the plain are the <lb/>
            ruins of the town Hysiæ in Argolis, and here they say the <lb/>
            reverse happened to the Lacedæmonians. <note type="footnote"> 1 II. ix. 457. </note></p><pb n="139"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE road to Mantinea from Argos is not the same as <lb/>
            the road to Tegea, but you start from the gates near <lb/>
            the ridge. And on this road there is a temple with a double <lb/>
            entrance, one facing west, another east. At the east end <lb/>
            is a wooden statue of Aphrodite, at the west one of Ares. <lb/>
            These statues are they say votive offerings of Polynices and <lb/>
            the Argives who were associated with him in his expedi­ <lb/>
            tion. And as you go on from thence after crossing the <lb/>
            winter torrent called Ravine you come to (Enoe, which <lb/>
            gets its name (so the Argives say) from (Eneus, who was <lb/>
            king in Ætolia, and expelled they say from his kingdom <lb/>
            by the sons of Agrius, and went to Argos to Diomede. <lb/>
            And he helped him somewhat by leading an army into <lb/>
            Calydonia, but he couldn't he said stay there : but recom­ <lb/>
            mended him if he liked to accompany him to Argos. And <lb/>
            when he went there, he treated him in all respects well, as <lb/>
            one would expect a person to treat his grandfather, and <lb/>
            when he died he buried him here. The place got called <lb/>
            Œnoe by the Argives after him. And above (Enoe is the <lb/>
            Mountain Artemisium, and a temple of Artemis on the top <lb/>
            of the mountain. And on this mountain are the sources <lb/>
            of the Inachus: for it has its rise here, though it flows <lb/>
            underground for some way. There is nothing else to see <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>And another road from the gates near the Ridge goes to <lb/>
            Lyrceia. This is the place to which Lynceus alone of all <lb/>
            the 50 brothers is said to have escaped, and when he got <lb/>
            there safe, he held up a lighted torch there. For it was no <lb/>
            doubt agreed between Hypermnestra and him that he should <lb/>
            do so as a signal, if he should escape from Danaus and get <lb/>
            to a place of safety. And she also they say kindled another <lb/>
            at Larissa, manifestly to show that she too was in no <lb/>
            danger. And in memory of this the Argives every year <lb/>
            have a torch procession. And in those days the place was <lb/>
            called Lynceia, but afterwards, because Lyrcus an illegiti­ <lb/>
            mate son of Abas lived there, it got the name Lyrceia from <lb/>
            him. There is nothing very notable among the ruins but <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            the effigy of Lyrcus on a pillar. From Lyrceia to Argos <lb/>
            is about 60 stades, and it is about the same distance <lb/>
            from Lyrceia to Orneæ. Homer has made no mention of <lb/>
            Lyrceia in his catalogue, as the city was already depopu­ <lb/>
            lated at the time of the expedition to Ilium: but Orneæ, <lb/>
            which was still inhabited, Homer1 has recorded before <lb/>
            Phlius and Sicyon, according to its geographical situation <lb/>
            in Argolis. And it got its name from Orneus the son of <lb/>
            Erechtheus: and this Orneus had a son Peteos, and he had <lb/>
            a son Menestheus, who aided Agamemnon with a force from <lb/>
            Athens to put down the dominion of Priam. From Orneus <lb/>
            then the city got its name, and the Argives afterwards dis­ <lb/>
            possessed the people of Orneæ; and when they were dis­ <lb/>
            possessed they were naturalized among the Argives. And <lb/>
            there is at Orneæ a temple of Artemis, and a wooden statue <lb/>
            of the goddess in an erect posture, and another temple to <lb/>
            all the gods in common. And beyond Orneæ are Sicyonia <lb/>
            and Phliasia.</p>
          <p>And as you go from Argos to the district of Epidaurus <lb/>
            there is a building on the right hand like a pyramid, with <lb/>
            some Argolic shields worked on it as a design. Here <lb/>
            Prœtus fought with Acrisius for the supremacy, and their <lb/>
            contest was they say drawn, and they had a peace after­ <lb/>
            wards, as neither of them could conquer the other. And <lb/>
            they say that they engaged first with shields, and then they <lb/>
            and the army on both sides in full armour. And those <lb/>
            who fell on both sides, as they were . fellow citizens and <lb/>
            kinsmen, had one tomb and monument in common. And <lb/>
            as you go on from thence and turn to the right you come <lb/>
            to the ruins of Tiryns. And the Argives dispossessed the <lb/>
            inhabitants of Tiryns, wishing to take them in as settlers to <lb/>
            aggrandize Argos. And they say the hero Tiryns, from <lb/>
            whom the city got its name, was the son of Argus the son <lb/>
            of Zeus. And the walls of the city, which are the only <lb/>
            ruins left, are the work of the Cyclopes made of rude stones, <lb/>
            each stone of so gigantic a size that the smallest of them <lb/>
            could hardly be moved by a pair of mules. And in ancient <lb/>
            times small stones were inserted so as to dovetail in with <lb/>
            the large stones. And as you go down to the sea, are the <lb/>
            chambers of the daughters of Prœtus. And when you <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 571. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            return to the high road you will come to Midea on the left. <lb/>
            They say that Electryon the father of Alcmena was king of <lb/>
            Midea. But now nothing is left of Midea but the site. And <lb/>
            on the direct road to Epidaurus is the village Lessa, and <lb/>
            there is a temple of Athene in it, and a wooden statue very <lb/>
            similar to that in the citadel at Larissa. And above Lessa <lb/>
            is the Mountain Arachnæum, which in old times in the days <lb/>
            of Inachus had the name of Sapyselaton. And there are <lb/>
            altars on it to Zeus and Hera. They sacrifice to these gods <lb/>
            here when there is a deficiency of rain.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND near Lessa is Epidaurus in Argolis, and before you <lb/>
            get to the town itself, you will come to the temple of <lb/>
            Æsculapius. I do not know who dwelt in this place before <lb/>
            Epidaurus came to it: nor could I learn from any of the <lb/>
            people of the neighbourhood anything about his descen­ <lb/>
            dants. But the last king they say before the Dorians came <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese was Pityreus, the descendant of Ion the <lb/>
            son of Xuthus. He they say gave up the land without <lb/>
            fighting for it to Deiphontes and the Argives : and retired <lb/>
            to Athens with his subjects and dwelt there, and Dei­ <lb/>
            phontes and the Argives who espoused his cause occupied <lb/>
            Epidauria. For there was a split among the Argives at the <lb/>
            death of Temenus, Deiphontes and Hyrnetho being hostile <lb/>
            to the sons of Temenus, and the army with them favouring <lb/>
            Deiphontes and Hyrnetho more than Cisus and his brothers. <lb/>
            Epidaurus, from whom the country got its name, was, as <lb/>
            the people of Elis say, the son of Pelops : but according to <lb/>
            the opinion of the Argives, and the poem of Hesiod called <lb/>
            The Great Eœæ, the father of Epidaurus was Argus the <lb/>
            son of Zeus. But the Epidaurians make Epidaurus the <lb/>
            son of Apollo. And the district was generally held sacred <lb/>
            to AEsculapius for the following reason. The Epidaurians <lb/>
            say that Phlegyas came to the Peloponnese on the pretext <lb/>
            of seeing the country, but really to spy out the population, <lb/>
            and see if the number of fighting men was large. For <lb/>
            Phlegyas was the greatest warrior of that day, and, who­ <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            ever he attacked, used to carry off their corn and fruit and <lb/>
            booty of all kinds. But when he came to the Peloponnese <lb/>
            his daughter followed him, who though her father knew <lb/>
            it not was with child by Apollo. And when she bore <lb/>
            her child on Epidaurian soil, she exposed it on the <lb/>
            mountain called in our day Titthion, but which was then <lb/>
            called Myrgion. And as he was exposed there one of the <lb/>
            she-goats feeding on the mountain gave him milk, and the <lb/>
            watch-dog of the flock guarded him. And Aresthanas, for <lb/>
            that was the name of the goat-herd, when he found the <lb/>
            number of the goats not tallying and that the do- was also <lb/>
            absent from the flock, went in search everywhere, and <lb/>
            when he saw the child desired to take him away, but when <lb/>
            he got near saw lightning shining from the child, and <lb/>
            thinking there was something divine in all this, as indeed <lb/>
            there was, he turned away. And it was forthwith noised <lb/>
            abroad about the lad both by land and sea that he could <lb/>
            heal sicknesses, and raise the dead. There is also another <lb/>
            tradition told of him, that Coronis, when pregnant with <lb/>
            Æsculapius, lay with Ischys the son of Elatus, and that <lb/>
            she was put to death by Artemis who thus punished her <lb/>
            unfaithfulness to Apollo, and when the funeral pyre was <lb/>
            already lighted Hermes is said to have plucked the child <lb/>
            from the flame. And a third tradition is as it seems to me <lb/>
            the least likely of all, which makes AEsculapius the son of <lb/>
            Arsinoe, the daughter of Leucippus. For when Apollo- <lb/>
            phanes the Arcadian went to Delphi and enquired of the <lb/>
            god, whether AEsculapius was the son of Arsinoe and a <lb/>
            citizen at Messene, Apollo answered from his oracle, " 0 <lb/>
            AEsculapius, that art born a great joy to all mortals, <lb/>
            whom lovely Coronis, the daughter of Phlegyas, bare to <lb/>
            me the child of love, at rocky Epidaurus." This oracular <lb/>
            response shows plainly that Æsculapius was not the son of <lb/>
            Arsinoe, but that Hesiod, or somebody that interpolated <lb/>
            Hesiod, inserted that legend to please the people of Mes­ <lb/>
            sene. And this too bears me out that Æsculapius was <lb/>
            born at Epidaurus, that his worship is derived from <lb/>
            thence. For the Athenians call the day on which they <lb/>
            worship AEsculapius Epidauria, and they say the god is <lb/>
            worshipped by them from Epidaurus ; and also Archias the <lb/>
            son of Aristæchmus, being healed in Epidauria of a con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            ulsion that seized him when he was hunting near Pin­ <lb/>
            asus, introduced the worship of the god at Pergamum. <lb/>
            md from the people of Pergamum it passed in our time <lb/>
            o the people of Smyrna. And at Balagræ amongst the <lb/>
            !yrenaeans the Epidaurian AEsculapius is called Doctor. <lb/>
            nd from the Cyrenæans AEsculapius got worshipped in <lb/>
            iabene among the Cretans. And there is this difference <lb/>
            etween the Cyrenæan and Epidaurian customs of wor­ <lb/>
            hipping ,Esculapius, that the former sacrifice goats, <lb/>
            rhich is not customary with the latter. And I find that <lb/>
            EscuJapius was considered as a god from the beginning, <lb/>
            nd not merely as he got fame as time went on, from other <lb/>
            roofs, and the testimony of Homer in what Agamemnon <lb/>
            lys about Machaon, <lb/>
            " Talthybius, call here as quickly as possible Machaon the mortal, <lb/>
            the son of Æsculapius,” <lb/>
            s if he said the man the son of the god.1</p>

          <p>r <lb/>
            HE sacred grove of AEsculapius is walled in on all <lb/>
            sides: nor do any deaths or births take place in the <lb/>
            recincts of the god, just as is the case at the island <lb/>
            )elos. And the sacrifices, whether any native of Epi­ <lb/>
            aurus or stranger be the sacrificer, they consume in the <lb/>
            recincts. The same I know happens at Titane. And <lb/>
            he statue of Æsculapius is in size half that of Olympian <lb/>
            eus at Athens, and is made of ivory and gold: and the <lb/>
            iscription shows that it was by the Parian Thrasymede <lb/>
            he son of Arignotus. The god sits on a seat holding a <lb/>
            taff in one hand, and the other hand he has on a <lb/>
            ragon's head, and a dog is seated at his feet. And on <lb/>
            he seat are represented the actions of Argive heroes, as <lb/>
            Bellerophon killing the Chimæra, and Perseus with the <note type="footnote">1 Iliad, iv. 193, 194. Is Pausanias nodding here ? </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            head of Medusa. And beyond the temple is a sleeping- <lb/>
            place for suppliants. And a round building has been <lb/>
            built near well worth seeing, of white stone, called the <lb/>
            Rotunda. And in it there is a painting by Pausias of Cupid <lb/>
            throwing away his bow and arrows and taking up a lyrt <lb/>
            instead. There is also here a painting of Drunkenness, alst <lb/>
            by Pausias, drinking out of a glass bowl. You may see in <lb/>
            the painting the glass bowl and in it a woman's face re <lb/>
            flected. And six pillars to this day stand in the precincts <lb/>
            but in old time there were more. On these are recorded <lb/>
            the names of men and women healed by Æsculapius, and <lb/>
            the complaint from which each suffered, and how they wer <lb/>
            cured, written in Doric. And apart from the rest is a <lb/>
            ancient pillar, which states that Hippolytus offered 2 <lb/>
            horses to the god. And the people of Aricia have a trad! <lb/>
            tion corresponding to the inscription on this pillar, that <lb/>
            when Hippolytus died in consequence of the imprecation <lb/>
            of Theseus, Æsculapius restored him to life again: and <lb/>
            when he came to life again, he refused to pardon his <lb/>
            father, and disregarding his entreaties went into Italy to <lb/>
            the people of Aricia, and there became king and built a <lb/>
            temple to Artemis, where in my time the prize for victory <lb/>
            in single combat was to become the priest of the goddess.' <lb/>
            But the contest was not for freemen, but for slaves who <lb/>
            had run away from their masters. And the Epidaurians <lb/>
            have a theatre in their temple, especially well worth seeing <lb/>
            in my opinion: for the Roman theatres beat all in the world <lb/>
            in magnificence, and for size the Arcadian theatre at Mega­ <lb/>
            lopolis carries the day: but for beauty of proportion what <lb/>
            architect could compete with Polycletus ? And Polycletus <lb/>
            it was that designed this theatre and round building. <lb/>
            And within the grove there is a temple of Artemis, and a <lb/>
            statue of Epione, and a temple of Aphrodite and Themis <lb/>
            and a stadium, as generally among the Greeks, consisting <lb/>
            of a mound of earth, and a fountain well worth seeing <lb/>
            for its roof and other decoration. And Antonine the <lb/>
            Senator constructed in our days a bath of Æsculapius, and <lb/>
            a temple of the gods they call the Bountiful Gods. He <lb/>
            built also a temple for Hygiea and for Æsculapius and <lb/>
            for Apollo under the title of Egyptian gods. He re­ <lb/>
            stored also Cotys' porch for the roof had fallen in and it <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            had all come to ruin as it had been built of unbaked brick. <lb/>
            And the Epidaurians who lived near the temple were espe­ <lb/>
            cially unfortunate, for their women might not bear children <lb/>
            under a roof but only in the open air. But Antonine set <lb/>
            this right and erected a building where it was lawful <lb/>
            both to die and bear children. And there are two moun­ <lb/>
            tains above the grove, one called Titthion and the other <lb/>
            Cynortion, and on the latter a temple to Maleatian Apollo. <lb/>
            The building is ancient, but everything else in connection <lb/>
            with the temple, as the reservoir e.g. in which rainwater <lb/>
            is stored up, was put there by Antonine for the benefit of <lb/>
            the Epidaurians.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OW all kinds of dragons, and especially those which <lb/>
            incline to tawny in colour, are considered sacred <lb/>
            to Æsculapius, and are tame, and the Epidaurian country <lb/>
            alone breeds them. I find similar phenomena in other <lb/>
            countries. Thus Libya alone breeds land crocodiles no <lb/>
            smaller than two cubits, and from India alone come parrots <lb/>
            and other birds. For the great snakes in size as big as 30 <lb/>
            cubits, which are produced in India and in Libya, the Epi­ <lb/>
            daurians say are not dragons but another species altogether. <lb/>
            And as you ascend the mountain called Coryphon there is <lb/>
            an olive tree called Twisted, its having been so moulded by <lb/>
            Hercules' hand is the origin of the name. I can hardly <lb/>
            believe that he meant this for a boundary for the Asinæi in <lb/>
            Argolis, forvas the country on both sides lies waste one <lb/>
            could find no clear boundary here. And on the top of the <lb/>
            mountain Coryphon is the temple of Artemis, which Tele­ <lb/>
            silla has mentioned in a poem. And as you go down to <lb/>
            the city of the Epidaurians is a place, called Hyrnethium, <lb/>
            full of wild olives that grow there. I shall record the <lb/>
            Epidaurian tradition and the probable truth. Cisus and <lb/>
            the other sons of Temenus knew that they would greatly <lb/>
            vex Deiphontes, if they could by any means get Hyrnetho <lb/>
            from him. Cerynes and Phalces therefore went alone <lb/>
            to Epidaurus: for Argæus the youngest did not approve <note type="footnote">L</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            of their plot. And they leaving their travelling carriage <lb/>
            near the walls sent a messenger to their sister, wishing <lb/>
            they said to have a conversation with her. And when <lb/>
            she complied with their invitation, the young men at <lb/>
            once brought various charges against Deiphontes, and <lb/>
            begged her earnestly to return to Argos, making various <lb/>
            promises, and that they would give her in marriage to a <lb/>
            man in every respect better than Deiphontes, to the ruler <lb/>
            of a larger population and a more fertile country. And <lb/>
            Hyrnetho vexed at their words gave them back as good as <lb/>
            they brought, and said that Deiphontes was acceptable to <lb/>
            her as a husband, and that to be Temenus' son in law was <lb/>
            not to be despised, but they ought to be called rather <lb/>
            Temenus' murderers than his sons. And they made no <lb/>
            reply to her, but took hold of her, put her into the travel­ <lb/>
            ling carriage, and drove off. And an Epidaurian took the <lb/>
            news to Deiphontes that Cerynes and Phalces had gone off <lb/>
            with Hyrnetho against her will. And he came to the rescue <lb/>
            with all speed, and the Epidaurians when they heard what <lb/>
            the matter was came to the rescue with him. And Dei­ <lb/>
            phontes when he came up with Cerynes shot at him and <lb/>
            killed him with an arrow, but as Phalces was close to <lb/>
            Hyrnetho he did not dare to shoot at him, lest he should <lb/>
            miss him and kill her, but he closed with him and endea­ <lb/>
            voured to get her away. But Phalces resisting and pulling <lb/>
            Hyrnetho too violently killed her, for she was pregnant. <lb/>
            And he perceiving what he had done to his sister, drove <lb/>
            the travelling carriage at full speed, hastening to be off <lb/>
            before the Epidaurians could come up: and Deiphontes <lb/>
            with his sons (for he had had by Hyrnetho Antimenes and <lb/>
            Xanthippus and Argeus, and one daughter Orsobia, who <lb/>
            afterwards married Pamphylus the son of Ægimius), took <lb/>
            the dead body of Hyrnetho and conveyed it to the place <lb/>
            which is now called Hyrnethium. And they built a <lb/>
            chapel to her memory and paid her other honours, and <lb/>
            with regard to the olive trees that grow in her grove, or <lb/>
            any other trees there, it is an established custom that <lb/>
            no one should break pieces of them off and carry them <lb/>
            away, nor use them for any purpose, but leave them intact <lb/>
            as sacred to Hyrnetho. And not far from the city is the <lb/>
            sepulchre of Melissa, who was the wife of Periander the <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            son of Cypselus, and the sepulchre of Proclees the father <lb/>
            of Melissa. And he was king at Epidaurus, as his son in <lb/>
            law Periander was at Corinth.</p>

          <p>E <lb/>
            PIDAURUS has the following things most worthy of <lb/>
            record. There is a temple of AEsculapius, and statues <lb/>
            of Æsculapius and Epione, who they say was his wife. <lb/>
            These are in the open air, and are of Parian marble. And <lb/>
            there are temples of Dionysus and Artemis, the latter as a <lb/>
            Huntress. There is a temple also built to Aphrodite : and <lb/>
            near the harbour on the cliff jutting out into the sea is they <lb/>
            say one of Hera. And the Athene in the citadel, a wooden <lb/>
            statue well worth seeing, they call Cissæan Athene.</p>
          <p>The Æginetans inhabit the island opposite Epidauria. <lb/>
            And they say there were no inhabitants there originally, <lb/>
            but Zeus having taken Ægina the daughter of Asopus <lb/>
            there to that desert island, it was called Ægina after her <lb/>
            instead of its old name CEnone, and when Æacus was <lb/>
            grown up he asked of Zeus for settlers, and then they say <lb/>
            that Zeus produced men from the soil. And they can tell <lb/>
            of no king reigning there but Æacus, for we know of none <lb/>
            of the sons of Æacus continuing there, for Peleus and Tela. <lb/>
            mon had to flee for the murder of Phocus, and the sons of <lb/>
            Phocus again dwelt near Parnassus in what is now called <lb/>
            Phocis. And the name Phocis was given to the district <lb/>
            when Phocus of the family of Ornytion first came to it. <lb/>
            In the days of this Phocus the country near Tithorea and <lb/>
            Parnassus was called Phocis : but in the days of Æacus <lb/>
            the name Phocis included everybody from Minyæ near <lb/>
            Orchomenus to Scarphea in Locris. And Peleus' sons <lb/>
            were kings in Epirus, and of Telamon's sons the family of <lb/>
            Ajax was rather obscure (as he lived in a retired way <lb/>
            privately), except Miltiades, who led the Athenians at <lb/>
            Marathon, and his son Cimon, both of whom were ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly illustrious. And the descendants of Teucer were <lb/>
            kings of Cyprus down to Evagoras. And according to the <lb/>
            poet Asius Phocus' sons were Panopeus and Crisus: and <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            the son of Panopeus was Epeus, who according to Homer <lb/>
            was the contriver of the wooden horse, and the grandson of <lb/>
            Crisus was Pylades, the son of Strophius, the son of Crisus <lb/>
            by Anaxibia the daughter of Agamemnon. Such is the <lb/>
            pedigree of the so-called Æacidæ, but they branched off <lb/>
            from the beginning into other directions. And in after <lb/>
            time a part of the Argives that had occupied Epidaurus <lb/>
            with Deiphontes crossed over to Ægina, and, mixing <lb/>
            among the old settlers at Ægina, introduced into the island <lb/>
            the Doric language and manners. And the Æginetans <lb/>
            became a great power, so that they were even a greater <lb/>
            naval power than the Athenians, and in the Persian War <lb/>
            furnished the greatest number of vessels next to the <lb/>
            Athenians, but their prosperity did not last, for they were <lb/>
            turned out of Ægina by the Athenians, and went and <lb/>
            dwelt at Thyrea in Argolis, which the Lacedaemonians gave <lb/>
            them. They recovered Ægina indeed, when the Athenian <lb/>
            triremes were captured at the Hellespont, but never re­ <lb/>
            gained their former wealth and power. Of all the Greek <lb/>
            islands Ægina is the most difficult of access. For there <lb/>
            are rocks under the sea all round it, and sunken reefs. <lb/>
            And they say that Æacus contrived this on purpose from <lb/>
            fear of pirates, and that he might not be exposed to <lb/>
            enemies. And near the chief harbour is a temple of <lb/>
            Aphrodite, and in the most conspicuous part of the city <lb/>
            what is called the Hall of Æacus, a square court of <lb/>
            white stone: at the entrance of which are statues of the <lb/>
            envoys who were sent by the Greeks to Æacus. All <lb/>
            give the same account of this as the Æginetans. A <lb/>
            drought for some time afflicted Greece, and there was no <lb/>
            rain either beyond the Isthmus or in the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            until they sent messengers to Delphi, to enquire the cause, <lb/>
            and at the same time to beg to be rid of the evil. The <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess told them to propitiate Zeus, and that, <lb/>
            if he was to listen to them, Æacus must be the suppliant. <lb/>
            Accordingly they sent envoys from every city to beg <lb/>
            Æacus to do so. And he offered sacrifices and prayers to <lb/>
            Pan-Hellenian Zeus and caused rain to come on the earth: <lb/>
            and the Æginetans made these effigies of all the envoys <lb/>
            that had come to him. And within the precincts are some <lb/>
            olive trees planted a long time ago, and an altar not much <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            higher than the ground, which it is secretly whispered is <lb/>
            a memorialof Æacus. And near the Hall of Æacus is <lb/>
            the tomb of Phocus, a mound of earth with a base in the <lb/>
            shape of a circle, and on it is a rough stone : and when <lb/>
            Telamon and Peleus invited Phocus to the contest of the <lb/>
            pentathlum, and it was Peleus' turn to throw the stone, <lb/>
            which served them for a quoit, he purposely threw it at <lb/>
            Phocus and hit him. And in this they gratified their mother, <lb/>
            for they were the sons of Endeis the daughter of Sciron, <lb/>
            and Phocus was the son of her sister Thetis, if the Greeks <lb/>
            speak the truth. And Pylades appears to me for this <lb/>
            reason, and not merely in friendship to Orestes, to have <lb/>
            contrived the death of Neoptolemus. But when Phocus <lb/>
            was struck by the quoit and fell down dead, then the sons <lb/>
            of Endeis got on board ship and fled. And Telamon later <lb/>
            on sent a messenger, and endeavoured to clear himself of <lb/>
            having contrived the death of Phocus. But Æacus would <lb/>
            not let him land on the island, but bade him if he liked <lb/>
            pile up a mole in the sea and make his defence there. <lb/>
            Accordingly he sailed to the harbour called Secret, and by <lb/>
            night produced a mole, which remains to this day. And <lb/>
            being pronounced guilty of the death of Phocus he sailed <lb/>
            back again to Salamis. And not far from this harbour <lb/>
            Secret is a theatre well worth seeing, in size and workman­ <lb/>
            ship very similar to the one at Epidaurus. And behind it <lb/>
            is built one side of a stadium, upholding the theatre and <lb/>
            serving as a prop for it.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND near one another are temples of Apollo, and Arte­ <lb/>
            . mis, and Dionysus. The wooden statue of Apollo is <lb/>
            naked and of native art, but Artemis and Dionysus are <lb/>
            draped, and Dionysus is represented with a beard. But <lb/>
            the temple of Æsculapius is on the other side and not here, <lb/>
            and the statue of stone, seated. And of all the gods the <lb/>
            people of Ægina honour Hecate most, and celebrate her <lb/>
            rites annually, saying that Orpheus the Thracian intro­ <lb/>
            duced those rites. And within the precincts is a temple. <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            containing a wooden statue of Hecate by Myron, with only <lb/>
            one head and one body. Alcamenes as it seems to me was <lb/>
            the first who made the statue of Hecate with three heads and <lb/>
            three bodies which the Athenians call Hecate Epipurgidia : <lb/>
            it stands near the temple of Wingless Victory. And in <lb/>
            Ægina as you go to the mountain of Panhellenian Zeus is <lb/>
            the temple of Aphæa, about whom Pindar wrote an ode for <lb/>
            the Æginetans. And the Cretans say, (for her worship <lb/>
            is indigenous among them too), that Eubulus was the son <lb/>
            of that Carmanor who purged Apollo of the murder of <lb/>
            Python, and that Britomartis was the daughter of Zeus <lb/>
            by Carme the daughter of Eubulus: and that she rejoiced <lb/>
            in races and hunting, and was a very great friend of <lb/>
            Artemis. And fleeing from Minos, who was enamoured of <lb/>
            her, she threw herself into some nets set for catching <lb/>
            fish. Artemis made her a goddess, and she is worshipped <lb/>
            not only by the Cretans but also by the Æginetans, who <lb/>
            say that Britomartis was seen in their island. And she is <lb/>
            called Aphæa in Ægina, but Dictynna in Crete. And the <lb/>
            mountain Pan-hellenium has nothing of note but the <lb/>
            temple of Zeus, which they say Æacus erected. As to <lb/>
            what concerns Auxesias and Lamias, how there was no <lb/>
            rain at Epidaurus, and how after receiving olive trees from <lb/>
            Athens they made wooden statues according to the bid­ <lb/>
            ding of the oracle, and how the Epidaurians did not pay <lb/>
            to the Athenians their charge for the Æginetans having <lb/>
            these statues, and how the Athenians who crossed over to <lb/>
            Ægina to exact payment perished, all this has been told <lb/>
            accurately and circumstantially by Herodotus. I do not <lb/>
            therefore care to write again what has been so well told be­ <lb/>
            fore, but this much I may say that I have seen the statues <lb/>
            and sacrificed to them as they are accustomed to sacrifice at <lb/>
            Eleusis.</p>
          <p>Let so much suffice for Ægina, and Æacus and his ex­ <lb/>
            ploits. And next to Epidauria come the people of Trœzen, <lb/>
            who are proud of their country if any people are. And <lb/>
            they say that Orus was a native of their country. To me <lb/>
            however the name Orus seems decidedly Egyptian and not <lb/>
            at all Greek. However they say he was their king, and <lb/>
            that the country was called Oræa after him, and Althepus <lb/>
            the son of Poseidon by Lets the daughter of Orus, suc­ <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            ceeding to Orus, called the country Althepia. When he <lb/>
            was king they say that Athene and Poseidon had a dispute <lb/>
            about the country, and resolved to hold it in common, <lb/>
            for so Zeus ordered them to do. And so they worship <lb/>
            Athene under the names Polias and Sthenias, and Poseidon <lb/>
            under the name of king. And so their ancient coins have <lb/>
            on them a trident and the head of Athene. And next to <lb/>
            Althepus Saron was king, who they say built the temple <lb/>
            to Saronian Artemis near the sea where it was muddy <lb/>
            on the surface, insomuch that it was called the Phœbæan <lb/>
            marsh. And it chanced that Saron, who was very fond <lb/>
            of hunting, was pursuing a stag and followed it to the <lb/>
            sea as it fled. And it swam further and further from the <lb/>
            land, and Saron continued to follow it up, till in his im­ <lb/>
            petuosity he got out to open sea, and, as he was by now <lb/>
            tired, and the waves were too much for him, he was <lb/>
            drowned. And his dead body was cast on shore on the <lb/>
            Phcebaean marsh, and they buried him in the grove of <lb/>
            Artemis, and they call the sea here after him the Saronian <lb/>
            marsh instead of the Phœbæan. The names of the kings <lb/>
            that followed him they do not know till Hyperes and <lb/>
            Anthas, who they say were the sons of Poseidon by <lb/>
            Alcyone the daughter of Atlas, and built the cities in that <lb/>
            country called Hyperea and Anthea. And Aetius the son <lb/>
            of Anthas, succeeding his father and uncle in the king­ <lb/>
            dom, called one of these two cities Poseidonias. And <lb/>
            when Trcezen and Pittheus joined Aetius, there were three <lb/>
            kings instead of one, and the sons of Pelops were the <lb/>
            stronger. And this proves it. After the death of Trœzen <lb/>
            Pittheus joined together Hyperea and Anthea, and com­ <lb/>
            bined the inhabitants into one city, which he called Trcezen <lb/>
            from the name of his brother. And many years afterwards <lb/>
            the descendants of Aetius, the son of Anthas, were sent on a <lb/>
            colony from Trœzen, and colonized Halicarnassus in Caria, <lb/>
            and Myndus. And the sons of Trœzen, Anaphlystus and <lb/>
            Sphettus, migrated to Attica, and gav etheir names to two <lb/>
            townships. And as regards These-as the son of Pittheus' <lb/>
            daughter I do not write to people who know all the history. <lb/>
            But I must narrate thus much. When the Heraclidæ re­ <lb/>
            turned to the Peloponnese the people of Trcezen received as <lb/>
            colonists the Dorians from Argos, having been formerly <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            subject to the Argives. And Homer in his catalogue says <lb/>
            that they were under the rule of Diomede. Diomede at <lb/>
            least and Euryalus the son of Mecisteus, who were Regents <lb/>
            for Cyanippus the son of Ægialeus, led the Argives to <lb/>
            Troy. But Sthenelus, as I have shown before, was of more <lb/>
            illustrious birth, being of the family of the Anaxagoridæ, <lb/>
            and the kingdom of the Argives was more his by right. <lb/>
            Such are all the historical details about Trcezen, except a <lb/>
            list of the cities which are said to have been colonized <lb/>
            from Trcezen. I will now describe the contents of the <lb/>
            temples and other notable things in Trcezen.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I <lb/>
            N the market place is a temple, and statues, of Artemis <lb/>
            the Saviour. And it is said that Theseus built it and <lb/>
            called her Saviour, when he returned from Crete after <lb/>
            having killed Asterion the son of Minos. This seems to <lb/>
            me to have been the most notable of all his exploits, not <lb/>
            so much because Asterion excelled in bravery all who were <lb/>
            killed by Theseus, but because he escaped the hidden <lb/>
            snares of the labyrinth, and all this makes it clear that <lb/>
            Theseus and his companions were saved by providence. In <lb/>
            this temple are altars of the gods said to rule in the lower <lb/>
            world: and they say that Semele was brought here from <lb/>
            Hades by Dionysus, and that Hercules brought Cerberus <lb/>
            here from Hades. But I do not think that Semele died <lb/>
            at all, as she was the wife of Zeus: and as to Cerberus I <lb/>
            shall elsewhere tell what I think.</p>
          <p>And behind the temple there is a monument of Pittheus, <lb/>
            and three seats are on it of white stone : and Pittheus and <lb/>
            two others with him are said to be giving sentence on these <lb/>
            seats. And at no great distance is a temple of the Muses, <lb/>
            built they say by Ardalus, the son of Hephæstus: who they <lb/>
            think discovered the use of the flute, and so they call the <lb/>
            Muses Ardalian after him.. Here they say Pittheus taught <lb/>
            the art of language, and I have' myself read a book <lb/>
            written by Pittheus, that was given me by an Epidau­ <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            rian. And not far from the temple of the Muses is an <lb/>
            ancient altar, erected as they say also by Ardalus. And <lb/>
            they sacrifice on it to the Muses and Sleep, saying that <lb/>
            Sleep is the god most friendly to the Muses. And near <lb/>
            the theatre is a temple of Lycean Artemis, which Hippolytus <lb/>
            built. Why the goddess was so called I could not find <lb/>
            from the antiquarians, but it seems to me it was either be­ <lb/>
            cause Hippolytus drove out the wolves that ravaged <lb/>
            Trœzen and the neighbourhood, or that it was a title of <lb/>
            Artemis among the Amazons, of whom his mother was <lb/>
            one. Or there may be some other explanation which I <lb/>
            do not know. And the stone in front of the temple called <lb/>
            the holy stone was they say the stone on which formerly <lb/>
            the 9 men of Troezen cleared Orestes of the murder of <lb/>
            his mother. And not far from the temple of Lycean <lb/>
            Artemis are altars at no great distance from one another. <lb/>
            The first of them is one of Dionysus, called Saviour in <lb/>
            accordance with some oracle, and the second is called <lb/>
            Themidon, Pittheus dedicated it they say. And they very <lb/>
            likely built an altar to the Sun the Liberator when they <lb/>
            escaped the slavery of Xerxes and the Persians. And they <lb/>
            say Pittheus built the temple of Thearian Apollo, which is <lb/>
            the oldest of all I know. There is indeed an old temple <lb/>
            of Athene among the Phocians in Ionia, which Harpagus <lb/>
            the Persian burnt, old also is the temple of Pythian Apollo <lb/>
            among the Samians, but far later are both than this one at <lb/>
            Troezen. And the statue of the god is still to be seen, the <lb/>
            votive offering of Auliscus, and the design of Hermon of <lb/>
            Trœzen, who also made wooden statues of the Dioscuri. <lb/>
            And there are also in the porch in the market-place stone <lb/>
            statues of the women and children whom the Athenians <lb/>
            committed to the charge of the people of Trœzen, when <lb/>
            they resolved to leave Athens, and not to encounter the <lb/>
            attack of the Mede with a land force. And they are said <lb/>
            to have put here statues not of all those women, for they <lb/>
            are not many here, but only of those who were especially <lb/>
            remarkable for merit. And there is a building in front of <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo, called the tent of Orestes. For <lb/>
            before he was cleared of his mother's blood, none of the <lb/>
            people of Trœzen would receive him in their houses : but <lb/>
            they put him here and gradually cleared him and fed him <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            here, till the expiatory rites were completed. And to this <lb/>
            day the descendants of those that cleared him feast here on <lb/>
            appointed days. And the expiations having been buried <lb/>
            not far from this tent, they say a laurel sprang up from <lb/>
            them, which is still to be seen in front of the tent. And <lb/>
            they say that Orestes among other purgations used water <lb/>
            from Hippocrene. For the people of Trœzen have a well <lb/>
            called Hippocrene, and the tradition about it is the same <lb/>
            as the Boeotian tradition. For they too say that water <lb/>
            sprang up from the ground when Pegasus touched the <lb/>
            ground with his hoof, and that Bellerophon came to <lb/>
            Trœzen to ask for Æthra as his wife from Pittheus, but it <lb/>
            so chanced that before the marriage came off he fled from <lb/>
            Corinth.</p>
          <p>And there is here a statue of Hermes called Polygius, <lb/>
            and they say Hercules offered his club to it, and the club <lb/>
            was of wild olive, and, (believe it who will,) sprouted in <lb/>
            the earth and grew, and is now a tree, for Hercules they <lb/>
            say discovered the wild olive in the Saronian marsh and <lb/>
            cut a club of it. There is also a temple of Zeus Soter, <lb/>
            built they say by King Aetius the son of Anthas. And <lb/>
            they call their river Chrysorrhoe (golden stream), for when <lb/>
            there was a drought in the land and no rain for nine <lb/>
            years, and all other water they say dried up, this Chry­ <lb/>
            sorrhoe continued to flow as'usual.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Hippolytus the son of Theseus has precincts and <lb/>
            a temple in them and ancient statue. Diomede they <lb/>
            say erected all these, and was the first to sacrifice to <lb/>
            Hippolytus: and the people of Trœzen have a priest of <lb/>
            Hippolytus who serves for life, and they have yearly <lb/>
            sacrifices, and the following custom. Every maiden cuts <lb/>
            off a lock of her hair before marriage, and takes it and <lb/>
            offers it at this temple. And they don't represent Hip­ <lb/>
            polytus as having died through being torn in pieces by his <lb/>
            horses, nor do they point out his tomb if they know it: <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            but they try to make out that Hippolytus is call <unclear>with</unclear> offer- <lb/>
            heaven the Charioteer, and has this honour from there 'tis said <lb/>
            And within his precincts is the temple of Apollo <unclear>Accordingly</unclear> <lb/>
            terius, the votive offering of Diomede when he escape<unclear/> and called <lb/>
            storm which fell on the Greeks as they were returning <unclear>sed</unclear> the <lb/>
            Ilium : they say also that Diomede first established th <unclear>efore</unclear> <lb/>
            Pythian games in honour of Apollo. And as to Lamia <lb/>
            and Auxesia (for they also have their share of honour) <lb/>
            the people of Trœzen do not give the same account as the <lb/>
            Epidaurians and Æginetans, but say that they were virgins <lb/>
            who came from Crete, and in a general commotion in the <lb/>
            city were stoned by one of the rival factions, and they <lb/>
            have a festival to them called Stonethrowing. And in <lb/>
            another part of the precincts is what is called Hippolytns' <lb/>
            racecourse, and overlooking it a temple of Peeping Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite : where, when Hippolytus was training, Phædra would <lb/>
            gaze at him in her love. Here too grows the myrtle with <lb/>
            the leaves pricked, as I described before: for when Phaedra <lb/>
            was in despair and found no relief for her love-pains, she <lb/>
            wreaked her agony on the leaves of the myrtle. And <lb/>
            Phædra's tomb is here, not very far from the monument of <lb/>
            Hippolytus, or that myrtle tree. And there is a statue of <lb/>
            Æsculapius by Timotheus, but the people of Trcezen say it <lb/>
            is not Æsculapius but Hippolytus. I saw also the house of <lb/>
            Hippolytus, and in front of it is what is called the Well of <lb/>
            Hercules, the water (as the people of Trcezen say) which <lb/>
            Hercules discovered. And in the citadel there is a temple <lb/>
            of Athene Sthenias, the wooden statue of the goddess is <lb/>
            by Canon of Ægina; who was the pupil of Tectæus and <lb/>
            Angelion, who designed the statue of Apollo at Delos; and <lb/>
            they were pupils of Dipœnus and Scyllis. And as you go <lb/>
            down from thence you come to the temple of Pan the <lb/>
            Deliverer, for he shewed dreams to the chief people of the <lb/>
            Trœzenians which brought about deliverance from the <lb/>
            plague, which pressed so hard on the Athenians. And in <lb/>
            the environs of Trœzen you will see a temple of Isis, and <lb/>
            above it one of Aphrodite of the Height: the temple <lb/>
            the Halicarnassians built for Trœzen their mother city; <lb/>
            but the statue of Isis was a votive offering of the people of <lb/>
            Trœzen.</p>
          <p>As you go along the mountains to Hermione you see the <pb n="156"/>
            <unclear/><lb/>
            <lb/>
            of the river Hyllicus, which was originally ca<unclear/><lb/>
            here, till the exp, and a rock called Theseus' rock, which used<unclear/><lb/>

            not far frand under it the shoes and sword rock of Ægeus. And n <unclear/><lb/>
            them, wanis rock is the temple of Bridal Aphrodite, which w<unclear/><lb/>
            the built by Theseus when he married Helen.And outside t<lb/>
             walls is a temple of Fruit-giving Poseidon: for they s<lb/>
            that Poseidon in wrath threatened to make their la<unclear/><lb/>
            fruitless, by casting brine on the seeds and roots of the <lb/>
            plants, till mollified by their sacrifices and prayers he se<unclear/><lb/>
            brine on their land no longer And above the temple <lb/>
            Poseidon is Law-giving Demeter, which was built the<lb/>
            say by Althepus. And as you descend to the harbou<unclear/><lb/>
            near what is called Celenderis, is the place which they cal<lb/>
            Natal-place, because they say Theseus was born there.And <lb/>
            in front of this place is a temple of Ares on the spot where <lb/>
            Theseus conquered the Amazons in battle: they must have <lb/>
            been some of that band who fought in Attica with Theseus <lb/>
            and the Athenians. And as you go towards the Psiphæan <lb/>
            sea there is a wild olive tree called twisted Rhachus. The<lb/>
            people of Trœzen give that name to every kind of olive<lb/>
            that bears no fruit, whether its general name is қ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ότινος</foreign>,<lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φυλίας</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">έλαις</foreign>. And they call it twisted because,<lb/>
            the reins catching in it, the chariot of Hippolytus got over-<lb/>
            turned. And at no great distance from this is the temple<lb/>
            of Saronian Artemis, about which I have already given an<lb/>
            account. But this much more shall be stated, that they<lb/>
            keep an annual feast called Saronia to Artemis.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            the islands near Trœzen one is so close to the main­ <lb/>
            land, that you can wade over to it at low water. It <lb/>
            was called Sphæria in former days, and Sacred for the <lb/>
            following reason. It contains the tomb of Sphærus, who <lb/>
            they say was the charioteer of Pelops. <lb/>
            He had a dream from <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            Athene, that Æthra crossed over into the island with offer­ <lb/>
            ings for the dead, and when she crossed over there 'tis said <lb/>
            that Poseidon had an intrigue with her. Accordingly <lb/>
            Æthra built a temple here to Injurious Athene, and called <lb/>
            the island Sacred instead of Sphæria : she also imposed the <lb/>
            custom on the maidens of Trcezen that they should before <lb/>
            marriage dedicate their maiden-girdle to Injurious Athene. <lb/>
            And they say the island Calaurea was in ancient days <lb/>
            sacred to Apollo, when Delphi belonged to Poseidon, it is <lb/>
            also said that they exchanged these places with one another. <lb/>
            And they produce in support of their statement the follow­ <lb/>
            ing oracle, <lb/>
            It is all one whether yon dwell at Delos or Calaurea, <lb/>
            At sacred Pytho or the wind-swept Tænarus." <lb/>
            There is also at Calaurea a sacred temple to Poseidon, and <lb/>
            the priestess is a maiden till the period for marriage. And <lb/>
            within the precincts is the tomb of Demosthenes. Fortune <lb/>
            seems to have shown especial malignity to Demosthenes <lb/>
            as earlier to Homer, since Homer was not only blind but <lb/>
            overwhelmed by such poverty that he was a strolling beggar <lb/>
            on every soil, and Demosthenes in his old age had to taste <lb/>
            the bitterness of exile, and came to a violent end. Much <lb/>
            has been said about Demosthenes by others and by himself, <lb/>
            by which it is clear that he had no share in the money <lb/>
            which Harpalus brought from Asia, but what was said <lb/>
            afterwards I will relate. Harpalus, after having fled from <lb/>
            Athens and crossed over with the fleet to Crete, was mur­ <lb/>
            dered not long afterwards by some of his attendant slaves : <lb/>
            but some say he was treacherously murdered by the Mace­ <lb/>
            donian Pausanias. And the dispenser of the money fled <lb/>
            to Rhodes, and was arrested by Philoxenus the Macedonian, <lb/>
            who had also demanded the extradition of Harpalus from <lb/>
            the Athenians. And getting this lad he cross-questioned <lb/>
            him, until he obtained full intelligence of those who had <lb/>
            had any money from Harpalus: and when he ascertained <lb/>
            their names he sent letters to Athens. Although in those <lb/>
            letters he enumerated the names of those who had had any <lb/>
            money from Harpalus, and the precise sum which each of <lb/>
            them had, he made no mention whatever of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            though he was most bitterly hated by Alexander, and <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            although Philoxenus himself was privately his enemy. <lb/>
            Demosthenes had honours paid to him in other parts of <lb/>
            Greece also as well as by the inhabitants of Calaurea.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I <lb/>
            N the Trcezenian district there is an isthmus jutting <lb/>
            out some way into the sea, and on it has been built a <lb/>
            small town near the sea called Methana. And there is a <lb/>
            temple of Isis there, and a statue in the marketplace of <lb/>
            Hermes, and another of Hercules. And at the distance <lb/>
            of about 30 stades from this small town are some warm <lb/>
            baths. And they say that water first appeared there when <lb/>
            Antigonus, the son of Demetrius, was King of the Mace­ <lb/>
            donians, and water did not first appear, but fire bubbled up <lb/>
            from the ground, and when this burnt itself out then water <lb/>
            began to flow, which bubbles up even to this day warm and <lb/>
            very salt. And if one bathes here the water is not cold <lb/>
            near the shore, but if you go well out to sea swimming is <lb/>
            dangerous, for there are many kinds of sea-monsters and <lb/>
            especially sea dogs. But the most wonderful thing at <lb/>
            Methana I will now record. The South West Wind when <lb/>
            the vines are growing blows upon them from the Saronic <lb/>
            Gulf, and scorches them up. And when the wind is still <lb/>
            sweeping down on them, two men take a cock with white <lb/>
            feathers only, and tear it in half, and run round the vines in <lb/>
            different directions, each with half the cock, and when they <lb/>
            come back to the place where they started, they bury it <lb/>
            there. This is their invention and contrivance against the <lb/>
            South West Wind. The little islands, which lie just off the <lb/>
            coast, 9 in number, they call the islands of Pelops, and <lb/>
            they say when it rains rain never comes on one of them. <lb/>
            Whether this is so I do not know, but the people about <lb/>
            Methana say so, and I have heard of people trying to avert <lb/>
            hail by sacrifices and incantations. Methana then is an <lb/>
            Isthmus in the Peloponnese: and inside the Trœzenian <lb/>
            Isthmus is the neighbouring town of Hermione. And the <lb/>
            people of Hermione say that the founder of the old city <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            was one Hermion the son of Europs. And this Europs, <lb/>
            who was certainly the son of Phoroneus, was said by Hero­ <lb/>
            phanes of Trœzen to be illegitimate, on the ground that the <lb/>
            kingdom of Argos would not have come to Argus the <lb/>
            daughter's son of Phoroneus, had Phoroneus had a legiti­ <lb/>
            mate son. But, even if Europs was legitimate and died <lb/>
            before Phoroneus, I know very well that a son of his would <lb/>
            not have been considered equal to Niobe's son, who was <lb/>
            reckoned to be the son of Zeus. And afterwards Dorians <lb/>
            from Argos colonized Hermione, but amicably I think, for <lb/>
            had there been a war it would have been mentioned by the <lb/>
            Argives.</p>
          <p>And there is a road to Hermione from Trœzen along the <lb/>
            rock which was formerly called the altar of Zens Sthenius, <lb/>
            but after Theseus removed the shoes and sword of Ægeus, <lb/>
            it was called Theseus' rock. As you go by this rock on the <lb/>
            mountain side, you come to the temple of Apollo called The <lb/>
            God of the Planetrees, and the hamlet is called Ilei, and in it <lb/>
            are temples of Demeter and her daughter Proserpine. And <lb/>
            near the sea, on the border of the territory of Hermione, is <lb/>
            a temple of Demeter under the title Thermasia. And at <lb/>
            the distance of about eighty stades is the promontory called <lb/>
            Scyllæum from Scylla, the daughter of Nisus. For after <lb/>
            Minos took Nisæa and Megara through her treason, he <lb/>
            refused to marry her though he had promised, and even <lb/>
            ordered the Cretans to throw her overboard, and the tide <lb/>
            washed her dead body on to this promontory. And they <lb/>
            exhibit no tomb of her, for they say that her body was <lb/>
            neglected, and carried away by sea birds bit by bit. And <lb/>
            as you sail from Scyliæum in the direction of the city is <lb/>
            another promontory called Bucephala, and next to it 3 <lb/>
            islands, of which the first is Haliusa, which affords a con­ <lb/>
            venient harbour for ships to ride at anchor, and next is <lb/>
            Pityusa, and the third they call Aristeræ. And as you <lb/>
            coast along by these islands, there is another promontory <lb/>
            called Colyergia jutting out from the mainland, and next it <lb/>
            an island called Tricrana, and a mountain Buporthmus <lb/>
            jutting out into the sea from the Peloponnese. And at <lb/>
            Buporthmus is a temple of Demeter and Proserpine, and <lb/>
            also one of Athene under the title Promachorma. And in - <lb/>
            front of Buporthmus lies an island called Aperopia. And <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            at no great distance from Aperopia is another island called <lb/>
            Hydrea. And the shore on the mainland opposite these <lb/>
            islands extends in a crescent shape, and is rocky from the <lb/>
            easterly direction close to the sea as far as the temple of <lb/>
            Poseidon, but slopes at the westerly end of the bay, where <lb/>
            it has its harbours. The length of this rocky headland is <lb/>
            about seven stades, and the breadth in the broadest part <lb/>
            about three stades or a little more. Here was the old town <lb/>
            of Hermione. And even now there are several temples <lb/>
            there, one of Poseidon at the commencement of the head­ <lb/>
            land, and as you go from the sea to the heights a temple of <lb/>
            Athene, and near it some remains of a racecourse, where <lb/>
            they say the sons of Tyndareus used to practise. There is <lb/>
            also another small temple of Athene, but the roof has fallen <lb/>
            in. And there is a temple to the Sun, and another to the <lb/>
            Graces, and another to Serapis and Isis. And there is a <lb/>
            circle of huge unhewn stones, and inside this circle they <lb/>
            perform the sacred rites of Demeter. Such are the objects <lb/>
            to be seen at the old town of Hermione. But the new town <lb/>
            is at about four stades' distance from the promontory on <lb/>
            which there is the temple of Poseidon, and it lies on a <lb/>
            gentle slope as you ascend the hill called Pron, for that is <lb/>
            its name. There is a wall all round Hermione. And it <lb/>
            has various objects of interest, but what I select as most <lb/>
            worthy of record are the temple of Marine Aphrodite and <lb/>
            Aphrodite of the Harbour, and a statue of white stone of <lb/>
            huge size, and a work of art. And there is another temple <lb/>
            of Aphrodite, which has other honours from the people of <lb/>
            Hermione and this special one, that maidens or widows <lb/>
            intending to marry must all sacrifice here before their <lb/>
            marriage. And Thermasian Demeter has two temples, one <lb/>
            on the borders of Trœzen as I have before said, and one <lb/>
            in new Hermione.</p><pb n="161"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next is a temple of Dionysns Melanægis, in whose <lb/>
            hononr they have a musical contest every year, and <lb/>
            give prizes for diving and rowing. And there is a temple <lb/>
            of Artemis under the name of Iphigenia, and a statue <lb/>
            of Poseidon in bronze with one foot on a dolphin. And <lb/>
            as you proceed to the temple of Vesta, you find no statue, <lb/>
            bnt an altar on which they sacrifice to Vesta. And there <lb/>
            are three temples and three statues of Apollo: one has <lb/>
            no title, the second is called Pythæan Apollo, and the <lb/>
            third Apollo of the Borders. The name Pythæan they bor­ <lb/>
            rowed from the Argives : for Telesilla says that to their <lb/>
            country first of all the Greeks came Pythæus the son of <lb/>
            Apollo. But why they call the god Apollo of the Borders <lb/>
            I cannot precisely tell, bnt I conjecture that having <lb/>
            obtained victory either by war or litigation in reference to <lb/>
            the borders, they honoured for this Apollo of the Borders. <lb/>
            And the temple of Fortune is they say the latest one that <lb/>
            the people of Hermione have, the statne is colossal in <lb/>
            Parian marble. And they have two wells, one an old one <lb/>
            into which the water flows by a hidden channel, but it <lb/>
            would never grow dry, not even if all the population were <lb/>
            to come and drink of it: and another dug in onr day, and <lb/>
            the name of the place from which the water flows into it is <lb/>
            Meadow. But the temple most worthy of notice is that of <lb/>
            Demeter on the Pron. This temple the people of Hermione <lb/>
            say was built by Clymenns, the son of Phoroneus, and by <lb/>
            Chthonia the sister of Clymenus. And the Argives say, <lb/>
            when Demeter came to Argolis, that Atheras and Mysins <lb/>
            offered the goddess hospitality, bnt Colontas would neither <lb/>
            receive her into his honse, nor pay her any other attention : <lb/>
            and in this he acted very much against the wish of his <lb/>
            daughter Chthonia. And Colontas they say for this con­ <lb/>
            dnct was burnt house and all, bnt Chthonia wes conveyed <lb/>
            to Hermione by Demeter, and built the temple there to <lb/>
            Demeter. And Demeter is called Chthonia there, and the <lb/>
            annual festival held in her honour in the season of summer <lb/>
            is called Chthonia too. And they keep the festival in this <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            wise. The priests of the gods and all the town authorities <lb/>
            for the year lead the procession, and the women and <lb/>
            men follow. It is customary for boys too to honour the <lb/>
            goddess by a procession, in which they take part clothed <lb/>
            in white, and with garlands on their heads plaited of the <lb/>
            flower which they call here cosmosandalum, but which seems <lb/>
            to me from size and colour to resemble the hyacinth, it has <lb/>
            also on its petals the same mournful letters. And the pro­ <lb/>
            cession is followed by some people who lead a full grown <lb/>
            heifer from the herd, tightly bound with ropes and curvetting <lb/>
            wildly. Some drag this heifer to the temple and unfasten <lb/>
            the ropes so as to let it inside, while others keep the doors <lb/>
            open till they see the heifer inside, and then shut them. <lb/>
            And four old women are waiting inside, and they finish the <lb/>
            heifer. For whoever can get the chance cuts its throat <lb/>
            with a sickle. And afterwards the doors are opened, and <lb/>
            those who have this duty drive up a second, third, and even <lb/>
            fourth heifer. The women finish them all off in the same <lb/>
            way, and then this fresh wonder is added to the sacrifice : <lb/>
            on whichever side the first heifer falls all must fall. This <lb/>
            is the way in which the sacrifice is performed by the people <lb/>
            of Hermione. And in front of the temple there are a few <lb/>
            statues of women who have been priestesses of Demeter, <lb/>
            and as you enter in there are seats on which the old women <lb/>
            sit, waiting for each heifer to be driven in, and there are <lb/>
            some statues not very old of Athene and Demeter. But the <lb/>
            special object of their worship neither have I seen nor any <lb/>
            man, whether stranger or native of Hermione. These old <lb/>
            women only know what it is.</p>
          <p>There is also another temple : and there are statues all <lb/>
            round it. This temple is opposite the temple of Chthonia, <lb/>
            and is called the temple of Clymenus. to whom they sacri­ <lb/>
            fice here. I don't think Clymenus is the name of an Argive <lb/>
            that came to Hermione, but the title of a god who accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the tradition was a king in the infernal regions. <lb/>
            Hard by is another temple and statue of Ares. On the <lb/>
            right of the temple of Chthonia is a porch, called by <lb/>
            the natives Echo, as a man's slightest whisper is repeated <lb/>
            thrice. And behind the temple of Chthonia are some places <lb/>
            which the people of Hermione call, one Clymenus' place, <lb/>
            and another Pluto's place, and a third the Acherusian <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            marsh. They are all fenced in with a wall of stone : and <lb/>
            in Clymenus' place there is a hole in the ground, through <lb/>
            which Hercules brought up Cerberus according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the people of Hermione. And near the gate <lb/>
            from which the road leads straight to Mases, is a temple <lb/>
            of <unclear>Ilithyia</unclear> within the walls. They propitiate the goddess <lb/>
            Ilithyia in various ways every day with sacrifices and <lb/>
            incense, and to her are most of the votive offerings given, <lb/>
            but her statue no one may look at except her priestesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXXVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            BOUT seven stades on the high road to Mases, as you <lb/>
            turn to the left, is the road to Halice. Halice in our <lb/>
            days is deserted, but it was formerly inhabited, and is men­ <lb/>
            tioned on the pillars of the Epidaurians, which record the <lb/>
            cures wrought by Æsculapius. I know of nothing else <lb/>
            worthy of record, either of the place or its population. <lb/>
            And the road that leads to it passes between Pron and <lb/>
            another mountain that in old times was called Thornax. <lb/>
            But because of the legendary change of Zeus into the <lb/>
            cuckoo they say its name was changed to Coccygium <lb/>
            (Cuckoo-mountain). And there are temples on the tops <lb/>
            of both these mountains, one of Zeus on the top of Coccy­ <lb/>
            gium, and one of Hera on the top of Pron. That at <lb/>
            Coccygium is at the end of the mountain, and it has neither <lb/>
            doors nor roof, nor any statue in it, and it was said to be <lb/>
            Apollo's temple. And near it is a road to Mases as you <lb/>
            take the turn to the right. And Mases was a town in old <lb/>
            times, as Homer has mentioned it in his catalogue of the <lb/>
            Argives, and the people of Hermione use it as their port <lb/>
            now. And from Mases there is a road on the right to the <lb/>
            promontory called Struthus, and it is about 250 stades <lb/>
            from this promontory along the mountain passes to what is <lb/>
            called Philanorium and to Bolei. Bolei consists of layers <lb/>
            of unhewn stones. And another place which they call <lb/>
            Didymi is 20 stades from Bolei. At Didymi there is a <lb/>
            temple of Apollo, and another of Poseidon, and another of <lb/>
            Demeter: and their statues are erect, in white stone.</p><pb n="164"/>
            
          <p>As you go from thence you come to the district of the <lb/>
            Argives formerly called Asinæa from its chief town Asine, <lb/>
            the ruins of which are near the sea. And when the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians under their king Nicander, the son of Charillus, <lb/>
            the son of Polydectes, the son of Eunomus, the son of Pry­ <lb/>
            tanis, the son of Eurypon, invaded Argolis with an army, the <lb/>
            people of Asine joined them, and ravaged with them the <lb/>
            territory of the Argives. But when the Lacedaemonian <lb/>
            force went home again, then the Argives and their king <lb/>
            Eratus marched against Asine. And for some time the <lb/>
            people of Asine defended their walls, and slew several of <lb/>
            the most valiant of the Argives and among them Lysis­ <lb/>
            tratus, but when their walls were carried, then they put <lb/>
            their wives and children on shipboard and left the town, <lb/>
            and the Argives razed it to the ground, and added it to their <lb/>
            territory, but they left the temple of Apollo standing, and <lb/>
            it is now to be seen, and they buried Lysistratus near it.</p>
          <p>Now the sea at Lerna is about 40 stades from Argos. <lb/>
            And as you go down to Lerna you first come to the river <lb/>
            Erasinus, which flows into the Phrixus,and the Phrixus into <lb/>
            the sea between Temenium and Lerna. And as you turn <lb/>
            from the Erasinus about 8 stades to the left there is a <lb/>
            temple of the Dioscuri called the Kings : and their statues <lb/>
            are of wood just like those in the city. And as you turn to <lb/>
            the right you cross the Erasinus, and come to the river <lb/>
            Chimarrus. And near it is a circle of stones, and here (so <lb/>
            the story goes) Pluto, after the Rape of Proserpine the <lb/>
            daughter of Demeter, descended to his supposed under­ <lb/>
            ground realms. Now Lerna is, as I have previously said, by <lb/>
            the sea, and they have rites here to Demeter of Lerna. <lb/>
            And there is a sacred grove beginning at the mountain <lb/>
            which they call Pontinus. And this mountain Pontinus <lb/>
            does not let the rain flow off, but absorbs it. Though the <lb/>
            river Pontinus does indeed flow from it. And on the top <lb/>
            of the mountain is the temple of Saitian Athene, only ruins <lb/>
            now, and the foundations of the house of Hippomedon, <lb/>
            who accompanied Polynices the son of Œdipus in his <lb/>
            attempt against Thebes. <note type="footnote"> 1 Qu. "Now Lerna by the sea" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign> <unclear>κατὰ</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλασσαν Λέρνα</foreign>). Cf. a <lb/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the grove of planetrees beginning at this mountain <lb/>
            extends most of the way to the sea, bounded on <lb/>
            one side by the river Pontinus, and on the other by the <lb/>
            river Amymone, which gets its name from the daughter of <lb/>
            Danaus. And inside the grove are statues, of Demeter <lb/>
            Prosymne and Dionysus, and the statue of Demeter is <lb/>
            seated and not a large one. These are of stone : but in <lb/>
            another temple there is a wooden one of Dionysus the <lb/>
            Saviour seated ; and a stone statue of Aphrodite near the <lb/>
            sea, which they say was a votive offering of the daughters <lb/>
            of Danaus, and Danaus himself erected the temple of <lb/>
            Athene near the Pontinus. And they say that Philham­ <lb/>
            mon was the founder of the rites at Lerna. The traditions <lb/>
            about these mysteries are manifestly not very ancient. <lb/>
            And what I have heard was written on a heart made of <lb/>
            orichalcum; this Arriphon could not have got from Phil­ <lb/>
            hammon, for Arriphon was a native of Triconium in <lb/>
            Ætolia, and held in most repute of all the Lycians in our <lb/>
            time, and a clever fellow at finding out what nobody before <lb/>
            knew, and who no doubt found this out for himself. The <lb/>
            verses and all the prose mixed up with the verses were in <lb/>
            Doric: but before the return of the Heraclidæ to the <lb/>
            Peloponnese the Argives used the same dialect as the <lb/>
            Athenians. And in the days of Philhammon I do not <lb/>
            believe that even the name of Dorians was known through­ <lb/>
            out all Greece. This proves my case.</p>
          <p>And near the source of the Amymone grows a plane tree, <lb/>
            under which they say the hydra was reared. I believe that <lb/>
            this beast was larger in size than other water-snakes, and <lb/>
            that its poison was so venomous that Hercules dipped the <lb/>
            points of his arrows in its gall, but I cannot help thinking <lb/>
            it had only one head and not more. But Pisander of <lb/>
            Camirus, that the beast might appear more formidable and <lb/>
            so add lustre to his poem, described it as having many <lb/>
            heads. I have seen also the well of Amphiaraus and the <lb/>
            Alcyonian marsh, by which the Argives say Dionysus <lb/>
            descended to Hades to fetch up Semele, for Polymnus <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            shewed him the descent. There is indeed no end to the <lb/>
            depth of the Alcyonian marsh, nor do I know of any man <lb/>
            who by any device ever got to the bottom of it, since <lb/>
            even Nero, though he got and fastened together ropes <lb/>
            many stades long, and put a piece of lead and other <lb/>
            apparatus for sounding at the end, never could arrive at <lb/>
            an accurate knowledge of its depth. I have also heard <lb/>
            that though the water of the marsh, as you would infer <lb/>
            from looking at it, is calm and quiet, if anyone ven­ <lb/>
            tures to swim in it, it is sure to drag him down and suck <lb/>
            him underneath to the bottom. The circuit of the lake is <lb/>
            not large, only about a third of a stade, and on its banks <lb/>
            are grass and reeds. But the nightly rites which take <lb/>
            place near it annually I am not permitted to write for <lb/>
            public reading.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you go from Lerna to Temenium—now Teme­ <lb/>
            nium belongs to the Argives, and gets its name from <lb/>
            Temenus the son of Aristomachus: for he occupied and <lb/>
            fortified the place, when he fought with the Dorians against <lb/>
            Tisamenus and the Achæans from this base-the river <lb/>
            Phrixus has its outlet into the sea, and there is a temple of <lb/>
            Poseidon at Temenium and another of Aphrodite, and <lb/>
            there is a monument of Temenus which is honoured by the <lb/>
            Dorians at Argos. And about 50 stades I should say <lb/>
            from Temenium is Nauplia, deserted in our day, it was <lb/>
            founded by Nauplius who is reputed to have been the son <lb/>
            of Poseidon and Amymone. And there are still some re­ <lb/>
            mains of walls at Nauplia, and a temple of Poseidon and <lb/>
            a harbour, and a well called Canathus: in which the <lb/>
            Argives say Hera bathes every year and becomes a virgin <lb/>
            again. This is a tradition in connection with the secret <lb/>
            rites which they perform to Hera. And the traditions of the <lb/>
            people of Nauplia about the ass, that by gnawing twigs off <lb/>
            the vine it makes the produce more abundant, (and con­ <lb/>
            sequently they have an ass carved on the rock as having <lb/>
            taught the art of pruning vines), I pass over deeming them <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            unworthy of mention. There is also another road going <lb/>
            from Lerna by the seaside to a place which they call Gene­ <lb/>
            slum : and near the sea close to Genesium there is a small <lb/>
            temple of Poseidon. And close to this is another place <lb/>
            called Landing-place : for according to tradition this was <lb/>
            the first place in Argolis where Danaus and his sons landed. <lb/>
            And as you go on from thence is a place called Anigræa, <lb/>
            on a road narrow and difficult of access. It is on the left <lb/>
            hand and extends to the sea, and is a good soil for trees <lb/>
            especially olive trees. And as you go up to the mainland <lb/>
            there is a place called Thyrea, where 300 picked men of the <lb/>
            Argives fought with 300 picked men of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            for the possession of the land. And as they were all killed <lb/>
            except one Spartan and two Argives, the tombs of those <lb/>
            that fell in the action were piled up here, but theLacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians afterwards got a firm footing at the place, as they <lb/>
            fought in full force with the Argives, and enjoyed it them­ <lb/>
            selves for a time, and afterwards gave it to the Æginetans <lb/>
            who had been driven out of Ægina by the Athenians. And <lb/>
            in my day the Argives inhabited the district of Thyrea, <lb/>
            and they say that they recovered it justly by conquest. <lb/>
            Next to that burial-ground you come to Athene, where <lb/>
            those Æginetans dwelt, and another village Neris, and a <lb/>

            brother of Alexanor, and he heals the people here, and has <lb/>
            divine honours from the inhabitants. And beyond these <lb/>

            between the Lacedaemonians and Argives and people of <lb/>
            Tegea. And some stone Hermæ stand as border stones to <lb/>
            mark the boundaries, and the place gets its name from <lb/>
            them. And there is a river called Tanaus, the only river <lb/>
            which flows from Mount Parnon. It flows through Argive <lb/>
            territory into the Thyreatic gulf.</p><pb n="168"/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            EXT to the Hermæ comes Laconia on the West. And <lb/>
            according to the Lacedaemonian tradition Lelex the <lb/>
            autochthon first reigned in this land, and the people over <lb/>
            whom he ruled were called after him Leleges. And Lelex' <lb/>
            sons were Myles and a younger son Polycaon. Where <lb/>
            Polycaon went to and why I shall relate elsewhere. But <lb/>
            on the death of Myles his son Eurotas succeeded him in <lb/>
            the kingdom. He diverted to the sea by a canal all the <lb/>
            stagnant water that filled the plain, and as it flowed to the <lb/>
            sea in mighty volume and became a noble river, he called it <lb/>
            the Eurotas. As he had no male children he left the <lb/>
            kingdom to Lacedæmon, whose mother was Taygete, (who <lb/>
            gave her name to the mountain Taygetus), and reputed <lb/>
            father Zeus. And Lacedæmon married Sparta the daughter <lb/>
            of Eurotas, and when he succeeded to the kingdom he first <lb/>
            gave the country and inhabitants his own name, and then <lb/>
            built and gave his wife's name to the city Sparta, which is <lb/>
            so called even to our day. And Amyclas his son, wishing <lb/>
            also himself to leave a memorial behind him, built the little <lb/>
            town Amyclæ in Laconia. And of his sons Hyacinthus, <lb/>
            the youngest and most handsome, died in his father's life­ <lb/>
            time, and there is a monument of him at Amyclæ close to <lb/>
            the statue of Apollo. And on the death of Amyclas the <lb/>
            succession devolved upon Argalus his eldest son, and after <lb/>
            the death of Argalus upon Cynortas. And Cynortas had a <lb/>
            son called Œbalus. He married Gorgophone the daughter <lb/>
            of Perseus from Argos, and had a son Tyndareus, with <lb/>
            whom Hippocoon contended for the kingdom, claiming it on <lb/>
            the ground of seniority. And Icarius and his party espous­ <lb/>
            ing Hippocoon's cause, he far exceeded Tyndareus in power, <lb/>
            and compelled him to retire from fear to Pellene, according <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            to the Lacedæmonian account. But the account of the <lb/>
            Messenians is that Tyndareus fled to Aphareus in Messenia, <lb/>
            and that Aphareus was the son of Perieres and the uterine <lb/>
            brother of Tyndareus : and they say he dwelt at Thalamæ <lb/>
            in Messenia, and had sons born to him there. And some <lb/>
            time afterwards he was restored by Hercules and recovered <lb/>
            his kingdom. And his sons reigned after him, as well as <lb/>
            his son-in-law Menelaus the son of Atreus, and Orestes the <lb/>
            husband of Hermione the daughter of Menelaus. But <lb/>
            when the Heraclidæ returned in the reign of Tisamenus the <lb/>
            son of Qrestes, one party in Messene and Argos made <lb/>
            Temenus king, and another section Cresphontes. And in <lb/>
            Lacedæmon as Aristodemus had twins there were two royal <lb/>
            houses, and they say this was in accordance with the oracle <lb/>
            at Delphi. And they say that Aristodemus died at Delphi <lb/>
            before the Dorians returned to the Peloponnese. Some <lb/>
            indeed, magnifying their own history, say that Aristodemus <lb/>
            was shot with arrows by Apollo, because he had not gone <lb/>
            to the oracle, but consulted Hercules whom he chanced to <lb/>
            meet first, as to how the Dorians should return to the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese. But the truer account is that the sons of Pylades <lb/>
            and Electra, who were cousins of Tisamenus the son of <lb/>
            Orestes, murdered Aristodemus. The names of his two <lb/>
            sons were Procles and Eurysthenes, who though they were <lb/>
            twins were in most respects very unlike one another. But <lb/>
            though they hated one another very cordially, yet they <lb/>
            jointly combined with Theras, the son of Autesion, their <lb/>
            Argive mother's brother, and their Regent, in esta­ <lb/>
            blishing a colony at the island which was then called Cal­ <lb/>
            liste, Theras hoping that the descendants of Membliarus <lb/>
            would abandon the kingdom of their own free will, as in <lb/>
            fact they did, reckoning that Theras' pedigree went up to <lb/>
            Cadmus, whereas they were only descendants of Mem­ <lb/>
            bliarus, a private individual whom Cadmus left in the <lb/>
            island as leader of the colonists. And Theras gave his own <lb/>
            name to the island instead of Calliste, and the people of <lb/>
            Thera even now yearly offer victims to him as their founder. <lb/>
            And Procles and Eurysthenes vied with one another in <lb/>
            their zeal for carrying out the wishes of Theras, but in all <lb/>
            other respects were at variance together. Not that, even if <lb/>
            they had been one in heart and mind, I could have put all <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            their descendants into one common pedigree, as cousin with <lb/>
            cousin, and cousins' children, with cousins' children, and so <lb/>
            on, that to the latest posterity they should arithmetically <lb/>
            dovetail in with one another. I shall therefore pursue the <lb/>
            history of each family separately, and not mix up the two <lb/>
            together in one account.</p>

          <p>E <lb/>
            URYSTHENES, the eldest of the sons of Aristode­ <lb/>
            mus, had a son Agis they say : (and from him they <lb/>
            call the descendants of Eurysthenes Agidæ). During his <lb/>
            reign, when Patreusthe son of Preugenes founded the city <lb/>
            in Achaia called to this day Patræ after him, the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monians took part in that colony. They co-operated also <lb/>
            with Grais, the son of Echelas, the son of Penthilus, the son <lb/>
            of Orestes, who was sailing with a fleet to make a colony <lb/>
            somewhere or other. And he indeed was destined to <lb/>
            occupy the country between Ionia and Mysia, which is in <lb/>
            our day called Æolis : his grandfather Penthilus had <lb/>
            already occupied Lesbos, the island opposite this mainland. <lb/>
            And during the reign of Echestratus the son of Agis at <lb/>
            Sparta the Lacedaemonians expelled all the Cynurians that <lb/>
            were in their prime, alleging as their excuse that robbers <lb/>
            from Cynuria ravaged Argolis, and the Argives were their <lb/>
            kinsmen, and that the Cynurians themselves made open <lb/>
            incursions into Argolis. If tradition speaks true the Cynu­ <lb/>
            rians were originally Argives, and they say their founder <lb/>
            was Cynurus the son of Perseus. And not many years <lb/>
            afterwards Labotas the son of Echestratus was king at <lb/>
            Sparta. This Labotas, as we are told by Herodotus in his <lb/>
            account of Crœsus, had during his minority the famous <lb/>
            legislator Lycurgus as his Regent, only Herodotus calls <lb/>
            him Leobotes instead of Labotas. In his days first did <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians make war against the Argives, and <lb/>
            they alleged as their reasons for declaring war that the <lb/>
            Argives when they invaded Cynuria took a slice of Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian territory, and tried to stir up their neighbouring <lb/>
            subjects to revolt. In this war they say nothing very <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            notable was done on either side : and those of this family <lb/>
            who succeeded one another as kings, viz. Doryssus the son <lb/>
            of Labotas and Agesilaus the son of Doryssus, both died at <lb/>
            no great interval after one another. And it was when Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus was king that Lycurgus legislated for the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, and some say that he derived his laws from Crete, <lb/>
            others that he was instructed by the Oracle at Delphi. <lb/>
            And the Cretans say that their laws come from Minos, who <lb/>
            received divine assistance in codifying them. And it seems <lb/>
            to me that Homer has hinted as much in the following lines <lb/>
            about the legislation of Minos, " There too is Gnossus, the <lb/>
            great city where Minos reigned nine years, the bosom- <lb/>
            friend of great Zeus." 1 But of Lycurgus I shall have <lb/>
            more to say hereafter. And the son of Agesilaus was <lb/>
            Archelaus. In his reign the Lacedæmonians conquered in <lb/>
            war and enslaved one of the neighbouring cities called <lb/>
            Ægys, suspecting that the people of it had an understand­ <lb/>
            ing with the Arcadians. And Charillus, the king of the <lb/>
            other family, assisted Archelaus against Ægys, and his <lb/>
            own separate doings as leader of the Lacedaemonians I <lb/>
            shall relate later on when I come to the so-called Eury­ <lb/>
            pontidæ. And the son of Archelaus was Telecius. In <lb/>
            his reign the Lacedæmonians took in war the neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing cities of Amyclæ and Pharis and Geranthræ, which <lb/>
            were then in the possession of the Achæans, and razed <lb/>
            them to the ground. The inhabitants however of Pharis <lb/>
            and Greranthræ, being terrified at the approach of the <lb/>
            Dorians, agreed to evacuate the Peloponnese upon con­ <lb/>
            ditions : but the people of Amyclæ they could not drive out <lb/>
            at first assault, but only after a long siege and the greatest <lb/>
            exhibition of valour. And the Dorians themselves shewed <lb/>
            this by erecting a trophy after the conquest of Amyclæ, as <lb/>
            thinking that conquest no small feather in their cap. And <lb/>
            not long after all this Teleclus was killed by the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians in the temple of Artemis in the town of Limnæ, on <lb/>
            the borders between Laconia and Messenia. And after the <lb/>
            death of Teleclus Alcamenes his son succeeded him, and <lb/>
            during his reign the Lacedæmonians sent to Crete Char­ <lb/>
            midas the son of Euthys, one of the most famous men in <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xix. 178, 179. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            Sparta, who put down the insurrection at Crete, and per­ <lb/>
            suaded the Cretans to abandon the cities which were inland <lb/>
            and in other respects weak, and to inhabit instead those <lb/>
            which were conveniently situated on the coast. The Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians also depopulated Helos, a city by the sea in the <lb/>
            possession of the Achaeans, and defeated the Argives who <lb/>
            came to the help of the people of Helos.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND after the death of Alcamenes Polydorus his son suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded to the kingdom, and the Lacedæmonians sent <lb/>
            a colony into Italy to Croton, and to the Locrians at the pro­ <lb/>
            montory Zephyrium : and the war that was called the war <lb/>
            with Messene was at its height when Polydorus was king. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians and Messenians give different reasons <lb/>
            for this war. Their different accounts, and the progress <lb/>
            of the war, will be set forth by me in their turn : but thus <lb/>
            much will I record at present that Theopompus the son of <lb/>
            Nicander had the greatest hand in the first war with the <lb/>
            Messenians, being the king of the other house. And after <lb/>
            the end of the war, when Messenia was already conquered <lb/>
            by the Lacedaemonians, and Polydorus was in good repute <lb/>
            at Sparta, and popular with the Lacedæmonians and espe­ <lb/>
            cially with the populace, for he exhibited no violence either <lb/>
            in word or deed to anyone, and in legal cases tempered <lb/>
            justice with mercy, when in short he had a brilliant fame <lb/>
            throughout all Greece, he was murdered by Polemarchus a <lb/>
            man of no mean family in Lacedæmon, but hotheaded, as <lb/>
            indeed he shewed by this murder. And after his death <lb/>
            Polydorus received many notable honours from the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians. Polemarchus also had a monument at Sparta, <lb/>
            whether being judged to have been a good man previously, <lb/>
            or that his relatives buried him privately. During the reign <lb/>
            of Eurycrates the son of Polydorus the Messenians patiently <lb/>
            endured the Laccdæmonian yoke, nor was any revolution <lb/>
            attempted by the Argive people, but in the days of Anax­ <lb/>
            ander the son of Eurycrates—for fate was already driving <lb/>
            the Messenians out of all the Peloponnesc—the Messenians <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            revolted from the Lacedæmonians, and fought against them <lb/>
            for some time, but were eventually conquered, and evacuated <lb/>
            the Peloponnese upon conditions of war. And the remnant <lb/>
            of them became slaves on Lacedæmonian soil, except those <lb/>
            who inhabited the maritime towns. All the circumstances <lb/>
            of this war and revolt of the Messenians I have no need to <lb/>
            recount in detail in the present part of my history. And <lb/>
            Anaxander had a son Eurycrates, and this second Eurycrates <lb/>
            a son Leo. During their reigns the Lacedæmonians met with <lb/>
            the greatest reverses in fighting against the people of Tegea. <lb/>
            And in the reign of Anaxandrides the son of Leo they over­ <lb/>
            came the people of Tegea, and in the following way. A <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian by name Lichas came to Tegea at a time <lb/>
            when Lacedæmon and Tegea were at peace together. And <lb/>
            on Lichas' arrival they made a search for the bones of <lb/>
            Orestes, and the Spartans sought for them in accordance <lb/>
            with an oracle. And Lichas discovered that they were <lb/>
            lying in the shop of a blacksmith, and he discovered it in <lb/>
            this way : all that he saw in the blacksmith’s shop he com­ <lb/>
            pared with the oracle at Delphi, thus he compared the <lb/>
            blacksmith’s bellows to the winds, because they produce a <lb/>
            strong wind, the hammer was the blow, that which resists <lb/>
            the blow was the anvil, and that which was a source of woe <lb/>
            to man he naturally referred to iron, for people already <lb/>
            began to use iron in battle, for the god would have spoken of <lb/>
            brass as a source of woe to man in the days of the heroes. <lb/>
            And just as this oracle was given to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            about the bones of Orestes, so afterwards the Athenians <lb/>
            were similarly instructed by the oracle to bring. Theseus' <lb/>
            bones to Athens from Scyrus, for otherwise Scyrus could <lb/>
            not be taken. And Cimon the son of Miltiades discovered <lb/>
            the bones of Theseus, he too by ingenuity, and not long <lb/>
            after he took Scyrus. That in the days of the heroes all <lb/>
            arms alike were brass is borne witness to by Homer in the <lb/>
            lines which refer to the axe of Pisander and the arrow of <lb/>
            Meriones. And I have further confirmation of what I <lb/>
            assert in the spear of Achilles which is stored up in the <lb/>
            temple of Athene at Phaselis, and the sword of Memnon in <lb/>
            the temple of AEsculapius at Nicomedia, the former has its <lb/>
            tip and handle of brass, and the latter is of brass through­ <lb/>
            out. This we know to be the case. And Anaxandrides <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            the son of Leo was the only Lacedaemoniam that had two <lb/>
            wives together and two households. For his first wife, <lb/>
            excellent in other respects, had no children, and when the <lb/>
            ephors bade him divorce her, he would not consent to this <lb/>
            altogether, but only so far as to take a second wife as well. <lb/>
            And the second wife bare a son Cleomenes, and the first <lb/>
            wife, though so long barren, after the birth of Cleomenes <lb/>
            bare Dorieus, and Leonidas, and Cleombrotus. And after <lb/>
            the death of Anaxandrides, the Lacedæmonians though <lb/>
            they thought Dorieus the better man both in council and <lb/>
            war, reluctantly rejected him, and gave the kingdom to <lb/>
            Cleomenes according to their law of primogeniture.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Dorieus, as he would not remain at Lacedæmon <lb/>
            subject to Cleomenes, was sent to form a colony. And <lb/>
            Uleomenes commenced his reign by an inroad into Argons, <lb/>
            gathering together an army of Lacedæmonians and allies. <lb/>
            And when the Argives came out to meet him armed for <lb/>
            battle, he conquered them, and when they were routed <lb/>
            about 5,000 of them fled into a neighbouring grove, which <lb/>
            was sacred to Argus the son of Niobe. And Cleomenes, who <lb/>
            often had a touch of the mad, ordered the Helots to set this <lb/>
            grove on fire, and the grove was entirely consumed, and all <lb/>
            these fugitives in it. He also marched his army against <lb/>
            Athens, and at first, by freeing the Athenians from the yoke <lb/>
            of the sons of Pisistratus, got for himself good fame among <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians and all the Greeks, but afterwards in <lb/>
            his favour to an Athenian called Isagoras, tried to get for <lb/>
            him the dominion over the Athenians. But failing in this <lb/>
            expectation, and the Athenians fighting stoutly for their <lb/>
            freedom, he ravaged various parts of their territory, and <lb/>
            they say laid waste a place called Orgas, sacred to the gods <lb/>
            at Eleusis. He also went to Ægina, and arrested the lead­ <lb/>
            ing men there for their support to the Medcs, as they had <lb/>
            persuaded the citizens to supply King Darius the son of <lb/>
            Hystaspes with earth and water. And while Cleomenes was <lb/>
            staying at Ægina, Demaratus the king of the other family <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            was calumniating him to the multitude at Laced æmon. And <lb/>
            Cleomenes on his return from Ægina contrived to get De­ <lb/>
            maratus ejected from the kingdom, and bribed the priestess <lb/>
            at Delphi to utter as oracular responses to the Lacedemo­ <lb/>
            nians about Demaratus whatever he told her, and also <lb/>
            instigated Leotychides, one of the royal house and same <lb/>
            family as Demaratus, to be a rival claimant for the king­ <lb/>
            dom. And Leotychides caught at some words, which <lb/>
            Aristo formerly had foolishly thrown out against Demaratus <lb/>
            at his birth, saying that he was not his son. And when the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians took this question about Demaratus, as <lb/>
            they took all their questions, to the oracle at Delphi, the <lb/>
            priestess gave them as replies whatever Cleomenes had told <lb/>
            her. Demaratus therefore was deposed from his kingdom <lb/>
            by the hatred of Cleomenes and not on just grounds. And <lb/>
            Cleomenes after this died in a fit of madness, for he seized <lb/>
            his sword, and stabbed himself, and hacked his body about <lb/>
            all over. The Argives say he came to this bad end as a <lb/>
            judgment for his conduct to the 5,000 fugitives in the <lb/>
            grove, the Athenians say it was because he ravaged Orgas, <lb/>
            and the Delphians because he bribed the priestess at <lb/>
            Delphi to tell falsehoods about Demaratus. Now there <lb/>
            are other cases of vengeance coming from heroes and gods <lb/>
            as on Cleomenes, for Protesilaus who is honoured at Eleus, <lb/>
            a hero not a whit more illustrious than Argus, privately <lb/>
            punished the Persian Artayctes, and the Megarians who <lb/>
            had dared to till the holy land could never get pardon from <lb/>
            the gods of Eleusis. Nor do I know of anyone that ever <lb/>
            dared to tamper with the oracle but Cleomenes alone. <lb/>
            And as Cleomenes had no male children the kingdom de­ <lb/>
            volved upon Leonidas the son of Anaxandrides, the brother <lb/>
            of Dorieus on both sides. It was in his reign that Xerxes <lb/>
            led his army into Greece, and Leonidas with his 300 Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians met him at Thermopylae. There have been many <lb/>
            wars between the Greeks and barbarians, but those can easily <lb/>
            be counted wherein the valour of one man mainly contributed <lb/>
            to glorious victory, as the valour of Achilles in the war <lb/>
            against Ilium, and that of Miltiades in the action at Mara­ <lb/>
            thon. But indeed in my opinion the heroism of Leonidas <lb/>
            excelled all the great deeds of former times. For Xerxes, the <lb/>
            most sagacious and renowned of all the kings that ruled over <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            the Medes and Persians, would have been prevented, at the <lb/>
            narrow pass of Thermopylae by the handful of men that <lb/>
            Leonidas had with him, from seeing Greece at all, and from <lb/>
            afterwards burning Athens, had it not been for a certain <lb/>
            Trachinian who led round by a pass on Mount (Eta the army <lb/>
            of Hydarnes so as to fall on the Greek flank, and, when <lb/>
            Leonidas was conquered in this way, the barbarians passed <lb/>
            into Greece over his dead body. And Pausanias the son of <lb/>
            Cleombrotus was not king after Leonidas, but was Regent <lb/>
            for Plistarchus Leonidas' son during his minority, and he led <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to Platæa and afterwards passed over to <lb/>
            the Hellespont with a fleet. I especially admire the conduct <lb/>
            of Pausanias to the Coan lady, who was the daughter of a <lb/>
            man of no mean note among the Coans, viz. of Hegetorides <lb/>
            the son of Antagoras, and against her will the concubine of <lb/>
            Pharandates the son of Teaspis, a Persian: and when Mar­ <lb/>
            donius fell in the battle at Platæa, and the barbarians were <lb/>
            annihilated, Pausanias sent this lady home to Cos, with the <lb/>
            ornaments and all other apparel that the Persian had given <lb/>
            her. Moreover he would not suffer the dead body of Alar­ <lb/>
            donius to be outraged, though the Æginetan Lampon <lb/>
            urged it.</p>

          <p>p <lb/>
            LISTARCHUS the son of Leonidas died soon after <lb/>
            succeeding to the kingdom, and Plistoanax the son of <lb/>
            of Pausanias, the hero of Platæa, succeeded him. And <lb/>
            .Plistoanax was succeeded by his son Pausanias. This is <lb/>
            that Pausanias who led an army into Attica, ostensibly <lb/>
            against Thrasybulus and the Athenians, but really to esta­ <lb/>
            blish the dominion of the Thirty Tyrants who had been set <lb/>
            over Athens by Lysander. And he conquered in an engage­ <lb/>
            ment the Athenians who guarded the Piræus, but directly <lb/>
            after the battle he took his army off home again, not to <lb/>
            bring upon Sparta the most shameful disgrace of establish­ <lb/>
            ing the power of unholy men. And when he returned from <lb/>
            Athens with nothing to show for his battle, his enemies <lb/>
            brought him to trial. Now a king of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            is tried by a court composed of twenty-eight Seniors, and <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            the Ephors, and the King of the other family. Fourteen <lb/>
            of the Seniors and Agis, the King of the other family, con­ <lb/>
            demned Pausanias, the rest of the Court acquitted him. <lb/>
            And no long time after the Lacedæmonians gathering to­ <lb/>
            gether an army against Thebes, the reason for which war <lb/>
            we shall relate in our account about Agesilaus, Lysander <lb/>
            marched into Phocis, and, having mustered the Phocians in <lb/>
            full force, lost no time in advancing into Bœotia, and <lb/>
            making an attack upon the fortified town Haliartus, which <lb/>
            would not revolt from Thebes. Some Thebans however <lb/>
            and Athenians had secretly entered the town, and they <lb/>
            making a sally and drawing up in battle array, Lysander <lb/>
            and several of the Lacedæmonians fell. And Pausanias, <lb/>
            who had been collecting forces from Tegea and the rest of <lb/>
            Arcadia, came too late to take part in the fight, and when <lb/>
            he got to Boeotia and heard of the death of Lysander and <lb/>
            the defeat of his army, he nevertheless marched his army <lb/>
            to Thebes, intending to renew the fight there. But when <lb/>
            he got there he found the Thebans drawn up in battle <lb/>
            array against him, and it was also reported that Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus was coming up with an Athenian force; accordingly, <lb/>
            fearing to be taken between two fires, he made a treaty <lb/>
            with the Thebans, and buried those who had fallen in the <lb/>
            sally from Haliartus. This conduct of his did not please <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, but I praise his determination for the <lb/>
            following reason. Well knowing that reverses always found <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians surrounded by a swarm of enemies, <lb/>
            what happened after Thermopylae and in the island of <lb/>
            Sphacteria made him afraid of causing a third disaster. <lb/>
            But as the citizens accused him of slowness in getting <lb/>
            to Bœotia he did not care to stand a second trial, but the <lb/>
            people of Tegea received him as a suppliant at the temple <lb/>
            of Mean Athene. This temple was from time immemorial <lb/>
            venerated throughout the Peloponnese, and afforded safety <lb/>
            to all suppliants, as was shewn by the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            Pausanias, and earlier still to Leotychides, and by the <lb/>
            Argives to Chrysis, who all took sanctuary here, and were <lb/>
            not demanded up. And after the voluntary exile of Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias, his sons Agesipolis and Cleombrotus being quite young, <lb/>
            Aristodemus the next of kin was appointed Regent: and the <lb/>
            I success of the Lacedæmonians at Corinth was owing to his <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            generalship. And when Agesipolis came of age and took <lb/>
            over the kingdom, his first war was against the Argives. <lb/>
            And as he was leading his army from Tegea into Argolis, <lb/>
            the Argives sent an envoy to negotiate peace with him on <lb/>
            the old conditions established among all Dorians. But he <lb/>
            not only declined these proposals, but advanced with his <lb/>
            army and ravaged Argolis. And there was an earthquake, <lb/>
            but not even then would Agesipolis draw off his forces, <lb/>
            though these tokens of Poseidon's displeasure frightened <lb/>
            the Lacedemonians especially, [and also the Athenians.] <lb/>
            And Agesipolis was now encamped under the walls of <lb/>
            Argos, and the earthquakes ceased not, and some of the <lb/>
            soldiers died struck by lightning, and others were dis­ <lb/>
            mayed by the thunder. So at last he returned from <lb/>
            Argolis sorely against his will, and led an expedition against <lb/>
            the Olynthians, and having been successful. In battle, and <lb/>
            taken most of the other cities in Chalcidice, and hoping to <lb/>
            take Olynthus also, he was carried off by a sudden disease <lb/>
            and died.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Agesipolis having died childless, the succession de­ <lb/>
            . volved upon Cleombrotus, under whom the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians fought against the Bœotians at Leuctra, and <lb/>
            Cleombrotus, exposing himself too freely, fell at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of the action. Somehow or other the Deity <lb/>
            seems to like to remove the General first in great reverses, <lb/>
            as from the Athenians he removed Hippocrates (the son of <lb/>
            Ariphron) their General at Delium, and later on Leosthenes <lb/>
            their General in Thessaly.</p>
          <p>The elder son of Cleombrotus, Agesipolis, did nothing <lb/>
            worthy of record, and Cleomenes the younger succeeded <lb/>
            after his brother's death. And he had two sons, of <lb/>
            whom the eldest Acrotatus died before his father, and <lb/>
            when later on the younger Cleomenes died, there was a <lb/>
            dispute who should be king between Cleonymus the son of <lb/>
            Cleomenes and Areus the son of Acrotatus. The Senate <lb/>
            decided that to Areus the son of Acrotatus and not to <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            Cleonymus belonged the hereditary office. And Cleonymus <lb/>
            got mightily enraged at being ejected from the kingdom, <lb/>
            though the Ephors endeavoured to induce him by various <lb/>
            honours, and by making him commander-in-chief of the <lb/>
            army, not to be an enemy to his country. But in spite of <lb/>
            this he eventually injured his country in various ways, and <lb/>
            even went so far as to invite in Pyrrhus the grandson of <lb/>
            Æacus.</p>
          <p>And during, the reign of Areus the son of Acrotatus, <lb/>
            Antigonus the son of Demetrius made an expedition against <lb/>
            Athens both by land and sea. And an Egyptian fleet <lb/>
            under Patroclus came to the aid of the Athenians, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians came out in full force with Areus the king <lb/>
            at their head. And Antic-onus having closely invested <lb/>
            Athens, and barring the Athenian allies from every ap­ <lb/>
            proach to the city, Patroclus sent messengers and begged <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians and Areas to begin the battle against <lb/>
            Antigonus, and when they began he said he would fall on <lb/>
            the rear of the Macedonians, for it was not reasonable that <lb/>
            his force should attack the Macedonians first, being Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians and sailors. Then the Lacedaemonians were eager to <lb/>
            bear the brunt of the battle, being animated by their friend­ <lb/>
            ship to the Athenians, and the desire to do something that <lb/>
            posterity would not willingly forget. But Areus, as. their <lb/>
            provisions had been consumed, led his army home again. <lb/>
            For he thought it sheer madness not to husband their re­ <lb/>
            sources, but lavish them all on strangers. And Athens <lb/>
            holding out for a very long time, Antigonus made peace <lb/>
            on conditions that he might have a garrison at the Museum. <lb/>
            And some time after Antigonus himself withdrew the <lb/>
            garrison there. And Areus had a son Acrotatus, and he <lb/>
            had a son Areas, who was only 8 when he fell sick and <lb/>
            died. And as now Leonidas was the only male left of the <lb/>
            family of Eurysthenes, though quite an old man, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians made him king. And it so chanced that <lb/>
            Lysander, a descendant of Lysander the son of Aristocritus, <lb/>
            especially disliked Leonidas. He associated with himself <lb/>
            Cleombrotus, the son in law of Leonidas, and having won <lb/>
            him over brought against Leonidas various charges, and the <lb/>
            oath he had sworn to Cleonymus his father while quite a <lb/>
            boy that he would destroy Sparta. So Leonidas was <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            deposed from the kingdom, and Cleombrotus reigned in <lb/>
            his room. And if Leonidas had given way to temper, <lb/>
            and (like Demaratus the son of Aristo) had gone and <lb/>
            joined the king of Macedonia or the king of Egypt, he <lb/>
            would have got no advantage from the subsequent repent­ <lb/>
            ance of the Spartans. But as it was when the citizens <lb/>
            exiled him he went to Arcadia, and from thence not many <lb/>
            years afterwards the Lacedæmonians recalled him, and <lb/>
            made him king the second time. And all that Cleomenes <lb/>
            the son of Leonidas did, and all his boldness and bravery, <lb/>
            and how the Spartan kings came to an end with him, I <lb/>
            have previously recorded in connection with Aratus of <lb/>
            Sicyon. Nor did I omit the details of Cleomenes' death in <lb/>
            Egypt.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>O <lb/>
            F the family of Eurysthenes then, called the Agiadæ, <lb/>
            Cleomenes the son of Leonidas was the last king at <lb/>
            Sparta: but as to the other branch this is what I have <lb/>
            heard. Procles the son of Aristodemus had a son called <lb/>
            Sons, whose son Eurypon attained such glory that the <lb/>
            family were called Eurypontidæ from him, though till his <lb/>
            time they were called Proclidæ. And Eurypon had a son <lb/>
            Prytanis, and it was in his days that animosity broke out <lb/>
            between the Lacedaemonians and Argives, and even earlier <lb/>
            than this quarrel they fought with the Cynurians, but <lb/>
            during the succeeding generations, when Eunomus the son <lb/>
            of Prytanis and Polydectes the son of Eunomus were kings, <lb/>
            Sparta continued at peace. But Charillus the son of Poly­ <lb/>
            dectes ravaged the Argive territory, and made a raid into <lb/>
            Argolis, and under his leadership the Spartans went out <lb/>
            to Tegea, when the Lacedaemonians hoped to take Tegea <lb/>
            and slice the district off from Arcadia, following a beguil­ <lb/>
            ing oracle. And after the death of Charillus Nicander his <lb/>
            son succeeded to the kingdom, and it was in his reign that <lb/>
            the Messenians killed Teleclus the king of the other family <lb/>
            in the temple of Artemis Limnas. And Nicander invaded <lb/>
            Argolis with an army, and ravaged most of the country. <lb/>
            And the Asinæans having taken part with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            monians in this expedition, not long afterwards paid the <lb/>
            penalty to the Argives in the destruction of their country <lb/>
            and their own exile. And Theopompus the son of <lb/>
            Nicander, who was king after his father, I shall make <lb/>
            mention of when I come to the history of Messenia. <lb/>
            During his reign came on the contest for Thyrea between <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians and Argives. Theopompus himself <lb/>
            took no part in this, partly from old age, but still more <lb/>
            from sorrow at the death of his son Archidamus. Not <lb/>
            that Archidamus died childless, for he left a son Zeuxi­ <lb/>
            damus, who was succeeded in the kingdom by his son <lb/>
            Anaxidamus. It was in his reign that the Messenians <lb/>
            evacuated the Peloponnese, having been a second time <lb/>
            conquered in war by the Spartans. And Anaxidamus <lb/>
            had a son Archidamus, and he had a son Agesicles : and <lb/>
            both of them had the good fortune to spend all their life in <lb/>
            peace and without wars. And Aristo the son of Agesicles <lb/>
            having married a girl who they say was the most shame­ <lb/>
            less of all the girls in Lacedæmon, but in appearance the <lb/>
            most beautiful girl next to Helen, had by her a son Dema­ <lb/>
            ratus seven months after marriage. And as he was sit­ <lb/>
            ting with the ephors in council a servant came and told <lb/>
            him of the birth of his son. And Aristo, forgetting the <lb/>
            lines in the Iliad1 about the birth of Eurystheus, or <lb/>
            perhaps not knowing them, said it couldn't be his child <lb/>
            from the time. He was sorry afterwards for these words <lb/>
            which he had spoken. And when Demaratus was king <lb/>
            and in other respects in good repute at Sparta, and had <lb/>
            cooperated with Cleomenes in freeing the Athenians from <lb/>
            the Pisistratidæ, this thoughtless word of Aristo, and the <lb/>
            hatred of Cleomenes deprived him of the kingdom. And <lb/>
            he went to Persia to king Darius, and they say his de­ <lb/>
            scendants continued for a long time in Asia. And Leoty­ <lb/>
            chides, who became king in his place, shared with the <lb/>
            Athenians and their General Xanthippus, the son of <lb/>
            Ariphron, in the action at Mycale, and also marched into <lb/>
            Thessaly against the Aleuadæ. And though he might have <lb/>
            reduced all Thessaly, as he was victorious in every battle, <lb/>
            he allowed the Aleuadæ to buy him off. And being im- <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xix. 117. </note> <lb/>

            peached at Lacedæmon he went voluntarily into exile to <lb/>
            escape trial, and became a suppliant at Tegea at the temple <lb/>
            of Alean Athene there, and as his son Zeuxidamus had <lb/>
            previously died of some illness, his grandson Archidamus <lb/>
            succeeded him, on his departure to Tegea. This Archi­ <lb/>
            damus injured the Athenian territory excessively, invading <lb/>
            Attica every year, and whenever he invaded it he went <lb/>
            through all the country ravaging it, and also captured <lb/>
            after a siege the town of Plata3a which was friendly to the <lb/>
            Athenians. Not that Platæa had ever stirred up strife <lb/>
            between the Peloponnesians and Athenians, but as far as <lb/>
            in its power lay had made them both keep the peace. But <lb/>
            Sthenelaidas, one of the Ephors, a man of great power at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, was mainly the cause of the war at that time. <lb/>
            And this war shook Greece, which was previously in a <lb/>
            flourishing condition, to its foundation, and afterwards <lb/>
            Philip the son of Amyntas reduced it completely, when it <lb/>
            was already rotten and altogether unsound.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND on the death of Archidamus, Agis the elder of his <lb/>
            sons being of age succeeded, and not Agesilaus. <lb/>
            And Archidamus had also a daughter called Cynisca, who <lb/>
            was most ambitious in regard to the races at Olympia, <lb/>
            and was the first woman who trained horses, and the first <lb/>
            woman who won the prize at Olympia, though after her <lb/>
            several women, especially Lacedæmonian ones, won the <lb/>
            prize at Olympia, though none came up to her fame in <lb/>
            these contests. But the Spartans seem to me to admire <lb/>
            least of all men the glory that proceeds from poetry, for <lb/>
            except an epigram on Cynisca composed by some one or <lb/>
            other, and still earlier one on Pausanias, composed by <lb/>
            Simonides, inscribed on the tripod erected at Delphi, there <lb/>
            is no record made by any poet on any of the Lacedaemonian <lb/>
            kings. And in the reign of Agis, the son of Archidamus, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians brought other charges against the <lb/>
            people of Elis, but were especially annoyed at their being <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            shut out of the contest at Olympia, and the privileges of the <lb/>
            temple there. They therefore sent an envoy with an ulti­ <lb/>
            matum to the people of Elis, bidding them allow the people of <lb/>
            Lepreum, and all other resident aliens who were subject to <lb/>
            them, to live according to their own laws. And the people <lb/>
            of Elis making reply that, when they saw the subject cities <lb/>
            of Sparta free, they would immediately set their own free, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians under King Agis at once invaded <lb/>
            Elis. On that occasion the army retired in consequence of <lb/>
            an earthquake, when they had advanced as far as Olympia <lb/>
            and the River Alpheus, but next year Agis wasted the <lb/>
            country and carried off much booty. And Xenias a man <lb/>
            of Elis, who was privately friendly to Agis and publicly a <lb/>
            champion of the Lacedaemonians, conspired against the <lb/>
            populace with the men who were wealthy, but before Agis <lb/>
            and the army could come up and cooperate with them <lb/>
            Thrasydaeus, who was at this time the leader of the popu­ <lb/>
            lace at Ells, conquered Xenias and his faction in battle and <lb/>
            drove them from the city. And when Agis led his <lb/>
            army home again, he left Lysistratus the Spartan with a <lb/>
            portion of his force, and the refugees from Elis, to co­ <lb/>
            operate with the men of Lepreum in ravaging the district. <lb/>
            And in the third year of the war the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            Agis made preparations to invade Elis: but the people <lb/>
            of Elis and Thrasydæus, who had been reduced by the <lb/>
            war to the greatest extremity, made a convention to give <lb/>
            liberty to their subject cities, and to raze the fortifica­ <lb/>
            tions of their town, and to allow the Lacedæmonians to <lb/>
            sacrifice to the god at Olympia and to contend in the <lb/>
            games. After this A-is kept continually attacking Attica, <lb/>
            and fortified Decelea as a constant menace to the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians : and after the Athenian fleet was destroyed at <lb/>
            Ægos-potamoi, Lysander the son of Aristocritus and Agis <lb/>
            violated the solemn oaths which the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            Athenians had mutually sworn to observe, and at their <lb/>
            own responsibility, and not at the bidding of the Spartan <lb/>
            community, made an agreement with their allies to cut off <lb/>
            Athens root and branch. These were the most notable <lb/>
            exploits of A-is in war. And the hastiness of speech of <lb/>
            Aristo about the legitimacy of his son Demaratus Agis also <lb/>
            imitated in regard to his son Leotychides, for some evil <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            genius put it into his head in the hearing of the Ephors to <lb/>
            say that he did not think he was his son. He repented <lb/>
            however of his speech afterwards, for when he was carried <lb/>
            home sick from Arcadia and had got to Heræa, he solemnly <lb/>
            declared before a multitude of witnesses that he did verily <lb/>
            believe that Leotychides was his son, and conjured them <lb/>
            with entreaties and tears to report what he had said to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. But after his death Agesilaus drove <lb/>
            Leotychides from the kingdom, reminding the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians of Agis' former speech, though the Arcadians <lb/>
            came from Heræa, and bare witness what they had heard <lb/>
            about Leotychides from Agis on his death-bed. And the <lb/>
            variance between Agesilaus and Leotychides was heightened <lb/>
            by the oracle at Delphi, which ran as follows :— <lb/>
            " Sparta, beware, although thou art so great, <lb/>
            Of having king o'er thee lame of one leg. <lb/>
            For unexpected woes shall then prevail, <lb/>
            And mortal-slaying wave of troublous war." <lb/>
            Leotychides said that this oracle referred to Agesilaus, for <lb/>
            he limped on one leg, but Agesilaus said it referred to <lb/>
            Leotychides' not being the legitimate son of Agis. And <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians did not avail themselves of their privi­ <lb/>
            lege to refer the question to Delphi: but Lysander, the son <lb/>
            of Aristocritus, seems to have prevailed upon the people to <lb/>
            unanimously choose Agesilaus.</p>

          <p>s <lb/>
            0 Agesilaus the son of Archidamus was king, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians resolved to cross over into Asia with <lb/>
            their fleet to capture Artaxerxes the son of Darius : for <lb/>
            they had learnt from several people in authority, and espe­ <lb/>
            cially from Lysander, that it was not Artaxerxes that had <lb/>
            helped them in the war against the Athenians, but Cyrus <lb/>
            who had supplied them with money for their ships. And <lb/>
            Agesilaus, after being instructed to convey the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion to Asia as commander of the land forces, sent round <lb/>
            the Peloponnese to all the Greeks except at Argos and <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            outside the Isthmus urging them to join him as allies. <lb/>
            The Corinthians for their part, although they had been <lb/>
            most eager to take part in the expedition to Asia, yet, when <lb/>
            their temple of Olympian Zens was suddenly consumed by <lb/>
            fire, took it as an evil omen, and remained at home sorely <lb/>
            against their will. And the Athenians urged, as pretext <lb/>
            for refusing their aid, the strain of the Peloponnesian war <lb/>
            and the city's need of recovery from the plague : but their <lb/>
            having learnt from envoys that Conon the son of Timotheus <lb/>
            had gone to the great king, was their main motive. And <lb/>
            Aristomenidas was sent as ambassador to Thebes, the father <lb/>
            of Agesilaus' mother, who was intimate with the Thebans, <lb/>
            and had been one of the judges who, at the capture of <lb/>
            Platæa, had condemned the garrison to be put to the <lb/>
            sword. The Thebans however cried off like the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, declining their aid. And Agesilaus, when his own <lb/>
            army and that of the allied forces was mustered and his <lb/>
            fleet ready to sail, went to Aulis to sacrifice to Artemis, <lb/>
            because it was there that Agamemnon had propitiated the <lb/>
            goddess when he led the expedition to Troy. And Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus considered himself king of a more flourishing state <lb/>
            than Agamemnon, and that like him he was leading all <lb/>
            Greece, but the success would be more glorious, the hap­ <lb/>
            piness greater, to conquer the great King Artaxerxes, and <lb/>
            to be master of Persia, than to overthrow the kingdom <lb/>
            of Priam. But as he was sacrificing some Thebans at­ <lb/>
            tacked him, and threw the thighbones of the victims <lb/>
            that were burning off the altar, and drove him out of <lb/>
            the temple. And Agesilaus was grieved at the non-com­ <lb/>
            pletion of the sacrifice, but none the less he crossed <lb/>
            over to Asia Minor and marched for Sardis. Now Lydia <lb/>
            was at this period the greatest province in Lower Asia <lb/>
            Minor, and Sardis was the principal city for wealth and <lb/>
            luxury, and it was the chief residence of the satrap by the <lb/>
            sea, as Susa was the chief residence of the great king. <lb/>
            And fighting a battle with Tissaphernes, the satrap of <lb/>
            Ionia, in the plain near the river Hermus, Agesilaus de­ <lb/>
            feated the Persian cavalry and infantry, though Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes' army was the largest since the expedition of <lb/>
            Xerxes against Athens, and earlier still the expedition of <lb/>
            Darius against the Scythians. And the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            delighted at the success of Agesilaus by land, readily made <lb/>
            him leader of the fleet also. And he put Pisander his <lb/>
            wife's brother, a very stout soldier by land, in command <lb/>
            of the triremes. But some god must have grudged his <lb/>
            bringing things to a happy conclusion. For when Arta­ <lb/>
            xerxes heard of the victorious progress of Agesilaus,' and <lb/>
            how he kept pushing on with his army, not content with <lb/>
            what he had already gained, he condemned Tissaphernes <lb/>
            to death, although he had in former times done him signal <lb/>
            service, and gave his satrapy to Tithraustes, a longheaded <lb/>
            fellow and very able man, who greatly disliked the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonians. Directly he arrived at Sardis, he forthwith <lb/>
            devised means to compel the Lacedemonians to recall their <lb/>
            army from Asia Minor. So he sent Timocrates a native of <lb/>
            Rhodes into Greece with money, bidding him stir up war <lb/>
            against the Lacedemonians in Greece. And those who <lb/>
            received Timocrates' money were it is said Cylon and Soda­ <lb/>
            mas among the Argives, and at Thebes Androclides and <lb/>
            Ismenias and Amphithemis: and the Athenians Cephalus <lb/>
            and Epicrates had a share, and the Corinthians with Argive <lb/>
            proclivities as Polyanthes and Timolaus. But the war was <lb/>
            openly commenced by the Locrians of Amphisse. For the <lb/>
            Locrians had some land which was debated between them <lb/>
            and the Phocians, from this land the Phocians, at the in­ <lb/>
            stigation of the Thebans and Ismenias, cut the ripe corn and <lb/>
            drove off cattle. The Phocians also invaded Locris in full <lb/>
            force, and ravaged the territory. Then the Locrians in­ <lb/>
            vited in the Thebans as their allies, and laid Phocis waste. <lb/>
            And the Phocians went to Lacedæmon and inveighed <lb/>
            against the Thebans, and recounted all that they had suf­ <lb/>
            fered at their hands. And the Lacedemonians determined <lb/>
            to declare war against the Thebans, and among other <lb/>
            charges which they brought against them was their insult <lb/>
            at Aulis to the sacrifice of Agesilaus. And the Athenians, <lb/>
            having heard of the intention of the Lacedemonians, sent <lb/>
            to Sparta, begging them not to war against Thebes, but to <lb/>
            submit their differences to arbitration. And the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians angrily dismissed the embassy. And what <lb/>
            happened subsequently, viz. the expedition of the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonians and the death of Lysander, has been told by <lb/>
            me in reference to Pausanias. And what is known to <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            history as the Corinthian war began with this march into <lb/>
            Boeotia of the Lacedæmonians, and grew into a big war, <lb/>
            and compelled Agesilaus to bring his army home from <lb/>
            Asia Minor. And when he had crossed over in his ships <lb/>
            from Abydos to Sestos, and marched into Thessaly through <lb/>
            Thrace, the Thessalians attempted to bar his way to in­ <lb/>
            gratiate themselves with the Thebans, partly also in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of their long standing friendship with Athens. <lb/>
            And Agesilaus having routed their cavalry marched through <lb/>
            Thessaly, and then through Bceotia, having conquered the <lb/>
            Thebans and their allies at Coronea. And when the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians were routed, some of them fled to the temple of <lb/>
            Athene Itonia : and though Agesilaus was wounded in the <lb/>
            battle, he did not for all that violate their sanctuary.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            XD not long afterwards those Corinthians who had <lb/>
            been exiled for their Lacedæmonian proclivities esta­ <lb/>
            blished the Isthmian games. But those who were at this <lb/>
            time in Corinth remained there from fear of Agesilaus, but <lb/>
            when he broke up his camp and returned to Sparta, then <lb/>
            they also joined the Argives at the Isthmian games. And <lb/>
            Agesilaus came again to Corinth with an army : and, as the <lb/>
            festival of Hyacinthus was coming on, he sent home the <lb/>
            natives of Amyclæ, to go and perform the customary rites <lb/>
            to Apollo and Hyacinthus. This detachment were attacked <lb/>
            on the road and cut to pieces by the Athenians under <lb/>
            Iphicrates. Agesilaus also marched into Ætolia to help <lb/>
            the ޺Ætolians who were hard pressed by the Acarnanians, <lb/>
            and compelled the Acarnanians to bring the war to an <lb/>
            end, when they had all but taken Calydon and the other <lb/>
            fortified towns in Ætolia. And some time afterwards he <lb/>
            sailed to Egypt, to the aid of the Egyptians who had re­ <lb/>
            volted from the great king: and many memorable exploits <lb/>
            did he in Egypt. And he died on the passage home, for <lb/>
            he was now quite an old man. And the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            when they got his dead body, buried it with greater honours <lb/>
            than they had shewn to any of their kings.</p><pb n="188"/>
            
          <p>And during the reign of Archidamus, the son of Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus, the Phocians seized the temple of Apollo at Delphi. <lb/>
            Offers of mercenary aid came privately to the Thebans to <lb/>
            fight against the Phocians, and publicly from the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians and Athenians, the latter remembering the old <lb/>
            kindnesses they had received from the Phocians, and the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians under pretext of friendship, but really as I <lb/>
            think in hostility to the Thebans. And Theopompus, the <lb/>
            son of Damasistratus, said that Archidamus also had a <lb/>
            share of the money at Delphi, and that also Dinichas, his <lb/>
            wife, had received a bribe from the authorities of the <lb/>
            Phocians, and that all this made Archidamus more willing <lb/>
            to bring the Phocians aid. I do not praise receiving <lb/>
            sacred money, and assisting men who made havoc of the <lb/>
            most famous of oracles. But this much I can praise. The <lb/>
            Phocians intended to kill all the young men at Delphi, and <lb/>
            to sell the women and children into slavery, and to raze <lb/>
            the city to its foundations: all this Archidamus success- <lb/>
            fully deprecated. And he afterwards crossed over into <lb/>
            Italy, to assist the people of Tarentum in a war with their <lb/>
            barbarian neighbours : and he was slain there by the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, and his dead body failed to find a tomb through <lb/>
            the wrath of Apollo. And A-is, the cider son of this <lb/>
            Archidamus, met his death fighting against the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians and Antipater. During the reign of Eudamidas the <lb/>
            younger one the Lacedæmonians enjoyed peace. All about <lb/>
            his son Agis, and his grandson Eurydamidas, I have already <lb/>

            name of it Scotitas (dark place) was not derived from the <lb/>
            thickness of the foliage, but from Zeus surnamcd Scotitas, <lb/>
            whose temple is about 10 stades as you turn off the road <lb/>
            to the left. And when you have returned to the road, and <lb/>
            gone forward a little, and turned again to the left, there is <lb/>
            a statue and trophy of Hercules : Hercules erected the <lb/>
            trophy it is said after killing Hippocoon and his sons. <lb/>
            And a third turn from the high road to the right leads to <lb/>
            Caryce and the temple of Artemis. For Caryæ is sacred to <lb/>
            Artemis and the Nymphs, and there is a statue of Artemis <note type="footnote">1 Mentioned ii, 38 ; iii, i. Pausanias now returns to topography. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            of Caryæ in the open air, and here the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            maidens have a festival every year, and hold their national <lb/>
            dances. And as you return to the high road and go <lb/>
            straight on you come to the ruins of Sellasia, which place <lb/>
            (as I have mentioned before) the Achæans reduced to <lb/>
            slavery, when they had conquered in battle the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and their king Cleomenes the son of Leonidas. <lb/>
            And at Thornax, which you next come to, is a statue of <lb/>
            Pythæan Apollo, very similar to the one at Amyclæ, which <lb/>
            I shall describe when I come to Amyclæ. But the one at <lb/>
            Amyclæ is more famous than the Lacedæmonian one, for <lb/>
            the gold which Crœsus the Lydian sent to Pythæan Apollo <lb/>
            was used to adorn it.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>O <lb/>
            N going forward from Thornax, you come to the city <lb/>
            which was originally called Sparta, but afterwards <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, which was once the name of the whole dis­ <lb/>
            trict. And according to my rule which I laid down in my <lb/>
            account about Attica, not to give everything in detail but <lb/>
            to select what was most worthy of account, so I shall deal <lb/>
            in my account of Sparta: for I determined from the out­ <lb/>
            set to pick out the most remarkable of the particulars which <lb/>
            tradition hands down. From this determination I shall <lb/>
            on no occasion deviate. At Sparta there is a handsome <lb/>
            marketplace, and a councilchamber for the Senate, and <lb/>
            public buildings in the marketplace for the Ephors and <lb/>
            guardians of the laws, and for those who are called the <lb/>
            Bidia?i. The Senate is the most powerful governing body <lb/>
            in Sparta, but all these others take part in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment : and the ephors and the Bidiæi are each five in <lb/>
            number, and are appointed to preside over the games of <lb/>
            the young men in the Platanistas and elsewhere, and the <lb/>
            Ephors manage all other important matters, and furnish <lb/>
            one of their number as the Eponymus, who like the magis­ <lb/>
            trates of the same name at Athens presides over the rest. <lb/>
            But the most notable thing in the marketplace is what <lb/>
            they call the Persian Portico, built of the spoils taken from <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            the Medes : and in time they have brought it to its present <lb/>
            size and magnificence. And there are on the pillars statues <lb/>
            in white stone of Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, and other <lb/>
            Persians. There is also a statue of Artemisia, the daughter <lb/>
            of Lygdamis, who was Queen of Halicarnassus : and who <lb/>
            they say of her own accord joined Xerxes in the expedition <lb/>
            against Greece, and displayed great valour in the sea fight <lb/>
            at Salamis. And there are two temples in the market­ <lb/>
            place, one to Cæsar, who was the first of the Romans that <lb/>
            aimed at Autocracy, and established the present regime, <lb/>
            and the other to Augustus his adopted son, who confirmed <lb/>
            the Autocratic rule, and advanced further in consideration <lb/>
            and power even than Cæsar had done. His name Augustus <lb/>
            has the same signification as the Greek Sebastus. At the <lb/>
            altar of Augustus they exhibit a brazen statue of Agias, <lb/>
            who they say foretold Lysander that he would capture all <lb/>
            the Athenian fleet at Ægos-potamoi but ten triremes : they <lb/>
            got off safe to Cyprus, but the Lacedæmonians took all the <lb/>
            rest and their crews. This Agias was the son of Agelo­ <lb/>
            elms, the son of Tisamenus. This last was a native of Elis <lb/>
            of the family of the Iamidæ, who was told by the oracle <lb/>
            that he should win the prize in 5 most notable contests. <lb/>
            So he trained for the pentathlum at Olympia, and came off <lb/>
            the ground unvictorious in that, though he won the prize <lb/>
            in two out of the five, for he beat Hieronymus of Andros <lb/>
            in running and leaping. But having been beaten by him <lb/>
            in wrestling, and losing the victory, he interpreted the <lb/>
            oracle to mean that he would win five victories in war. <lb/>
            And the Lacedæmonians, who were not-ignorant of what <lb/>
            the Pythian priestess had foretold Tisamenus, persuaded <lb/>
            him to leave Elis, and carry out the oracle for the benefit <lb/>
            of the Spartans. And Tisamenus had his five victories, first <lb/>
            at Platæa against the Persians, and secondly at Tegea in a <lb/>
            battle between the Lacedæmonians and the people of Tegea <lb/>
            and the Argives. And next at Dipæa against all the <lb/>
            Arcadians but the Mantinaeans : (Dipæa is a small town <lb/>
            of the Arcadians near Mænalia.) And the fourth victory <lb/>
            was at Ithome against the Helots that had revolted in the <lb/>
            Isthmus. However all the Helots did not revolt, but only <lb/>
            the Messenian portion who had separated themselves from <lb/>
            the original Helots. But I shall enter into all this more <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            fully hereafter. After this victory the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            listening to Tisamenus and the oracle at Delphi, allowed <lb/>
            the rebels to go away on conditions. And the fifth victory <lb/>
            was at Tamagra in a battle against the Argives and Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. Such is the account I heard about Tisamenus. <lb/>
            And the Spartans have in their market-place statues of <lb/>
            Pythæan Apollo, and Artemis, and Leto. And this place <lb/>
            is called Dance-ground because during the Festival of <lb/>
            Gymnopædia,1 (and there is no feast more popular among <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians,) the boys have dances here in honour <lb/>
            of Apollo. And at no great distance are temples of Earth, <lb/>
            and Market Zeus, and Market Athene, and Poseidon whom <lb/>
            they call Asphalius, and Apollo again, and Hera. There is <lb/>
            also a huge statue of a man to represent the People of <lb/>
            Sparta. And the Destinies have a temple at Sparta, near <lb/>
            to which is the tomb of Orestes the son of Agamemnon : <lb/>
            for they say his bones were brought from Tegea and buried <lb/>
            here in accordance with the oracle. And near the tomb of <lb/>
            Orestes is an effigy of Polydorus the son of Alcamenes, <lb/>
            whom of all their kings they so extolled that the govern­ <lb/>
            ment seal all their public documents with Polydorus' <lb/>
            image. There is also a Market Hermes carrying a little <lb/>
            Dionysus, and some antiquities called Ephorea, and among <lb/>
            them memorials of Epimenides the Cretan, and of Apha­ <lb/>
            reus the son of Perieres. And I think the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            account of Epimenides truer than the Argive one. Here <lb/>
            also are statues of the Destinies, and some other statues. <lb/>
            There is also a Hospitable Zeus and a Hospitable Athene.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            S you go from the marketplace on the road which they <lb/>
            call Apheta (starting-place), you come to what is <lb/>
            called Booneta, (Ox-purchased). I must first explain the <lb/>
            name of the road. They say that Icarius proposed a race <lb/>
            for the suitors of Penelope, and that Odysseus won the <lb/>
            prize is clear, and they started they say at the road called <note type="footnote"> 1 Gymnopædia, as its name denotes, was a yearly festival at which <lb/>
            boys danced naked and went through gymnastic exercises. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            Apheta. And I think Icarius imitated Danaus in proposing <lb/>
            this contest. For this was Danaus' plan in regard to his <lb/>
            daughters ; as no one would marry any of them because <lb/>
            of their atrocious crime, Danaus made it known that he <lb/>
            would marry his daughters to any one who should select <lb/>
            them for their beauty without requiring wedding-presents, <lb/>
            but when only a few came to apply he established a race, <lb/>
            and the winner might take his pick of the girls, and the <lb/>
            second the next, and so on to the last in the race: and <lb/>
            the girls still remaining had to wait for a second batch of <lb/>
            suitors and a second race. And what the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            call Booneta on this road, was formerly the house of king <lb/>
            Polydorus: and after Polydorus' death they bought it of <lb/>
            his widow for some oxen. For as yet there was no coinage <lb/>
            either in silver or gold, but in primitive fashion they gave in <lb/>
            barter oxen and slaves, and silver or gold in the lump. And <lb/>
            mariners to India tell us the Indians give in exchange for <lb/>
            Greek commodities various wares, but do not understand <lb/>
            the use of money, and that though they have plenty of <lb/>
            gold and silver. And opposite the public Hall of the <lb/>
            Bidiæi is the temple of Athene, and Odysseus is said to <lb/>
            have put there the statue of the goddess, and called it <lb/>
            Celeuthea, when he outran the suitors of Penelope. And <lb/>
            he built three temples of Celeuthea at some distance <lb/>
            from one another. And along the road called Apheta <lb/>
            there are hero-chapels of lops, who is supposed to have <lb/>
            been a contemporary of Lelex or Myles, and of Am­ <lb/>
            phiaraus the son of CEclees, (and this last they think the <lb/>
            sons of Tyndareus erected as Amphiaraus was their uncle), <lb/>
            and also one of Lelex himself. And not far from these is <lb/>
            the shrine of Taenarian Apollo, for that is his title, and at <lb/>
            no great distance a statue of Athene, which they say was a <lb/>
            votive offering of those who migrated to Italy and Taren­ <lb/>
            tum. And the place which is called Hellenium is so called <lb/>
            because those of the Hellenes (Greeks), who strove to <lb/>
            prevent Xerxes' passing into Europe, deliberated in this <lb/>
            place how they should resist him. But another tradition <lb/>
            says that it was here that those who went to Ilium to <lb/>
            oblige Menelaus deliberated on the best plan for sailing to <lb/>
            Troy, and exacting punishment of Paris for the rape of <lb/>
            Helen. And near Hellenium they exhibit the tomb of <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            Talthybius : as do also the people of Ægæ in Achaia in their <lb/>
            marketplace, who also claim the tomb of Talthybius as <lb/>
            being with them. And the wrath of this Talthybius for <lb/>
            the murder of the envoys, who were sent by King Darius <lb/>
            to Greece to ask for earth and water, was publicly mani­ <lb/>
            fested to the Lacedæmonians, but on the Athenians was <lb/>
            visited privately, and mainly on the house of one man, <lb/>
            Miltiades the son of Cimon, for he was the person responsible <lb/>
            for getting the envoys that came to Attica put to death by <lb/>
            the Athenians. And the Lacedæmonians have an altar of <lb/>
            Apollo Acritas, and a temple of Earth called Gaseptum, and <lb/>
            above it is Apollo Maleates. And at the end of the road <lb/>
            Apheta, and very near the walls, is the temple of Dictynna, <lb/>
            and the royal tombs of the Eurypontidæ. And near Hel­ <lb/>
            lenium is the temple of Arsinoe, the daughter of Leucippus, <lb/>
            and the sister of the wives of Poly deuces and Castor. And <lb/>
            at what is called Garrison there is a temple of Artemis, <lb/>
            and as you go on a little further there is a monument <lb/>
            erected to the prophets from Elis who are called Iamidæ. <lb/>
            And there is a temple of Maro and Alpheus, who, of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians that fought at Thermopylae, seem to have <lb/>
            been reckoned most valiant next to Leonidas. And the <lb/>
            temple of Victory-giving Zeus was erected by the Dorians, <lb/>
            after a victory over the people of Amyclæ and the other <lb/>
            Achæans, who at this time occupied Laconia. And the temple <lb/>
            of the great Mother is honoured especially. And next to <lb/>
            it are hero-chapels of Theseus, and the Arcadian Aulon, and <lb/>
            the son of Tlesimenes: some say that Tlesimenes was the <lb/>
            brother, others the son, of Parthenopæus the son of Melanion.</p>
          <p>And there is another outlet from the marketplace, where <lb/>
            is built the place called Scias, where even now they hold <lb/>
            meetings. This Scias was they say built by the Samian <lb/>
            Theodorus, who was the first discoverer of fusing, and <lb/>
            making statues, in iron. Here the Lacedæmonians hung <lb/>
            up the harp of Milesian Timotheus, censuring him for <lb/>
            adding four chords in harpistry to the old Seven. And <lb/>
            near Scias there is a round building (in which are statues <lb/>
            of Olympian Zeus and Olympian Aphrodite) constructed <lb/>
            they say by Epimenides, of whom they give a different <lb/>
            account to that of the Argives, since they say that the <lb/>
            Argives never fought with the Gnossians.</p><pb n="194"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            OT far from Scias is the tomb of Cynortas the son of <lb/>
            Amyclas, and the monument of Castor, and a temple <lb/>
            to him over it. Castor and Pollux were not they say <lb/>
            reckoned gods till the fortieth year after the battle between <lb/>
            Idas and Lynceus, whose tombs are exhibited at Scias, <lb/>
            though a more probable tradition states that they were <lb/>
            buried in Messenia. But the misfortunes of the Messenians, <lb/>
            and the long time they were away from the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            have made many of their old traditions unknown to pos­ <lb/>
            terity, and since they do not themselves know them for <lb/>
            certain, any one who chooses can doubt. Right opposite <lb/>
            the temple of Olympian Aphrodite the Lacedæmonians have <lb/>
            a temple of Saviour Proserpine, erected some say by the <lb/>
            Thracian Orpheus, others say by Abaris who came from <lb/>
            the Hyperboreans. And Carneus, whom they surname <lb/>
            CEcetes, had honours in Sparta even before the return of <lb/>
            the Heraclidæ, and a statue was erected to him in the <lb/>
            house of Crius, the son of Theocles the prophet. As the <lb/>
            daughter of this Crius was drawing water, some Dorian <lb/>
            spies met her and had a conversation with her, and went <lb/>
            to Crius, and'learnt of him the way to capture Sparta. <lb/>
            And the worship of Carnean Apollo was established among <lb/>
            all the Dorians by Carnus, an Acarnanian by race and the <lb/>
            prophet of Apollo : and when he was slain by Hippotes the <lb/>
            son of Phylas the heavy wrath of Apollo fell upon the <lb/>
            camp of the Dorians, and Hippotes had to flee for this <lb/>
            . murder, and the Dorians determined to propitiate the <lb/>
            Acarnanian prophet by sacred rites. But indeed it is not <lb/>
            this Carnean CEcetes, but the son of the prophet Crius <lb/>
            that was honoured while the Achæans still held Sparta. <lb/>
            It has indeed been written by Praxilla in her verses that <lb/>
            Carneus was the son of Europa, and that Apollo and Leto <lb/>
            brought him up. But there is another tradition recorded <lb/>
            of him, that the Greeks cut down on Trojan Ida some <lb/>
            cornel trees that grew in the grove of Apollo to make the <lb/>
            Wooden Horse : and when they learnt of the anger of the <lb/>
            god against them for this sacrilege, they propitiated him <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            with sacrifices and called him Carnean Apollo from these <lb/>
            cornel trees, transposing the letter p according to ancient <lb/>
            custom.1</p>
          <p>And not far from Carnean Apollo is the statue of Aphe­ <lb/>
            tæus : where they say the suitors of Penelope started for <lb/>
            their race. And there is a place which has porticos forming <lb/>
            a square, where nicknacks in old times used to be sold : at <lb/>
            this place is an altar of Ambulian Zeus and Ambulian <lb/>
            Athene, and also of Ambulian Castor and Pollux. And <lb/>
            right opposite is what is called Colona (Hill), and a temple <lb/>
            of Zeus of Colona, and near it the grove of the hero, who <lb/>
            they say showed Dionysus the way to Sparta. And the <lb/>
            women called Dionysiades and Leucippides sacrifice to this <lb/>
            hero before they sacrifice to the god himself. But the other <lb/>
            eleven women, whom they also call Dionysiades, have a race <lb/>
            specially appointed for them : this custom came from Delphi. <lb/>
            And not far from the temple of Dionysus is that of Zens <lb/>
            Euanemus, and on the right of this is the hero chapel of <lb/>
            Neuron. On the mother's side the sons of Tyndareus were <lb/>
            descended from Pleuron, for Areus says in his poems that <lb/>
            Thestius, the father of Leda, was the son of Agenor and <lb/>
            grandson of Pleuron. And not far from this hero chapel is <lb/>
            hill, and on the hill is a temple of Argive Hera, erected <unclear/> <lb/>
            they say by Eurydice the daughter of Lacedæmon, and the <unclear/> <lb/>
            rife of Acrisius the son of Abas. And the temple of <lb/>
            yperchirian Hera was built according to the oracle, when <lb/>
            he Eurotas overflowed a considerable part of the country. <lb/>
            And the old wooden statue they call that of Aphrodite Hera, <lb/>
            nd when a daughter is married it is customary for mothers <lb/>
            o sacrifice to that goddess. And on the road to the right <lb/>
            )f this hill is an effigy of Etœmocles. He and his father <lb/>
            Hipposthenes won prizes for wrestling at Olympia, the <lb/>
            ather on eleven occasions, the son on twelve. <note type="footnote"> 1 The cornel tree is in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράνεια</foreign>. Transposition of the p will <lb/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            S yon go westwards from the marketplace is the <lb/>
            cenotaph of Brasidas the son of Tellis, and at no <lb/>
            great distance a theatre in white stone well worth seeing. <lb/>
            And opposite the theatre are the tombs of Pausanias the <lb/>
            General at Platæa, and of Leonidas : and every year they <lb/>
            have speeches over them, and a contest in which none but <lb/>
            Spartans may compete. The remains of Leonidas were 40 <lb/>
            years after his death removed from Thermopylæ by Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias, and there is a pillar with the names and pedigree <lb/>
            of those who fought against the Medes at Thermopylæ. <lb/>
            And there is in Sparta a place called Theomelida, where <lb/>
            are the tombs of the kings descended from Agis, and at no <lb/>
            great distance is what is called the Lounge of the Crotani; <lb/>
            who belong to the Pitanatæ. And not far from this <lb/>
            Lounge is the temple of Æsculapius, called the temple <lb/>
            among the tombs of the descendants of Agis. And as you <lb/>
            go on you come to the tomb of Tænarus, from whom they <lb/>
            say the promontory Tænarum gets its name. And there <lb/>
            are temples of Hippocurian Poseidon and Æginetan Arte­ <lb/>
            mis. And as you retrace your steps to the Lounge is the <lb/>
            temple of Artemis Issora, they also call her Limnæa, though <lb/>
            she is not called Artemis but Britomartis by the Cretans, but <lb/>
            about her I shall speak when I come to Ægina. And very <lb/>
            near the tombs of the descendants of Agis you will see a <lb/>
            pillar, and inscribed on it are the victories which Chionis a <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian carried off in the course, and others which <lb/>
            he won at Olympia. For there he had seven victories, <lb/>
            four in the course, and three in the double course. The <lb/>
            shield race at the end of the sports was not then instituted. <lb/>
            Chionis also took part they say with Theræan Battus <lb/>
            in founding Cyrene, and in ejecting the neighbouring <lb/>
            Libyans. And they allege the following as the reason why <lb/>
            the temple of Thetis was built. When they were fighting <lb/>
            against the Messenians who had revolted, and their king <lb/>
            Anaxander invaded Messenia and took captive some women, <lb/>
            and among them Cleo the priestess of Thetis, Anaxander's <lb/>
            wife Leandris begged Cleo of her husband, and she found <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            Cleo in possession of a wooden statue of Thetis, and joined <lb/>
            her in building a temple to the goddess: and Leandris <lb/>
            built this according to the pattern which she saw in a <lb/>
            dream : and the old wooden statue of Thetis they keep in <lb/>
            a private place. And the Lacedæmonians say they were <lb/>
            taught to worship Demeter Chthonia by Orpheus, but I <lb/>
            am of opinion that the temple at Hermion taught them this <lb/>
            worship of Demeter Chthonia. The Spartans have also a <lb/>
            very recent temple of Serapis, and another of Olympian <lb/>
            Zens.</p>
          <p>And the Lacedæmonians give the name Dromus to the <lb/>
            place where it is customary still for the young men to <lb/>
            practise in running. As you go to this Dromus from the <lb/>
            tomb of the descendants of A,-is you see on the left hand <lb/>
            the sepulchre of Eumedes, who was the son of Hippocoon, <lb/>
            and an old statue of Hercules, to whom the Spartan youths <lb/>
            called Sphærei sacrifice. This name is given to the lads <lb/>
            who are just growing to manhood.1 There are also gym­ <lb/>
            nasiums in Dromus, one the offering of the Spartan <lb/>
            Eurycles. And outside Dromus, and opposite the statue <lb/>
            of Hercules, is a house which now belongs to a private <lb/>
            person, but was of old the house of Menelaus. And <lb/>
            as you go on from Dromus you come to the temples of <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux, and the Graces, and Ilithyia, and <lb/>
            Carnean Apollo, and Sovereign Artemis. And on the right <lb/>
            of Dromus is a temple of Æsculapius surnamed Agnitas <lb/>
            (Willowy), because the god's statue is made of willow, of <lb/>
            the same kind as that called rhamnus: and at no great <lb/>
            distance is a trophy, which they say Polydeuces put up <lb/>
            after his victory over Lynceus. And this confirms in my <lb/>
            opinion the probability that the sons of Aphareus were <lb/>
            not buried at Sparta. Near the beginning of Dromus are <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux of the Startingpoint, and as you go a <lb/>
            little way further is the hero-chapel of Alco, who they say <lb/>
            was the son of Hippocoon. And next to the hero-chapel of <lb/>
            Alco is the temple of Poseidon whom they surname Doma­ <lb/>
            tites. And there is a place called Platanistas from the <lb/>
            plane-trees which grow high and continuous round it. And <lb/>
            this place, where it is customary for the young men to have <note type="footnote"> 1 It means boxers, or football players. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            their fights, is surrounded by water as an island is by the <lb/>
            sea, and you enter it by bridges. On one side of these <lb/>
            bridges is a statue of Hercules, and on the other one of <lb/>
            Lycurgus, who not only legislated for the state generally <lb/>
            but even for the fights of the youths. And the youths have <lb/>
            the following customs also. They sacrifice before their <lb/>
            fights in the temple of Phœbus, which is outside the city <lb/>
            and not very far from Therapne. Here each division of <lb/>
            the young men sacrifice a puppy dog to Enyalius,l deeming <lb/>
            the most valiant of domesticated animals a suitable victim <lb/>
            to the most valiant of the gods. And I know no other <lb/>
            Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppy dogs except <lb/>
            the Colophonians, who sacrifice a black puppy to Enodius. <lb/>
            The sacrifices both of the Colophonians and also of these <lb/>
            young men at Lacedaemon take place by night. And after <lb/>
            their sacrifice the young men pit together tame boars to <lb/>
            fight, whichever boar gets the victory, the party to which <lb/>
            it belongs are generally victorious at Platanistas. This <lb/>
            is what they do in the temple of Phoebus : and on the next <lb/>
            day a little before noon they cross the bridges to Plata­ <lb/>
            nistas. And the approach for each division is appointed <lb/>
            by lot the night before. And they fight with hands and <lb/>
            feet, and bite and tear one another's eyes out. So they <lb/>
            fight, and violently attack one another full tilt, and push <lb/>
            one another into the water.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            EAR Platanistas there is a hero-chapel of Cynisca, the <lb/>
            daughter of Archidamus king of Sparta: she was <lb/>
            the first woman who trained horses, and the first woman <lb/>
            who won the chariot-race at Olympia. And behind the <lb/>
            portico near Platanistas are several other hero-chapels, one <lb/>
            of Alcimus, and another of Enaræphorus, and at no great <lb/>
            distance one of Dorceus, and above this one of Sebrus. <lb/>
            These they say were sons of Hippocoon. And from Dorceus <lb/>
            they call the fountain near the hero-chapel Dorcea, and <lb/>
            from Sebrus they call the place Sebrium. And on the <note type="footnote"> 1 A name for Ares the god of war, the Latin Mars. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            right of Sebrium is the sepulchre of Alcman, the sweet­ <lb/>
            ness of whose poems was not injured by the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            dialect, though it is the least euphonious. And there are <lb/>
            temples of Helen and Hercules, hers near the tomb of <lb/>
            Alcman, and his very near the walls with a statue in it of <lb/>
            Hercules armed : Hercules was so represented in the statue <lb/>
            they say because of his fight against Hippocoon and his <lb/>
            sons. The animosity of Hercules against the family of <lb/>
            Hippocoon originated they say in that, after killing Iphitus, <lb/>
            when he came to Sparta to clear himself, they refused to <lb/>
            clear him. The following matter also contributed to the <lb/>
            beginning of strife. CEonus a lad, and nephew of Hercules, <lb/>
            for he was the son of Alcmena's brother, accompanied <lb/>
            Hercules to Sparta, and as he was going round and looking <lb/>
            at the city, when he was opposite the house of Hippocoon, <lb/>
            a watch do- jumped out on him, and CEonus chanced to <lb/>
            throw a stone and hit the do-. Then the sons of Hippocoon <lb/>
            ran out, and struck CEonus with clubs till they had killed <lb/>
            him. At this Hercules was furious against Hippocoon and <lb/>
            his sons, and immediately (so angry was he) attacked them. <lb/>
            For the moment he retired as he was wounded, but after­ <lb/>
            wards he brought others with him to Sparta to avenge <lb/>
            himself on Hippocoon and his sons for the murder of <lb/>
            CEonus. And the sepulchre of CEonus was erected near the <lb/>
            temple of Hercules. And as you go eastwards from Dromus <lb/>
            there is a, path on the right hand to the temple of Athene <lb/>
            under the title of Exactor of due punishment. For when <lb/>
            Hercules took on Hippocoon and his sons adequate ven­ <lb/>
            geance for what they had done, he built this temple to <lb/>
            Athene under the title of Exactor of due punishment, for <lb/>
            the old race of men called revenge punishment., And there <lb/>
            is another temple of Athene as you go on another road from <lb/>
            Dromus, erected they say by Theras the son of Autesion, <lb/>
            the son of Tisamenus, the son of Thersander: when he sent <lb/>
            a colony to the island which is now called Thera after him, <lb/>
            but was of old called Calliste. And hard by is the temple <lb/>
            of Hipposthenes who carried off most of the wrestling prizes, <lb/>
            and whom they worship according to the oracle, as if they <lb/>
            were awarding honours to Poseidon. And right opposite <note type="footnote"> 1 So Bacon calls revenge ' a kind of wild justice.' Essay iv. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            this temple is Enyalius in fetters, an old statue. And the <lb/>
            opinion of the Lacedaemonians about this statue and about <lb/>
            that of the Athenians called Wingless Victory is the same, <lb/>
            viz. that Enyalius will never depart from the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians as being fettered, just as Victory will always remain <lb/>
            with the Athenians because she has no wings to fly away. <lb/>
            Athens and Lacedaemon have erected these statues on <lb/>
            similar principles and with a similar belief. And at Sparta <lb/>
            there is a Lounge called the Painted Lounge, and various <lb/>
            hero-chapels near it, as of Cadmus the son of Agenor, and <lb/>
            his descendants, CEolycus the son of Theras, and Ægeus the <lb/>
            son of CEolycus. And they say these hero-chapels were <lb/>
            built by Mæsis, Læas, and Enropas, who are said to have <lb/>
            been the sons of Hyræus and grandsons of ,Egeus. And <lb/>
            they built also a hero-chapel to Amphilochus, because their <lb/>
            ancestor Tisamenus was the son of Demonassa, the sister of <lb/>
            Amphilochus. And the Lacedaemonians are the only Greeks <lb/>
            with whom it is customary to call Hera Goateater and <lb/>
            to sacrifice goats to her. And Hercules they say built <lb/>
            a temple and sacrificed goats to her first, because when <lb/>
            he was fighting against Hippocoon and his sons he met with <lb/>
            no obstacle from Hera, though he thought the goddess <lb/>
            opposed him on all other occasions. And they say he <lb/>
            sacrificed goats to her as being in difficulty about getting <lb/>
            any other victims. And not far from the theatre is the <lb/>
            temple of Tutelary Poseidon and hero-chapels of Cleodaeus <lb/>
            the son of Hyllus, and of CEbalus. And the most notable of <lb/>
            the Spartan temples of Æsculapius is at Booneta, on the <lb/>
            left of which is the hero-chapel of Teleclus, of whom I <lb/>
            shall give an account when I come to Messenia. And <lb/>
            when you have gone forward a little further there is a hill <lb/>
            not very high, and on it an old temple Iand wooden statue <lb/>
            of Aphrodite in full armour. This is the only templeI <lb/>
            know which has an upper story built above it, and in this <lb/>
            upper story is a shrine of Aphrodite under the title of The <lb/>
            Shapely, the goddess is seated with a veil on and fetters on <lb/>
            her feet. They say Tyndareus added the fetters, symbo <lb/>
            lising by those bonds the bonds of love, that unite men <lb/>
            so powerfully to women. For as to the other tradition <lb/>
            that Tyndareus punished the goddess by fetters, because <lb/>
            he thought his daughters' disgrace had come from th <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            goddess, this I don't at all accept: for it would have been <lb/>
            altogether childish to make a small figure of cedar-wood <lb/>
            and call it Aphrodite, and then think in punishing it one <lb/>
            was punishing the goddess !</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XVI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND hard by is the temple of Hilaira and Phœbe, who <lb/>
            the writer of the Cyprian poems says were the <lb/>
            daughters of Apollo. And their priestesses are maidens, <lb/>
            called also Leucippides as well as the goddesses. One of <lb/>
            their statues was touched up by a priestess of the goddesses, <lb/>
            who with an art not unknown in our days put a new face <lb/>
            on the old statue, but a dream prevented her treating the <lb/>
            other statue in the same way. Here is hung up an egg, <lb/>
            fastened to the roof by fillets; they say it is the egg which <lb/>
            Leda is said to have laid. And every year the women <lb/>
            weave a coat for Apollo at Amyclæ, and they call the place <lb/>
            where they weave it Goat. Near the temple is a house <lb/>
            which they say the sons of Tyndareus originally lived in, <lb/>
            but afterwards Phormio a Spartan got possession of it. <lb/>
            To him Castor and Pollux came as strangers, they said <lb/>
            they had come from Cyrene and desired to lodge at his <lb/>
            house, and asked for a chamber, (with which they were <lb/>
            greatly pleased), as long as they should remain at Sparta. <lb/>
            But he bade them go to some other house where they <lb/>
            might like to dwell, he could not give them that chamber, <lb/>
            for it was the apartment of his daughter a maiden. And <lb/>
            the next day maiden and her attendants had all vanished, <lb/>
            but statues of Castor and Pollux were found in the <lb/>
            chamber, and a table with some assa-fœtida on it. Such <lb/>
            at least is the tradition.</p>
          <p>And as you go to the gates from the place called Coat <lb/>
            there is a hero-chapel of Chilo, who was accounted one of <lb/>
            the seven wise men, and of an Athenian hero who accom­ <lb/>
            panied Dorieus, the son of Anaxandrides, on the expedition <lb/>
            to colonize Sicily. And they put in at Eryx thinking that <lb/>
            district belonged to the descendants of Hercules, and not <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            to barbarians who really held it. For there is a tradition <lb/>
            that Eryx and Hercules wrestled on the following condi­ <lb/>
            tions, that if Hercules conquered the land of Eryx should <lb/>
            be his, but if Eryx conquered the oxen of Geryon, (which <lb/>
            Hercules was then driving,) should be his, for these oxen <lb/>
            had swum across to Sicily from the promontory at Scylla,1 <lb/>
            and Hercules had crossed over after them to find them, and <lb/>
            Eryx should have them if he came off victor. But the <lb/>
            good will of the gods did not speed Dorieus the son of <lb/>
            Anaxandrides as it had done Hercules, for Hercules killed <lb/>
            Eryx, but the people of Segeste nearly annihilated Dorieus <lb/>
            and his army. And the Lacedaemonians have built a <lb/>
            temple to their legislator Lycurgus as to a god. And <lb/>
            behind this temple is the tomb of Eucosmus, the son of <lb/>
            Lycurgus, near the altar of Lathria and Anaxandra, who <lb/>
            were twins, (and the sons of Aristodemus who married <lb/>
            them'were also twins), and the daughters of Thersander <lb/>
            the son of Agamedidas, the king of the Cleestonæans, and <lb/>
            the great grandson of Ctesippus the son of Hercules. And <lb/>
            right opposite the temple are the tombs of Theopompus the <lb/>
            son of Nicander, and Eurybiades, who fought against the <lb/>
            Medes in the Lacedaemonian gallies at Artemisium and <lb/>
            Salamis. And hard-by is what is called the hero-chapel <lb/>
            of Astrabacus.</p>
          <p>And the place called Limnæum is the temple of Orthian <lb/>
            Artemis. The wooden statue of the goddess is they say <lb/>
            the very one which Orestes and Iphigenia formerly stole <lb/>
            from the Tauric Chersonese. And the Lacedæmonians say <lb/>
            it was brought to their country when Orestes was king <lb/>
            there. And their account seems to me more probable than <lb/>
            the account of the Athenians.. For why should Iphigenia <lb/>
            have left the statue at Brauron ? And when the Athenians <lb/>
            were preparing to leave the place, would they not have pu <lb/>
            it on board ship ? And so great still is the fame of Tauri <lb/>
            Artemis, that the Cappodocians who live near the Euxine <lb/>
            claim that the statue was theirs, and the Lydians who <lb/>
            have a temple of Anaitian Artemis make the same claim <lb/>
            But it appears it was neglected by the Athenians and <lb/>
            became a prey to the Medes : for it was carried from <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading the emendation of SylbuTgius <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὸ Σκύλλαιον τὴν <lb/>

            Brauron to Snsa, and afterwards the Syrians of Laodicea <lb/>
            received it from Seleucus and still have it. And the <lb/>
            following facts plainly prove to me that the Orthian <lb/>
            Artemis at Lacedæmon is the same wooden statue which <lb/>
            was taken from the barbarians: that Astrabacus and <lb/>
            Alopecus, (the sons of Irbus, the son of Amphisthenes, the <lb/>
            son of Amphicles, the son of Agis), when they found the <lb/>
            statue immediately went mad; and also that the Limnatae <lb/>
            among the Spartans, and the people of Cynosura, Mesoa, <lb/>
            and Pitane, who were sacrificing to Artemis, had a quarrel <lb/>
            and even went so far as to kill one another, and after <lb/>
            many were killed at the altar a pestilence destroyed the <lb/>
            rest. And after that an oracle bade them sprinkle human <lb/>
            blood over the altar. And instead of a person drawn by <lb/>
            lot being sacrificed, Lycurgus changed it to flogging the <lb/>
            young men there, and so the altar got sprinkled with <lb/>
            human blood. And the priestess stands by during the <lb/>
            operation, holding the wooden statue, which is generally <lb/>
            light from its smallness, but if the scourgers spare any <lb/>
            young man at all in his flogging either on account of his <lb/>
            beauty or rank, then this wooden statue in the priestess' <lb/>
            hand becomes heavy and no longer easy to hold, and she <lb/>
            makes complaint of the scourgers and says it is so heavy <lb/>
            owing to them. So innate is it with this statue, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the sacrifices at the Tauric Chersonese, to <lb/>
            delight in human blood. And they not only call the <lb/>
            goddess Orthia, but also Bound-with-willow-twigs, because <lb/>
            the statue was found in a willow bush, and the willows <lb/>
            so tenaciously twined round it that they kept it in an <lb/>
            upright posture.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND not far from that of Orthian Artemis is the temple <lb/>
            of Ilithyia : this temple they say was built, and <lb/>
            Ilithyia accounted a goddess, in obedience to the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi. And the Lacedæmonians have no citadel rising to <lb/>
            a notable height, as the Cadmea at Thebes, or Larissa <lb/>
            among the Arrives: but as there are several hills in the <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            city the highest of these is called the citadel. Here is <lb/>
            erected a temple of Athene called Poliuchus and Chalciœ­ <lb/>
            cus. And this temple began to be built they say by <lb/>
            Tyndareus : and after his death his sons wished to finish <lb/>
            the building, and they had an opportunity in the spoils <lb/>
            from Aphidne. But as they too died before the conclusion <lb/>
            of the work, the Lacedaemonians many years afterwards <lb/>
            completed the temple, and made a statue of Athene in brass. <lb/>
            And the artificer was Gitiadas a native of Sparta, who also <lb/>
            composed Doric poems and a hymn to the goddess. Many <lb/>
            too of the Labours of Hercules are delineated in brass, and <lb/>
            many of his successes on his own account, and several of <lb/>
            the actions of Castor and Pollux, and their carrying off <lb/>
            the daughters of Leucippus, and Hephæstus freeing his <lb/>
            mother from her bonds. I have given an explanation of <lb/>
            all these before, and the legends about them, in my account <lb/>
            of Attica. There too are the Nymphs giving Perseus, as <lb/>
            he is starting for Libya and Medusa, the invisible cap, <lb/>
            and the sandals with which he could fly through the air. <lb/>
            There too are representations of the birth of Athene, and <lb/>
            of Amphitrite, and Poseidon, which are the largest and as <lb/>
            it seems to me finest works of art.</p>
          <p>There is also another temple there of Athene the Worker. <lb/>
            At the South Porch there is also a temple of Zeus called <lb/>
            the Arranger, and the tomb of Tyndareus in front of it. <lb/>
            And the West Porch has two Eagles and two Victories <lb/>
            to correspond, the votive offering of Lysander, and a <lb/>
            record of his two famous exploits, the one near Ephesus <lb/>
            when he defeated Antiochus, the pilot of Alcibiades, and the <lb/>
            Athenian gallies, and the other at Ægospotamoi where he <lb/>
            crushed the Athenian navy. And at the left of Athene <lb/>
            Chalcioecus they have built a temple of the Muses, because <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians do not go out to battle to the sound of <lb/>
            the trumpet, but to the music of flutes and lyre and harp. <lb/>
            And behind Athene Chalciœcus is the temple of Martial <lb/>
            Aphrodite. Her wooden statues are as old as any among <lb/>
            the Greeks.</p>
          <p>And on the right of Athene Chalciœcus is a statue of <lb/>
            Supreme Zeus, the most ancient of all brass statues, for <lb/>
            it is not carved in one piece, but forged piece by piece <lb/>
            and deftly welded together, and studs keep it together <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            from falling to pieces. The artificer was they say Clearchus <lb/>
            a man of Rhegium, who some say was the pupil of Dipcenus <lb/>
            and Scyllis, others say of Dædalus. And at what is called <lb/>
            the Scenoma there is a figure of a woman, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians say it is Euryleonis, who won the prize at Olympia <lb/>
            with a pair of horses.</p>
          <p>And near the altar of Athene Chalcicecus are erected <lb/>
            two figures of Pausanias the General at Platæa. His fate <lb/>
            I shall not relate to people who know it, for what I have <lb/>
            written before is quite sufficient. I shall merely therefore <lb/>
            state what I heard from a man of Byzantium, that Pausanias <lb/>
            was detected plotting, and was the only one of those that <lb/>
            took sanctuary with Athene Chalcicecus that did not get <lb/>
            indemnity, and that for no other reason than that he could <lb/>
            not clear himself of the guilt of murder. For when he <lb/>
            was at the Hellespont in command of the allied fleet, he got <lb/>
            enamoured of a Byzantian maiden called Cleonice, and at <lb/>
            nightfall a detachment of his men brought her to him. <lb/>
            And Pausanias had fallen asleep, and when this maiden <lb/>
            came into the room she knocked down inadvertently the <lb/>
            light that was burning, and the noise woke him. And <lb/>
            Pausanias, whose conscience smote him for having betrayed <lb/>
            Greece, and who was therefore always in a state of nervous <lb/>
            alarm and panic, was beside himself and stabbed the maiden <lb/>
            with a scimetar. This guilt Pausanias could not clear <lb/>
            himself from, though he endeavoured in every way to <lb/>
            propitiate Zeus the Acquitter, and even went to Phigalia <lb/>
            in Arcadia to the necromancers, but he paid to Cleonice <lb/>
            and the deity the fit penalty. And the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            at the bidding of the oracle made brazen statues for the <lb/>
            god Epidotes, and otherwise honoured him, because he it <lb/>
            was who in the case of Pausanias turned aside the wrath <lb/>
            of Zeus the god of Suppliants.</p>

          <p>N <lb/>
            EAR the two figures of Pausanias is a statue of Youth­ <lb/>
            prolonging Aphrodite, made at the bidding of an <lb/>
            oracle, and statues of bleep and Death. People have <lb/>
            reckoned them to be brothers according to Homer's lines <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            in the Iliad.1 And on the way to Alpium as it is called <lb/>
            you come to the temple of Athene the Eye-preserver, <lb/>
            erected they say by Lycurgus who had one of his eyes <lb/>
            knocked out by Alcander, because he did not find Lycur­ <lb/>
            gus' legislation agreeable. And he took refuge at this <lb/>
            place, and the Lacedemonians prevented his losing his <lb/>
            remaining eye, so he built a temple to Athene the Eye-pre­ <lb/>
            server. And as you go on from thence you come to the <lb/>
            temple of Amnion. The Lacedemonians seem from time <lb/>
            immemorial to have used his oracle in Libya most of all the <lb/>
            Greeks. And it is said that, when Lysander was besieging <lb/>
            Aphytis in Pallene, Amnion appeared to him by night, and <lb/>
            told him it would be better for him and Lacedæmon to <lb/>
            raise the siege. And accordingly he did so, and induced the <lb/>
            Lacedemonians to honour the god even more than before. <lb/>
            And the people of Aphytis honour Ammon as much as the <lb/>
            Ammonians themselves in Libya. And the following is <lb/>
            the tradition about Cnagian Artemis. Cnageus they say <lb/>
            was a native of Sparta, and went on the expedition against <lb/>
            Aphidna with Castor and Pollux, and was taken prisoner <lb/>
            in the battle and sold into slavery in Crete, and was slave <lb/>
            at the temple of Artemis in Crete, and in course of time <lb/>
            ran off with the priestess who also took with her the image <lb/>
            of the goddess. This is why they call her Cnagian Artemis. <lb/>
            But I cannot help thinking this Cnageus must have gone <lb/>
            to Crete in some other way, and not as the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            say, for I do not think a battle was fought at Aphidna, as <lb/>
            Theseus was detained in Thesprotia, and the Athenians <lb/>
            were not'unanimous for him, but inclined rather to Menes­ <lb/>
            thens. Not but that, if a contest took place, one might <lb/>
            readily believe that prisoners were taken by the conquerors, <lb/>
            especially as it was a decisive victory, for Aphidna was <lb/>
            captured. Let this suffice for the subject.</p>
          <p>On the road from Sparta to Amyclæ you come to the <lb/>
            river Tiasa. Tiasa was they think the daughter of Eurotas, <lb/>
            and near the river is a temple of the Graces Phaenna and <lb/>
            Clete, whom Alcman has celebrated. And they think that <lb/>
            Lacedæmon erected this temple to the Graces and gave <lb/>
            them these names. The things worth seeing at Amyclæ are <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xiv. 231. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            the statue of Ænetus on a pillar (he won all the prizes in <lb/>
            the pentathlum, and died they say directly after being <lb/>
            crowned for his victory at Olympia,) and some brazen <lb/>
            tripods, three 1 of which are older they say than the <lb/>
            Messenian War. Under the first of these is a statue of <lb/>
            Aphrodite, under the second one of Artemis, both the design <lb/>
            and work of Gitiadas. And the third is by Gallon of Ægina, <lb/>
            and under it is a statue of Proserpine the daughter of <lb/>
            Demeter. And the Parian Aristander has represented a <lb/>
            woman with a lyre to signify Sparta no doubt, and Poly­ <lb/>
            cletus the Argive has represented Aphrodite called the <lb/>
            Aphrodite near Amyclæan Apollo. These 3 tripods are <lb/>
            bigger than any of the rest, and were dedicated in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the victory at Ægos-Potamoi. And Bathycles <lb/>
            the Magnesian, who made the throne of Amyclæan Apollo, <lb/>
            also carved some of the Graces on the throne and a statue of <lb/>
            Artemis Leucophryene. Who he learnt his art from, or <lb/>
            in whose reign he made this throne I pass by, but I have <lb/>
            seen it and will describe it. Before and behind it are two <lb/>
            Graces and two Seasons, on the left is the Hydra and <lb/>
            Typhos, and on the right the Tritons. But to narrate <lb/>
            every detail of this work of art would tire my readers, to <lb/>
            make therefore a short summary, since most are well <lb/>
            known, Poseidon and Zeus are carrying off Taygetes, the <lb/>
            daughter of Atlas, and her sister Alcyone. There also is <lb/>
            Atlas delineated, and the combat between Hercules and <lb/>
            Cycnus, and the fight of the Centaurs with Pholus. There <lb/>
            too is the Minotaur represented by Bathycles (I know not <lb/>
            why) as fettered and led alive by Theseus. And there is a <lb/>
            dance of Phæacians on the throne, and Demodocus is <lb/>
            singing. There too is Perseus' victory overMedusa. And <lb/>
            not to mention the contest of Hercules with the giant <lb/>
            Thurius, and of Tyndareus with Eurytus, there is the rape <lb/>
            of the daughters of Leucippus. And there is Hermes <lb/>
            carrying to heaven Dionysus as a boy, and Athene taking <lb/>
            Hercules to dwell among the gods. And there is Peleus <lb/>
            handing over Achilles for his education to Chiron, who is <lb/>
            said to have been his tutor. And there is Cephalus carried <lb/>
            off by Aurora for his beauty. And there are the gods <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρει̃ς</foreign> with Facius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            bringing their gifts at the wedding of Harmony. There <lb/>
            too is the single combat between Achilles and Memnon, and <lb/>
            Hercules slaying Diomede, King of Thrace, and Nessus by <lb/>
            the river Evenus, and Hermes bringing up the goddesses <lb/>
            to Paris for the trial of beauty, and Adrastus and Tydeus <lb/>
            stopping the fight between Amphiarus and Lycurgus the <lb/>
            son of Pronax. And Hera is gazing at Io already changed <lb/>
            into a heifer, and Athene is running away from the pursuit <lb/>
            of Hephæstus. There too is Hercules fighting with the <lb/>
            hydra, and bringing up Cerberus from Hades. There too <lb/>
            are Anaxis and Mnasinous each of them on horseback, and <lb/>
            Megapenthes, the son of Menelaus, and Nicostratus both on <lb/>
            one horse. And there is Bellerophon killing the Chimæra <lb/>
            in Lycia, and Hercules driving off the cattle of Geryon. <lb/>
            And on each side of the upper portions of the throne are <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux on horseback : under their horses are <lb/>
            some Sphinxes and some wild beasts running above, on <lb/>
            Castor's side a leopard, but near Pollux a lioness. And at <lb/>
            the very top of the throne is a company of the Magnesians <lb/>
            who assisted Bathycles in this work of art. And if you go <lb/>
            under the throne to see its interior parts where the Tritons <lb/>
            are, there is the boar of Calydon, and Hercules slaying the <lb/>
            sons of Actor, and Calais and Zetes driving away the <lb/>
            Harpies from Phineus, and Pirithous and Theseus carrying <lb/>
            off Helen, and Hercules throttling the Nemean lion. And <lb/>
            there are Apollo and Artemis transfixing Tityus. And <lb/>
            there is the contest of Hercules with the Centaur Oreus, <lb/>
            and of Theseus with the Minotaur, and the wrestling of <lb/>
            Hercules with Achelous, and Hera bound by Hephæstus as <lb/>
            the story goes, and the games established by Acastus in <lb/>
            memory of his father, and what we read in the Odyssey <lb/>
            about Menelaus and the Egyptian Proteus. Lastly there <lb/>
            is Admetus yoking to his chariot a boar and a lion, and the <lb/>
            Trojans making their offerings at the grave of Hector.</p><pb n="209"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            S to the seat for the god on this throne, it is not <lb/>
            one continuous surface but has several partitions with <lb/>
            intervals between them. The largest partition is in the <lb/>
            middle, where there is a statue about 30 cubits high I con­ <lb/>
            jecture, for no one has taken its measure. And this is not <lb/>
            by Bathycles but an ancient and inartistic production, for <lb/>
            except the face toes and hands it resembles a brazen pillar. <lb/>
            There is a helmet on its head, and a lance and bow in its <lb/>
            hands. And the base of the statue is like an altar, and <lb/>
            they say Hyacinthus is buried there, and at the festival of <lb/>
            Hyacinthns, before they sacrifice to Apollo, they make offer­ <lb/>
            ings to Hyacinthus on this altar through a brazen door which <lb/>
            is on the left of the altar. And carved npon this altar are <lb/>
            effigies of Bins and Amphitrite and Poseidon, and Zeus <lb/>
            and Hermes talking together, and near them Dionysus and <lb/>
            Semele, and near Semele Ino. On this altar too are effigies <lb/>
            of Demeter and Proserpine and Pluto, the Destinies and <lb/>
            the Seasons, Aphrodite and Athene and Artemis; and they <lb/>
            are carrying to heaven Hyacinthus and his sister Polybcea <lb/>
            who they say died a virgin. Hyacinthus has a small beard, <lb/>
            and Nicias the son of Nicomedes has represented him as <lb/>
            very handsome, hinting at the love of Apollo for him. <lb/>
            There is also a representation of Hercules being taken to <lb/>
            heaven by Athene and the other gods; as also effigies of <lb/>
            the daughters of Thestius and the Muses and the Seasons. <lb/>
            As to the Zephyr, and the story of Hyacinth having been <lb/>
            accidentally slain by Apollo, and the legends about the <lb/>
            flower Hyacinth, the traditions may possibly be baseless, <lb/>
            but let them stand.</p>
          <p>Amyclæ was destroyed by the Dorians, and is now only <lb/>
            a village, which contains a temple and statue of Alexandra <lb/>
            well worth seeing, (by Alexandra the people of Amyclae <lb/>
            mean Cassandra the daughter of Priam).</p>
          <p>There is here also an effigy of Clytæmnestra, and a statue <lb/>
            of Agamemnon, and his supposed tomb. And Amyclæan <lb/>
            Apollo and Dionysns are the chief gods worshipped here, <lb/>
            the latter they call very properly in my opinion Psilax <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            (Winged). Psila is the Dorian word for wings, and wine <lb/>
            elevates men and lightens their judgment just as wings <lb/>
            elevate birds. And such is all that is memorable about <lb/>
            Amy else.</p>
          <p>Another road from Sparta leads to Therapne. And on <lb/>
            the way is a wooden statue of Athene Alea. And before <lb/>
            you cross the Eurotas a little above the bank stands the <lb/>
            temple of Wealthy Zens. And when you have crossed the <lb/>
            Eurotas, you come to the temple of Cotylean .,Esculapius <lb/>
            built by Hercules, who called .Esculapius Cotylean because <lb/>
            in the first conflict with Hippocoon and his sons he received <lb/>
            a wound on his cotyle or hip. And of all the temples built <lb/>
            on this road, the most ancient is one of Ares, on the <lb/>
            left of the road, and the statue of the god was they say <lb/>
            brought by Castor and Pollux from Colchi. And Theritas <lb/>
            gets its name they say from There, who was the nurse of <lb/>
            Ares. And perhaps they got the name Theritas from the <lb/>
            Colchians, for the Greeks know nothing of a nurse of Ares <lb/>
            called There. But I cannot but think that the name <lb/>
            Theritas was given to Ares not on account of his nurse, <lb/>
            but because in an engagement with the enemy one must be <lb/>
            mild no longer, but be like the description of Achilles in <lb/>
            Homer, " as a lion he knows savageness." 1</p>
          <p>Therapne got its name from Therapne, the daughter of <lb/>
            Lelex, and it has a temple of Menelaus, and they say that <lb/>
            Menelaus and Helen were buried here. But the Rhodians <lb/>
            have a different account to that of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and say that Helen after the death of Menelaus, while <lb/>
            Orestes was still on his travels, was driven away by Nico­ <lb/>
            stratus and Megapenthes and went to Rhodes, as she was a <lb/>
            connection of Polyxo the wife of Tlepolemus, for Polyxo <lb/>
            was of Argive descent, and being the wife of Tlepolemus <lb/>
            fled with him to Rhodes, and there became Queen, being <lb/>
            left with one fatherless child. This Polyxo they say desired <lb/>
            to avenge on Helen the death of Tlepolemus, and when she <lb/>
            got her in her power sent to her as she was bathing some <lb/>
            attendants dressed like the Furies, and they laid hold of <lb/>
            Helen and hung her on a tree, and for this reason the Rho­ <lb/>
            dians have a temple to Helen Hung on the Tree. And I will <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xxiv. 41. Pausanias derives from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θήρ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θηρίον</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            record the tradition of the people of Croton about Helen, <lb/>
            which is the same as that of the people of Himera. There is <lb/>
            in the Euxine sea, near the mouth of the Ister, an island <lb/>
            sacred to Achilles called Leuce. It is 20 stades in extent, <lb/>
            entirely thick forest and full of beasts domesticated and wild, <lb/>
            and contains a temple and statue of Achilles. They say <lb/>
            Leonymus of Croton was the first that ever sailed to it. For <lb/>
            when there was a war between the people of Croton and <lb/>
            the Locrians in Italy, and the Locrians invited in Ajax the <lb/>
            son of Oileus to aid them because of their kinsmanship to <lb/>
            the Opuntians, Leonymus the general of the Crotonians <lb/>
            attacked that part of the enemy's army where he was told <lb/>
            that Ajax was stationed, and got wounded in the breast, <lb/>
            and, as he suffered very much from his wound, went to <lb/>
            Delphi. And the Pythian Priestess sent him to the island <lb/>
            Leuce, and told him that Ajax would appear there and heal <lb/>
            his wound. And in process of time getting well he returned <lb/>
            from Leuce, and said that he had seen Achilles, and Ajax <lb/>
            the son of Oileus, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and that <lb/>
            Patroclus And Antilochus were in the company, and that <lb/>
            Helen was married to Achilles and had told him to sail to <lb/>
            Himera, and tell Stesichorus that the loss of his eyesight <lb/>
            was a punishment to him from her. In consequence of <lb/>
            this Stesichorus composed his palinode.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            T Therapne too I saw the fountain Messeis. Some of <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians say that the fountain called in <lb/>
            our day Polydeucea, and not this one at Therapne, was <lb/>
            called by the ancients Messeis. But the fountain Poly­ <lb/>
            deucea, and the temple of Polydeuces, are on the right <lb/>
            of the road to Therapne. And not far from Therapne <lb/>
            is a temple of Phcebus, and in it a shrine of Castor and <lb/>
            Polydeuces, and the youths sacrifice here to Enyalius. <lb/>
            And at no great distance is a temple of Poseidon under <lb/>
            the name of the Earth-holder. And as you go on thence <lb/>
            on the road to Taygetus you come to a place they call <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            Alesiæ (i.e. Mill-town), for they say that Myles the son of <lb/>
            Lelex was the first that discovered the use of mills, and <lb/>
            first ground here. At Alesiæ there is a hero-chapel to <lb/>
            Lacedaemon the son of Taygete. And as you go on from <lb/>
            thence and cross the river Phellias, on the road from <lb/>
            Amyclæ to the sea you come to Pharis, formerly a popu­ <lb/>
            lous town in Laconia, and leaving the river Phellias on the <lb/>
            right is the way to Mount Taygetus. And there is in the <lb/>
            plain a shrine of Messapian Zeus. He got this title they <lb/>
            say from one of his priests. As you go thence towards <lb/>
            Mount Taygetus there is a place called Bryseæ, where was <lb/>
            formerly a town, and there is still a temple of Dionysus <lb/>
            and his statue in the open air. But the statue in the temple <lb/>
            only women may look upon : and women only conduct the <lb/>
            ritual in connection with the sacrifices. The highest point <lb/>
            of Mount Taygetus is Taletum above Bryseæ. This they <lb/>
            say is sacred to the Sun, and they sacrifice there to the <lb/>
            Sun horses and other victims, as do also the Persians. <lb/>
            And not far from Taletum is the forest called Evoras, which <lb/>
            supports several wild beasts and especially wildgoats. In <lb/>
            fact Mount Taygetus throughout affords excellent goat­ <lb/>
            hunting and boarhunting, and superfine deerhunting and <lb/>
            bearhunting. And between Taletum and Evoras is a place <lb/>
            they call Theras, where they say Leto came from the heights <lb/>
            of Taygetus. And there is a temple to Demeter under <lb/>
            the name Eleusinia. Here the Lacedæmonians say Her­ <lb/>
            cules was hidden by Æsculapius, while he was being cured <lb/>
            of his wound. And there is in it a wooden statue of <lb/>
            Orpheus, the work as they say of the Pelasgi. And I <lb/>
            know that Orphic rites take place here also. Near the sea <lb/>
            is a town called Helus, which Homer has mentioned in his <lb/>
            catalogue of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            ' Those who dwelt at Amyclæ and Helus the city by the sea.'1 <lb/>
            It was founded by Heleus the youngest son of Perseus, and <lb/>
            the Dorians in after days reduced it by siege. Its inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants were the first slaves of the Lacedaemonian com­ <lb/>
            monalty, and were the'first called Helots from the place of <lb/>
            their birth. Afterwards Helot was the general name the <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ii. 584. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            Dorians gave their slaves, even when they were Messe­ <lb/>
            nians, just as all the Greeks are called Hellenes from Hellas <lb/>
            in Thessaly. From Helus they bring on stated days the <lb/>
            wooden statue of Proserpine, the daughter of Demeter, to <lb/>
            Eleusinium. And 15 stades from Eleusinium is the place <lb/>
            called Lapithæum from a native called Lapithus. It is on <lb/>
            Mount Taygetus, and not far from it is Dereum, where is <lb/>
            a statue of Derean Artemis in the open air, and near it a <lb/>
            fountain which they call Anonus. And next to Dereum, <lb/>
            about 20 stades further on is Harplea, which extends as <lb/>
            far as the plain.</p>
          <p>On the road from Sparta to Arcadia there is a statue of <lb/>
            Athene called Parea in the open air, and near it a temple of <lb/>
            Achilles, which it is customary to keep shut. But those of <lb/>
            the youths who intend to contend at Platanistas are wont <lb/>
            to sacrifice there to Achilles before the contest. And the <lb/>
            Spartans say this temple was built for them by Prax, who <lb/>
            was the great grandson of Pergamus, the son of Neop­ <lb/>
            tolemus. And as you go on you come to the tomb called <lb/>
            The Horse, for Tyndareus sacrificed a horse here and put <lb/>
            an oath to all the suitors of Helen, making them stand by <lb/>
            the horse's entrails. And the oath was to aid Helen, and <lb/>
            whoever should be chosen for her husband, if they were <lb/>
            wronged. And after putting this oath to them he buried <lb/>
            the remains of the horse here. And at no great distance <lb/>
            there are seven pillars set there after some ancient custom, <lb/>
            I suppose, to represent the seven planets. And on the <lb/>
            road there is a grove of Carnean Apollo called Stemmatius, <lb/>
            and a temple of Mysian Artemis. And the statue of <lb/>
            Modesty, about 30 stades' distance from Sparta, is the votive <lb/>
            offering of Icarius, said to have been made on the following <lb/>
            occasion. When Icarius gave Penelope in marriage to <lb/>
            Odysseus, he endeavoured to persuade Odysseus to live at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, but failing in that he begged his daughter to <lb/>
            remain with him, and when she set out for Ithaca followed <lb/>
            the chariot, and besought her earnestly to return. And <lb/>
            Odysseus for a time refused his consent to this, but at last <lb/>
            gave Penelope permission either to accompany him of her <lb/>
            own volition, or to go back to Lacedæmon with her father. <lb/>
            And she they say made no answer, but, as she veiled her <lb/>
            face at this proposal, Icarius perceived that she wished to <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            go off with Odysseus, and let her go, and dedicated a statue <lb/>
            of Modesty in the very place in the road where they say <lb/>
            Penelope had got to when she veiled herself.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND 20 stades further you will come to the Eurotas <lb/>
            which flows very near the road, and to the tomb of <lb/>
            Ladas, who surpassed all his contemporaries in swiftness of <lb/>
            foot. At Olympia he received the prize for the long race, <lb/>
            but I think he was tired out after his victory, for he died <lb/>
            on this spot and was buried above the public road. Another <lb/>
            Ladas, who also was a victor at Olympia but not in the long <lb/>
            race, was they say an Achaean from Ægium, according to <lb/>
            the archives of Elis about the victors at Olympia. And if <lb/>
            you go on you come to the village called Characoma, and <lb/>
            next to it is Pellana, formerly a town, where they say <lb/>
            Tyndareus lived, when he fled from Sparta from Hippo­ <lb/>
            coon and his sons. And the notable things I have myself <lb/>
            seen there are the temple of Æsculapius and the fountain <lb/>
            Pellanis, into which they say a maiden fell when she was <lb/>
            drawing water, and after she had disappeared her veil was <lb/>
            found in another fountain called Lancea. And about 100 <lb/>
            stades from Pellana is a place called Belemina : best off for <lb/>
            water of all Laconia, for not only does the river Eurotas <lb/>
            flow through it, but it has also fountains in abundance.</p>
          <p>As you go down to the sea in the direction of Gythium, <lb/>
            you come to the Lacedaemonian village called Croceæ. The <lb/>
            stonequarries here are not one continuous piece of rock, <lb/>
            but stones are dug out of them like river stones, rather <lb/>
            difficult to carve, but when they are carved admirably <lb/>
            adapted to adorn the temples of the gods, and add very <lb/>
            greatly to the beauty of fishponds and ornamental waters. <lb/>
            And in front of the village are statues of the gods, as Zeus of <lb/>
            Croceæ in stone, and at the quarry Castor and Pollux in <lb/>
            brass. And next to Croceæ, as you turn to the right from <lb/>
            the high road to Gythium, you will come to the small town <lb/>
            called Ægiæ. They say Homer mentions it under the <lb/>
            name Augeæ. Here is a marsh which is called Poseidon's <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            marsh, and the god has a temple and statue near it. The <lb/>
            natives are afraid however to catch the fish, for they say <lb/>
            that whoever fishes there becomes a fish and ceases to be <lb/>
            a man.</p>
          <p>Gythium is about 30 stades from Ægiæ, and is near the <lb/>
            sea, and is inhabited by the Eleutherolacones, whom the <lb/>
            Emperor Augustus liberated from the yoke of slavery im­ <lb/>
            posed on them by the Lacedæmonians of Sparta. All the <lb/>
            Peloponnese except the Isthmus of Corinth is surrounded <lb/>
            by water: and the maritime parts of Laconia furnish <lb/>
            shell fish from which purple dye is obtained, next in ex­ <lb/>
            cellence to the Tyrian purple. And the Eleutherolacones <lb/>
            have 18 cities, first Gythium as von descend from Ægiæ <lb/>
            to the sea, and next Teuthrone, and Las, and Pyrrhichus, <lb/>
            and near Tænarum Cænepolis, and (Etylus, and Leuctra, <lb/>
            and Thalamæ, and Alagonia, and Gerenia: and opposite <lb/>
            Gythium Asopus near the sea, and Acriæ, and Bœæ, and <lb/>
            Zarax, and Epidaurus called Limera, and Brasiæ, and <lb/>
            Geronthræ, and Marius. These are all that remain of what <lb/>
            were once 24 cities of the Eleutherolacones. And the other <lb/>
            six, which I shall also give an account of, are tributary to <lb/>
            Sparta and not independent as those we have just spoken <lb/>
            of. And the people of Gythium assign no mortal as their <lb/>
            founder, but say that Hercules and Apollo, when their con­ <lb/>
            test for the tripod was over, jointly built their town. In <lb/>
            the marketplace they have statues of Apollo and Hercules, <lb/>
            and near them Dionysus. And in a different part of the <lb/>
            town is Carnean Apollo, and a temple of Ammon, and a <lb/>
            brazen statue of Æsculapius; his shrine has no roof to it, <lb/>
            and there is a fountain of the god, and a temple sacred to <lb/>
            Demeter, and a statue of Poseidon the Earth-holder. And <lb/>
            the person that the people of Gythium call the old man, <lb/>
            who they say lives in the sea, is I discovered Nereus, and <lb/>
            this name Homer gave him in the Iliad in the speech of <lb/>
            Thetis, ' Ye now enter Ocean's spacious bosom, to visit <lb/>
            the old man of the sea and the homes of our sire.'1 And <lb/>
            the gates here are called Castorides, and in the citadel there <lb/>
            is a temple and statue of Athene. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xviii. 140, 141. </note></p><pb n="216"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND about 3 stades from Gythium is the White Stone, <lb/>
            where they say Orestes sat to cure himself of his <lb/>
            madness. In the Doric tongue the stone was called Zens <lb/>
            Cappotas. And opposite Gythium lies the island Cranae, <lb/>
            where according to Homer Paris first carried off Helen. <lb/>
            Facing this island on the mainland is the temple of Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite Migonitis, and the whole place is called Migonium. <lb/>
            The temple they say was built by Paris. And Menelaus, <lb/>
            returning home safe 8 years after the capture of Ilium, <lb/>
            placed near the temple of Aphrodite Migonitis statues of <lb/>
            Thetis and Praxidice. There is a mountain too above <lb/>
            Migonium sacred to Dionysus, which they call Larysium : <lb/>
            and here at the commencement of spring they have a feast <lb/>
            to Dionysus, alleging among other reasons for the festival <lb/>
            that they found here a ripe cluster of grapes.</p>
          <p>On the left of Gythium about 30 stades' distance you <lb/>
            will see on the mainland the walls of Trinasus, which <lb/>
            seems to me to have been a fort and not a town. And I <lb/>
            think it got its name from the three small islands which <lb/>
            lie here near the mainland. And about 80 stades from <lb/>
            Trinasus you come to the ruins of Helus, and 30 stades <lb/>
            further to Acriæ a city on the sea, where is a handsome <lb/>
            temple of the Mother of the Gods, and her statue in stone. <lb/>
            And the inhabitants of Acrise say that this is the oldest of <lb/>
            all the temples of this goddess in the Peloponnese : though <lb/>
            the Magnesians who live north of Sipylus have on a rock <lb/>
            called Coddinus the most ancient statue of the Mother of <lb/>
            the Gods; and the Magnesians say it was made by Broteas <lb/>
            the son of Tantalus.. Acriæ once produced a victor at <lb/>
            Olympia in Nicocles, who carried off at two Olympiads five <lb/>
            victories in the chariot race. His tomb is between the <lb/>
            gymnasium and the walls near the harbour. It is about <lb/>
            120 stades from Acrive to Geronthræ. Geronthræ was <lb/>
            inhabited before the Heraclidæ came to the Peloponnese, and <lb/>
            the inhabitants were driven out by the Dorians of Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, who, when they had driven out the Achoeans from <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            Geronthræ, put in colonists of their own. But Geronthræ <lb/>
            now belongs to the Eleutherolacones. On the road from <lb/>
            Acriæ to Geronthræ there is a village called Palæa, and <lb/>
            at Geronthræ there is a temple and grove of Ares, whose <lb/>
            festival they celebrate annually, when women are forbid­ <lb/>
            den to enter the grove. And near the market place are <lb/>
            fountains of drinkable water. And in the citadel there is <lb/>
            a temple of Apollo, and the head of his image in ivory: all <lb/>
            the rest of the image was destroyed by fire when the <lb/>
            old temple was burnt. Another town belonging to the <lb/>
            Eleutherolacones is Marius, 100 stades from Geronthræ. <lb/>
            There is an old temple there common to all the gods, and <lb/>
            round it a grove with fountains, there are also fountains <lb/>
            in the temple of Artemis. Marius indeed has plenty of <lb/>
            water if any place. And above Marius is a village called <lb/>
            Glyptia in the interior of the country. And there is <lb/>
            another village called Selinus about 20 stades from <lb/>
            Geronthræ.</p>
          <p>So much for the interior of Laconia from Acriæ. And <lb/>
            the town Asopus on the sea is about 60 stades from Acriæ. <lb/>
            In it is a temple of the Roman Emperors, and inland from <lb/>
            Asopus about 12 stades is a temple of AEsculapius, they <lb/>
            call the god Philolaus there. And the bones that are <lb/>
            honoured in the gymnasium are exceedingly large, but not <lb/>
            too big for a mortal. And there is a temple of Athene <lb/>
            called Cyparissia in the citadel: and at the foot of the citadel <lb/>
            there some ruins of a town called the town of the Paracy­ <lb/>
            parissian Achæans. There is also in this district a temple <lb/>
            of Æsculapius about 50 stades from Asopus, and they call <lb/>
            the place in which this temple is Hyperteleatum. And <lb/>
            there is a promontory jutting out into the sea about 200 <lb/>
            stades from Asopus, which they call Ass' jaw-bone. This <lb/>
            promontory has a temple of Athene, without either statue <lb/>
            or roof, said to have been built by Agamemnon. There is <lb/>
            also a monument of Cinadus, who was the pilot of Mene­ <lb/>
            laus' ship. And next to this promontory is what is called <lb/>
            the Bay of Bœæ, and the city Bœæ is at the head of the <lb/>
            bay. It was built by Bœus, one of the sons of Hercules <lb/>
            who is said to have peopled it from the three towns Etis, <lb/>
            Aphrodisias, and Sida. Two of these ancient towns are <lb/>
            reputed to have been built by Æneas, when he was fleeing <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            to Italy and driven into this bay by storms, his daughter <lb/>
            Etias gave her name to Etis, and the third town was they <lb/>
            say called after Sida the daughter of Danaus. Those who <lb/>
            were driven out of these towns enquired where they should <lb/>
            dwell: and the oracle told them that Artemis would shew <lb/>
            them where to dwell. On their starting their journey a <lb/>
            hare sprung in view, this hare they made their guide: and <lb/>
            as it hid in a myrtle tree they built their city on the site of. <lb/>
            the myrtle tree, and they still venerate the myrtle tree, and <lb/>
            call Artemis their Saviour. There is also a temple of <lb/>
            Apollo in the marketplace of Bœæ, and in another part of <lb/>
            the city temples of AEsculapius and Serapis and Isis. The <lb/>
            ruins of the three towns are not more than 7 stades from <lb/>
            Bœæ, and on the road you see a stone statue of Hermes <lb/>
            on the left, and among the ruins can trace temples of <lb/>
            Æsculapius and Hygiea.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Cythera lies opposite Bœæ, and to the promontory <lb/>
            of Platanistus-the point where the island is nearest <lb/>
            to the mainland—from the promontory on the mainland <lb/>
            called Ass' jawbone is about 4 stades' sail. And at Cythera <lb/>
            there is a station for ships called Scandea, and Scandea is <lb/>
            about 10 stades from the town of Cythera as you go along <lb/>
            the cliffs. And the temple of Celestial Aphrodite is the <lb/>
            most holy and most ancient of all the. temples the Greeks <lb/>
            have of Aphrodite, and the statue is an old wooden one, <lb/>
            the goddess is in complete armour.</p>
          <p>As you sail from Bœæ to the promontory of Malea there <lb/>
            is a harbour called Nymphæum, and a statue of Poseidon <lb/>
            erect, and a cave very near the sea, and in it a spring of <lb/>
            fresh water, and many people live in the neighbourhood. <lb/>
            And as you double the promontory of Malea, and sail <lb/>
            about 100 stades, you come to a place called Epidelium on <lb/>
            the borders of Bœæ, where is a temple of Apollo. It is <lb/>
            called Epidelium because the wooden statue of Apollo <lb/>
            there now was formerly at Delos. For Delos being for­ <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            merly an emporium for the Greeks, and being thought <lb/>
            likely to give security to commerce because of the god, <lb/>
            Menophanes a General of Mithridates, either of his own <lb/>
            insolence or obeying the orders of Mithridates, (for to a <lb/>
            man looking only to lucre divine things come after gain), <lb/>
            seeing that Delos had no fortifications and that the in­ <lb/>
            habitants were unarmed, sailed to it and slew all the <lb/>
            resident aliens, and the Delians also, and robbed the mer­ <lb/>
            chants of much money, and carried off all the votive <lb/>
            offerings, and also enslaved the women and children, <lb/>
            and razed Delos to the ground. And during the sack and <lb/>
            plunder one of the barbarians in very wantonness threw <lb/>
            this wooden statue into the sea, and the waves landed it <lb/>
            here at the place called Epidelium in the district of Bœæ. <lb/>
            But the fierce wrath of the god failed not to pursue Meno­ <lb/>
            phanes and Mithridates himself, for Menophanes, when he <lb/>
            put to sea again after laying Delos waste, was lain in wait <lb/>
            for by the merchants who had escaped, and his vessel sunk, <lb/>
            and Mithridates subsequently was compelled by the god to <lb/>
            be his own executioner when his power was entirely de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, and he driven hither and thither by the Romans. <lb/>
            And some say that he found a violent death as a favour at <lb/>
            the hands of one of his mercenaries. Such was the end of <lb/>
            these men for their impiety.</p>
          <p>And adjacent to the district of Bœæ is Epidaurus Limera, <lb/>
            about 200 stades from Epidelium. And they say that it <lb/>
            was colonized and inhabited not by the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            bit by some Epidaurians that lived in Argolis, who, sailing <lb/>
            to Cos to see AEsculapius on public business put in at <lb/>
            Laconia here, and according to visions they had continued <lb/>
            here. And they say that the dragon which they had <lb/>
            brought with them from Epidaurus escaped from the ship <lb/>
            and dived into a hole not far from the sea, and according <lb/>
            to their visions and the wonderful behaviour of their dragon <lb/>
            they determined to dwell there. And at the point where <lb/>
            the dragon dived into a hole they erected altars to Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapins, and some olive trees grow in the vicinity. About <lb/>
            two stades further there is on the right hand some water <lb/>
            called the water of Ino, in size only a small lake, but it <lb/>
            goes very deep into the ground. Into this water on the­ <lb/>
            festival of Ino they throw barley cakes. If the water <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            absorbs them it is thought a lucky sign for the person who <lb/>
            throws them in, but if they float on the surface it is judged <lb/>
            a bad sign. The craters at Ætna have the same prophetic <lb/>
            power. For they throw into them gold and silver vessels, <lb/>
            and offerings of all kinds. And if the fire absorbs them <lb/>
            they rejoice at it as a good sign, but if it rejects them they <lb/>
            regard it as a sure sign of misfortune for the person who <lb/>
            has thrown them in. And on the road from Bœæ to Epi­ <lb/>
            daurus Limera there is a temple of Artemis called by the <lb/>
            Epidaurians Limnas. The town is at no great distance <lb/>
            from the sea, and is built on an eminence: and the sights <lb/>
            worth seeing here are the temple of Aphrodite, and a statue <lb/>
            of Æsculapius in stone erect, and a temple of Athene in <lb/>
            the citadel, and in front of the harbour a temple of Zeus <lb/>
            Soter. And into the sea near the town juts out the pro­ <lb/>
            montory Minoa. And the bay is very similar to all the <lb/>
            others in Laconia made by the encroaches of the sea. And <lb/>
            the seashore has pebbles beautiful in shape and of all kinds <lb/>
            of colours.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            BOUT 100 stades from Epidaurus Limera is Zarax, in <lb/>
            other respects convenient as a harbour, but especially <lb/>
            ravaged of all the towns of the Eleutherolacones, for <lb/>
            Cleonymus, the son of Cleomenes, the son of Agesipolis, <lb/>
            razed to the ground this alone of the Laconian towns. But <lb/>
            I have elsewhere spoken of Cleonymus. And at Zarax <lb/>
            there is nothing remarkable but a temple of Apollo at the <lb/>
            end of the harbour, and a statue of the god with a lyre.</p>
          <p>And as you go along the coast from Zarax about 6 stades, <lb/>
            and then turn and strike into the interior of the country <lb/>
            for about 10 stades, you come to the ruins of Cyphanta, <lb/>
            where is a temple of .Esculapius called Stethæum, and the <lb/>
            statue of the god is of stone. And there is a spring of <lb/>
            cold water bubbling out from the rock. They say Atalanta <lb/>
            was parched with thirst hunting here, and struck the <lb/>
            rock with her lance and the water gushed forth. And <lb/>
            Brasiæ near the sea is the last place which belongs to the <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            Eleutherolacones here, and it is about 200 stades' sail <lb/>
            from Cyphanta. And the natives here have traditions <lb/>
            different to all the other Greeks, for they say that Semele <lb/>
            bare a son to Zens, and that she and her son Dionysus were <lb/>
            spirited away by Cadmus and put into a chest, and this <lb/>
            chest was they say carried by the waves to Brasiæ, and <lb/>
            they say they buried magnificently Semele who was no <lb/>
            longer alive, and reared Dionysus. And in consequence <lb/>
            of this the name of their city, which had been hitherto <lb/>
            called Oreatæ was changed to Brasiæ, because of this land­ <lb/>
            ing from the chest. To this day in fact most people speak <lb/>
            of things cast ashore by the waves as brashed1 ashore. The <lb/>
            people of Brasiæ say further that Ino came to their land on <lb/>
            her travels, and when she came there wished to be the nurse <lb/>
            of Dionysus. And they show the cave where she reared <lb/>
            Dionysus, and they call the plain Dionysus' garden. And <lb/>
            there are temples of Æsculapius and Achilles there, and <lb/>
            they have an annual feast to Achilles. And there is a <lb/>
            small promontory at Brasiæ, which slopes gently to the sea, <lb/>
            and there are some brazen statues on it not more than a <lb/>
            foot high with hats on their heads, I know not whether they <lb/>
            are meant for Castor and Pollux or the Corybantes, how­ <lb/>
            ever there are three figures, and there is also a statue of <lb/>
            Athene. And on the right of Gythinm is Las, ten stades <lb/>
            from the sea, and forty from Gythium. And the town is <lb/>
            now built on the ground between the three mountains <lb/>
            called respectively Ilium and Asia and Cnacadium, but it <lb/>
            was originally on the crest of Asia: and there are still ruins <lb/>
            of the old town, and before the walls a statue of Hercules, <lb/>
            and a trophy over the Macedonians, who were a portion of <lb/>
            Philip's army when he invaded Laconia, but wandered <lb/>
            from the rest of the army, and ravaged the maritime parts <lb/>
            of the country. And there is among the ruins a temple of <lb/>
            Athene under the title of Asia, erected they say by Castor <lb/>
            and Pollux on their safe return from Colchi, where they <lb/>
            had seen a temple of Athene Asia. I know that they took <lb/>
            part in the expedition with Jason, and that the Colchians <lb/>
            honour Athene Asia I have heard from the people of Las. <lb/>
            And there is a fountain near the new town called from the <note type="footnote"> 1 We coin a word to keep the Paronomasia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            colour of its water Galaco (milky), and near the fountain <lb/>
            is a gymnasium, and an ancient statue of Hermes. And <lb/>
            on Mount Ilium there is a temple of Dionysus, and on the <lb/>
            top of the hill one of Æsculapius, and on Cnacadium Car­ <lb/>
            nean Apollo. And if you go forward about 30 stades from <lb/>
            Carnean Apollo there are at a place called Hypsi, on the <lb/>
            borders of Sparta, temples of Æsculapius and of Daphnean <lb/>
            Artemis. And on a promontory near the sea is the temple <lb/>
            of Artemis Dictynna, whose feast they keep annually. And <lb/>
            on the left of this promontory the river Smenus discharges <lb/>
            itself into the sea. The water is fresh to drink, and rises <lb/>
            on Mount Taygetus, and is not more than five stades <lb/>
            distant from Hypsi. And in the place called Araïnum is <lb/>
            the tomb of Las, and over his tomb a statue. This Las <lb/>
            they say was the founder of the town, and was killed by <lb/>
            Achilles, who they say came to their town to ask Helen in <lb/>
            marriage, of Tyndareus. But to speak truth it was Patro­ <lb/>
            clus that killed Las : for it was he that wooed Helen. <lb/>
            For that Achilles is not represented as one of Helen's <lb/>
            suitors in the Catalogue of Women, would indeed be no <lb/>
            proof that he did not ask for Helen's hand: but Homer <lb/>
            has stated very early in the Iliad 1 that Achilles went to <lb/>
            Troy to gratify the sons of Atreus, and not bound by any <lb/>
            oath to Tyndareus, and has represented Antilochus in the <lb/>
            Games saying that he was younger than Odysseus,2 and has <lb/>
            described Odysseus as discoursing about what he had seen <lb/>
            in Hades and other things, and how he wished to see <lb/>
            Theseus and Pirithous, who were older men than himself, <lb/>
            and we know that Theseus ran away with Helen. So it is <lb/>
            hardly permissible at all to think that Achilles could have <lb/>
            been a suitor of Helen. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, i. 158-160. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Is this a slip of Pausanias for Menelaus? See Iliad, xxiii. 587, <lb/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OT far from the tomb of Las the river called Scyras <lb/>
            falls into the sea; it had no name for a long time <lb/>
            and was called Scyras because Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, <lb/>
            put in there with his fleet, when he sailed from Scyrus to <lb/>
            marry Hermione. And when you have crossed the river <lb/>
            there is an ancient temple at some distance from an altar <lb/>
            of Zeus. And at forty stades' distance from the river is <lb/>
            Pyrrhichus in the heart of the country. Some say the <lb/>
            town was so called from Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, others <lb/>
            say Pyrrhichus was the god of the Curetes. There are <lb/>
            some even that say Silenus came from Malea and dwelt <lb/>
            here. That Silenus was brought up at Malea is plain from <lb/>
            these lines of Pindar,1 <lb/>
            ' The mighty, the dance-loving Silenus, <lb/>
            Reared by the Malea-bom husband of Nais.' <lb/>
            That Pyrrhichus was his name has not been told us by <lb/>
            Pindar, but is a tradition of those that live at Malea. And <lb/>
            there is at Pyrrhichus a conduit in the marketplace, which <lb/>
            they think they owe to Silenus: and if the conduit were to <lb/>
            fail them they would be short of water. And the temples <lb/>
            at Pyrrhicus are two, one of Artemis the Putter-of-an-end­ <lb/>
            to-War, because here the Amazons were stopped from any <lb/>
            further warfare, and one of Apollo Amazonius. Both have <lb/>
            wooden statues, and tradition says they were votive offer­ <lb/>
            ings of the women that came from Thermodon.</p>
          <p>As you go towards the sea from Pyrrhichus you come <lb/>
            to Teuthrone, which they say was built by Teuthras an <lb/>
            Athenian. And of all the gods they pay most honour <lb/>
            to Issorian Artemis, and they have a fountain called Naia. <lb/>
            And a hundred and fifty stades from Teuthrone is the <lb/>
            promontory of Tænarum jutting out into the sea, and the <lb/>
            harbours Achilleus and Psamathus. And on the pro­ <lb/>
            montory there is a temple like a cave, and before it a statue <lb/>
            of Poseidon. And some of the Greeks have repres3nted <note type="footnote"> 1 Only found as a fragment now. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            that it was here that Hercules brought up Cerberus from <lb/>
            the lower world, though there is no underground road <lb/>
            leading up to the cave, nor could one easily believe that <lb/>
            the gods have any underground dwelling, where departed <lb/>
            souls congregate. But Hecatæus the Milesian has a pro­ <lb/>
            bable legend, that a dreadful serpent called Cerberus was <lb/>
            reared at Tænarum, and that whoever was bitten by it <lb/>
            was sure to die, so venomous was its bite, and this serpent <lb/>
            was dragged by Hercules to Eurystheus. Homer, who first <lb/>
            spoke of the dog being dragged from Hades by Hercules, <lb/>
            gave him no name, nor complete description as he did of <lb/>
            the Chimæra.1 But others afterwards called the dog Cer­ <lb/>
            berus, and said he was like a dog in all respects except that <lb/>
            he had 3 heads, though Homer said no more that he was <lb/>
            the domestic animal called the do- than if he had called a <lb/>
            real serpent the dog of Hades. There are several works of. <lb/>
            art at Tænarum, and among others the harper Arion in <lb/>
            brass riding on the dolphin's back. As to Arion and the <lb/>
            dolphin Herodotus2 has given the tradition as he heard it <lb/>
            in his history about Lydia. I have myself seen at Poro­ <lb/>
            selene a dolphin so full of gratitude to a boy, by whom he <lb/>
            had been healed of wounds received from some fishermen, <lb/>
            that he was obedient to his call, and carried him on his <lb/>
            back over the sea whenever he wished. There is also a <lb/>
            fountain at Tænarum, which now presents nothing marvel­ <lb/>
            lous, but in former times they say gave to those who looked <lb/>
            into it the sight of harbours and ships. This peculiarity <lb/>
            of the water was stopt for all time by a woman's washing <lb/>
            her dirty linen in it.</p>
          <p>About 40 stades' sail from the promontory of Tænarum <lb/>
            is a place called Csenepolis, which was also formerly called <lb/>
            Tænarum. And in it is a chapel of Demeter, and a temple <lb/>
            of Aphrodite near the sea, and a stone statue of the god­ <lb/>
            dess erect. And 30 stades thence is Thyrides the top­ <lb/>
            most peak of Tænarum, and the ruins of the town of Hip­ <lb/>
            pola, and among them the temple of Athene of Hippola, <lb/>
            and at a little distance the town and harbour of Messa. It <lb/>
            is about 150 stades from this harbour to CEtylus. And <note type="footnote"> 1 In Odyssey, xi. 623, he is simply called xva, in Iliad, viii. 368, <lb/>

            the hero from whom Œtylus got its name was originally <lb/>
            from Argos, being the son of Amphianax, the son of Anti­ <lb/>
            machus. The most notable things to see in Œtylus are <lb/>
            the temple of Serapis, and a wooden statue in the market­ <lb/>
            place of Carnean Apollo.</p>

          <p>F <lb/>
            FROM Œtylus to Thalamæ the distance by road is <lb/>
            about 80 stades, and by the roadside is a temple and <lb/>
            oracle of Ino. They get their oracular responses asleep, <lb/>
            for whatever they want to know the goddess shews them in <lb/>
            dreams. And there are two brazen statues in the open air <lb/>
            part of the temple, one of Pasiphae, and one of the Sun. <lb/>
            What the statue in the temple is made of is not easy to see <lb/>
            from the quantity of the garlands, but they say that it too <lb/>
            is of brass. And fresh water flows from a sacred fount, <lb/>
            called the water of the Moon. Pasiphae indeed is not the <lb/>
            indigenous goddess of the people of Thalamae.</p>
          <p>And about twenty stades from Thalamae is a place called <lb/>
            Pephnos, by the sea. There is a little island in front of it <lb/>
            not greater than a big rock, which is also called Pephnos, <lb/>
            and the people of Thalamæ say that it was the birthplace <lb/>
            of Castor and Pollux. Aleman also gives us the same <lb/>
            account I know in one of his poems. But they do not say <lb/>
            that they were brought up at Pephnos, for Hermes took <lb/>
            them to Pellana. And in this island there are brazen <lb/>
            statues of Castor and Pollux about a foot high in the open <lb/>
            air. These the sea cannot move from their position, <lb/>
            though in winter time it dashes violently over the rock. <lb/>
            This is indeed wonderful, and the ants there are whiter in <lb/>
            colour than ants generally. The Messenians say that the <lb/>
            island originally belonged to them, so that they claim <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux as theirs rather than as deities of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>About twenty stades from Pephnos is Leuctra. Why it <lb/>
            was so called I do not know: but if it was from Leucippus <lb/>
            the son of Perieres, as the Messenians say, this will be why <lb/>
            they honour ,Esculapius here most of all the gods, as <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            the son of Arsinoe the daughter of Leucippus. And there is <lb/>
            a statue of Æsculapius in stone, and one of Ino in another <lb/>
            part of the town. There is also a temple and statue of <lb/>
            Cassandra the daughter of Priam, who is called Alexandra <lb/>
            by the people of Leuctra: and there are some wooden <lb/>
            statues of Carnean Apollo, who is worshipped in the same <lb/>
            way as by the Lacedemonians at Sparta. And in the <lb/>
            citadel there is a temple and statue of Athene. And there <lb/>
            is a temple and grove of Eros, and in winter-time water <lb/>
            flows through the grove: but the leaves that fall from <lb/>
            the trees in autumn could never be carried away by the <lb/>
            water even if it were very plentiful. But what I know hap­ <lb/>
            pened in my time at a part of Leuctra near the sea, I will <lb/>
            now relate. The wind fanned a fire in the wood so that it <lb/>
            burnt down most of the trees : and when the spot became <lb/>
            bare, there was a statue of Ithomatan Zeus discovered <lb/>
            which had been erected there. The Messenians say that <lb/>
            this is a proof that Leuctra was originally part of Mes­ <lb/>
            senia. But Ithomatan Zeus might have received honours <lb/>
            from the Lacedemonians as well, if they originally lived at <lb/>
            Leuctra.</p>
          <p>And Cardamyle, which Homer1 has mentioned in the <lb/>
            promises of gifts made by Agamemnon, is subject to <lb/>
            Sparta, as the Emperor Augustus detached it from Ales­ <lb/>
            senia. It is eight stades from the sea, and sixty from <lb/>
            Leuctra. And not far from the seashore is a grove sacred <lb/>
            to the daughters of Nereus, for the story goes that they <lb/>
            climbed up to this place from the sea to see Pyrrhus the <lb/>
            son of Achilles, when he went off to Sparta to marry Her­ <lb/>
            mione. In this small town there is a temple of Athene and <lb/>
            Carnean Apollo, whom they worship according to the <lb/>
            Dorian fashion.</p>
          <p>And the city called by Homer1 Enope, the inhabitants <lb/>
            of which are Messenians though they join the Council of <lb/>
            the Eleutherolacones, is called in our time Gerenia. Some <lb/>
            say Nestor was brought up in this city, others that he fled <lb/>
            here when Pylos was taken by Hercules. Gerenia contains <lb/>
            the tomb and temple of Machaon the son of Æsculapius: <lb/>
            from whom men may have possibly learnt the healing of <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, ix. 292. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            diseases. The sacred place they call Rhodon, and the <lb/>
            statue of Machaon is erect in brass. And on its head <lb/>
            is a garland, which the Messenians call ciphos1 in their <lb/>
            country's tongue. The writer of the epic poem called <lb/>
            the Little Iliad says that Machaon was killed by Eury­ <lb/>
            pylusthe son of Telephus. That is why (as I myself know) <lb/>
            in the rites in the temple of iEsculapius at Pergamum, <lb/>
            they begin with the Hymns of Telephus, but make no re­ <lb/>
            ference in their singing to Eurypulus, nor will they name <lb/>
            him at all in the temple, because they know he was the <lb/>
            murderer of Machaon. And the tradition is that Nestor <lb/>
            recovered the bones of Machaon. And Podalirius, when <lb/>
            the Greeks were returning after the sack of Ilium, was <lb/>
            carried they say out of his way to Syrnum a place in the <lb/>
            Continent of Caria, and getting there safe built a town <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>In the Gerenian district is the mountain Calathinm, and <lb/>
            on it is a temple of Clæa and a grotto near the temple, with <lb/>
            a narrow entrance: within there are several objects worth <lb/>
            seeing. And from Gerenia to Alagonia in the interior is <lb/>
            about 30 stades, but that town I have already mentioned <lb/>
            amongst the Eleutherolacones. And the sights best worth <lb/>
            seeing there are the temples of Dionysus and Artemis. <note type="footnote"> 1 Our coif. </note></p><pb n="228"/>

            HE border of Messenia towards Laconia, as fixed by <lb/>
            Augustus, is at Gerenia, and in our time is called the <lb/>
            Chœrian dell. This country, originally without inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants, is described to have been inhabited by the first colo­ <lb/>
            nists in the following manner. After the death of Lelex, <lb/>
            who reigned in what is now called Laconia, but was then <lb/>
            called Lelegia after him, Myles who was the elder of his sons <lb/>
            succeeded him, and Polycaon the younger was only a private <lb/>
            person till he married the Argive Messene, the daughter of <lb/>
            Triopas, the son of Phorbas. But Messene, being full of <lb/>
            pride owing to her father, who was foremost of all the <lb/>
            Greeks in merit and power, did not think it tolerable that <lb/>
            her husband should be a private person. So they gathered <lb/>
            together an army from Argos and Lacedæmon and invaded <lb/>
            this country, and the whole district was called Messene <lb/>
            from her. And several other cities were built, as well as <lb/>
            the place where the royal head-quarters were established, <lb/>
            viz. Andania. Before the battle which the Thebans fought <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians at Leuctra, and the building of <lb/>
            Messene in our day close to Ithome; I know of no city that <lb/>
            was previously called Messene. My inference is very much <lb/>
            confirmed by Homer. For in the catalogue of those who <lb/>
            went to Ilium, when enumerating Pylos and Arene and <lb/>
            other cities, he mentions no Messene. And in the Odyssey <lb/>
            he shews that by this time the Messenians were a race <lb/>
            and not a city, <lb/>
            ' For the Messenians took cattle from Ithaca,'1 <lb/>
            and clearer still in speaking of the bow of Iphitus, <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xxi. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            ' They two in Messene met one another, <lb/>
            In the house of Ortilochus.'1 <lb/>
            By the house of Ortilochus in Messene he meant the town <lb/>
            of Pherme, as he has shewn in the visit of Pisistratus to <lb/>
            Menelaus, <lb/>
            ' They went to Pherme to the house of Diocles, <lb/>
            The son of Ortilochus.'2</p>
          <p>However the first rulers of this country were Polycaon <lb/>
            (the son of Lelex) and his wife Messene. Cane on, the <lb/>
            son of Celænus, the son of Phlyus, introduced here from <lb/>
            Eleusis the mysteries of the Great Goddesses. Phlyus was <lb/>
            according to the Athenian tradition the son of Mother <lb/>
            Earth. And this tradition of theirs is confirmed by the <lb/>
            Hymn of Musæus made for the Lycomidæ in honour of <lb/>
            Demeter. And the rites of the Great Goddesses were held <lb/>
            in greater honour many years afterwards, owing to Lycus <lb/>
            the son of Pandion, than in Caucon's days. And they still <lb/>
            call the place where he purged the initiated the oak coppice <lb/>
            of Lycus. That there is an oak-coppice in this land called <lb/>
            Lycus' is also borne out by Rhianus the Cretan, <lb/>
            ' By rocky Elaeum and beyond the oak-coppice of Lycus.' <lb/>
            And that this Lycus was the son of Pandion is plain by the <lb/>
            inscription on the statue of Methapus. This- Methapus <lb/>
            reformed some of the rites. He was an Athenian by <lb/>
            race, an organizer of all sorts of mystic rites. He it <lb/>
            was who established also among the Thebans the rites <lb/>
            of the Cabiri. And he erected near the enclosure of <lb/>
            the Lycomidæ a statue with an inscription which con­ <lb/>
            firms my account. " I have purified the home and <lb/>
            paths of Hermes and the firstborn daughter of Demeter, <lb/>
            where they say Messene established games to the Great <lb/>
            Goddesses, owing to the son of Caucon, the illustrious <lb/>
            descendant of Phlyus. But I wonder that Lycus the son <lb/>
            of Pandion should establish the sacred rites of Atthis in <lb/>
            venerable Andania." This inscription shews that Caucon <lb/>
            who came to Messene was the descendant of Phlyus, and <lb/>
            confirms all the other facts about Lycus, and that the <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyssey, xxi. 15, 16. </note> <lb/>
            2<note type="footnote"> Ibid. iii. 488, 489. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            mysteries in ancient times were celebrated at Andania. <lb/>
            And it seems also common sense that Messene would not <lb/>
            establish the mysteries in any other place than where she <lb/>
            and Polycaon lived.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND being very anxious to know accurately who the <lb/>
            sons of Polycaon were by Messene, I perused the poem <lb/>
            called the Great Eœœ and the Naupactian poems, and also <lb/>
            all the genealogical information of Cinæthon and Asius. <lb/>
            And yet I did not discover anything in them except <lb/>
            that the Great Eœœ say that Polycaon the son of Butes <lb/>
            married Euæchme, the daughter of Hyllus the son of <lb/>
            Hercules, but they make no mention of either Messene <lb/>
            or her husband. But in after time, when none of the de­ <lb/>
            scendants of Polycaon survived, they continued five gene­ <lb/>
            rations and no more, they introduced as King Perieres the <lb/>
            son of Æolus. To his court came as the Messenians say <lb/>
            Melaneus, a skilful archer and for that reason thought to <lb/>
            be the son of Apollo, and Perieres assigned to him Carna­ <lb/>
            sium to dwell in, .which was formerly called CEchalia from <lb/>
            the wife of Melaneus. But the Thessalians and Eubœans—for <lb/>
            there are almost always disputed accounts of most Grecian <lb/>
            events-give different accounts. The former say that Eury­ <lb/>
            tium a place deserted in our days was a city in old times and <lb/>
            called CEchalia : but Creophylus in his Heraclea has written <lb/>
            what corresponds with the account of the Eubœans. And <lb/>
            Hecatæus the Milesian writes that CEchalia is in Scium a <lb/>
            part of Eretria. But the Messenians seem to me to give <lb/>
            the most probable account, especially about the bones of <lb/>
            Eurytus, which I shall touch upon later. And Perieres <lb/>
            had by Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus Aphareus and <lb/>
            Leucippus who, on his death, succeeded their father as <lb/>
            kings of the Messenians, but Aphareus had most power. <lb/>
            During his reign he built the city Arene which got its <lb/>
            name from the daughter of CEbalus, his wife and uterine <lb/>
            sister. For Gorgophone was married to CEbalus, as I have <lb/>
            already mentioned, in my account of Argolis, and also in <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            my accountof Laconia. Aphareus then built the city Arene <lb/>
            in Messenia, and received into his house his cousin Neleus, <lb/>
            the son of Cretheus, the son of iEolus (who was surnamed <lb/>
            Poseidon), when he fled from Pelias at Iolcus, and gave <lb/>
            him the maritime parts of the land, among which were <lb/>
            several other cities besides Pylos, where Neleus dwelt, and <lb/>
            made it his seat of government. And Lycus the son of Pan­ <lb/>
            dion came also to Arene, when he also fled from Athens <lb/>
            from his brother Ægeus. And he taught the mysteries of <lb/>
            the Great Goddesses to Aphareus and his sons and his wife <lb/>
            Arene. And he introduced them into Andania, for Caucon <lb/>
            there initiated Messene. And the elder and more manly of <lb/>
            Aphareus' children was Idas, and the younger was Lyn­ <lb/>
            ceus, of whom Pindar said, believe it who will, that he had <lb/>
            such keen eyesight that he could see through the trunk of <lb/>
            a tree. We do not know of Lynceus having had a son, <lb/>
            but Ides had by Marpessa a daughter Cleopatra, who <lb/>
            married Meleager. And the writer of the Cyprian Poems <lb/>
            says that the wife of Protesilaus, (who when the Greeks <lb/>
            got to the Troad was the first who ventured to land), was <lb/>
            by name Polydora, and he also says that she was the <lb/>
            daughter of Meleager the son of CEneus. If this be correct <lb/>
            then all these three women, beginning with Marpessa, com­ <lb/>
            mitted suicide after the death of their husbands.</p>

          <p>B <lb/>
            UT when between the sons of Aphareus and Castor and <lb/>
            Pollux (their uncles) a quarrel arose about cattle, and <lb/>
            Lynceus was slain by Pollux, while Idas died smitten with <lb/>
            lightning, the house of Aphareus was entirely deprived of <lb/>
            male offspring, and upon Nestor the son of Neleus devolved <lb/>
            the kingdom of the Messenians, over all whom Idas <lb/>
            reigned over and others besides, except those who followed <lb/>
            the sons of Æsculapius. For they say that the sons of <lb/>
            Æsculapius that went on the expedition to Ilium were <lb/>
            Messenians : for AEsculapius was the son of Arsinoe the <lb/>
            daughter of Leucippus, and not the son of Coronis. And <lb/>
            they call a deserted place in Messenia Tricca, it is men­ <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            tioned by Homer in the passage where Nestor is consoling <lb/>
            Machaon, who was wounded with an arrow. He would not <lb/>
            have exhibited such kindness except to a neighbour and <lb/>
            king of the same tribe. They confirm also greatly this <lb/>
            account about the children of Æsculapius by showing <lb/>
            at Gerenia the monument of Machaon, and at Pharæ the <lb/>
            temple of the sons of Machaon.</p>
          <p>And after the end of the war against Ilium, and the <lb/>
            death of Nestor after his return home, the expedition of <lb/>
            the Dorians and return of the Heraclidæ two generations <lb/>
            afterwards drove out the descendants of Neleus from <lb/>
            Messenia. And this was as it were the climax of the doings <lb/>
            of Temenus which I have already described. But I will <lb/>
            narrate this much more. When the Dorians assigned <lb/>
            Argos to Temenus, Cresphontes asked of them Messenia, <lb/>
            on the ground that he was older than Aristodemus, <lb/>
            who had just died. But Theras the son of Autesion <lb/>
            vehemently opposed Cresphontes ; he was of Theban <lb/>
            ancestry and fifth descendant of Polynices the son of <lb/>
            CEdipus, and at this time Guardian of Aristodemus' <lb/>
            sons, as he was their uncle on the mother's side, for Aris­ <lb/>
            todemus had married the daughter of Autesion, whose <lb/>
            name was Argia. But Cresphontes, for he was determined <lb/>
            to have Messenia, begged of Temenus to decide the <lb/>
            question by lots. And Temenus put into a water-pot <lb/>
            which had water in it the lots of Cresphoutes and the <lb/>
            sons of Aristodemus separately, so that he who's lot <lb/>
            came up first should have Messenia. Temenus prepared <lb/>
            both the lots, the lot of the sons of Aristodemus he made <lb/>
            of clay dried in the sun, and Cresphontes' lot of clay that <lb/>
            had been baked in the furnace : and the lot of the sons of <lb/>
            Aristodemus melted, and stuck to the bottom of the water- <lb/>
            pot, so that Cresphontes (for his lot came out) got posses­ <lb/>
            sion in this way of Messenia. And the old Messenians <lb/>
            were not turned out by the Dorians, but agreed to Cres­ <lb/>
            phontes being their king, and to the partition of the land <lb/>
            among the Dorians. And they were brought over to <lb/>
            this compliance by suspicion of their former kings, be­ <lb/>
            cause they were Minyæ who had originally sprung from <lb/>
            Iolcus. And the wife of Cresphontes was Merope the <lb/>
            daughter of Cypselus (who was at that time king of the <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            Arcadians), by whom he had several children and the name <lb/>
            of the youngest was Æpytus. And his palace, where he <lb/>
            himself and his sons meant to live, he built at Stenyclerus : <lb/>
            for in ancient times Perieres and the other kings lived at <lb/>
            Andania, and after Aphareus had built Arene he and his <lb/>
            sons lived there, and in the reign of Nestor and his descen­ <lb/>
            dants the Court lived at Pylos, but Cresphontes changed <lb/>
            the royal residence to Stenyclerus. And, as he chiefly <lb/>
            ingratiated himself with the people, the wealthy classes <lb/>
            rose up in insurrection against him and killed him and <lb/>
            all his sons except Æpytus, who being quite a boy was <lb/>
            brought up by Cypselus, and alone survived of all the <lb/>
            house, and when he grew to man's estate the Arcadians <lb/>
            restored him to Messene. And the other kings of the <lb/>
            Dorians, the sons of Aristodemus, and Isthmius the son of <lb/>
            Temenus, joined in bringing him back. And when Æpytus <lb/>
            became king he punished his father's murderers, and all <lb/>
            those who had instigated the crime: and bringing over to <lb/>
            his side by his attentions those who were in high position <lb/>
            among the Messenians, and the populace by gifts, he arrived <lb/>
            at such a pitch of honour that his descendants were called <lb/>
            Æpytidæ instead of Heraclida?.</p>
          <p>And Glaucus the son of Æpytus, who succeeded his <lb/>
            father, in all other respects imitated his father beth in <lb/>
            public and private, but far exceeded him in piety. For <lb/>
            when the sacred enclosure of Zeus on the summit of <lb/>
            Ithome did not receive honours among the Dorians, through <lb/>
            the neglect of Polycaon and Messene, Glancus restored <lb/>
            his worship : and was the first to sacrifice to Machaon the <lb/>
            son of AEsculapius at Gerenia, and awarded such gifts to <lb/>
            Messene the daughter of Triopas as are usually bestowed <lb/>
            on heroes. And Isthmius Glaucus' son also built a temple <lb/>
            to Gorgasus and Nicomachus at Pharæ. And the son of <lb/>
            Isthmius was Dotadas, who, though Messenia had several <lb/>
            other havens, constructed one at Mothone. And Sybotas <lb/>
            the son of Dotadas decreed that annually the king should <lb/>
            sacrifice by the river Pamisus, and offer victims to Eury­ <lb/>
            tus the son of Melaneus in Œchalia, before the rites of the <lb/>
            Great Goddesses that are still celebrated in Andania.</p><pb n="234"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND in the reign of Phintas, the son of Sybotas, the <lb/>
            Messenians first sent to Apollo at Delos sacrifices and <lb/>
            a choir of men. And their processional Hymn to the god <lb/>
            was composed by Eumelus, and these are considered the only <lb/>
            genuine lines of Eumelus. It was during the reign of this <lb/>
            Phintas that a disagreement for the first time came about <lb/>
            between the Lacedæmonians and the Messenians. The <lb/>
            cause is doubtful, but is traditionally as follows. On the <lb/>
            borders of Messenia is a temple of Artemis Limnas, in <lb/>
            which the Messenians and Lacedæmonians were the only <lb/>
            Dorians that had a share. The Lacedaemonians say that <lb/>
            some maidens of theirs who were present at the feast <lb/>
            were violated by some Messenians, and that their king <lb/>
            Teleclus, (the son of Archelaus, the son of Agesilaus, the <lb/>
            son of Doryssus, the son of Labotas, the son of Echestratus, <lb/>
            the son of Agis,) was slain in endeavouring to prevent this <lb/>
            outrage. They also say that the maidens who were vio­ <lb/>
            lated put themselves to death from shame. But the Mes­ <lb/>
            senian account is that Teleclus plotted against their persons <lb/>
            of quality that came to the temple, on account of the excel­ <lb/>
            lence of the Messenian soil, and picked out some beardless <lb/>
            Spartans, and, dressing them in female attire and ornaments <lb/>
            like maidens, introduced them armed with daggers among <lb/>
            some of the Messenians who were resting: but the other <lb/>
            Messenians came up to the rescue, and killed the beard­ <lb/>
            less young men and Teleclus himself. And the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians—for their king had not contrived all this with­ <lb/>
            out the common consent-knowing that they had begun <lb/>
            the wrong, did not demand vengeance for the murder of <lb/>
            Teleclus.. These are the different accounts the two nations <lb/>
            give, let everyone accept the view he prefers.</p>
          <p>And a generation afterwards, when Alcamenes the son of <lb/>
            Teleclus was king at Lacedæmon, and the king of the other <lb/>
            family was Theopompus; the son of Nicander, the son of <lb/>
            Charillus, the son of Polydectes, the son of Eunomus, the <lb/>
            son of Prytanis, the son of Eurypon, and Antiochus and <lb/>
            Androcles the sons of Phintas were kings of the Messenians, <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            strife arose between the Lacedæmonians and Messenians, and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians began hostilities, availing themselves, as <lb/>
            they were full of animosity and very warlike, of an adequate <lb/>
            and even specious pretext. But had their disposition been <lb/>
            more peaceable it would have been settled by arbitration. <lb/>
            This is what happened. Polychares a Messenian in other <lb/>
            respects not obscure was a victor at Olympia in the games, <lb/>
            when the people of Elis were celebrating their 4th Olympiad <lb/>
            and competed only in the race in which Polychares was victor. <lb/>
            This man had much cattle and, because he had not sufficient <lb/>
            land to pasture them upon, he handed them over to Euæph­ <lb/>
            nus a Spartan to feed on his land, on condition that he <lb/>
            should have a share in the produce of the cattle. Now <lb/>
            Eusephnus was a person who preferred unrighteous gains <lb/>
            to acting with integrity, and was generally speaking a wheed­ <lb/>
            ling fellow, so he sold the oxen of Polychares to merchants <lb/>
            who sailed to Laconia, and went himself to Polychares and <lb/>
            reported to him that some pirates had landed on the spot, <lb/>
            and violently robbed him both of cattle and herdsmen. <lb/>
            And while he was deceiving Polychares one of the herdsmen <lb/>
            fled from the merchants, and coming back to Polychares <lb/>
            found Euaephnus with him, and accused him to his master. <lb/>
            And being detected and having no defence, he earnestly <lb/>
            begged for pardon from Polychares and his son: en the <lb/>
            score that, among the elements in human nature whereby <lb/>
            we become unjust almost by compulsion, the love of gain is <lb/>
            the most powerful. And he stated the sum which he had <lb/>
            received for the cattle, and asked Polychares' son to go <lb/>
            with him and carry it back to his father. And when they <lb/>
            went on their journey and got to Laconia, Euæphnus dared <lb/>
            a deed more unholy than the former, he slew the son of <lb/>
            Polychares. And when Polychares knew of this last mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, he went to Lacedæmon to the kings and Ephors, <lb/>
            and went wailing through the multitude, reckoning up <lb/>
            what he had suffered at the hands of Euæphnus, whom he <lb/>
            had treated as a friend, and trusted more than all the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians. And when he got no redress, though he went <lb/>
            continually to the authorities, then he went off his head, <lb/>
            and giving way to his anger, and being perfectly reckless <lb/>
            of the consequences, endeavoured to kill every Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nian he met.</p><pb n="236"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE Laced cemonian account is that they went to war <lb/>
            because Polychares was not given up to them, and <lb/>
            because of the murder of Teleclus, and because they <lb/>
            were suspected earlier still of having had a hand in the <lb/>
            villany of Cresphontes about the lots. But the Messenians <lb/>
            contradict what I have already said about Teleclus, and <lb/>
            point to the fact that Æpytus the son of Cresphontes was <lb/>
            restored by the sons of Aristodemus, which they would <lb/>
            never have done had they been at variance with Cresphontes. <lb/>
            And they say that they did not give up Polychares to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians for punishment, because neither would <lb/>
            they give up Euæphnus, but they were willing that sentence <lb/>
            should be given by the Argives (who were the kinsmen of <lb/>
            both) at Amphictyonia, or that the case should be submitted <lb/>
            to the Court at Athens called the Areopagus, because that <lb/>
            court seemed from ancient times appointed for murder <lb/>
            cases. They also say that the Lacedæmonians did not go <lb/>
            to war on this account, but in consequence of their ambition <lb/>
            plotted against their land and did various things, alleging <lb/>
            at one time the condition of Arcadia, at another the state <lb/>
            of Argos, for they were never satisfied with slicing off from <lb/>
            time to time the territory of both of those people. And <lb/>
            they were the first to become friends of the barbarian <lb/>
            Crœsus who sent them gifts, at the time when he reduced <lb/>
            to slavery all the Greeks in Asia Minor, and all the Dorians <lb/>
            that dwelt in the mainland of Caria. And they declare <lb/>
            that, when the Phocian leaders plundered the temple at <lb/>
            Delphi, the kings at Sparta and other noblemen privately, <lb/>
            and the Ephors and senators publicly, had a hand in it. <lb/>
            And above all, to shew that the Lacedæmonians would <lb/>
            stick at nothing for lucre, they twitted them with their <lb/>
            alliance with Apollodorus the tyrant of Cassandrea. Why <lb/>
            indeed the Messenians consider this such a bitter taunt, I <lb/>
            cannot now discuss: for except that the courage of the <lb/>
            Messenians and the length of time they fought differed <lb/>
            from the tyranny of Apollodorus, they suffered nearly as <lb/>
            much as the people of Cassandrea. These are the causes <lb/>
            which each nation assign for the war.</p><pb n="237"/>
            
          <p>And now an embassy of Lacedæmonians came to demand <lb/>
            the extradition of Polychares. The kings of the Messenians <lb/>
            however answered the embassy that after deliberation with <lb/>
            the people they would send an answer to Sparta, and accord­ <lb/>
            ingly after the departure of the embassy they convened the <lb/>
            citizens to a general assembly. And different opinions were <lb/>
            bandied about; Androcles thought they ought to give up <lb/>
            Polychares as having acted impiously and most savagely, <lb/>
            Antiochus took the opposite view, and maintained that it <lb/>
            would be most distressing if Polychares should suffer before <lb/>
            the eyes of Euæphnus, and enumerated the harrowing de­ <lb/>
            tails of what his punishment would be. And eventually the <lb/>
            rival parties of Androcles and Antiochus proceeded to such <lb/>
            lengths that they took up arms. However their strife was <lb/>
            not long continued, for the party of Antiochus, being far <lb/>
            superior in numbers, slew Androcles and the most illustrious <lb/>
            of his partizans. And Antiochus being now the only king <lb/>
            sent letters to Sparta, to say that he would submit the <lb/>
            matter to the arbitration of the courts I have mentioned. <lb/>
            But the Lacedaemonians are said to have given no <lb/>
            answer to the bearers of these letters. And not many <lb/>
            months afterwards Antiochus died, and Euphaes his son <lb/>
            succeeded him. And the Lacedæmonians not only sent <lb/>
            no herald to proclaim war with the Messenians, nor <lb/>
            openly renounced friendship with them, but made their <lb/>
            preparations as secretly as possible, and previously bound <lb/>
            themselves by oath that neither for length of war (if <lb/>
            it should not be decided speedily), nor for reverses (if <lb/>
            they should meet with even great ones), would they leave <lb/>
            off till they had won Messenia by the fortune of war. <lb/>
            After taking this oath they made a night-attack on <lb/>
            Amphea, having appointed Alcamenes the son of Teleclus <lb/>
            as their General. Amphea is a small town in Messenia <lb/>
            but near Laconia, situated on a high hill, and well supplied <lb/>
            with water. And in other respects Amphea seemed a very <lb/>
            convenient base for their war. So they captured the town, <lb/>
            the gates being open and no garrison there, and killed all <lb/>
            the Messenians that they took in the town, some even in <lb/>
            their beds, and others as they found them sitting as sup­ <lb/>
            pliants at the temples and altars of the gods, and only a <lb/>
            few escaped. This was the first attack the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            made upon Messenia, in the second year of the ninth <lb/>
            Olympiad, in which Xenodocus the Messenian was victor in <lb/>
            the race. And at Athens there were not as yet yearly <lb/>
            magistrates appointed by lot: for the descendants of <lb/>
            Melanthus, who were called Medontidæ, had at first much <lb/>
            of their power taken away by the people, and instead of a <lb/>
            kingdom their power became limited, and afterwards their <lb/>
            authority was definitely restricted to ten years. At the time <lb/>
            of the capture of Amphea Æsimides, the son of AEschylus, <lb/>
            was in the fifth year of his government over the Athenians.</p>

          <p>B <lb/>
            UT before I write the history of this war, and the <lb/>
            actions and sufferings entailed by it upon both parties <lb/>
            by Providence, I wish to relate in their order the exploits <lb/>
            of Aristomenes the Messenian hero. For this war between <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians and their allies and the Messenians <lb/>
            and their mercenaries did not get its name from the attack­ <lb/>
            ing force, as the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, but was <lb/>
            called the Messenian war from the disasters which befell the <lb/>
            Messenians, just as the war at Ilium got called Trojan and <lb/>
            not Grecian, so it was in this war, which Rhianus of Bene and <lb/>
            Myron of Priene have celebrated, the former in poetry, the <lb/>
            latter in prose. Neither of them however have narrated <lb/>
            fully the events of the war from beginning to end, but <lb/>
            Myron has described the capture of Amphea and its conse­ <lb/>
            quences up to the death of Aristodemus, and Rhianus has <lb/>
            not touched at all the commencement of the war, but only <lb/>
            what eventually happened to the Messenians in consequence <lb/>
            of their quarrel with the Lacedæmonians, and he has not <lb/>
            described even the whole of this, but only what took place <lb/>
            after the battle which they fought at what was called the <lb/>
            great trench; and the hero Aristomenes on whose account <lb/>
            only I mentioned Rhianus and Myron, and who was the first <lb/>
            and foremost in bringing the name of Messene to honour, <lb/>
            this hero (I say) has been introduced by Myron into his <lb/>
            history, and by Rhianus into his poem, in which Aristomenes <lb/>
            is as much lauded as Achilles by Homer in the Iliad. As <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            these two have given such different accounts, I am obliged <lb/>
            to accept one of them and not both together. Rhianus ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me to speak more probably about the age of Aris­ <lb/>
            tomenes. But Myron, as one can learn in other particulars <lb/>
            and not least in the history of this Messenian war, does not <lb/>
            with sufficient accuracy test the truth or at least probability <lb/>
            of what he relates. For he states that Aristomenes slew Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus; the king of the Lacedæmonians, a little before the <lb/>
            death of Aristodemus, whereas we know that Theopompus <lb/>
            did not die in battle or in any other way before the end of <lb/>
            the war. And in fact Theopompus concluded the war, as <lb/>
            the elegiac lines of Tyrtæus bear me out, <lb/>
            ‘ To our king Theopompus god-beloved, <lb/>
            Through whom we took Messene spacious town! <lb/>
            Aristomenes therefore in my opinion was in the second <lb/>
            Messenian war, and I shall relate in detail all about him <lb/>
            when I come to that part of my subject.</p>
          <p>Now the Messenians, when they heard all that had hap­ <lb/>
            pened at Amphea from those who escaped from its capture, <lb/>
            convened delegates from all their towns at Stenyclerus. <lb/>
            And when the people were gathered together in the assembly, <lb/>
            several of those in authority, and last of all the king, exhorted <lb/>
            them not to be dejected at the fall of Amphea as if all the <lb/>
            war were decided thereby, and not to fear the preparations <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians as more formidable than their own, <lb/>
            for although they had had longer experience in war, yet <lb/>
            the Messenians would find necessity a great spur to brave <lb/>
            men, and would meet with greater favour from the gods as <lb/>
            defending their country, and not commencing hostilities.</p>

          <p>w <lb/>
            ITH these words Euphaes dismissed the assembly, <lb/>
            and from that time forward kept all the Messenians <lb/>
            under arms, compelling those that did not know to learn the <lb/>
            art of war, and making those that did practise more fre­ <lb/>
            quently than before. And the Lacedæmonians made incur­ <lb/>
            sions into Messenia, but did not injure the country inns­ <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            much as they considered it their own, neither did they cut <lb/>
            down trees nor pull down houses ; but they drove off what­ <lb/>
            ever cattle they found, and carried off the corn and all <lb/>
            fruit. They likewise made attacks on some of the towns <lb/>
            but took none, inasmuch as they were strongly fortified and <lb/>
            carefully guarded, and after much loss they desisted from <lb/>
            the attempt, and ceased attacking them. And the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians plundered the maritime parts of Laconia, and all the <lb/>
            farms in the neighbourhood of Mount Taygetus. And in <lb/>
            the 4th year after the capture of Amphea Euphaes, full of <lb/>
            zeal from the ardour of the Messenians who were boiling <lb/>
            over with rage at the Lacedaemonians, and at the same time <lb/>
            thinking their training complete, ordered a march, and <lb/>
            bade the slaves follow with wood and all other things <lb/>
            necessary for entrenching a camp. And the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians heard from the garrison at Amphea that the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians were on the march, and they too marched out to <lb/>
            battle. And at a place in Messenia very convenient for a <lb/>
            battle, with a deep ravine in front of it, Euphaes drew up <lb/>
            the Messenians in battle array, having appointed Cleonnis <lb/>
            to the chief command : the cavalry and light-armed troops, <lb/>
            which were both less than 500, were under Pytharatus and <lb/>
            Antander. And when the two armies engaged the ravine <lb/>
            prevented the heavy-armed troops from encountering, though <lb/>
            they advanced against one another eagerly and impetuously <lb/>
            in their mutual hatred, but the cavalry and the light-armed <lb/>
            troops engaged above the ravine, and they were equally <lb/>
            matched in numbers and skill, and consequently the battle <lb/>
            was evenly poised. But while these were engaged, Euphaes <lb/>
            ordered the slaves first to fortify the rear of the army and <lb/>
            then the flanks with stockades. And when night overtook <lb/>
            them and the battle was stayed, then they fortified also the <lb/>
            front of the camp opposite the ravine, so that next day the <lb/>
            tactical skill and foresight of Euphaes dawned upon the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and they found that they could not fight <lb/>
            against the Messenians if they would not come out of their <lb/>
            entrenchments, and they despaired of besieging them as <lb/>
            they had no siege train.</p>
          <p>And so they returned home: and a year afterwards, when <lb/>
            the old man reviled them and taunted them with cowar­ <lb/>
            dice and disregard of their oath, they openly made pre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            parations for a second campaign against the Messenians. <lb/>
            And they were led by both their kings, Theopompus the <lb/>
            son of Nicander, and Polydorus the son of Alcamenes, for <lb/>
            Alcamenes was now dead. And the Messenians made <lb/>
            counter-preparations, and when the Spartans marched to <lb/>
            battle moved out to meet them. And the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            were led by Polydorus on the left wing, and Theopompus <lb/>
            on the right, and in the centre by Euryleon, a Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian for the nonce but originally a Theban descended <lb/>
            from Cadmus, the fifth descendant from Ægeus, the <lb/>
            son of Œolycus, the son of Theras, the son of Autesion. <lb/>
            And opposite the right wing of the Lacedaemonians were <lb/>
            the Messenians under Antander and Euphaes, and on the <lb/>
            wing opposite Polydorus under Pytharatus, and in the <lb/>
            centre under Cleonnis. And as they were just going to <lb/>
            engage, the kings came up and exhorted their men. To <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians Theopompus made a short harangue <lb/>
            according to the custom of his country, reminding them of <lb/>
            their oath against the Messenians, and how noble an ambi­ <lb/>
            tion it was to shew themselves more capable of brilliant <lb/>
            exploits than their fathers who subjugated their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, and to acquire a richer territory. Euphaes spoke at <lb/>
            greater length than the Lacedæmonian king, but not more <lb/>
            so than the occasion warranted. For he shewed that the <lb/>
            contest was not only for land or possessions, but they knew <lb/>
            clearly he said what misery would come upon them if they <lb/>
            were conquered : their wives and children would be led off <lb/>
            into captivity, the lightest punishment for their young men <lb/>
            would be death, perhaps not unaccompanied by outrage, <lb/>
            their temples would be plundered, their country destroyed <lb/>
            by fire. He was not he said merely making suppositions, <lb/>
            what those who were taken at Amphea had suffered was <lb/>
            proof positive of all that he said. Rather than bear such <lb/>
            ills it would be preferable to die nobly, and it would <lb/>
            be much easier (when they were yet unconquered and as <lb/>
            bold as the enemy) to vanquish their adversaries by their <lb/>
            courage, than to retrieve their ruined fortunes if they were <lb/>
            faint-hearted now. Such was the speech of Euphaes. <note type="footnote"> R </note></p><pb n="242"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND directly the leaders on either side gave the signal <lb/>
            for battle, the Messenians came on at the double, and <lb/>
            exposed themselves freely as men dealing death in their <lb/>
            rage at every blow, and everyone was anxious to begin the <lb/>
            fight. And the Lacedaemonians rushed out to meet them <lb/>
            with equal ardour, but took care not to break their line. <lb/>
            And when they got to close quarters, they threatened one <lb/>
            another, rattling their arms, and looking fiercely at one <lb/>
            another, and proceeded to abuse, the Lacedæmonians say­ <lb/>
            ing that the Messenians were already their slaves, and <lb/>
            that they were not a whit freer than the Helots, and the <lb/>
            Messenians replying that they were impious in what they <lb/>
            were attempting, viz. in attacking kinsmen for the sake <lb/>
            of gain, and were profane to the national gods of the <lb/>
            Dorians and especially to Hercules. And by this time <lb/>
            they followed up words with blows, and rushed on one <lb/>
            another pell mell (with greatest vigour the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians), man attacking man. From their long experience <lb/>
            and practice in war the Lacedaemonians had the advantage, <lb/>
            and also from their numbers, (for the neighbouring nations <lb/>
            who were subject to them they had with them in their <lb/>
            army, and the Asinæi and Dryopes, who a generation <lb/>
            earlier had been driven by the Argives from their own land <lb/>
            and had come to Lacedæmon as suppliants, were now com­ <lb/>
            pelled to swell their army), and against the lightarmed <lb/>
            troops of the Messenians they had Cretan archers, merce­ <lb/>
            naries. And the Messenians were animated equally by <lb/>
            despair and contempt of death, and all their sufferings <lb/>
            they looked on as necessary rather than dreadful to those <lb/>
            who loved their country's honour, and the more vigorously <lb/>
            they fought the harder they thought would things go for <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. And some of them advancing in front <lb/>
            of their lines exhibited brilliant bravery, and others badly <lb/>
            wounded and scarce alive were animated by desperation. <lb/>
            And they cheered one another on, those who were alive and <lb/>
            yet unwounded encouraging the wounded to receive with joy <lb/>
            their fate, and sell their lives as dearly as possible : and the <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            wounded, (when they perceived their strength failing, and <lb/>
            that they would soon yield up their breath), urging on the <lb/>
            unwounded to shew as much courage as themselves had <lb/>
            shewn, and not to let their death be useless to their <lb/>
            country. But the Lacedæmonians at first made no <lb/>
            harangues to their men, and were not as ready as the <lb/>
            Messenians to display heroic courage : but being accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to war from boys their formation in line was deeper, <lb/>
            and they expected that the Messenians could not hold out <lb/>
            as long as they could, nor stand the strain of their heavy <lb/>
            armour, nor their wounds. Such were the peculiar features <lb/>
            of each army in respect to both the behaviour and feel- , <lb/>
            ings of the combatants: what was common to both was <lb/>
            that no quarter was asked for, perhaps this was despaired <lb/>
            of from their fierce hatred, and they felt the greatest self­ <lb/>
            indignation that they had not sold their lives dearer: and <lb/>
            those that killed their man abstained both from boasting <lb/>
            and reproaches, being uncertain which party would win. <lb/>
            And most unexpectedly fell those who were endeavouring <lb/>
            to plunder some of the dead bodies, for either by disclosing <lb/>
            some naked part of their body they got pierced with darts, <lb/>
            not on their guard in their thirst for plunder, or they <lb/>
            were killed by some of those whom they were attempting <lb/>
            to rob who were still alive. The kings also foughf right <lb/>
            valiantly, and Theopompus rushed with ungovernable rage <lb/>
            against Euphaes, intending to kill him. And Euphaes <lb/>
            seeing him rushing on said to Antander that Theopompus <lb/>
            was displaying as much bravery as his ancestor Polynices : <lb/>
            for Polynices led an army from Argos against his own <lb/>
            country, and he and his brother mutually slew one <lb/>
            another: and Theopompus (he added) wished to load <lb/>
            the family of the Heraclidæ with the same guilt as that <lb/>
            of the family of Laius and Œdipus: he would not how­ <lb/>
            ever go with joy from the battle. With these words he <lb/>
            himself went forward to meet Theopompus. Hereupon <lb/>
            the battle, which had rather flagged, took up fresh vigour <lb/>
            again, and their bodies were renewed as it were, and the <lb/>
            fearlessness of death on both sides was increased, so that <lb/>
            one might have thought the battle had only just com­ <lb/>
            menced. And eventually Euphaes' division, nearly mad <lb/>
            with desperate valour and stoutheartedness, for the King's <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            bodyguard were all picked men, broke the enemy's line, <lb/>
            routed Theopompus, and put the Lacedaemonians in that <lb/>
            part of the field to flight. But the other wing of the <lb/>
            Messenians was hard pressed, for Pytharatus their General <lb/>
            was dead, and without a leader they became disordered <lb/>
            and dejected. But neither did Polydorus pursue the <lb/>
            fleeing Messenians, nor Euphaes the fleeing Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians. For Euphaes and his staff thought it better to <lb/>
            come to the aid of their vanquished friends: nor did <lb/>
            they engage with Polydorus and his troops: for by this <lb/>
            time it was already dark, and the Lacedaemonians were <lb/>
            prevented from following the fugitives not least by their <lb/>
            ignorance of the country. It was also their country's <lb/>
            custom not to pursue an enemy too hotly, being more <lb/>
            anxious not to break their line than to annihilate the <lb/>
            enemy. And in the centre on both sides, the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians under Euryleon, and the Messenians under Cleonnis, <lb/>
            the fight was pretty equal, till the approach of night put <lb/>
            an end to the contest.</p>
          <p>This battle was fought on both sides mainly by the heavy <lb/>
            armed infantry. Some cavalry there was indeed, but they <lb/>
            had no great influence on the fortunes of the day, for the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians of that day were not good horsemen. And <lb/>
            the light armed troops of the Messenians and the Cretans <lb/>
            on the Lacedaemonian side did not come to the encounter at <lb/>
            all: for they were posted in ancient fashion among the <lb/>
            infantry. And on the following day neither party were <lb/>
            minded to renew the battle nor to erect a trophy of victory, <lb/>
            but as the day wore on they sent out heralds to treat of the <lb/>
            burying of their dead, and as this was agreed to on both <lb/>
            sides, they began to bury their dead immediately.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>B <lb/>
            UT the Messenians after the battle began to find their <lb/>
            affairs in a deplorable condition : for they were nearly <lb/>
            ruined by their outlay in money expended in keeping <lb/>
            garrisons in the towns, and their slaves deserted to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. Also a pestilence fell upon them, which <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            troubled them greatly being like the plague, though it did <lb/>
            not prevail universally throughout their country. And <lb/>
            after deliberation about their present condition they deter­ <lb/>
            mined to abandon their towns in the interior of the country, <lb/>
            and dwell in the mountain district of Ithome. And there <lb/>
            was a small town at Ithome which Homer has mentioned <lb/>
            in his catalogue, <lb/>
            ‘ And rocky Ithome.’1 <lb/>
            To this town they repaired, extending its ancient limits so <lb/>
            as to make it a sufficient defence for all of them. And the <lb/>
            place was in other respects a strong position: for Ithome <lb/>
            is as high as any of the mountains within the Isthmus, and <lb/>
            in this respect most difficult of access. They thought they <lb/>
            would also send an envoy to Delphi, and they selected for <lb/>
            this mission Tisis the son of Aids, who in general merit <lb/>
            and in divination was considered inferior to nobody. This <lb/>
            Tisis on his return from Delphi was laid in wait for by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians who were in garrison at Amphea : but he <lb/>
            would not be taken alive, so valiantly did he defend himself <lb/>
            against those that had lain in ambush, in spite of the wounds <lb/>
            he received from them, till a voice was heard without any <lb/>
            appearance of the speaker, " Let the bearer of the oracle <lb/>
            go." And Tisis, directly he got safe to Ithome, and had <lb/>
            delivered his oracle to the king, fell down dead of his <lb/>
            wounds. And Euphaes collected the Messenians together <lb/>
            and recited the oracle. " Sacrifice a pure virgin (selected <lb/>
            by lot out of the family of the Æpytidæ) by night to the <lb/>
            gods below. But if you cannot find one of the Æpytidæ, <lb/>
            then sacrifice anyone else who offers himself as a willing <lb/>
            victim." This being the utterance of the god, forthwith all <lb/>
            the maidens of the family of the Æpytidæ drew lots. And <lb/>
            when the lot fell upon the daughter of Lyciscus, Epebolus <lb/>
            the seer said it would not do to sacrifice her ; for she was <lb/>
            not really the daughter of Lyciscus, but a girl that the wife <lb/>
            of Lyciscus being barren had palmed off as hers. While he <lb/>
            was making this revelation, Lyciscus took off the girl and <lb/>
            fled to Sparta. And the Messenians being very dejected <lb/>
            at finding out the flight of Lyciscus, Aristodemus, a man <lb/>
            of the family of the Æpytidæ, and in other respects and in <note type="footnote"> I Iliad, ii. 729. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            war more illustrious than Lyciscus, offered to sacrifice his <lb/>
            own daughter. But the affairs of mankind, and not least <lb/>
            their desires, are secretly directed by Fate, just as the <lb/>
            bottom of a river has pebbles, so that Aristodemus on this <lb/>
            occasion, endeavouring to save Messene, was prevented by <lb/>
            the following circumstance. A Messenian, whose name <lb/>
            is not known, happened to be deeply in love with the <lb/>
            daughter of Aristodemus, and was on the eve of marry­ <lb/>
            ing her. He at first disputed the right of Aristodemus to <lb/>
            the maiden as he had betrothed her to him, and argued <lb/>
            that he being her betrothed alone had right to her. And <lb/>
            afterwards, when he found this argument unavailing, he <lb/>
            invented a shameful story, that he had had an amour with <lb/>
            her and that she was pregnant by him. And at last he <lb/>
            wrought up Aristodemus to such a pitch, that driven to <lb/>
            madness in his anger he killed his daughter, and afterwards <lb/>
            cut her up and found she was not pregnant. And Epebolus <lb/>
            who was present bade somebody else give his daughter as a <lb/>
            victim, for the daughter of Aristodemus (he said) could be <lb/>
            no more use to them now she was dead : for her father had <lb/>
            indeed killed her, but not sacrificed her to the gods as the <lb/>
            Pythian oracle ordered. When the seer had said this the <lb/>
            mass of the Messenians rushed forward to kill the girl's <lb/>
            lover, as he had caused Aristodemus to commit a useless <lb/>
            crime, and had rendered doubtful the safety of the com­ <lb/>
            munity. But this man was a very great friend of Euphaes. <lb/>
            Euphaes accordingly persuaded the Messenians that the <lb/>
            oracle was fulfilled by the death of the girl, and that what <lb/>
            Aristodemus had done was sufficient. And when he had <lb/>
            said this all the Æpytidæ agreed with him : for each was <lb/>
            anxious to have his fears removed about having to sacrifice <lb/>
            his own daughter. So they hearkened to the advice of the <lb/>
            king and broke up the assembly, and afterwards turned <lb/>
            their attention to the sacrifices and festival of the gods.</p><pb n="247"/>

          <p>B <lb/>
            UT the Lacedaemonians on hearing the oracle of the <lb/>
            Messenians were very dejected, both they and their <lb/>
            kings, and henceforth shrank from resuming the war. But <lb/>
            in the sixth year after the flight of Lyciscus from'Ithome <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians (as their sacrifices were auspicious) led <lb/>
            an army to Ithome. But the Cretans chanced to be absent, <lb/>
            and the allies of the Messenians were also behindhand. For <lb/>
            the Spartans were an object of suspicion to other Peloponne­ <lb/>
            sians and especially to the Arcadians and Argives. The <lb/>
            Argives indeed were going to come to help the Messenians <lb/>
            secretly without the knowledge of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            privately rather than from public decree. But the Arca­ <lb/>
            than expedition was publicly announced, though they were <lb/>
            behindhand too. But the Messenians were induced by <lb/>
            confidence in the oracle to hazard war even without allies. <lb/>
            In most respects the battle was no different from the former <lb/>
            one, for daylight on this occasion too failed the combatants: <lb/>
            it is not however mentioned that either wing or division <lb/>
            were broken, for they say the troops did not remain in the <lb/>
            order in which they were placed at first, but the bravest men <lb/>
            came from the wings in both armies into the centre, and there <lb/>
            was the strain of battle. For Euphaes was more ardent in <lb/>
            fight than one would have expected from a king, and reek­ <lb/>
            lessly rushing upon Theopompus and his staff, received many <lb/>
            mortal wounds. As he fainted away and fell to the ground, <lb/>
            and could scarce breathe, the Lacedæmonians strove with <lb/>
            might and main to drag him to their army. But their pre­ <lb/>
            vious goodwill to Euphaes, and their future disgrace if they <lb/>
            abandoned him, roused the Messenians, and it appeared <lb/>
            better to them to give up their lives for their king rather than <lb/>
            purchase safety by abandoning him. Accordingly the peril <lb/>
            of Euphaes prolonged the battle, and added to the bravery <lb/>
            exhibited on both sides, and afterwards he revived, and saw <lb/>
            that his men were fighting as valiantly as the foe, and not <lb/>
            many days afterwards he died, having been king of the <lb/>
            Messenians for 13 years, and having been at war with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians during all his reign. And as he had no <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            children he left the choice of his successor to the people, <lb/>
            and Cleonnis and Damis were rival competitors with Aris­ <lb/>
            todemus, being considered superior to him both in other <lb/>
            respects and in war. And Antander had been killed in the <lb/>
            battle jeoparding his life for Euphaes. And the opinions <lb/>
            of the seers, Epebolus and Ophioneus, were both similar, <lb/>
            that the kingdom of Æpytus and his descendants should <lb/>
            not be conferred upon a man polluted with the murder of a <lb/>
            daughter. Nevertheless Aristodemus was elected and be­ <lb/>
            came king. And Ophioneus the Messenian seer was blind <lb/>
            from his birth, and had the following mode of divina­ <lb/>
            tion. By enquiring into a person's private and public for­ <lb/>
            tune in the past he informed them what it would be in the <lb/>
            future. This was his divination, and Aristodemus having <lb/>
            become king through the people was desirous to gratify <lb/>
            them in all that was reasonable, and of those in authority <lb/>
            he held Cleonnis and'Damis in special honour. He also <lb/>
            paid great attention to the allies, and sent gifts to the <lb/>
            most influential Arcadians both at Argos and Sicyon. And <lb/>
            in the war which was carried on in the reign of Aristode­ <lb/>
            mus they pillaged from time to time, and in the summer­ <lb/>
            time made incursions into one another's country. There <lb/>
            were counter-incursions into Laconia on the part of the <lb/>
            Arcadians with the Messenians. But the Argives did not <lb/>
            think it well openly to proclaim their hostility against the* <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, but made their preparations so as to strike <lb/>
            in when the fray begun.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XI..</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I <lb/>
            N the fifth year of the reign of Aristodemus, when both <lb/>
            nations were about to take the field again after open <lb/>
            proclamation of war, both very much weakened by the <lb/>
            length and expenses of the war, then allies came to both, <lb/>
            to the Lacedaemonians the Corinthians alone of all the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians, and to the Messenians the Arcadians in <lb/>
            full force, and picked men from Argos and Sicyon. The <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians placed the Corinthians and Helots and the <lb/>
            provincials in the centre, and themselves with their kings <lb/>
            took up their position on the wings, in deeper and <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            fuller formation than was ever before adopted. And the <lb/>
            dispositions of Aristodemus and his staff for the battle <lb/>
            were as follows. For all the Arcadians or Messenians that <lb/>
            were strong in body and stout of heart, but had not good <lb/>
            weapons, he picked out the best arms, and when the action <lb/>
            became hot, posted them among the Argives and Sicyo­ <lb/>
            nians : and extended his line so as not to be taken in flank <lb/>
            by the enemy. And he took care that his men were so <lb/>
            placed that they had the mountain Ithome in their rear. <lb/>
            And he appointed Cleonnis to the command here, and <lb/>
            himself and Damis stayed with the light-armed troops, <lb/>
            and a few slingers and archers: most in this part of the <lb/>
            army were well adapted physically for attack and retreat, <lb/>
            and lightly armed. Each had a breastplate or shield, <lb/>
            but such as were deficient in this respect had goatskins <lb/>
            and sheepskins, or the skins of wild beasts, the Arcadian <lb/>
            mountaineers in particular had the skins of wolves and <lb/>
            bears. And each had several javelins, and some had lances. <lb/>
            And these lay in ambush in Ithome where they could be <lb/>
            best concealed from sight And the heavy armed troops of <lb/>
            the Messenians and the allies stood the first onset of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and afterwards were in all respects full of <lb/>
            bravery. They were outnumbered by the enemy, but being <lb/>
            picked men they fought against an armed mob and not <lb/>
            against men of equal discipline to themselves, consequently <lb/>
            they held out much longer through their bravery and <lb/>
            skill. Moreover the light-armed troops of the Messenians, <lb/>
            when the signal was given, rushed against the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians and hemmed them in, and hurled their javelins at <lb/>
            their flanks, and the bolder of them rushed in and fought <lb/>
            hand to hand. And the Lacedæmonians, though they saw <lb/>
            before them a second danger and so hopeless a one in the <lb/>
            same place, yet were not in despair, but turned upon the <lb/>
            light-armed troops and tried to repel them, but as because <lb/>
            of the lightness of their armour they easily ran away, the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians were both perplexed and irritated. Some­ <lb/>
            how or other men are apt to be especially vexed at what <lb/>
            happens contrary to their, expectation. And so here those <lb/>
            of the Spartans who were already wounded, and those who <lb/>
            were nearest to the light-armed troops, as their comrades <lb/>
            lay dead, rushed out of their ranks wherever they saw the <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            light-armed troops pressing on, and in their heat pursued <lb/>
            rather too far as the enemy retired. Then the light-armed <lb/>
            troops of the Messenians, as they had done at first, struck <lb/>
            them, and hurled their javelins at them as they stood their <lb/>
            ground, and when they pursued made a feint to flee, and <lb/>
            attacked them as they tried to rejoin their men. And <lb/>
            this they did in various parts of the field, and at different <lb/>
            points in the enemy's lines. And the heavy-armed <unclear>OI</unclear>,the <lb/>
            Messenians and the allies at this juncture pressed more <lb/>
            boldly right at the foe. And eventually the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, spent with the length of the battle and their wounds, <lb/>
            and at the same time harassed beyond measure by the light­ <lb/>
            armed troops, broke their ranks. And in the rout the <lb/>
            light-armed troops harassed them all the more. Of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians who were cut to pieces in the battle, I <lb/>
            could not ascertain the number, but I believe it was very <lb/>
            large. And the return home to some was easy, but to the <lb/>
            Corinthians it was sure to be dangerous, for, whether they <lb/>
            returned through Argolis or by Sicyon, they had equally to <lb/>
            pass through hostile country.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE Lacedaemonians were troubled at this reverse that <lb/>
            had befallen them, and at the many excellent warriors <lb/>
            they had lost in the battle. And they despaired of success <lb/>
            in the war, so they sent envoys to Delphi. And this was the <lb/>
            oracle the Pythian Priestess gave. ' Phoebus bids you not <lb/>
            only apply yourselves to warlike deeds, but as it was by <lb/>
            cunning that the people got the Messenian land, by the <lb/>
            selfsame cunning as it was got shall it be taken.' The <lb/>
            kings and Ephors, though they were very anxious to do <lb/>
            so, could not find out a good plan till they imitated the wili­ <lb/>
            ness of Odysseus at Ilium. They sent 100 men to Ithome <lb/>
            to spy out the enemies' designs, who were to pretend to be <lb/>
            deserters. And to keep up the cheat these men were pub­ <lb/>
            licly condemned at Sparta as deserters. But on their <lb/>
            arrival Aristodemus sent them home again at once, saying, <lb/>
            " The injuries done to the Lacedæmonians are recent, their <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            craft ancient." The Lacedæmonians having failed in this <lb/>
            manoeuvre next attempted to tamper with the allies of the <lb/>
            Messenians. But as the Arcadians rejected their overtures, <lb/>
            for to them the envoys went first, they did not proceed to <lb/>
            Argos. And Aristodemus hearing of all these Intrigues on the <lb/>
            part of the Lacedæmonians sent himself messengers to con­ <lb/>
            sult the oracle at Delphi. And this was the answer of the <lb/>
            Pythian priestess. " The glory in the war the god gives you, <lb/>
            but take care that the treacherous hostile ambush be not too <lb/>
            much for you through Spartan wiles ; for if Ares is to have <lb/>
            their well-wrought armour, and the garlands of their dances <lb/>
            are to belong to sorrowing owners, then must they avoid the <lb/>
            appearance of two hidden things. Nor shall the sacred light <lb/>
            of day behold tie end of all this till fate shall come to the <lb/>
            things that change their nature." Aristodemus however <lb/>
            and the seers could not understand what was meant: but <lb/>
            a few years afterwards the god threw light on it and <lb/>
            fulfilled it. Remarkable things too happened at this time <lb/>
            to the Messenians. As Lyciscus lived as a resident alien <lb/>
            at Sparta his daughter, whom he had taken with him <lb/>
            in his flight from Messene, chanced to die. And as he <lb/>
            often went to visit his daughter's grave, some Arcadian <lb/>
            cavalry lay in wait for him and carried him off. And he <lb/>
            was taken to Ithome, and being brought before the assembly <lb/>
            he made his defence ; he had not left his country he said <lb/>
            intending treason, but in consequence of believing the asser­ <lb/>
            tion of the seer that she was not his genuine daughter. In <lb/>
            this line of defence he was not believed to be speaking the <lb/>
            truth till a woman, who was at that time the priestess of <lb/>
            Hera, came into the theatre. And she confessed that the child <lb/>
            was hers, and that she had given it to the wife of Lyciscus <lb/>
            to palm off as her own. And now (she continued) by re­ <lb/>
            vealing my secret I shall depose myself from my priesthood. <lb/>
            This she said because it was a custom in Messene that, if <lb/>
            any of the children of a priest or priestess died, the priest­ <lb/>
            hood should pass to somebody else. Thinking therefore <lb/>
            that the woman was speaking the truth, they chose for the <lb/>
            goddess a priestess in her place, and said that Lyciscus had <lb/>
            acted in a pardonable way.</p>
          <p>And after that they resolved, for it was the 20th year of <lb/>
            the war, to send again to Delphi to enquire about their <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            chance of victory. And to their enquiry the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess returned this answer. " To those who shall first <lb/>
            set up 100 tripods at the altar of Zeus of Ithome the god <lb/>
            will give the Messenian land with fame in war. This is <lb/>
            the will of Zeus. But guile moves you on, and behind is <lb/>
            vengeance, and you cannot deceive the god. Act as fate <lb/>
            shall determine. Ruin takes people by turns." When <lb/>
            they heard this they thought the oracle was in their favour, <lb/>
            and promised them victory in the war ; for as they were in <lb/>
            possession of the temple of Zeus within the walls of Ithome, <lb/>
            they thought the Lacedaemonians could not be beforehand <lb/>
            with them in erecting tripods. And so they intended making <lb/>
            wooden tripods, for they had not means enough to make <lb/>
            tripods of brass. But somebody from Delphi reported the <lb/>
            oracle at Sparta. And the Spartans had a public consulta­ <lb/>
            tion about it, but could hit upon no plan, but CEbalus, a <lb/>
            man of no great repute but evidently possessed of good <lb/>
            judgment, made 100 tripods of clay roughly, and took <lb/>
            them with him and nets as if he were a hunter. And <lb/>
            being unknown even to most of the Lacedæmonians he <lb/>
            easily escaped the detection of the Messenians. For joining <lb/>
            himself with some countrymen he went with them into <lb/>
            Ithome, and directly night came on he offered these clay <lb/>
            tripods to the god, and returned to Sparta and told the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians what he had done. And the Messenians <lb/>
            when they saw what had happened were terribly upset, <lb/>
            and guessed (as indeed was the case) that it was a trick of <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians : however Aristodemus consoled them <lb/>
            with arguments suited to the present conjuncture, and <lb/>
            placed their wooden tripods which were already made at <lb/>
            the altar at Ithome. It happened also that Ophioneus, <lb/>
            the seer who was blind from birth, greatly to the surprise <lb/>
            of all men recovered his sight: for he had a sharp head­ <lb/>
            ache and recovered his sight after it.</p><pb n="253"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            XD thenceforward—for fate already turned the scales <lb/>
            towards the capture of Ithome—the god gave them <lb/>
            various predictions of their coming destiny. For the statue <lb/>
            of Artemis, which was of brass as well as the armour, <lb/>
            dropt its shield; and as Aristodemus was about to sacrifice <lb/>
            the victims to Zeus at Ithome, the rams of their own accord <lb/>
            violently dashed their heads against the altar, and were <lb/>
            killed by the blow. And a third phenomenon happened. <lb/>
            Some dogs assembled in the same place and howled all <lb/>
            night, and eventually went off in a body to the camp of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. This troubled Aristodemus, as also the <lb/>
            following vision of the night. He dreamed that he was <lb/>
            going out to battle fully armed, and saw lying on a table <lb/>
            the victims' entrails, and his daughter appeared to him in <lb/>
            a black dress with her breast and belly ripped up, and he <lb/>
            thought she threw away what was on the table, and took <lb/>
            away his armour, and instead of it put upon him a golden <lb/>
            crown and white robe. And as Aristodemus was dispirited, <lb/>
            for he thought the dream announced to him the end of his <lb/>
            life, (for the Messenians buried their notable men in. white <lb/>
            raiment with crowns on their heads), somebody brought <lb/>
            him word that Ophioneus had suddenly become blind again <lb/>
            as before. Then he understood the hidden sense of the <lb/>
            oracle, that by the pair who appeared after being hidden, <lb/>
            and returned again as fate necessitated, the Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess meant the eyes of Ophioneus. Thereupon Aristo­ <lb/>
            demus laying to heart his domestic misfortunes, that he had <lb/>
            been the murderer of his daughter to no purpose, and <lb/>
            seeing no future hope of safety for his country, cut his <lb/>
            throat at his daughter's grave, being such an one as would <lb/>
            in all human calculation have saved his country had not <lb/>
            fortune brought to nothing his plans and actions. And he <lb/>
            died after a reign of six years and a few months. And to <lb/>
            the Messenians their affairs now seemed desperate, so that <lb/>
            they were very near sending a supplicatory embassy to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, though pride restrained them from actually <lb/>
            doing so, so much did they feel the blow of Aristodemns’ <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            death. And when they gathered together in their assembly <lb/>
            they did not choose another king, but appointed Damis <lb/>
            dictator. And he, having selected Cleonnis and Phyleus <lb/>
            as his coadjutors, made preparations for the campaign <lb/>
            according to his best ability under the circumstances : for <lb/>
            he was pressed hard by the siege, and not least by famine <lb/>
            and the fear that famine inspired that they could not hold <lb/>
            out from want of supplies. There was no deficiency <lb/>
            of bravery or ,venturesomeness on the part of the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians : all their generals and notables were killed. For <lb/>
            about five months they held out, and towards the close of the <lb/>
            year evacuated Ithome, having been at war for full twenty <lb/>
            years, as the lines of Tyrtæus testify: " They in the <lb/>
            twentieth year left the rich pastures, and fled from the <lb/>
            high hills of Ithome." This war came to an end in the <lb/>
            first year of the fourteenth Olympiad, in which Dasmon <lb/>
            the Corinthian was victor in the stadium, the Medontidæ <lb/>
            at Athens being still in possession of their ten year office, <lb/>
            and at the completion of the fourth year of office of <lb/>
            Hippomenes.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the Messenians who had friends at Sicyon and at <lb/>
            Argos and amongst the Arcadians retired to those <lb/>
            places, and those of the family of the priests who performed <lb/>
            the mysteries to the Great Goddesses went to Eleusis. And <lb/>
            the multitude dispersed to their several nationalities. And <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians first razed Ithome to the ground, and <lb/>
            afterwards attacked and captured the other cities. And <lb/>
            out of the spoils they set up to Apollo of Amyclæ some <lb/>
            brazen tripods : under the first tripod is a statue of Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite, and under the second one of Artemis, and under the <lb/>
            third one of Proserpine the daughter of Demeter. These <lb/>
            they erected there. And of the Messenian land they gave <lb/>
            to the Asinæi, who had been ejected by the Argives, the <lb/>
            territory by the sea that they still have: and to the de­ <lb/>
            scendants of Androcles, (for Androcles had a daughter <lb/>
            and she had sons, and -after the death of Androcles they <lb/>
            fled to Sparta), they gave what is called Hyamea. And <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            the following conditions were imposed on the Messenians <lb/>
            by the Lacedæmonians. First of all they bound them by <lb/>
            oath not to revolt or to attempt any revolutionary move­ <lb/>
            ment. And next they appointed no stated tribute, but they <lb/>
            were to bring to Sparta from the land half its produce. <lb/>
            With respect too to the burials of kings and other people <lb/>
            in authority, provision was made that the men and women <lb/>
            in Messenia should wear black raiment, and a punishment <lb/>
            was ordained for those who violated this rule. And as to <lb/>
            their exactions from the Messenians they have been de­ <lb/>
            scribed by Tyrtæus : As asses worn out by long continued <lb/>
            toil, carrying to their masters from bitter necessity half of <lb/>
            all the fruit the country yields." And that necessity was <lb/>
            laid on them of mourning for their masters' deaths he has <lb/>
            manifested in the following lines, " They and their wives <lb/>
            together wailing for their masters, when baneful death <lb/>
            seized on any one."</p>
          <p>The Messenians in these circumstances, and with no hope <lb/>
            of any kinder treatment from the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            thinking death in battle or a wholesale migration from <lb/>
            the Peloponnese preferable to their present condition, <lb/>
            resolved upon a general rising. And they were mainly <lb/>
            induced to this by the young men, who had had no ex­ <lb/>
            perience of war, and were ambitious, and preferred-death <lb/>
            in a free country to happiness in all other conditions with <lb/>
            slavery. These youths were reared in various parts of <lb/>
            Messenia, but the bravest and most numerous were in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Andania, and among them Aristomenes, <lb/>
            who is still honoured among the Messenians as a hero: <lb/>
            and the circumstances attending his birth they think rather <lb/>
            remarkable. For they say that a demon or god in the form of <lb/>
            a dragon had an intrigue with Nicotelea his mother. I have <lb/>
            heard the Macedonians say similar things about Olympian, <lb/>
            and the Sicyonians about Aristodama. But the difference <lb/>
            is that the Messenians do not claim that Aristomenes was <lb/>
            the son of Hercules or Zeus, as the Macedonians say <lb/>
            that Alexander was the son of Ammon, and as the people <lb/>
            of Sicyon say that Aratus was the son of Æsculapius, but <lb/>
            most of the Greeks say that Pyrrhus was the father of <lb/>
            Aristomenes, though I know that the Messenians call <lb/>
            Aristomenes the son of Nicomedes at the libations. He <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            then, being in full vigour of age and boldness, and other <lb/>
            influential persons tried to bring about a general rising. <lb/>
            And this was not at first done openly, but they sent secretly <lb/>
            to Argos and the Arcadians, to see if they would assist <lb/>
            them as energetically as they had done in the former <lb/>
            war, bond fide and not half-heartedly.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND when they had made all their preparations for <lb/>
            war, and their allies were even more zealous than they <lb/>
            had expected, for the hostility between the Arcadians and <lb/>
            Argives and the Lacedaemonians had blazed out fiercely, <lb/>
            then in the thirty-ninth year after the capture of Ithome <lb/>
            they rose in insurrection, in the fourth year of the 23rd <lb/>
            Olympiad, in which the Hyperesian Icarus was victor <lb/>
            in the stadium. And at Athens there were now annual <lb/>
            archons, and the archon this year was Tlesias. Who were <lb/>
            kings at Lacedæmon at this time has not been recorded by <lb/>
            Tyrtæus, but Rhianus in his poem has said that Leotychides <lb/>
            was king during this war. I cannot agree with him in this : <lb/>
            as to Tyrtæus, though he has not mentioned expressly the <lb/>
            time, yet one may suppose he has hinted it in the following <lb/>
            passage,-in the elegiac lines he wrote about the former <lb/>
            war. " Nineteen years unceasingly they fought for their <lb/>
            country, ever with stout heart, those warriors the fathers of <lb/>
            our fathers." Manifestly then it was in the third genera­ <lb/>
            tion after the former war that the Messenians commenced <lb/>
            this war, and the period is marked by the fact that the <lb/>
            kings then at Sparta were Anaxander the son of Eurycrates <lb/>
            the son of Polydorus, and of the other family Anaxidamu <lb/>
            the son of Zeuxidamus, the son of Archidamus, the son of <lb/>
            Theopompus. I go as far as the fourth descendant of <lb/>
            Theopompus, because Archidamus the son of Theopompus <lb/>
            died in his father's lifetime, and the kingdom devolved upon <lb/>
            Zeuxidamus his grandson. And Leotychides clearly was <lb/>
            king after Demaratus the son of Aristo, and Aristo was <lb/>
            seventh descendant from Theopompus.</p>
          <p>And now in the first year after their insurrection the <lb/>
            Messenians engaged with the Lacedæmonians at a place in <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            their country called Deræ, and neither side had allies. And <lb/>
            the battle was an undecided one, but they say Aristomenes <lb/>
            exhibited in it preterhuman bravery, so that they elected <lb/>
            him king after the battle, for he was of the family of the <lb/>
            Æpytidæ, and though he was for refusing they also <lb/>
            appointed him commander in chief. He was inclined to <lb/>
            let them disown no one who had done valiantly in war: <lb/>
            and for himself thought it right first and foremost (as the <lb/>
            war with the Lacedaemonians was only just begun) to <lb/>
            thoroughly frighten them by some bold stroke, and so to <lb/>
            awe them more for the future. Accordingly he went by <lb/>
            night to Lacedæmon and hung up a shield at the temple <lb/>
            of Athene Chalciœcus, and on it was the inscription, " Aris­ <lb/>
            tomenes offers this to the goddess from Spartan spoils."</p>
          <p>The Lacedaemonians also had an oracular answer from <lb/>
            Delphi, that an Athenian would give them good advice. <lb/>
            They sent therefore envoys to the Athenians to report the <lb/>
            oracle, and to ask for the man who was to give them this <lb/>
            good advice. And the Athenians neither wishing that the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians should get the best part of the Peloponnese <lb/>
            without great danger, nor to disobey the god, took counsel <lb/>
            accordingly, and sent to Sparta one Tyrtaeus a school- <lb/>
            master, who was thought to have very little intelligence <lb/>
            and was lame in one foot. And he on his arrival there <lb/>
            recited his elegiac verses and his anapaests privately to <lb/>
            the authorities, and publicly to all whom he could collect <lb/>
            together. And a year after the battle of Deræ, when both <lb/>
            nations had now allies, they prepared for battle in a <lb/>
            village called Boar's Memorial. The Messenians had the <lb/>
            men of Elis and Arcadia as their allies in the action, and <lb/>
            had moreover help from Argos and Sicyon. There were also <lb/>
            present all the Messenians that had fled voluntarily, both <lb/>
            those from Eleusis who were the hereditary priests of the <lb/>
            mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and the descendants of <lb/>
            Androcles: for these too hastened to their assistance. And <lb/>
            to the help of the Lacedæmonians came the Corinthians, <lb/>
            and some of the people of Lepreum from hatred to the men <lb/>
            of Elis. The Asinæi were neutral. Boar's Memorial is <lb/>
            near Stenyclerus in Messenia, and was so called because <lb/>
            they say Hercules had a mutual covenant there with the <lb/>
            sons of Neleus over a boar's entrails. <note type="footnote"> s</note> </p><pb n="258"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND when the seers in both armies had commenced by <lb/>
            sacrifice, the Lacedæmonian seer being Hecas, the de­ <lb/>
            scendant and namesake of that Hecas who had come to <lb/>
            Sparta with the sons of Aristodemus, and the Messenian seer <lb/>
            being Theoclus, a descendant of Eumantis (a native of Elis <lb/>
            and one of the Iamidæ whom Cresphontes had introduced <lb/>
            into Messene), both armies were with more confidence stirred <lb/>
            up to battle. And there was ardour exhibited by several ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their age and prowess, but notably by Anaxander, <lb/>
            the king of the Lacedæmonians, and the Spartans in his divi­ <lb/>
            sion : and in the Messenian army Phintas and Androcles, <lb/>
            the descendants of Androcles, and the men who were posted <lb/>
            with them, strove to show their valour. And Tyrtæus and <lb/>
            the priests of the Great Goddesses took no part in the <lb/>
            action but that of cheering on the rears of their respective <lb/>
            armies. And this was the disposition of Aristomenes. <lb/>
            Eighty picked men of the Messenians about the same age <lb/>
            as himself were in close attendance upon him, and each of <lb/>
            them thought himself highly flattered to be posted near <lb/>
            Aristomenes: and they were very keen at detecting in a <lb/>
            glance one another's ideas and especially their leader's plans <lb/>
            in the very germ. They and Aristomenes had the brunt of the <lb/>
            battle, being posted opposite to Anaxander and the bravest <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians. And receiving wounds fearlessly, <lb/>
            and rushing on with the greatest recklessness, in time, they <lb/>
            routed by their boldness Anaxander's division. As these <lb/>
            fled Aristomenes commanded another Messenian regiment <lb/>
            to pursue them: and himself rushed into the thick of the <lb/>
            fight, and routed the men there, and then again turned to <lb/>
            some other part of the field. And having driven these <lb/>
            also from their positions he hurried on, charging those that <lb/>
            were left, until he had thoroughly beaten all the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonian force, allies and all. And as they felt some <lb/>
            shame in fleeing, and yet could not stand these frequent <lb/>
            charges, he dashed in amongst them with more formidable <lb/>
            fury than one could have expected from one man. But <lb/>
            near a wild pear tree that grew in the plain Theoclus tried <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            to prevent his passing: for he said Castor and Pollux were <lb/>
            seated on the pear tree. And Aristomenes giving way to <lb/>
            passion, and not hearing all the words of the seer, when <lb/>
            he got to the pear tree dropt his shield, and this loss of <lb/>
            Aristomenes gave the Lacedæmonians breathing time to <lb/>
            stop from their flight: for he lost some time trying to find <lb/>
            his shield.</p>
          <p>And when the Lacedæmonians were dispirited at this <lb/>
            blow, and were minded to finish the war, Tyrtæus put heart <lb/>
            into them by reciting his verses, and got some Helots en­ <lb/>
            rolled into the regiments in place of the dead men. And <lb/>
            when Aristomenes returned to Andania, the women wel­ <lb/>
            comed him with ribands and pelted him with flowers, <lb/>
            and sang for him a song not forgotten even in our days, <lb/>
            " To the mid plain and high mountain at Stenyclerus did <lb/>
            Aristomenes pursue the Lacedæmonians.” And he after­ <lb/>
            wards recovered his shield by going to Delphi, and, as <lb/>
            the Pythian Priestess ordered him, by descending to the <lb/>
            sacred shrine of Trophonius at Lebadea. And afterwards <lb/>
            he took the shield, and hung it up as a votive offering at <lb/>
            Lebadea, and I have myself seen it hanging up there. Its <lb/>
            design is an eagle with its wings extended at the upper <lb/>
            part of the shield. And now Aristomenes on his return <lb/>
            from Bceotia, having recovered his shield at the shrine <lb/>
            of Trophonius, immediately went in for further action. <lb/>
            And, having gathered together a levy of Messenians be­ <lb/>
            sides his own bodyguard of picked men, he marched at <lb/>
            nightfall to a city of Laconia, whose old name was Pharis <lb/>
            as in Homer's catalogue, but it was called Pharæ by the <lb/>
            Spartans and other neighbouring people. Marching there <lb/>
            he cut to pieces those who attempted to defend them­ <lb/>
            selves, and after carrying off much booty returned to Mes­ <lb/>
            sene. And the Lacedæmonian hoplites under Anaxander <lb/>
            their king attacking him on the road, he routed them also, <lb/>
            and was fain to pursue Anaxander. But being wounded <lb/>
            in his hinder quarters with a javelin he stayed the pursuit, <lb/>
            without losing the plunder he had got. And after waiting <lb/>
            sufficient time for his wound to be healed, he intended to <lb/>
            enter Sparta by night, when he was prevented by the appa­ <lb/>
            rition of Helen and Castor and Pollux, and lay in ambush <lb/>
            at nightfall for some maidens who were dancing to Artemis <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            at Caryæ, and arrested all who were remarkable for the <lb/>
            wealth and position of their fathers, and brought them by <lb/>
            night to a village in Messenia and went to rest, having <lb/>
            committed the custody of them to some men of his regiment. <lb/>
            Thereupon the young men in drink I suppose, and other­ <lb/>
            wise unable to control their passions by reason, endea­ <lb/>
            voured to violate the maidens, and when Aristomenes for­ <lb/>
            bade them to act in a manner not customary for Greeks, <lb/>
            they took no notice of him, so that he was obliged to kill <lb/>
            the most unruly of them. And the maidens he had taken <lb/>
            captive he let go for a good ransom with their honour <lb/>
            safe.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND there is a place in Laconia called Ægila, where is <lb/>
            a temple of Demeter. There Aristomenes and his sol­ <lb/>
            diers, knowing that the women were keeping festival to <lb/>
            Demeter, wished to seize them: but as these women in­ <lb/>
            spired by the goddess made a bold defence, most of the <lb/>
            Messenians received wounds with the swords which they <lb/>
            used to sacrifice the victims with, and the sharp pointed <lb/>
            spits on which they stuck their meat to roast it. And <lb/>
            Aristomenes they struck with their torches and took him <lb/>
            alive. However he escaped the same night to Messenia. <lb/>
            They say that Archidamea the priestess of Demeter had the <lb/>
            guilt of letting him escape. But she did not let him go <lb/>
            for money, but was an old sweetheart of his, and made out <lb/>
            that Aristomenes had escaped by burning1 his bonds.</p>
          <p>And in the third year of the war, when an engagement <lb/>
            was about to take place at what was called The Great <lb/>
            Trench, and when the Arcadians had come from all their <lb/>
            cities to help the Messenians, the Lacedaemonians bribed <lb/>
            Aristocrates, the son of Icetas, a native of Trapezus, king <lb/>
            and general of the Arcadians at this period. The Lacedæmo- <note type="footnote"> 1 This seems strange. Ingeniosissime <foreign xml:lang="grc">διακόψας</foreign> Corayus. Siebelis <lb/>
            defends the text. " Sacerdos, quo majus esset miraculum, videtur <lb/>
            dixisse, eum se advolvisse igni, eique admovisse vincula, usque dum <lb/>
            solverentur." J </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            nians are the first we know of that bribed an enemy, and <lb/>
            the first that made renown in arms a thing to be purchased <lb/>
            by money. For before the Lacedæmonians violated honour <lb/>
            in their war with the Messenians, in regard to this treason <lb/>
            of Aristocrates the Arcadian, their fighting men were dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished for bravery, and good fortune from the deity. <lb/>
            Afterwards too at Ægospotamoi, when they opposed the <lb/>
            fleet of the Athenians, they certainly bribed Adimantus <lb/>
            and other Athenian Admirals. But in process of time <lb/>
            upon the Lacedæmonians came what is called the Retribu­ <lb/>
            tion of Neoptolemus. For Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, <lb/>
            having slain Priam at the altar of Household Zeus, was him­ <lb/>
            self also slain at Delphi at the temple of Apollo, and-in <lb/>
            consequence of that—suffering what one had inflicted on <lb/>
            another got called the Retribution of Neoptolemus. For <lb/>
            when the Lacedæmonians were at the zenith of their power, <lb/>
            and had destroyed the fleet of the Athenians, and Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus had reduced most of Asia Minor, then it was not possible <lb/>
            to strip the Mede of all his power, because the barbarian <lb/>
            circumvented them by sending money to Corinth and Argos <lb/>
            and Athens and Thebes, and what was called the Corinthian <lb/>
            war was brought about by this money, so that Agesilaus <lb/>
            was compelled to leave Asia Minor. And so the deity made to <lb/>
            recoil upon themselves the wiliness that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            had displayed to the Messenians. And Aristocrates when <lb/>
            he had received money from Lacedæmon, at first hid his <lb/>
            plans from the Arcadians, but when they were on the eve <lb/>
            of an engagement, then he threw them into consternation, <lb/>
            by telling them they were in difficulty and straits and had <lb/>
            no means of retreat if they should be beaten. He also said <lb/>
            the sacrifices were not auspicious. He ordered everyone <lb/>
            therefore to run away when he gave the signal. And when <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians began the engagement and the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians were opposite to them, thereupon at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the battle Aristocrates led off the Arcadians, and <lb/>
            thus the Messenian centre and left wing was left exposed. <lb/>
            For the Arcadians had occupied both these parts of the field, <lb/>
            as the people of Elis were not present at the battle, nor the <lb/>
            people of Argos and Sicyon. And Aristocrates put the <lb/>
            finishing touch to his treason by fleeing through the <lb/>
            Messenian lines. And they were quite bewildered at the <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            unexpected state of affairs, and were disturbed by the pas­ <lb/>
            sage of the Arcadians through their lines, so that most <lb/>
            of them nearly forgot what they were about: for in­ <lb/>
            stead of the Lacedaemonians pressing on against the <lb/>
            Arcadians they saw them fleeing, and some begged them <lb/>
            to stand their ground, others reviled them as traitors and <lb/>
            covenant-breakers. And for the Lacedæmonians to sur­ <lb/>
            round the Messenians who were now left alone was easy <lb/>
            enough, and with the greatest ease they won a victory that <lb/>
            was a foregone conclusion. And though Aristomenes and <lb/>
            his division bravely stood their ground against the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of the Lacedaemonians that pressed against them, and <lb/>
            endeavoured to keep them in check, yet they were too few <lb/>
            to avail much. And such a quantity of Messenians were <lb/>
            cut to pieces, that they, who had expected to be masters <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians, now instead of having slaves had <lb/>
            hardly any hope of safety. And of their leaders fell Andro­ <lb/>
            cles and Phintas and others, and Phanas, (who fought espe­ <lb/>
            cially bravely, and had been victor at Olympia in the double <lb/>
            course). And Aristomenes after the battle collected the <lb/>
            Messenian fugitives, and persuaded them to leave Andania <lb/>
            and any other towns in the heart of the country, and to <lb/>
            take up their residence on the mountain Eira. And when <lb/>
            they assembled there they were besieged by the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians who wished to take them. However they resisted <lb/>
            and held out for eleven years after the disaster at The Great <lb/>
            Trench. That that was the time the blockade lasted is plain <lb/>
            from the verses of Rhianus about the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            " Along the ridges of the mountain white <lb/>
            Twenty-two summers and winters did they fight." <lb/>
            The word used for summers in the line just above is a word <lb/>
            properly meaning the grass when it is ripe, or a little before <lb/>
            hay harvest.</p><pb n="263"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the Messenians when they were hemmed in at <lb/>
            Eira, and debarred the rest of their country, except <lb/>
            what was occupied by the people of Pylos near the sea, and <lb/>
            the people of Mothone, plundered Laconia and their own <lb/>
            country, which they now regarded as enemy's country. <lb/>
            And several joined them in these raids, as chance brought <lb/>
            it about, and Aristomenes got together some picked men in <lb/>
            number about 300. They harried and carried off from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians whatever they could, corn and flocks and <lb/>
            wine, but furniture and human beings they ransomed for <lb/>
            money. So that the Lacedaemonians made a decree, inas­ <lb/>
            much as they were farming for the benefit of the people of <lb/>
            Eira rather than their own, not to cultivate Messenia and <lb/>
            the neighbouring parts of Laconia till after the war. And <lb/>
            from that time there was scarcity in Sparta, and with <lb/>
            the scarcity came riots, for those who got their money by <lb/>
            farming could not bear to see their lands lie fallow, but <lb/>
            their vexation was checked by the verses of Tyrtæus. And <lb/>
            Aristomenes with his picked men made a sally when the <lb/>
            night was considerably advanced, and stole a march upon <lb/>
            the enemy by getting to Amyclæ before daybreak, and <lb/>
            seized the fort and plundered Amyclæ, and was off again <lb/>
            before help could come from Sparta. And he afterwards <lb/>
            overran the whole country, till making an attack on more <lb/>
            than half the Lacedæmonian army under both their kings, <lb/>
            he received several wounds as he defended himself <lb/>
            valiantly, and as he was struck on the head by a stone his <lb/>
            eyes got dizzy, and the Lacedæmonians rushing at him all <lb/>
            together took him alive. Fifty of his men also were cap­ <lb/>
            tured. These were all condemned by the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            to be thrown into their underground cavern called Ceadas; <lb/>
            where they throw in their greatest malefactors. The other <lb/>
            Messenians who were thrown in were killed instanta­ <lb/>
            neously : but Aristomenes had some good genius who both <lb/>
            now and on all occasions looked after him. Those who <lb/>
            exaggerate everything about him say that, when he was <lb/>
            thrown into Ceadas, an eagle flew under him and supported <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            him with its wings, so that he reached the bottom safely <lb/>
            without a wound or scratch. The god on this occasion must <lb/>
            have also shown him some outlet. For when he got to the <lb/>
            bottom of the cavern, he sat down and muffling his head in <lb/>
            his cloak expected death which he felt certain. But on the <lb/>
            third day after he heard a noise, and unveiled his face, and <lb/>
            when his eyes got accustomed to the darkness, saw a fox <lb/>
            preying on the dead carcases. And reflecting that it must <lb/>
            have an outlet somewhere, he waited till the fox came near <lb/>
            and when it came near seized hold of it, and in one of his <lb/>
            hands, when the fox turned on him, held his cloak that it <lb/>
            might bite that and not him. As it ran he ran with it, and <lb/>
            was dragged by it along a very difficult path. At last he saw <lb/>
            a little hole, just big enough for a fox to pass through, and <lb/>
            light glimmered through it. And the fox, directly it was <lb/>
            liberated by Aristomenes, betook itself to its hole. And <lb/>
            Aristomenes, as the hole was too small to let him through, <lb/>
            enlarged it with his hands and got home safe to Eira, <lb/>
            having had most remarkable good fortune in respect to his <lb/>
            capture, (for his spirit and bravery were such that no one <lb/>
            could have expected to take him alive), and stranger still <lb/>
            and most plainly not without divine assistance was this <lb/>
            getting out safe from Ceadas.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND it was almost immediately reported to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians by deserters that Aristomenes had got home <lb/>
            safe : but being considered as incredible as if anyone were <lb/>
            to say that a dead man had come to life again, it was only be­ <lb/>
            lieved in consequence of the following transaction on the <lb/>
            part of Aristomenes. The Corinthians sent a force to help <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to take Eira. Aristomenes, learning <lb/>
            from his scouts that they were marching rather carelessly, <lb/>
            and that their camps were negligently made up, attacked; <lb/>
            them by night, and as they were asleep slew most of them, <lb/>
            and among others their leaders Hypermenides, and Achla­ <lb/>
            dams, and Lysistratus, and Sidectus. He plundered also <lb/>
            the tent of the generals, and the Lacedaemonians soon saw <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            that it was Aristomenes and no other Messenian that had <lb/>
            done all this. He sacrificed also to Zens of Ithome the <lb/>
            sacrifice which they call Hecatomphonia. It was of very <lb/>
            remote antiquity, and any Messenian who had killed 100 <lb/>
            enemies had a right to offer it. And Aristomenes first <lb/>
            offered this sacrifice when he fought the battle at Boar's <lb/>
            Memorial, and the slaughter of these Corinthians by night <lb/>
            gave him the right to offer this sacrifice a second time. <lb/>
            They say also that he offered the sacrifice a third time as <lb/>
            the result of various raids. But the Lacedæmonians, as <lb/>
            the festival of Hyacinthus was now coming on, made a truce <lb/>
            of 40 days with the inhabitants of Eira, and returned home <lb/>
            and kept the festival, and some Cretan bowmen, who had <lb/>
            been sent for as mercenaries from Lyctus and other towns, <lb/>
            made incursions into various parts of Messenia. And as <lb/>
            Aristomenes was at some distance from Eira, feeling per­ <lb/>
            fect security as it was truce time, seven of these bow­ <lb/>
            men lay in wait for him, and took him prisoner, and bound <lb/>
            him with the bands of their quivers. And it was evening. <lb/>
            And two of them went to Sparta, and announced the cap­ <lb/>
            ture of Aristomenes to the Lacedaemonians : and the re­ <lb/>
            maining five retired to a farm in Messenia, where a father­ <lb/>
            less maiden lived with her mother. The night before this <lb/>
            maiden had had a dream. Some wolves (she dreamed) <lb/>
            brought a lion to the farm bound and without claws, and <lb/>
            she freed the lion from its bonds and got it claws, and then <lb/>
            the wolves were torn in pieces by it. And now when <lb/>
            the Cretans brought in Aristomenes, the maiden remem­ <lb/>
            bered her dream of the previous night, and asked her <lb/>
            mother who he was : and when she learnt who he was she <lb/>
            took courage, and looked earnestly at him, and understood <lb/>
            the meaning of the dream. She therefore poured out wine <lb/>
            freely for the Cretans, till drink overpowered them, and <lb/>
            then withdrew the sword of the one who was fastest asleep. <lb/>
            Then she cut the bonds of Aristomenes, and he took the <lb/>
            sword and killed all 5. And Gorgus the son of Aristo­ <lb/>
            menes took the maiden to wife. And thus Aristomenes <lb/>
            requited to the damsel her saving of his life, and Gorgus <lb/>
            was only 18 when he married her.</p><pb n="266"/>

          <p>B <lb/>
            UT in the 11th year of the siege it was fated that Eira ' <lb/>
            should fall, and that the Messenians should be dis­ <lb/>
            persed, and the god accomplished what had been oracularly <lb/>
            foretold to Aristomenes and Theoclus. For when they went <lb/>
            to Delphi after the disaster at the Great Trench, and enquired <lb/>
            as to their safety, the Pythian Priestess replied as follows, <lb/>
            " When hegoat drinks of Neda's winding stream, <lb/>
            I cease to guard Messene. Her end is near." <lb/>
            Now the Neda rises in Mount Lycæus: and the river <lb/>
            flows through Arcadia and into Messenia again, and divides <lb/>
            the maritime parts of Messenia and Elis. And now they <lb/>
            were afraid of their he-goats drinking of the Neda: but <lb/>
            the god had quite a different meaning which I will unfold. <lb/>
            The wild fig tree, which some of the Greeks call Olynthe, <lb/>
            is called by the Messenians Tragus (that is He-Goat). At <lb/>
            this time there was a wild fig tree on the banks of the <lb/>
            river Neda which did not grow upright, but bent into the <lb/>
            stream and touched the water with its topmost boughs. <lb/>
            And the seer Theoclus having noticed it conjectured that <lb/>
            by the he-goat drinking of the Neda the Pythian Priestess <lb/>
            meant this wild fig, and that therefore the fate of Messene <lb/>
            was imminent. And he preserved silence on the matter to <lb/>
            everyone else, but he took Aristomenes to this figtree, and <lb/>
            pointed out to him that their period of safety had passed. <lb/>
            And Aristomenes was convinced by him that it was as he <lb/>
            said, and that that there was no room for delay, and he <lb/>
            adopted the following contrivance under the present <lb/>
            conjuncture. The Messenians had some sacred records, <lb/>
            which if lost would ruin Messene and keep her under for <lb/>
            ever, but which if preserved would, according to the <lb/>
            oracular utterances .of Lycus the son of Pandion, give the <lb/>
            Messenians a chance one day to recover their country, and <lb/>
            Aristomenes knowing these oracular utterances conveyed <lb/>
            away by night these arcana: and going to the most un­ <lb/>
            frequented part of Mount Ithome buried them there, and <lb/>
            prayed to Zens of Ithome and to the gods who had hitherto <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            befriended the Messenians to be witnesses of this deposit, <lb/>
            and not to allow the Lacedæmonians to rob them of their <lb/>
            only hope of returning home again one day. And after <lb/>
            this trouble came to the Messenians, as earlier still it did <lb/>
            to the Trojans, from adultery. They occupied the moun­ <lb/>
            tainous district all round Eira as far as the Neda, and <lb/>
            some lived outside the gates. And no other deserter came <lb/>
            to them from Laconia, but a herdsman, a slave of Empera­ <lb/>
            mus who was a man of some note at Sparta. This herds­ <lb/>
            man lived not far from the Neda. There he saw the wife <lb/>
            of one of the Messenians who lived outside the walls coming <lb/>
            to draw water: and he got enamoured of her, and ventured <lb/>
            to talk with her, and overcame her chastity by gifts. And <lb/>
            from that time forward this herdsman watched when her <lb/>
            husband went upon garrison duty. Now the Messenians <lb/>
            had to go on guard by turns in the citadel: it was here <lb/>
            that they were chiefly afraid of the enemy getting into the <lb/>
            place. And whenever the husband mounted guard, this <lb/>
            herdsman used to go and visit his wife. And on one occa­ <lb/>
            sion he and others had to mount guard at night, and it <lb/>
            chanced to be a very wet night. And the Messenians left <lb/>
            their guard. For the quantity of rain pouring down almost <lb/>
            forced them in, as they had no battlements or turrets in <lb/>
            their improvised fortifications, and at the same time" they <lb/>
            did not expect that the Lacedæmonians would attack them <lb/>
            in a night so wild and dark. And Aristomenes had been <lb/>
            wounded a few days previously in rescuing a Cephallenian <lb/>
            merchant and his goods, (he was a friend of his and used to <lb/>
            introduce into Eira all necessary supplies, but had been <lb/>
            captured by the Lacedaemonians and some Apteræan bow­ <lb/>
            men under Euryalus a Spartan), and therefore could not as <lb/>
            usual go his nightly rounds. This was the chief reason <lb/>
            why the citadel was abandoned by the guard. And as <lb/>
            each of them went off from his post so did the hus­ <lb/>
            band of the woman who had this intrigue with the herds­ <lb/>
            man. And she at this time had the herdsman at her house, <lb/>
            but perceiving the return of her husband quickly concealed <lb/>
            him, and welcomed her husband rather more than usual, <lb/>
            and asked him the reason of his return. And he, ignorant <lb/>
            that she was unfaithful to him and had her paramour there, <lb/>
            told her the truth, and said that, on account of the violence <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            of the rain, and other circumstances which he mentioned, <lb/>
            they had left their posts. And the herdsman overheard, <lb/>
            and immediately, when he understood the condition of <lb/>
            affairs, deserted the Messenians for the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            The Lacedaemonian kings were at this time absent from <lb/>
            the camp : but Emperamus the master of the herdsman <lb/>
            was commander in chief of the forces that were besieging <lb/>
            Eira. The herdsman then went to his master, and first <lb/>
            begged pardon for his absence from home, and next showed <lb/>
            him how they could capture Eira, mentioning all the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances which he had heard from the Messenian.</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>w <lb/>
            HAT the herdsman said seemed trustworthy, and he <lb/>
            led Emperamus and the Spartan force. Their march <lb/>
            was difficult owing to the darkness and steady down­ <lb/>
            pour. Still they advanced with alacrity, and, as soon as <lb/>
            they got to the citadel of Eira, fixed scaling ladders and <lb/>
            got over the walls with all dispatch. And the Messenians <lb/>
            had several indications of their coming trouble, especially <lb/>
            the unusual barking of the dogs, who barked fiercely and <lb/>
            continuously. Perceiving then that the final struggle <lb/>
            had come upon them, they had no time for arming them­ <lb/>
            selves properly, but each seized what weapon he could find <lb/>
            to defend their last possession out of all Messenia, their last <lb/>
            inch of fatherland ! The first who noticed that the enemy <lb/>
            had got inside the walls, and who rushed up to the fray, <lb/>
            were Gorgus the son of Aristomenes, and Aristomenes him­ <lb/>
            self, and Theoclus the seer and Manticlus his son, and <lb/>
            with them Euergetidas a man held in especial honour at <lb/>
            Messene, who had improved his fortunes by his marriage <lb/>
            with Agnagora, the sister of Aristomenes. And all the <lb/>
            others at this time, though they perceived that they were <lb/>
            in a trap, yet had a little hope in spite of the outlook : <lb/>
            but Aristomenes and the seer knew that it was all up <lb/>
            with the Messenians, remembering the Pythian Priestess' <lb/>
            oracle about the lie-goat, but they concealed none the less <lb/>
            the true state of affairs, and were silent about it to every­ <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            body. And they went all round the town energetically <lb/>
            and exhorted every Messenian they met to play the man, <lb/>
            and called from their houses those that yet remained in <lb/>
            them. During the night nothing very notable was done <lb/>
            on either side, for the attacking party were hindered <lb/>
            by their ignorance of the ground and the boldness of <lb/>
            Aristomenes, and the Messenians were rather backward <lb/>
            in taking the word from their generals, and if anyone <lb/>
            lit a torch or struck a light, the rain immediately put <lb/>
            -it out. And when day broke and they could see one <lb/>
            another clearly, then Aristomenes and Theoclus endea­ <lb/>
            voured to nerve the Messenians to desperate courage, by <lb/>
            giving them the necessary directions, and reminding them <lb/>
            of the heroism of the people of Smyrna, who, though they <lb/>
            were only Ionians, by their boldness and vigour drove out <lb/>
            of their city Gyges, the son of Dascylus, and the Lydians who <lb/>
            were in possession of it. And the Messenians hearing this <lb/>
            were animated with the courage of despair, and forming <lb/>
            what ranks they could rushed against the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            And even the women eagerly hurled tiles, and whatever each <lb/>
            could lay hold of, at the enemy : but they were partly pre­ <lb/>
            vented doing this from the slipperiness of the roofs through <lb/>
            the frequent rain : but they seized arms and thus kindled <lb/>
            still more the courage of the men, when they saw that even <lb/>
            the women preferred perishing with their country to being <lb/>
            led off as slaves to Lacedæmon, insomuch that had it been <lb/>
            possible they would have given destiny the go-by. And <lb/>
            the downpour of rain continued all day, and there was <lb/>
            thunder and lightning, and they could hardly see for the <lb/>
            lightning that flashed in their faces. And all this inspired <lb/>
            courage in the Lacedæmonians, who thought that the god <lb/>
            was visibly helping them, and as the lightning was on their <lb/>
            right the seer Hecas announced that the omen was auspi­ <lb/>
            cious. He also devised the following stratagem. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians were far the most numerous, but inas­ <lb/>
            much as the battle was on a limited area and not fought <lb/>
            tactically, but various bodies of men fought haphazard in <lb/>
            various parts of the city, it happened that the rearmen of <lb/>
            each division were useless. He therefore ordered them to <lb/>
            retire to the camp and get some food and sleep, and come <lb/>
            back again before evening to relieve their companions, who <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            had borne the burthen and heat of the day. And thus by <lb/>
            fighting and resting by turns they held out the longer, but <lb/>
            the Messenians were getting entirely worn out, for it was <lb/>
            now the third night that they had been fighting day and <lb/>
            night continuously. And when the next morning came, <lb/>
            and they were suffering from sleeplessness and constant <lb/>
            rain and cold all combined, hunger and thirst assailed them <lb/>
            too. Their women especially were ready to faint by reason <lb/>
            of being unused to war, and by the long continuance of <lb/>
            their efforts. Then the seer Theoclus came up and spoke <lb/>
            to Aristomenes. " Why do you continue in vain this <lb/>
            struggle ? It is decreed that Messene must perish, long <lb/>
            ago did the Pythian Priestess foretell this imminent ruin, <lb/>
            and lately did the wild figtree teach the same lesson. To <lb/>
            me the god assigns an end with my country: but you may <lb/>
            save the Messenians and yourself." When he had spoken <lb/>
            thus to him, he rushed against the foe, and said to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in a loud voice, " You shall not for long <lb/>
            joy in your conquest of Messene." After that he fiercely <lb/>
            attacked those who were opposite to him and slew them, <lb/>
            and was himself wounded, and breathed out his last having <lb/>
            first glutted his soul with slaughter. And Aristomenes <lb/>
            called all the Messenians back from the fight, except those <lb/>
            who were fighting with remarkable bravery, whom he <lb/>
            allowed to remain fighting. And the rest he ordered to <lb/>
            follow where he should lead, with the women and children <lb/>
            in their lines. To the command of this portion of the army <lb/>
            he appointed Gorgus and Manticlus : and himself took up <lb/>
            a position in the front rank, and by the motion of his head <lb/>
            and the waving of his spear plainly showed that he was <lb/>
            asking for a passage through, and already meditated retreat. <lb/>
            Emperamus and the Spartans on the spot were right glad <lb/>
            to let the Messenians through their lines, and not to irritate <lb/>
            too much men who were mad in rage and desperate to the <lb/>
            last degree. And Hecas the seer also bade them act so.</p><pb n="271"/>

          <p>D <lb/>
            IRECTLY the Arcadians heard of the capture of Eira, <lb/>
            they at once begged Aristocrates to lead them to save <lb/>
            the Messenians or perish with them. But he having been <lb/>
            bribed by the Lacedæmonians refused to lead them, and <lb/>
            said that he knew none of the Messenians were alive for <lb/>
            them to assist. But when the Arcadians received more <lb/>
            certain intelligence that some survived who had been com­ <lb/>
            pelled to leave Eira, they set out to meet them at Mount <lb/>
            Lycæus, having got ready both food and raiment, and sent <lb/>
            certain influential persons to comfort the Messenians and <lb/>
            guide them on their march. And when they got safe to <lb/>
            Mount Lycæus the Arcadians welcomed them, and treated <lb/>
            them kindly in other respects, and invited them to dwell in <lb/>
            their cities, and said they would give them a share of the <lb/>
            land. But Aristomenes in his grief for the capture of Eira <lb/>
            and his hatred to the Lacedæmonians contrived the follow­ <lb/>
            ing plan. He selected from the whole body 500 Messe­ <lb/>
            nians, who be knew were prodigal of their lives, and selected <lb/>
            them in the hearing of the other Arcadians and Aristo­ <lb/>
            crates, not knowing that he was a traitor-for he thought <lb/>
            Aristocrates had fled through cowardice and want of man­ <lb/>
            liness rather than in treason-and he asked the 500 in his <lb/>
            presence, whether they would die with him to avenge their <lb/>
            country. And when they said they would he revealed his <lb/>
            whole plan, that the following evening he intended to lead <lb/>
            them to Sparta. For at this time most of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were at Eira, and others were busy in plundering <lb/>
            the property of the Messenians. " And if we should capture <lb/>
            Sparta and keep it," continued Aristomenes, " we shall be <lb/>
            able to exchange it for Messene: and if we fail we shall <lb/>
            die together, having done deeds that posterity will not <lb/>
            forget." After he had made this speech, about 300 of the <lb/>
            Arcadians wished to join him in his desperate undertaking. <lb/>
            And for the moment they delayed their departure, as the <lb/>
            victims were not auspicious. On the following day how­ <lb/>
            ever they knew that their secret had been revealed to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and that they had been betrayed by Aristo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            crates for the second time. For Aristocrates had at once <lb/>
            disclosed by letter the design of Aristomenes, and given <lb/>
            the letter to his most trusty slave, and sent it to Anaxander <lb/>
            at Sparta. And on his return this slave was intercepted <lb/>
            by some Arcadians who had previously been hostile to <lb/>
            Aristocrates, and were now rather suspicious about him. <lb/>
            And having intercepted this slave they brought him before <lb/>
            the Arcadians, and showed the people the answer of Anax­ <lb/>
            ander from Lacedæmon. It was to the effect that, just as <lb/>
            Aristocrates' flight at an opportune moment from the Great <lb/>
            Trench had not been unrewarded by the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            so he should not be without further reward for his present <lb/>
            information. And when this was reported to them all, <lb/>
            the Arcadians began to stone Aristocrates, and urged the <lb/>
            Messenians to do the same. But they looked at Aristo­ <lb/>
            menes. And he looked on the ground and wept. So the <lb/>
            Arcadians stoned Aristocrates to death, and cast him un­ <lb/>
            buried out of their borders, and put up a pillar in the temple <lb/>
            of Lycæan Zeus with the following inscription. " Time <lb/>
            is sure to bring justice at last to an unjust king, and <lb/>
            time with Zeus' cooperation has easily found out Messene's <lb/>
            traitor. It is difficult for a perjured man to escape the god. <lb/>
            Hail, royal Zeus, and save, Arcadia."</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND all the Messenians that were captured at Eira, or <lb/>
            in any other part of Messenia, were incorporated by <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians among the Helots : and the people of <lb/>
            Pylos and Mothone and all the maritime towns removed <lb/>
            in ships, after the capture of Eira, to Cyllene the arsenal of <lb/>
            Elis. And from there they sent to the Messenians in <lb/>
            Arcadia, wishing them to join them in an expedition to seek <lb/>
            some city to dwell in, and bade them make Aristomenes <lb/>
            the founder of the colony. But he said that for his part <lb/>
            as long as he lived he would fight against the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and that he knew very well that Sparta would <lb/>
            always have trouble through him : but he gave them Gorgus <lb/>
            and Manticlus as their leaders. Euergctidas also retired to <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            Mount Lycæus with the rest of the Messenians: and from <lb/>
            thence, when he saw that Aristomenes' plan about the cap­ <lb/>
            ture of Sparta had fallen through, having got together <lb/>
            about 50 of the Messenians he made a raid against the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians at Eira, and falling in with them still plun­ <lb/>
            dering he turned their chant of victory into a dirge. And <lb/>
            fate seized him there, and Aristomenes ordered the leaders <lb/>
            of the Messenians, and whoever wished, to take part in the <lb/>
            colony to go to Cyllene. And all took part in it, except <lb/>
            those that were prevented by old age, or were destitute of <lb/>
            means for dwelling abroad. And these remained where <lb/>
            they were among the Arcadians.</p>
          <p>Eira was taken, and the second war between the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and the Messenians finished, in the Archonship <lb/>
            over the Athenians of Autosthenes, in the first year of the <lb/>
            28th Olympiad, in which Chionis the Laconian was victor.</p>
          <p>And when the Messenians had got together at Cyllene, <lb/>
            they resolved to winter there for that winter, and the people <lb/>
            of Elis provided them with supplies and money: but <lb/>
            directly Spring came they deliberated where they should <lb/>
            go. And the view of Gorgus was that they should occupy <lb/>
            Zacynthus beyond Cephallenia, and become islanders in­ <lb/>
            stead of dwelling on the mainland, and should sail in their <lb/>
            ships to the maritime parts of Laconia and ravage their <lb/>
            territory. Manticlus on the other hand exhorted them to <lb/>
            forget Messene and their animosity to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and sail to Sardinia and occupy that large and fertile island. <lb/>
            Meantime Anaxilas sent a message to the Messenians in­ <lb/>
            viting them to Italy. He was King at Rhegium, and fourth <lb/>
            in descent from Alcidamidas, who had migrated from <lb/>
            Messene to Rhegium, after the death of King Aristodemus <lb/>
            and the capture of Ithome. This Anaxilas then invited the <lb/>
            Messenians, and when they went to Rhegium he told them <lb/>
            that the people of Z ancle were at variance with him, and <lb/>
            that they had a fertile country and a city in the rich part <lb/>
            of Sicily, all which he said he would give them, and help <lb/>
            them in conquering the country. And as they eagerly ac­ <lb/>
            cepted his offer, Anaxilas conveyed them over into Sicily. <lb/>
            Now Zancle was a place which had originally been occupied <lb/>
            by pirates, and, as the land there was then unoccupied, <lb/>
            they built a fort near the harbour, and made Zancle their <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            headquarters for expeditions both by land and sea : and <lb/>
            their leaders were Crateemenes the Samian and Perieres <lb/>
            from Chalcis. And eventually Perieres and Cratæmenes <lb/>
            resolved to invite in other colonists from Greece. But now <lb/>
            Anaxilas conquered the people of Zancle who put out to sea <lb/>
            in their fleet, and the Messenians conquered them on land. <lb/>
            And being blockaded by land by the Messenians and simulta­ <lb/>
            neously by sea by the people of Rhegium, when their fort <lb/>
            was taken, they fled for refuge to the altars of the gods <lb/>
            and to the temples. Anaxilas however urged on the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians to slay the suppliants, though they prayed hard for <lb/>
            quarter, and to enslave the rest together with their women <lb/>
            and children. But Gorgus and Manticlus begged that <lb/>
            Anaxilas would not compel them, who had been shamefully <lb/>
            treated by their fellow-countrymen, to act with equal cruelty <lb/>
            to Greeks. And after that they took the people of Zancle <lb/>
            from the altars, and having mutually given and received <lb/>
            pledges dwelt together as one people. But the name of <lb/>
            the town they changed from Zancle to Messene. All this <lb/>
            took place in the 29th Olympiad, in which Chionis the <lb/>
            Laconian was victor the second time, and Miltiades was <lb/>
            Archon at Athens. And Manticlus built a temple of Her­ <lb/>
            cules for the new colony, and a statue of the god was <lb/>
            placed outside the fort called Hercules Manticlus, just as <lb/>
            Belus at Babylon got its name from an Egyptian called <lb/>
            Belus, and Ammon in Libya from the name of the shep­ <lb/>
            herd who built the temple. This was the end of the wan­ <lb/>
            dering of the Messenian exiles.</p>

            EANTIME Aristomenes, when he refused the leader­ <lb/>
            ship of those who were going on the new colony, <lb/>
            married his sister Agnagora to Tharyx of Phigaha, and <lb/>
            his two eldest daughters to Damothoidas of Lepreum <lb/>
            and Theopompus of Herveum. And he himself went to <lb/>
            Delphi and consulted the oracle. What answer was re­ <lb/>
            turned is not recorded. But Damagetus a native of Rhodes, <lb/>
            the King of Ialysus, had also at this time come to consult <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            the oracle as to where he should marry a wife from, and <lb/>
            the Pythian Priestess replied that he was to marry the <lb/>
            daughter of the noblest of the Greeks. And Aristomenes <lb/>
            had a third daughter, and he married her, thinking her <lb/>
            father far the noblest Greek of his time. And Aristomenes <lb/>
            went to Rhodes with his daughter, and from thence he <lb/>
            intended to go to Sardis to Ardys the son of Gyges, and to <lb/>
            Ecbatana the royal residence of the Medes to the Court of <lb/>
            King Phraortes, but before he could carry out this inten­ <lb/>
            tion he chanced to die of some illness, so that the fates did <lb/>
            not permit him to wreak his vengeance on the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians. And Damagetus and the people of Rhodes built a <lb/>
            splendid monument to him, and paid honours to his memory. <lb/>
            The traditions about those who are called the Diagoridæ <lb/>
            in Rhodes, (who were descended from Diagoras, the son of <lb/>
            Damagetus, the son of Dorieus, the son of Damagetus by <lb/>
            the daughter of Aristomenes), I have omitted, that I might <lb/>
            not appear to have introduced irrelevant matter.</p>
          <p>And the Lacedæmonians, when they had made them­ <lb/>
            selves masters of Messenia, shared it out among themselves <lb/>
            all but the territory of the Asinæi, and Mothone they gave <lb/>
            to the people of Nauplia who had recently been ejected by <lb/>
            the Argives.</p>
          <p>And the Messenians who were captured at Eira, and <lb/>
            compulsorily incorporated among the Helots, revolted again <lb/>
            from the Lacedæmonians in the 79th Olympiad, in which the <lb/>
            Corinthian Xenophon was victor, and Archimedes Archon <lb/>
            at Athens. And they seized the following opportunity. <lb/>
            Some of the Lacedæmonians, on a charge for which they <lb/>
            were condemned to death, fled to Tænarum as suppliants ; <lb/>
            and there the Ephors took them from the altar and slew <lb/>
            them. And the wrath of Poseidon came upon those <lb/>
            Spartans who had violated his rights of sanctuary, and he <lb/>
            adjudged the town to be utterly razed to the ground. And <lb/>
            it was after this calamity that the Helots who were Messe­ <lb/>
            nians revolted and went to Mount Ithome. And the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians sent for several allies to help to subdue <lb/>
            them, and among others for Cimon (the son of Miltiades) <lb/>
            their friend, of whom they. also begged some Athenian <lb/>
            troops. But when these Athenian troops came they sus­ <lb/>
            pected them as likely to introduce revolutionary ideas <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            among their own men, so in their suspicion they soon sent <lb/>
            them home again from Ithome. But when the Athenians <lb/>
            observed that suspicion on the part of the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            they were indignant and became friendly to the Argives, and, <lb/>
            when those of the Messenians who were besieged at Ithome <lb/>
            were allowed to surrender upon conditions, gave Naupactus <lb/>
            to them, (having taken it from the Locrians in Ætolia <lb/>
            called Ozolæ). And the Messenians were allowed to sur­ <lb/>
            render partly because of the strength of the place, partly <lb/>
            because the Pythian Priestess prophesied to the Lacedeemo­ <lb/>
            nians that there would be vengeance from Zeus of Ithome <lb/>
            if they violated his right of sanctuary. So they were <lb/>
            allowed to evacuate the Peloponnese upon conditions for <lb/>
            these reasons.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND when they got Naupactus, they were not content <lb/>
            with the town and region that they had got through <lb/>
            the Athenians, but a strong desire came upon them to get <lb/>
            a place for themselves by their own valour. And as they <lb/>
            knew that the Œniadæ, who had a rich soil in Acarnania, <lb/>
            had been for all time at variance with the Athenians, they <lb/>
            marched against them. And being not superior in point <lb/>
            of numbers, but far superior in respect to bravery, they <lb/>
            won a victory over them, and shut them up in their fort <lb/>
            and blockaded them. And the Messenians employed <lb/>
            every human invention for taking cities, they tried to get <lb/>
            over the walls by scaling ladders, and undermined the fort, <lb/>
            and bringing up such engines as they could get at short <lb/>
            notice kept battering away at the walls. And those in the <lb/>
            town, fearing that if the town was taken they would be un­ <lb/>
            done, and their wives and children sold into slavery, pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to surrender upon conditions. And for about a year <lb/>
            the Messenians occupied the town and enjoyed the produce <lb/>
            of the country, but the year after the Acarnanians gather­ <lb/>
            ing a force together from all their towns planned a march <lb/>
            upon Naupactus. But they changed their minds about <lb/>
            this when they saw that their .march would be through <lb/>
            the country of the zEtolians, who were always hostile to <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            them, and at the same time they expected the Naupactians <lb/>
            had a navy, as indeed they had, and as they were masters <lb/>
            of the sea it would not be possible to subdue them with a <lb/>
            land army. So they changed their plan with alacrity, and <lb/>
            marched against the Messenians at CEniadce. And they <lb/>
            began to lay siege to the town : for they did not suppose that <lb/>
            so few men would come to such a pitch of recklessness as <lb/>
            to sally out and fight against them. And the Messenians <lb/>
            had got together a store of corn and other provisions, ex­ <lb/>
            pectin- a long siege : but they thought before the blockade <lb/>
            commenced they would have one good fight in the open, <lb/>
            and as they were Messenians, who had only been inferior to <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians in luck not in courage, they would not <lb/>
            be frightened at this mob that had come from Acarnania. <lb/>
            And the Athenians remembered the action at Marathon, <lb/>
            how thirty myriads of Medes were slain by less than <lb/>
            10,000. So they determined to fight the Acarnanians, and <lb/>
            the battle was fought as follows. The Acarnanians inas­ <lb/>
            much as they were far more numerous easily surrounded <lb/>
            the Messenians, except where the gates at the back of the <lb/>
            Messenians checked them, and the men on the walls <lb/>
            stoutly defended their comrades. Here they could not be <lb/>
            surrounded. But both their flanks were sore pressed by <lb/>
            the Acarnanians, and they shot at them from all sides. <lb/>
            And the Messenians being a compact body, wherever they <lb/>
            made a general attack on the Acarnanians, threw the <lb/>
            enemy's ranks into confusion, and killed and wounded <lb/>
            many, yet could not bring about a complete rout. For <lb/>
            wherever the Acarnanians observed that their lines were <lb/>
            pierced by the Messenians, there they brought up large <lb/>
            detachments of men, and beat the Messenians back by sheer <lb/>
            force of numbers. And whenever the Messenians were un­ <lb/>
            successful in an attack, and tried in some other place to <lb/>
            break the Acarnanian line, the same result would follow. <lb/>
            At whatever point they attacked they produced confusion <lb/>
            and something like a rout, but the Acarnanians came <lb/>
            swarming up, and so the Messenians had very unwillingly <lb/>
            to retire. And the struggle being very evenly poised till <lb/>
            night came on, and the attacking force of the Acarnanians <lb/>
            being augmented the following evening from several <lb/>
            towns, a regular blockade of the Messenians commenced. <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            And they had no fear that the town would be taken by <lb/>
            storm, either by the Acarnanians getting over the walls, or <lb/>
            by their being compelled to desert their garrison duty. <lb/>
            But by the 8th month all their supplies were consumed. <lb/>
            To the Acarnanians they jeeringly cried out that their pro­ <lb/>
            visions would last even a ten years' siege: but about the <lb/>
            time of first sleep they quietly slipped out of Œniadœ, and <lb/>
            being compelled to fight their way through directly the <lb/>
            Acarnanians got to know of this flitting, lost about 300 but <lb/>
            killed a still greater number of the enemy, and most of <lb/>
            them succeeded in cutting their way through, and by the <lb/>
            assistance of the Ætolians who were friendly to them got <lb/>
            safe to Naupactus.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND from this time forward their hostility to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians increased, as they notably shewed in the <lb/>
            war between the Peloponnesians and Athenians. For they <lb/>
            made Naupactus a base against the Peloponnese, and when <lb/>
            the Spartans were cut off at Sphacteria some Messenian <lb/>
            bowmen from Naupactus assisted the Athenians. But <lb/>
            after the reverse of the Athenians at Ægospotamoi, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians being masters of the sea drove the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians from Naupactus, and some went into Sicily to their <lb/>
            kinsmen at Zancle and Rhegium, but most to Libya to <lb/>
            the Euesperitæ, who being hard pressed in war by some of <lb/>
            the neighbouring barbarians invited in the Greeks as <lb/>
            colonists. To them went most of the Messenians under <lb/>
            Comon, who had been their General at Sphacteria.</p>
          <p>And a year before the Theban victory at Leuctra, the <lb/>
            god foretold to the Messenians their return to the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese. For the priest of Hercules (they say) in Messene at <lb/>
            the Sicilian Strait saw in a dream Hercules Manticlus in­ <lb/>
            vited in a friendly way by Zeus to Ithome. And among the <lb/>
            Euesperitæ Comon dreamt that he had dealings with his <lb/>
            dead mother, and that subsequently his mother came to life <lb/>
            again. And he hoped as the Athenians were now powerful <lb/>
            at sea that they would be restored to Naupactus : and the <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            dream seemed to indicate that Messene would revive. And <lb/>
            no long time after came to the Lacedæmonians at Leuctra <lb/>
            the disaster that had long been fated: for the concluding <lb/>
            words of the oracle given to Aristodemus the king of the <lb/>
            Messenians were, <lb/>
            " Do as fate bids: woe comes to all in turn."</p>
          <p>As at that time it was fated for him and the Messenians <lb/>
            to be unfortunate, so in after time was it fated for Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon when her day had come. And now the Thebans <lb/>
            after the victory of Leuctra sent messengers to Italy and <lb/>
            Sicily and to the Euesperitæ, to recall the Messenians from <lb/>
            their wanderings to the Peloponnese. And they gathered <lb/>
            together quicker than anyone would have thought, from <lb/>
            yearning affection to their fatherland, and from their <lb/>
            abiding hate to the Lacedæmonians. And Epaminondas <lb/>
            was in doubt what city he should build as a base against <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, or where he should find a site, for the <lb/>
            Messenians would not dwell again at Andania and Œchalia, <lb/>
            because they had been so unlucky when they lived there <lb/>
            before. As he was in this doubt they say an old man, very <lb/>
            like a priest of the mysteries, appeared to him in a vision of <lb/>
            the night, and said to him, " My gift to you is universal <lb/>
            conquest in war : and when you shall leave this earth I will <lb/>
            make your name, 0 Theban, immortal and ever glorious. <lb/>
            But do you in return restore to the Messenians their <lb/>
            country and cities, for the wrath of Castor and Pollux <lb/>
            towards them is now appeased." These were his words to <lb/>
            Epaminondas, who revealed the dream to Epiteles the son <lb/>
            of Æschines, whom the Argives chose as their General and <lb/>
            the restorer of Messene. This man was bidden in a dream, <lb/>
            in the place where he should find at Ithome an ivy and <lb/>
            myrtle tree growing, to dig between them and recover an <lb/>
            old woman who was ill and confined there in a brass coffin <lb/>
            and already near to death's door. And Epiteles when day <lb/>
            broke went to the appointed place, and dug up a cinerary <lb/>
            urn of brass, and took it at once to Epaminondas and nar­ <lb/>
            rated his dream, and he told him to remove the lid and see <lb/>
            what was in it. And he after sacrifice and prayer to the <lb/>
            person who had sent him this dream opened the urn, and <lb/>
            found some tin beaten very thin, and rolled up like a book. <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            On it were written the mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and <lb/>
            it was in fact what Aristomenes had buried. And they say <lb/>
            the person who appeared to Epiteles and Epaminondas in <lb/>
            their dreams was Caucon, who formerly came from Athens <lb/>
            to Andania to Messene the daughter of Triopas.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE wrath of Castor and Pollux against the Messenians <lb/>
            began before the battle at Stenyclerus, and I conjec­ <lb/>
            ture it to have originated in the following way. Panormus <lb/>
            and Gonippus, two lads of Andania in the bloom of youth, <lb/>
            were great friends, and used jointly to make incursions and <lb/>
            raids into Laconia. And as the Lacedaemonians in camp <lb/>
            were keeping the festival of Castor and Pollux, and after <lb/>
            the banquet were full of wine and merrymaking, Gonippus <lb/>
            and Panormus, clad in white tunics and purple cloaks, well <lb/>
            mounted, with hats on their heads and spears in their <lb/>
            hands, presented themselves to the Lacedæmonians. And <lb/>
            when they saw them they bowed down before them and <lb/>
            worshipped them, thinking they were Castor and Pollux <lb/>
            who had come to the sacrifice. But these young men mixed <lb/>
            up with them and rode through them and stabbed many <lb/>
            with their lances, and, after many of them had fallen, rode <lb/>
            back to Andania, having thus outraged the festival of <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux. This is what I think made the Twin <lb/>
            Brethren hate the Messenians. But now, as was hinted to <lb/>
            Epaminondas in his dream, the Twin Brethren had no <lb/>
            objection to the return of the Messenians. And Epaminon­ <lb/>
            das was very greatly encouraged also to the restoration of <lb/>
            Messene by the oracles of Bacis, who had been driven mad by <lb/>
            the Nymphs and had given various prophetic utterances to <lb/>
            several of the Greeks, and amongst others this one about <lb/>
            the return of the Messenians : <lb/>
            " And then shall Sparta lose her glorious flower, <lb/>
            Messene built again be for all time." <lb/>
            I find also that Bacis foretold the manner in which Eira <lb/>
            would be taken : this is one of his prophetic lines, <lb/>
            " Those from conquered Messene with its splashing fountains." <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            And as the records of the Mysteries had been recovered, <lb/>
            the priests entered them in books. And Epaminondas, <lb/>
            as the place where the Messenians now have their capital <lb/>
            seemed most convenient to settle in, bade the seers <lb/>
            examine if the gods were favourable to the spot. And on <lb/>
            their replying that the omens were favourable, he at once <lb/>
            made preparations for building the town, ordering a large <lb/>
            supply of stone, and sending for builders who should artisti­ <lb/>
            cally lay out streets and build houses and temples and lines <lb/>
            of walls. And when all was in readiness the Arcadians <lb/>
            furnished victims, and Epaminondas and the Thebans <lb/>
            sacrificed to Dionysus and Apollo Ismenius in the accus­ <lb/>
            tomed manner, and the Argives to Argive Hera and <lb/>
            Nemean Zeus, and the Messenians to Zeus of Ithome and <lb/>
            Castor and Pollux, and the priests of the Mysteries to the <lb/>
            Great Goddesses and Caucon. And with one consent they <lb/>
            invoked the heroes to come and dwell with them, especially <lb/>
            Messene the daughter of Triopas, and Eurytus and Apha­ <lb/>
            reus and his sons, and of the Heraclidæ Cresphontes and <lb/>
            Æpytus. But most unanimous of all was the cry for Aristo­ <lb/>
            menes. And that day they devoted to sacrifices and prayers, <lb/>
            and on the following days they raised the circuit of the walls, <lb/>
            and began to build their houses and temples inside the <lb/>
            walls. And they carried on this work only to the music of <lb/>
            Boeotian and Argive flutes, and the tunes of Sacadas and <lb/>
            Pronomus now first came into competition. And they <lb/>
            called the capital Messene, and they restored others of <lb/>
            their towns. But the people of Nauplia were not turned <lb/>
            out of Mothone, the Asinæi also were allowed to remain <lb/>
            where they were, the latter out of gratitude because they <lb/>
            had refused to join the Lacedaemonians against them. And <lb/>
            the people of Nauplia, when the Messenians returned to <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, had brought them as gifts whatever they <lb/>
            had, and had continually prayed to the deity for their <lb/>
            return, and had also made many requests to the Messenians <lb/>
            for their own safety.</p>
          <p>Thus the Messenians returned to the Peloponnese, and <lb/>
            were restored to their country, 287 years after the capture <lb/>
            of Eira, when Dyscinetus was Archon at Athens, and in <lb/>
            the third year of the 102nd Olympiad, in which Damon of <lb/>
            Thurii won the second prize. It was indeed no short <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            time that the Platæans were exiles from their country, or <lb/>
            the Delians when (expelled from Delos by the Athenians) <lb/>
            they dwelt at Adramyttium. The Minyæ from Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus also, having been driven out by the Thebans from <lb/>
            Orchomenus after the battle of Leuctra, were restored to <lb/>
            Bœotia by Philip the son of Amyntas, as the Platæans also. <lb/>
            And although Alexander stript Thebes of Thebans, yet <lb/>
            not many years afterwards Cassander the son of Antipater <lb/>
            rebuilt it. The exile from Platæa seems to have been the <lb/>
            longest of those which I have recorded, however it was <lb/>
            not longer than two generations. But the Messenians were <lb/>
            wanderers from the Peloponnese for nearly 300 years, <lb/>
            during which time it is evident that they abandoned none <lb/>
            of their national customs, nor did they change their Doric <lb/>
            dialect, but even to our day they preserve it purer than <lb/>
            any other of the Peloponnesians.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            IT their return no apprehension was felt by them at first <lb/>
            about the Lacedæmonians: for they, being afraid of <lb/>
            the Thebans, did not interfere with the rebuilding of Mes­ <lb/>
            sene, nor the gathering of the Arcadians into one town. <lb/>
            But when the Phocian War, otherwise called the Holy <lb/>
            War, withdrew the Thebans from the Peloponnese, then <lb/>
            the Lacedemonians pricked up their courage, and could no <lb/>
            longer keep their hands off the Messenians. And the <lb/>
            Messenians bore the brunt of the war alone, except the <lb/>
            assistance they got from the Argives and Arcadians ; they <lb/>
            also begged for help from the Athenians,—but they replied <lb/>
            that they could not join them in an incursion into Laconia, <lb/>
            but if the Lacedæmonians were the aggressors and carried <lb/>
            the war into Messenia, then they promised that they would <lb/>
            not fail them. And eventually the Messenians got the <lb/>
            help of Philip, the son of Amyntas, and the Macedonians, <lb/>
            and this they say prevented them from participation in <lb/>
            the struggle of the Greeks at Chæronea. Not that they <lb/>
            would ever have been inclined to take up arms against the <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            Greeks. But after the death of Alexander, when the <lb/>
            Greeks commenced a second war against the Macedonians, <lb/>
            the Messenians took their part in this, as I have before <lb/>
            shewn in my account of Attica. But they did not join <lb/>
            the Greeks in fighting against the Galati, as Cleonymus <lb/>
            and the Lacedæmonians would not make a treaty with <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>And not long afterwards the Messenians occupied Elis, <lb/>
            partly by cunning partly by audacity. The people of Elis <lb/>
            in ancient times were the most orderly of all the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians, but when Philip the son of Amyntas did all that <lb/>
            harm to Greece that we have mentioned, and corrupted by <lb/>
            bribes the most influential of the people of Elis, then for <lb/>
            the first time in their history the people of Elis took up arms <lb/>
            and became factious. And after they had taken the first <lb/>
            plunge, they were likely with less reluctance to go into <lb/>
            future civil strife, inasmuch as through the Lacedemonians <lb/>
            their policy had been shifted, and they had drifted into <lb/>
            civil war. And the Lacedæmonians hearing of the factions <lb/>
            at Elis made preparations to assist those who were for their <lb/>
            party. And while they were drilling and mobilizing their <lb/>
            forces, about 1000 picked men of the Messenians secretly <lb/>
            approached Elis, with Lacedæmonian colours on their <lb/>
            shields. And when the men in Elis who were friendly to <lb/>
            the Spartans saw their shields, they concluded they had <lb/>
            come to help them and admitted them within the walls. <lb/>
            But when the Messenians got in, in the way I have de­ <lb/>
            scribed, they expelled from the town the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            party, and entrusted the town to their own friends. Their <lb/>
            stratagem was Homeric, and the Messenians seem to have <lb/>
            imitated Homer for the nonce, for Homer has represented <lb/>
            in the Iliad Patroclus wearing the armour of Achilles, and <lb/>
            how the Trojans, thinking that Achilles was leading the <lb/>
            attack, were thrown into confusion in their van. Other <lb/>
            stratagems of war are found in Homer, as when he describes <lb/>
            two Greek spies coming to the Trojans by night instead of <lb/>
            one, and afterwards a supposed deserter coming to Troy <lb/>
            really to spy out the weak points. Moreover he represents <lb/>
            those Trojans who were either too young or too old to fight <lb/>
            as manning the walls, while those of a suitable age took <lb/>
            the field against the Greeks. And those of the Greeks <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            that were wounded gave their armour to other fighting <lb/>
            men, that their services too might not be altogether <lb/>
            lost. Thus Homer's ideas have been generally useful to <lb/>
            mankind.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND no long time after this action at Elis the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians under Demetrius, the son of Philip the son of <lb/>
            Demetrius, attacked Messene. Most of the audacity dis­ <lb/>
            played by Perseus against Philip and his son Demetrius I <lb/>
            have already described in my account about Sicyon: and <lb/>
            the capture of Messene took place as follows. Philip was <lb/>
            in need of money, and, as he must have it by hook or by <lb/>
            crook, sent Demetrius with a fleet to the Peloponnese. And <lb/>
            Demetrius chanced to put in at one of the least frequented <lb/>
            harbours of Argolis: and without losing time he led his <lb/>
            army by the shortest cuts through the country to Messene. <lb/>
            And having posted in the van all his light-armed troops, <lb/>
            as he was well acquainted with the road to Ithome, he got <lb/>
            stealthily into the town a little before dawn, and took up <lb/>
            his position between the town and the citadel. And when <lb/>
            day broke and those in the town perceived their imminent <lb/>
            peril, their first thought was that the Lacedemonians had <lb/>
            got into the town, so they rushed against them with the <lb/>
            greatest alacrity owing to their ancient animosity. But <lb/>
            when both from their arms and language they discovered <lb/>
            that they were Macedonians under Demetrius the son of <lb/>
            Philip, a panic came over them, when they considered the <lb/>
            military renown of the Macedonians, and the good fortune <lb/>
            which they had invariably had. However the magnitude <lb/>
            of the impending danger suggested to them an almost <lb/>
            supernatural bravery, and at the same time the hope to see <lb/>
            better days supported them : for they could not but think <lb/>
            their return to the Peloponnese after so long an exile was <lb/>
            not against the will of the Deity. The Messenians there­ <lb/>
            fore in the town rushed against the Macedonians with <lb/>
            impetuosity, and the garrison in the citadel galled them <lb/>
            from their higher position. The Macedonians from their <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            courage and tactical skill fought at first like lions : but at <lb/>
            last spent with their long march, and not only pressed <lb/>
            hard by men, but pelted with tiles and stones by the <lb/>
            women, fled in disorder. And most of them perished <lb/>
            miserably, being pushed down the rocks, for Ithome was <lb/>
            very precipitous here, but a few threw away their arms and <lb/>
            got off safe.</p>
          <p>What prevented the Messenians from joining at first the <lb/>
            Achæan League was as follows. They had of their own accord <lb/>
            gone to the aid of the Lacedæmonians when they were at­ <lb/>
            tacked by Pyrrhus the son of Æacus, and for this good ser­ <lb/>
            vice there were already friendlier relations between them­ <lb/>
            selves and Sparta. They did not therefore wish to revive <lb/>
            the old feud by going to the Achæan League, as the <lb/>
            Achæans were most openly hostile to the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            And what has not escaped my notice, and cannot have <lb/>
            escaped the notice of the Messenians is that, even had there <lb/>
            been no Achæan League, the Achæans would have been <lb/>
            hostile to the Lacedæmonians, for among the Achæans the <lb/>
            Argives and Arcadians were no small element. In pro­ <lb/>
            cess of time however the Messenians joined the Achæan <lb/>
            League. And not long afterwards Cleomenes, the son of <lb/>
            Leonidas and grandson of Cleonymus, took Megalopolis the <lb/>
            chief town of the Arcadians in truce time. In the capture of <lb/>
            the town about a third of the inhabitants were captured or <lb/>
            slain, but Philopcemen the son of Craugis and those who <lb/>
            escaped with him (and they say that rather more than two <lb/>
            thirds of the people of Megalopolis got away) were kindly <lb/>
            received by the Messenians, partly on account of the <lb/>
            ancient friendliness which the Arcadians had first exhi­ <lb/>
            bited in the days of Aristomenes, and partly in consequence <lb/>
            of the part they had taken in the rebuilding of Messene. <lb/>
            The Messenians even went so far as to assign to the Area­ <lb/>
            dians equal rights to themselves. Such vicissitudes and <lb/>
            changes are there in all human affairs, that the deity put it <lb/>
            into the power of the Messenians to preserve in turn the <lb/>
            Arcadians, and (what was still less to be expected) one <lb/>
            day to capture Sparta. For when they fought against Cleo­ <lb/>
            menes at Sellasia they joined Aratus and the Achæans in <lb/>
            taking Sparta. And when the Lacedæmonians had got rid <lb/>
            of Cleomenes, there rose up against them the tyrant <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            Machanidas : and after his death Nabis is sprung up as tyrant <lb/>
            over them. And, as he not only plundered men but also <lb/>
            sacrilegiously robbed the holy places, in no long time he <lb/>
            amassed considerable sums of money, and got together <lb/>
            with this money an army. And when he occupied Messene <lb/>
            Philopœmen and the people of Megalopolis made a sally by <lb/>
            night, and the Spartan tyrant departed on conditions. And <lb/>
            the Achæans after this, in consequence of some difference <lb/>
            with the Messenians, marched out against them in full force, <lb/>
            and ravaged their territory. And again about harvest time <lb/>
            they collected a force for the purpose of attacking Mes­ <lb/>
            senia, but Dinocrates a prominent man among the people, <lb/>
            who had been recently elected ruler of the Messenians, <lb/>
            forced Lycortas and the army with him to retire without <lb/>
            effecting their object, and having occupied the byroads <lb/>
            between Messenia and Arcadia he protected1 the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians in their town and in all the neighbouring districts. <lb/>
            And when Philopœmen with a few cavalry came a little <lb/>
            later than the army of Lycortas. not having been able to <lb/>
            gather any tidings about them, the Messenians having the <lb/>
            advantage of ground beat them in battle, and took Philo­ <lb/>
            poemen alive. And the manner of his capture and his death <lb/>
            I shall relate hereafter in my account of Arcadia. Suffice <lb/>
            it here to state that those Messenians who were guilty of <lb/>
            the death of Philopcemen were punished, and Messene again <lb/>
            joined the Achaean League.</p>
          <p>Hitherto I have had to deal with the many sufferings of <lb/>
            the Messenians, and to describe how the Deity, having <lb/>
            scattered them to the ends of the earth, and to places most <lb/>
            remote from the Peloponnese, restored them to their own <lb/>
            country a long time afterwards. And now let us turn to <lb/>
            a description of the country and its towns. <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢμυνεν</foreign>. </note></p><pb n="287"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE is in our days in Messenia, about 20 stades <lb/>
            from the Choerian dell, a town by the sea called Abia. <lb/>
            They say in old times it was called Ire, and that it was <lb/>
            one of the seven towns, which Homer represents Agamem­ <lb/>
            non as promising to Achilles. And when Hyllus and the <lb/>
            Dorians were conquered in battle by the Achæans, then <lb/>
            they say Abia, the nurse of Glenus the son of Hercules, <lb/>
            went to Ire, and there lived, and built a temple of Her­ <lb/>
            cules, and for that reason Cresphontes afterwards assigned <lb/>
            her several honours, and changed the name of the town to <lb/>
            her name Abia. There were notable temples there both to <lb/>
            Hercules and AEsculapius.</p>
          <p>And Pharæ is distant from Abia about 80 stades, and <lb/>
            the water by the road is salt. The Emperor Augustus <lb/>
            ordered the Messenians at Pharæ to be ranked under <lb/>
            Laconia. The founder of the city was they say Pharis, the <lb/>
            son of Hermes by Phylodamea the daughter of Danaus. <lb/>
            And Pharis they say had no male children, but only a <lb/>
            daughter Telegone. The direct line of genealogy has been <lb/>
            given by Homer in the Iliad, who says that the twins <lb/>
            Crethon and Ortilochus were the sons of Diodes, and that <lb/>
            Diodes himself was the son of Ortilochus, the son of <lb/>
            Alpheus. But he has said nothing about Telegone, who <lb/>
            according to the Messenian tradition was the wife of <lb/>
            Alpheus and mother of Ortilochus. I have also heard at <lb/>
            Pharæ that Diodes had a daughter Anticlea as well as his <lb/>
            twin sons, and that she bare Nicomachus and Gorgasus to <lb/>
            Machaon the son of Æsculapius : they lived at Pharæ, and <lb/>
            after the death of Diodes succeeded to the kingdom. And <lb/>
            a constant tradition about them has prevailed even to this <lb/>
            day, that they have the power of healing illnesses and <lb/>
            people maimed in body. And because of this the people <lb/>
            sacrifice to them and offer votive offerings. At Pharæ <lb/>
            there is also a temple and ancient statue of Fortune. The <lb/>
            first person that I know of that has mentioned Fortune is <lb/>
            Homer. He has mentioned her in his Hymn to Demeter, <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            when enumerating the other daughters of Oceanus, how <lb/>
            they played with Demeter's daughter Proserpine, and <lb/>
            among them Fortune, also a daughter of Oceanus. These <lb/>
            are the lines.! "We all were in the pleasant meadow, <lb/>
            Leucippe, Phæno, Electra, and Ianthe, Melobosis, and <lb/>
            Fortune, and Ocyroe of the beautiful eyes." But he has <lb/>
            said nothing further about her, how she is the greatest <lb/>
            goddess in human affairs and has the greatest influence, as <lb/>
            in the Iliad he represented Athene and Enyo as supreme <lb/>
            in war, and Artemis as dreaded in childbirth, and Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite as the goddess of marriages. He has not symbolized <lb/>
            Fortune in this way. But Bupalus, a man of wonderful <lb/>
            ability in building temples and making models of animals, <lb/>
            is the first person we know of that made a statue of Fortune. <lb/>
            His was for the people of Smyrna. Fortune has a globe <lb/>
            on her head, and in one of her hands what is called by <lb/>
            the Greeks the horn of Amalthea. Thus did he typify <lb/>
            the actions of this goddess. Pindar also subsequently <lb/>
            wrote various lines about Fortune, and named her City- <lb/>
            Preserver.</p>

            OT far from Pharæ is the grove of Carnean Apollo, <lb/>
            and a fountain of water in it, and Pharæ is about six <lb/>
            stades from the sea. As you go from thence into the in­ <lb/>
            terior of Messenia about 80 stades you come to the town of <lb/>
            Thuria,—which they say Homer called Anthea in his verses. <lb/>
            And Augustus gave Thuria to the Spartans. For when the <lb/>
            future Emperor of Rome was at war with Mark Antony, <lb/>
            several Greeks and especially Messenians fought for Antony <lb/>
            because the Lacedaemonians espoused the side of Augustus. <lb/>
            Accordingly Augustus punished the Messenians and others <lb/>
            who had opposed him, some more some less. And the people <lb/>
            of Thuria left their ancient city which was built on a height, <lb/>
            and went and dwelt in the plain. Not that they altogether <lb/>
            abandoned the upper city, for there are ruins of their walls <note type="footnote"> 1 Hymn to Demeter, lines 417, 418, 420. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            and a temple there called the temple of the Syrian goddess. <lb/>
            And a river called Arts flows by their town in the plain.</p>
          <p>And there is in the interior a village called Calamæ and <lb/>
            a place called Limnæ : in the latter place is a temple of <lb/>
            Artemis of Limnæ, where they say Teleclus the king of <lb/>
            Sparta was killed. And as you go from Thuria in the <lb/>
            direction of Arcadia are the sources of the river Pamisus, <lb/>
            in which small boys by being dipped are cured of diseases. <lb/>
            And as you go to the left from these sources of the river <lb/>
            and go forward about 40 stades, you come to the city of <lb/>
            the Messenians under Mount Ithome: which is encircled <lb/>
            not only by Mount Ithome but also in the direction of <lb/>
            the Pamisus by Mount Eva. The mountain they say was <lb/>
            called Eva from the Bacchic cry Evce, which Dionysus and <lb/>
            his attendant women first uttered here. And round Mes­ <lb/>
            sene is a circular wall entirely constructed of stone, and <lb/>
            towers and battlements are built on it. As to the walls of <lb/>
            the Babylonians, or those called Memnon's in Susa amongst <lb/>
            the Persians, I have neither seen them nor heard anything <lb/>
            of them from eye witnesses: but I can confidently affirm <lb/>
            that the wall round Messene is stronger than those at Am­ <lb/>
            brosus in Phocis or at Bvzantium or at Rhodes. And <lb/>
            in the marketplace at Messene there is a statue of Zeus <lb/>
            Soter, and a conduit called Arsinoe, which got its name <lb/>
            from the daughter of Leucippus, and water flows under­ <lb/>
            ground to feed it from a well called Clepsydra. And the <lb/>
            gods who have temples are Poseidon and Aphrodite. And <lb/>
            the most notable thing is a statue of the Mother of the <lb/>
            Gods in Parian marble by Damophon, who most artisti­ <lb/>
            cally rivetted the Zeus at Olympia when the ivory got <lb/>
            loose. And honours were bestowed upon him by the people <lb/>
            of Elis. He too designed the statue that the people of <lb/>
            Messene call Laphria: whom they are accustomed to <lb/>
            worship for the following reason. Among the Calydonians, <lb/>
            who worship Artemis most of all the gods, her title is <lb/>
            Laphria. And the Messenians who received Naupactus <lb/>
            from the Athenians, and lived consequently very near to <lb/>
            Ætolia, borrowed the worship of Artemis Laphria from the <lb/>
            Calydonians. The statue I shall describe elsewhere. The <lb/>
            title Laphria is only given to Artemis by the Messenians <lb/>
            and the people of Pa træ in Achaia. Ephesian Artemis is <note type="footnote"> u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            the title which all cities recognize, and by which men <lb/>
            privately worship her as greatest of the gods; partly <lb/>
            from the fame of the Amazons, who are said to have <lb/>
            established the worship of her image, partly because she <lb/>
            had a temple at Ephesus from time immemorial. And <lb/>
            three other things contributed to her glory also, the size <lb/>
            of the temple which exceeds all other human structures, <lb/>
            the celebrity of the city of Ephesus, and the splendour of <lb/>
            the goddess' shrine.</p>
          <p>At Messene there is also a temple and stone statue of <lb/>
            Ilithyia. And hard by is a hall of the Curetes, where they <lb/>
            sacrifice all kinds of living things alike. Beginning with <lb/>
            bulls and goats, they even go as far as to cast birds into <lb/>
            the flames. There is also a temple sacred to Demeter, <lb/>
            and statues of Castor and Pollux represented as carrying <lb/>
            off the daughters of Leucippus. I have already shown <lb/>
            in a previous part of my work that the Messenians assert <lb/>
            that Castor and Pollux are indigenous with them and not <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians. And they have many statues <lb/>
            well worth seeing in the temple of Æsculapius. For besides <lb/>
            the statues of the god and his sons, and besides those of <lb/>
            Apollo and the Muses and Hercules, there are statues of <lb/>
            Thebes and Epaminondas the son of Cleommis, and of <lb/>
            Fortune and of Lightbringing Artemis. Those in stone are <lb/>
            the work of Damophon, the only Messenian statuary that <lb/>
            I know of that has produced any remarkable statues. The <lb/>
            effigy of Epaminondas in iron is by another hand. There <lb/>
            is also at Messene a temple of Triopas and her statue in <lb/>
            gold and Parian marble : and the paintings at the back of <lb/>
            the temple are Aphareus and his sons, the kings of Messene <lb/>
            before the expedition of the Dorians to the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            and after the return of the Heraclidæ Cresphontes, the <lb/>
            leader of the Dorians, and of those that dwelt at Pylos <lb/>
            Nestor and Thrasymedes and Antilochus, who were pre­ <lb/>
            ferred to the sons of Nestor partly because they were older, <lb/>
            partly because they had taken part in the Trojan ex­ <lb/>
            pedition. There are paintings also of Leucippus the <lb/>
            brother of Aphareus, and of Hilaira, Phœbe, and Arsinoe. <lb/>
            There are paintings also of Æsculapius, (the son of Ar­ <lb/>
            sinoe according to the tradition of the Messenians,) and <lb/>
            Machaon and Podalirius, for they also had a share in the <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            expedition to Ilium. These paintings were executed by <lb/>
            Omphalion, the pupil of Nicias the son of Nicomedes: some <lb/>
            say that he was also the slave of Nicias and his favourite.</p>

          <p>T: <lb/>
            HE temple at Messene called the Sacrificial Chamber <lb/>
            has statues of the gods generally worshipped among <lb/>
            the Greeks, and also an effigy of Epaminondas in brass. <lb/>
            There are also some ancient tripods, such as Homer de­ <lb/>
            scribes as not having experienced fire.1 And the statues <lb/>
            in the gymnasium are the work of Egyptians, and are <lb/>
            Hermes Hercules and Theseus, who are wont to be held <lb/>
            in honour at gymnasiums and palæstras by all Greeks and <lb/>
            by many barbarians. I also noticed a statue of Æthidas <lb/>
            who was a contemporary of mine but older, and as he was <lb/>
            very wealthy the Messenians paid him honours as a hero. <lb/>
            None of the people of Messene deny that Æthidas was <lb/>
            wealthy, but some say it is not that Æthidas who has a <lb/>
            statue on the pillar, but a namesake and ancestor. And <lb/>
            this earlier Æthidas was they say the General of the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians, when Demetrius the son of Philip and his army <lb/>
            stole into the town by night when they little expected it.</p>
          <p>There is here also the tomb of Aristomenes, and not a <lb/>
            mere cenotaph, if their account is correct. But when I <lb/>
            inquired how and from what place they brought home <lb/>
            Aristomenes' remains, they replied that they sent for them <lb/>
            from Rhodes, obeying the direction of the God at Delphi. <lb/>
            They also informed me of the sacrifices at this tomb. <lb/>
            The bull they intend to sacrifice they bring to the tomb, <lb/>
            and fasten it to a pillar near the tomb. And it being <lb/>
            wild and unused to bonds is reluctant to remain there. <lb/>
            And if by its struggles and mad bounds the pillar is <lb/>
            moved, it is an auspicious omen to the people of Messene, <lb/>
            but if it is not moved it is an omen of misfortune. And <lb/>
            they amuse themselves with the fancy that Aristomenes <lb/>
            though no longer alive was present at the fight at Leuctra, <lb/>
            and they say he fought for the Thebans, and was the main <note type="footnote"> 1 See Horn. II. ix. 122 ; xxiii. 267. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            cause of the Lacedaemonian defeat. I know that the <lb/>
            Chaldaean and Indian astrologers were the first who taught <lb/>
            that the soul of man is immortal, and several Greeks <lb/>
            credited their assertion, and notably Plato the son of Aristo. <lb/>
            And whoever are willing to believe this cannot deny the <lb/>
            fact that the hatred of Aristomenes to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            was eternal. And what I heard in Thebes lent probability <lb/>
            to the tradition at Messene, though it does not altogether <lb/>
            agree with their account. The The bans say that on the eve <lb/>
            of the battle at Leuctra they sent to several oracles, and <lb/>
            among others to that of Trophonius at Lebadea. The <lb/>
            answers are extant which were received from Ismenian <lb/>
            and Ptoan Apollo, as also from Abæ and Delphi. But the <lb/>
            response of Trophonius was in 4 hexameter verses. " Be­ <lb/>
            fore contending with the foe erect a trophy, decking out <lb/>
            the shield, which the ardent Aristomenes of Messene placed <lb/>
            in my temple. I will assuredly destroy the host of hostile <lb/>
            warriors." And on the arrival of this oracular response they <lb/>
            say that Epaminondas prevailed with Xenocrates to send for <lb/>
            the shield of Aristomenes, and he decked it out as a trophy <lb/>
            in a place where it would be visible to the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            And some of them recognized the shield as they had seen it <lb/>
            in time of peace at Lebadea, and all, knew of it by report. <lb/>
            And after the Thebans won their victory, they offered <lb/>
            Aristomenes' shield again to Trophonius as a votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing. There is also a brazen statue of Aristomenes in the <lb/>
            racecourse at Messene. And not far from the theatre is <lb/>
            the temple of Serapis and Isis.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you go towards the hill of Ithome, where the <lb/>
            Messenians have their citadel, is the spring called <lb/>
            Clepsydra. However willing one may be it is a matter of <lb/>
            no small difficulty to enumerate all the people who put in <lb/>
            the claim that Zeus was born and bred among them. The <lb/>
            people of Messene have this tradition among others. They <lb/>
            say that Zeus was reared among them, and that Ithome <lb/>
            and Neda were his nurses, and that Neda gave her name to <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            the river, and Ithome hers to the mountain. And these <lb/>
            Nymphs they say, when Zens was stolen away by the <lb/>
            Curetes from fear of Cronos, washed him here at Clepsy­ <lb/>
            dra, and the spring got its name from the theft of the <lb/>
            Curetes: and every day they take water from this spring <lb/>
            to the temple of Zens of Ithome. And the statue of Zeus <lb/>
            is the work of Ageladas, and was made originally for the <lb/>
            Messenians that dwelt at Naupactus. And a priest chosen <lb/>
            annually keeps the statue in his house. And they have an <lb/>
            annual feast at Ithome, and originally they had a musical <lb/>
            contest, as one may infer from other sources, but especially <lb/>
            from the lines of Eumelus, which are part of his Proces­ <lb/>
            sional Hymn at Delos, " Welcome to Zeus of Ithome was <lb/>
            the pure muse with free sandals." I think from these <lb/>
            verses that Eumelus knew that they had a musical contest <lb/>
            at the Feast of Zeus of Ithome.</p>
          <p>At the gates in the direction of Megalopolis in Arcadia <lb/>
            there is a statue of Hermes of Athenian design : the <lb/>
            busts of Hermes among the Athenians are square, and <lb/>
            others have borrowed this design from them. And if you <lb/>
            go about 30 stades down from these gates you come to the <lb/>
            river Balyra. It was so called they say because Thamyris <lb/>
            threw his lyre away there in his blindness, Thamyris the <lb/>
            son of Philammon and the nymph Argiope. Argiope they say <lb/>
            lived at Parnassus for a while, but when she became preg­ <lb/>
            nant removed to Odrysæ, because Philammon would not <lb/>
            marry her. And this is the reason why they call Thamyris <lb/>
            Odrysian and Thracian. And the rivers Leucasia and <lb/>
            Amphitus are tributaries of the Balyra.</p>
          <p>After you have crossed these you come to the plain called <lb/>
            the plain of Stenyclerus; this Stenyclerus was a hero. And <lb/>
            right opposite the plain is what was called of old CEchalia, <lb/>
            but in our day the Carnasian grove, mostly of cypress <lb/>
            trees. And the gods who have statues are Carnean Apollo <lb/>
            and Hermes carrying a ram. And the daughter of De­ <lb/>
            meter is here called the Virgin, and near her statue water <lb/>
            wells from a spring. But the rites of the Great Goddesses, <lb/>
            who have their Mysteries at the Carnasian grove, I must <lb/>
            not reveal: but they are in my opinion second only in sanc­ <lb/>
            tity to the Eleusininian Mysteries. I am also prevented by <lb/>
            a dream from revealing to the public all about the cinerary <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            urn of brass found by the Argive General, in which the re­ <lb/>
            mains of Eurytus the son of Melaneus are kept. And the <lb/>
            river Charadrus flows along the Carnasian grove, and as you <lb/>
            go on about 8 stades to the left you come to the ruins of <lb/>
            Andania. That the town was so named from a woman called <lb/>
            Andania is admitted by the antiquarians : I know however <lb/>
            nothing about her parents, or who she married. And on <lb/>
            the road from Andania to Cyparissiæ you come to a place <lb/>
            called Polichne, where the rivers Electra and Cams flow. <lb/>
            Perhaps the names of these rivers refer to Electra the <lb/>
            daughter of Atlas and to Cams the father of Leto, or Electra <lb/>
            and Cams are possibly some local heroes.</p>
          <p>And after crossing the Electra you come to the well <lb/>
            called Achaia, and the ruins of the city Dorium. And it is <lb/>
            here at Dorium that Homer has described Thamyris as <lb/>
            having been stricken blind, because he said he could excel <lb/>
            the Muses in singing.1 But Prodicus the Phocæan, (if the <lb/>
            poem called the Minyad is indeed his), says that punish­ <lb/>
            ments were reserved for Thamyris in Hades because of his <lb/>
            boastful language to the Muses. But I am of opinion that <lb/>
            Thamyris lost his eyesight through disease: as indeed <lb/>
            happened to Homer subsequently. But Homer went on <lb/>
            composing all his life, for he did not yield to his misfor­ <lb/>
            tune, whereas Thamyris wooed the Muse no longer, com­ <lb/>
            pletely overcome by his ever-present trouble.</p>

            ROM Messene to the mouth of the Pamisus is about 80 <lb/>
            stades, and the Pamisus flows clear and limpid through <lb/>
            arable land, and is navigable some 10 stades inland. And <lb/>
            some seafish swim up it especially at the season of spring, <lb/>
            as they do also up the rivers Rhenus and Maeander : but <lb/>
            mostly do they swim up the river Achelous, which has its <lb/>
            outlet near the islands called the Echinades. And the fish <lb/>
            that swim up the Pamisus are finer in appearance, because <lb/>
            the water is clear, and not full of mud like the other rivers <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad. ii. 594-600. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            I have mentioned. And mullets, being fishes that love <lb/>
            mud, are fond of muddy rivers. Now the Greek rivers do <lb/>
            not seem to produce beasts dangerous to man's life, like the <lb/>
            Indus, and the Nile in Egypt, and the Rhenus, the Ister, <lb/>
            the Euphrates, and the Phasis. For they produce beasts that <lb/>
            devour man, in appearance like the Glanides at Hermus <lb/>
            and Mæander, except that they have a darker skin and <lb/>
            more strength. In these respects the Glanides are defi­ <lb/>
            cient. And the Indus and Nile both furnish crocodiles, <lb/>
            and the Nile hippopotamuses also, which are as destructive <lb/>
            to man as the crocodile. But the Greek rivers are not for­ <lb/>
            midable for wild beasts, for even in the river Aous, that <lb/>
            flows through the Thesprotian mainland, the dogs are not <lb/>
            river dogs but sea dogs that swim up from the sea.</p>
          <p>On the right of the Pamisus is Corone, a town near the <lb/>
            sea, and under the mountain Mathia. And on the road <lb/>
            to it is a place near the sea, which they think is the temple <lb/>
            of Ino: for they say that the goddess landed here from the <lb/>
            sea, and was worshipped by the name of Leucothea instead <lb/>
            of Ino. And at no great distance the river Bias discharges <lb/>
            itself into the sea, which river took its name they say from <lb/>
            Bias the son of Amythaon. About 20 stades from the road <lb/>
            is the well Plataniston, the water flows from a plane tree, <lb/>
            broad and hollow inside, and like a small cave, and fresh <lb/>
            water flows from thence to Corone. The name of the town <lb/>
            was of old Æpea, but after the Messenians were restored <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese by the Thebans, they say that Epime­ <lb/>
            lides, who was sent to rebuild it, called it Coronea, after <lb/>
            Coronea in Boeotia where he came from, but the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians mispronounced the name Corone from the first, and <lb/>
            in process of time their mistake became prevalent. There <lb/>
            is also another tradition that when they were digging the <lb/>
            foundations of their walls they found a brass crow.1 The <lb/>
            gods here who have temples are Artemis called the Bearer <lb/>
            of children, and Dionysus, and Æsculapius. The statues of <lb/>
            Æsculapius and Dionysus are of stone, and there is a brazen <lb/>
            statue of Zeus Soter in the marketplace. There is also a <lb/>
            brazen statue of Athene in the citadel in the open air, <lb/>
            with a crow in her hand. I also saw the tomb of Epime- <note type="footnote"> 1 Crow in Greek is Corone. Hence the Paronomasia. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            lides. Why they call the harbour the harbour of the' <lb/>
            Achæans I do not know.</p>
          <p>As you go on about 80 stades from Corone you come to <lb/>
            a temple of Apollo, near the sea, which is held in high <lb/>
            honour : according to the Messenian tradition it is the most <lb/>
            ancient of all Apollo's temples, and the god heals diseases. <lb/>
            They call the god Corydus.1 His statue here is of wood, <lb/>
            but there is a brazen statue the work of Argeotas, a votive <lb/>
            offering they say of the Argonauts. And near the town of <lb/>
            Corone is Colonides. Its inhabitants say they were not <lb/>
            Messenians but were brought by Colsenus from Attica, who <lb/>
            according to an oracle followed the crested lark there. And <lb/>
            in process of time they picked up the Dorian dialect and <lb/>
            customs. And the town of Colonides is on a height not far <lb/>
            from the sea.</p>
          <p>And the people of Asine were originally neighbours of <lb/>
            the Lycoritæ, and dwelt near Mount Parnassus. They were <lb/>
            then called Dryopes from their founder, which name they re­ <lb/>
            tained when they came to the Peloponnese. But in the <lb/>
            third generation afterwards, when Phylas was king, the <lb/>
            Dryopes were beaten in battle by Hercules, and were taken <lb/>
            to Delphi and offered to Apollo. And being brought back <lb/>
            to the Peloponnese by the oracle which the god gave Hercules, <lb/>
            they first occupied Asine near Hermion, and, having been <lb/>
            expelled thence by the Argives, they dwelt in Messenia by <lb/>
            permission of the Lacedæmonians, and when in process of <lb/>
            time the Messenians were restored they were not turned <lb/>
            out by them from Asine. And the account the people of <lb/>
            Asine themselves give is as follows. They admit they were <lb/>
            conquered in battle by Hercules, and that their town on <lb/>
            Mount Parnassus was captured, but they deny that they <lb/>
            were led captive to Apollo, but when their walls were <lb/>
            taken by Hercules, they left their town they say and fled <lb/>
            for refuge to the heights of Parnassus ; and afterwards <lb/>
            crossing over in ships to the Peloponnese became suppliants <lb/>
            of Eurystheus, and be being a bitter enemy of Hercules gave <lb/>
            them Asine in Argolis to dwell in. And the Asinæi are the <lb/>
            only descendants of the Dryopes that still plume themselves <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, crested lark. The explanation of this title is given somr­ <lb/>
            what lower down. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            on that name, very unlike the Eubœans that live at Styra. <lb/>
            For they too are Dryopes by origin, who did not participate <lb/>
            in the contest with Hercules but dwelt at some distance <lb/>
            from the town. But they despise the name Dryopes, <lb/>
            just as the inhabitants of Delphi object to be called <lb/>
            Phocians. Whereas the Asinæi rejoice in the name of <lb/>
            Dryopes, and have evidently made the holiest of their <lb/>
            temples an imitation of those they formerly erected at <lb/>
            Mount Parnassus. They have not only a temple of Apollo, <lb/>
            but a temple and ancient statue of Dryops, whose mysteries <lb/>
            they celebrate annually, and say that he was the son ef <lb/>
            Apollo. And Asine lies by the sea just as the old Asine in <lb/>
            Argolis did, and the distance from Colonides is about 40 <lb/>
            stades, and at about the same distance in the other direc­ <lb/>
            tion is the Promontory of Acritas, just in front of which is <lb/>
            the deserted island of Theganussa. And not far from <lb/>
            Acritas is the harbour of Phcenicus and some islands called <lb/>
            Œnussæ opposite the harbour.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Mothone, which before the expedition against Troy <lb/>
            and even subsequently to that war was called Pedasus, <lb/>
            afterwards changed its name to Motone from the daughter <lb/>
            of CEneus as the inhabitants say: for CEneus the son of <lb/>
            Porthaon after the capture of Ilium retired they say with <lb/>
            Diomede to the Peloponnese, and had by a concubine a <lb/>
            daughter Mothone. But in my opinion the Rock called <lb/>
            Mothon gave its name to Mothone, a rock which constitutes <lb/>
            a natural harbour, for being much of it sunken under <lb/>
            the water it narrows the entrance for ships, and at the <lb/>
            same time is a kind of breakwater against the violence of <lb/>
            the waves. I have already described how the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, in the days when Damocratidas was king at Argos, <lb/>
            gave Mothone to the people of Nauplia, who had been ex­ <lb/>
            pelled from their city for their Laconian proclivities; and <lb/>
            how even after the restoration of the Messenians they were <lb/>
            not interfered with. The people of Xauplia were I imagine <lb/>
            in ancient times Egyptians, and, having, come to Argolis in <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            their ships with Danaus, they formed three generations <lb/>
            afterwards a colony at Nauplia under Nauplius the son <lb/>
            of Amymone. And the Emperor Trajan granted the <lb/>
            people of Mothone a free constitution. But in older <lb/>
            days they alone of all the Messenians had the following <lb/>
            serious misfortune. Thesprotia in Epirus was in a ruinous <lb/>
            condition from anarchy. For Deidamia the daughter of <lb/>
            Pyrrhus had no children, and on her death handed over <lb/>
            the government to the people. She was the daughter <lb/>
            of Pyrrhus, the son of Ptolemy, the son of Alexander, <lb/>
            the son of Pyrrhus: of this last Pyrrhus the son of <lb/>
            Æacides I have given an account earlier in my description <lb/>
            of Attica. Procles the Carthaginian has given Alexander <lb/>
            the son of Philip more praise for his good fortune and <lb/>
            the lustre of his exploits, but for the disposition of an <lb/>
            army and strategical tactics in the face of an enemy he <lb/>
            says Pyrrhus was the better man. And when the people of <lb/>
            Epirus became a democracy, they shewed a want of ballast <lb/>
            in several respects, and entirely disregarded their rulers: <lb/>
            and the Illyrians that dwelt north of Epirus by the <lb/>
            Ionian sea became their masters by sudden attack. For <lb/>
            we know of no democracy but Athens that ever rose to <lb/>
            greatness. The Athenians indeed rose to their zenith by <lb/>
            democracy : but in native intelligence they were superior <lb/>
            to the other Greeks, and obeyed the laws more than de­ <lb/>
            mocracies generally do.</p>
          <p>And the Illyrians, when they had once tasted the sweets <lb/>
            of conquest, longed for more and still more, and equipped <lb/>
            a fleet, and made piratic excursions everywhere, and sailed <lb/>
            to Mothone and anchored there as with friendly intent, and <lb/>
            sent a messenger into the town and asked for some wine for <lb/>
            their ships. And when a few men brought this wine, they <lb/>
            paid for it the price the people of Mothone asked for it, and <lb/>
            sold them in turn some of their cargoes. And on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing day more came from the city and a brisker traffic <lb/>
            ensued. And at last women and men came down to the <lb/>
            ships, and sold wine and received goods in turn from the <lb/>
            barbarians. Then the Illyrians in the height of their daring <lb/>
            captured many men and still more women, and clapped <lb/>
            them on board, and sailed away for the Ionian sea, having <lb/>
            half stripped the town of its population.</p><pb n="299"/>
            
          <p>At Mothone is a temple of Athene the Goddess of Winds, <lb/>
            Diomede they say dedicated the statue of the goddess <lb/>
            and gave her that title, for violent winds and unsea­ <lb/>
            sonable used to blow over the place and do much harm, <lb/>
            but after Diomede prayed to Athene, no trouble from <lb/>
            winds ever came to them thenceforward. There is also a <lb/>
            temple of Artemis here, and some water mixed with pitch <lb/>
            in a well, in appearance very like Cyzicenian ointment. <lb/>
            Water indeed can assume every colour and smell. The <lb/>
            bluest I have ever seen is at Thermopylæ, not all the water <lb/>
            but that which flows into the swimming-bath which the <lb/>
            people of the place call the women's Pots. And reddish <lb/>
            water very like blood is seen in the land of the Hebrews <lb/>
            near Joppa : the water is very near the sea, and the tradi­ <lb/>
            tion about the spring is that Perseus, after killing the sea <lb/>
            monster to whom the daughter of Cepheus was exposed, <lb/>
            washed away the blood there. And black water welling up <lb/>
            from springs I have seen at Astyra which is opposite <lb/>
            Lesbos, the warm baths are in a village called Atarneus, <lb/>
            which was given to the Chians by the Medes as a reward <lb/>
            for giving up to them the suppliant Pactyas the Lydian. <lb/>
            This water is black: and not far from a town across the <lb/>
            river Anio the Romans have some white water : and --when <lb/>
            one bathes in it it is at first cold and makes one shudder, <lb/>
            but if one stays in it a little time it is hot as fire. All <lb/>
            these wonderful springs I have myself seen, and those of <lb/>
            lesser wonder I purposely pass over, for to find water salt <lb/>
            and rough to the palate is no great wonder. But there are <lb/>
            two very remarkable kinds of water: one at Caria in the <lb/>
            plain called White, near a village called Dascylus, warm <lb/>
            and sweeter to drink than milk: and the other Herodo­ <lb/>
            tus describes as a spring of bitter water discharging itself <lb/>
            into the river Hypanis. How then shall we refuse to credit <lb/>
            that warm water is found at Dicæarchia 1 among the Tyr­ <lb/>
            rhenians, so hot that in a few years it melts the lead through <lb/>
            which it flows ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Puteoli is the Latin name. </note></p><pb n="300"/>

          <p>F <lb/>
            ROM Mothone to the promontory of Coryphasium is <lb/>
            about 100 stades, and near it is Pylos, which was founded <lb/>
            by Pylos, the son of Cleson, who brought from Megaris <lb/>
            the Leleges who then occupied Megaris. But he did not <lb/>
            enjoy it long, being turned out by Neleus and the Pelasgians <lb/>
            of Iolcus. And he went away to the neighbouring country <lb/>
            and occupied Pylos in Elis. And king Neleus advanced <lb/>
            Pylos to such renown that Homer in his Iliad calls it <lb/>
            the city of Neleus.1 There is a temple there of Athene <lb/>
            called Coryphasia, and a house called Nestor's house, <lb/>
            in which is a painting of Nestor, and there is his tomb <lb/>
            inside the city, and at a little distance from Pylos is <lb/>
            (they say) the tomb of Thrasymedes. And there is a <lb/>
            cave inside the city, which they say was the stall of the <lb/>
            oxen of Nestor and still earlier of Neleus. The breed of <lb/>
            these oxen would be Thessalian, of the herd of Iphiclus the <lb/>
            father of Protesilaus, for Neleus asked them as wedding <lb/>
            presents from the wooers of his daughter, and it was on <lb/>
            their account that Melampus to gratify his brother Bias <lb/>
            went to Thessalia, and was bound by the herdsmen of <lb/>
            Iphiclus, but eventually by answering the questions which <lb/>
            Iphiclus put obtained these oxen as a reward. The men <lb/>
            of that day were anxious to amass wealth in the shape of <lb/>
            herds of horses and oxen, for not only did Neleus desire <lb/>
            for his own the oxen of Iphiclus, but Eurystheus ordered <lb/>
            Hercules, in consequence of the fame of those oxen in Spain, <lb/>
            to drive off the herd that belonged to Geryon. And Eryx, <lb/>
            who was at that time king in Sicily, was manifestly so <lb/>
            keenly in love with the oxen from Erythea, that when he <lb/>
            wrestled with Hercules he staked his kingdom against <lb/>
            them. And Homer in the Iliad has represented Iphi­ <lb/>
            dimas, the son of Antenor, giving 100 oxen as the first <lb/>
            wedding present to his father in law.2 All this confirms <lb/>
            my theory that the men of those days were especially fond <lb/>
            of oxen. And the oxen of Neleus grazed I imagine mostly <lb/>
            over the borders, for the district of Pylos is mostly sandy, <note type="footnote">1 Iliad, xi. 682. </note><note type="footnote">2 Iliad, xi. 244. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            and unable to afford sufficient pasture. My authority is- <lb/>
            Homer who, whenever he mentions tester, always calls <lb/>
            him the king of sandy Pylos.</p>
          <p>Before the harbour is the island Sphacteria, situated <lb/>
            very much as Rhenea is in reference to the harbour of <lb/>
            Delos. It seems the destiny of both men and places to <lb/>
            be for a while unknown and then to come to renown. <lb/>
            Such was the case with Caphereus, a promontony in Eubcea, <lb/>
            by a storm which came there upon the Greeks returning <lb/>
            with Agamemnon from Ilium. So too with Psyttalea off <lb/>
            Salamis, where we know the Medes perished in great <lb/>
            numbers. So too the reverses of the Lacedaemonians at <lb/>
            Sphacteria made the place world-famed. And the Athenians <lb/>
            erected a brazen statue of Victory in their Acropolis as a <lb/>
            record of their success at Sphacteria.</p>
          <p>And as you go in the direction of Cyparissiæ from Pylos <lb/>
            there is a spring under the city close to the sea. They say <lb/>
            the water welled up in consequence of Dionysus striking <lb/>
            the ground with his thyrsus, and so they call the spring <lb/>
            Dionysus’ spring. There are also at Cyparissiæ temples of <lb/>
            Apollo and Cyparissian Athene. And at the place called <lb/>
            Anion there is a temple of ,,Esculapius, and a statue of <lb/>
            Aulonian Æsculapius. From this place the river Neda, <lb/>
            till it falls into the sea, is the boundary between Messenia <lb/>
            and Elis.</p><pb n="302"/>

            HOSE Greeks, who say that the Peloponnese is divided <lb/>
            into five parts and no more, are obliged to admit that <lb/>
            the people of Elis as well as the Arcadians dwell in the <lb/>
            division of the Arcadians, and that the second division is <lb/>
            Achaia, and that the Dorians have the remaining three. The <lb/>
            indigenous races that inhabit the Peloponnese are Area­ <lb/>
            dians and Achæans. And the Achæans were driven out of <lb/>
            their own land by the Dorians, but did not however evacuate <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, but dispossessed the Ionians that lived in <lb/>
            what was then called Ægialus, but is now called after them <lb/>
            Achaia. The Arcadians on the other hand have always up <lb/>
            to this day remained in Arcadia. But the other parts of <lb/>
            the Peloponnese are peopled by strangers. The latest im­ <lb/>
            portation were the present Corinthians, who were intro­ <lb/>
            duced into the Peloponnese some 217 years ago by the <lb/>
            Roman Emperor. And the Dryopes came into the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese from Mount Parnassus, the Dorians from Mount <lb/>
            (Eta.</p>
          <p>We know that the people of Elis originally came from <lb/>
            Calydon and other parts of Ætolia. And the oldest in­ <lb/>
            formation I have found about them is as follows. The <lb/>
            first king in this land was they say Aethlius, the son <lb/>
            of Zeus by Protogenea the daughter of Deucalion, and the <lb/>
            father of Endymion. The Moon was they say enamoured <lb/>
            of this Endymion, and had by him 50 daughters. But a <lb/>
            more probable account is that Endymion married Asterodia, <lb/>
            others say Chromia the daughter of Itonus the son of Am­ <lb/>
            phictyon, others say Hyperippe the daughter of Areas, and <lb/>
            had three sons, Pæon and Epeus and Ætolus, and one <lb/>
            daughter Eurycyde. Endymion also made his sons contend <lb/>
            in running at Olympia for the kingdom, and Epeus won, <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            so the people over whom he ruled were first called Epeans. <lb/>
            And of his brothers Ætolus they say remained at home, <lb/>
            but Pæon vexed at his loss went as far away as possible, <lb/>
            and the region beyond the river Axius was called <lb/>
            Pæonia after him. As to the death of Endymion different <lb/>
            accounts are given by the Heracleotæ at Miletus and <lb/>
            by the people of Elis, but the latter show the sepulchre <lb/>
            of Endymion, while the former say that he retired to <lb/>
            Mount Latmus, where is his shrine. And Epeus married <lb/>
            Anaxiroe, the daughter of Coronus, by whom he had a <lb/>
            daughter Hyrmina, but no male offspring. And these were <lb/>
            the events of his reign. (Enomaus the son of Alxion, (or <lb/>
            the son of Ares, as poets have sung, which is the prevalent <lb/>
            tradition), being ruler of the country called Pisæa, was de­ <lb/>
            posed from his rule by Pelops the Lydian, who had crossed <lb/>
            over from Asia Minor. And after his death Pelops occu­ <lb/>
            pied Pisæa and Olympia, slicing off from the territory of <lb/>
            Epeus what bordered upon Pisæa. And Pelops (so the <lb/>
            people of Elis say) was the first in the Peloponnese to <lb/>
            build a temple to Hermes and sacrifice to him, thus turn­ <lb/>
            ing away the wrath of the god for the murder of Myrtilus.</p>
          <p>And :tolus, the king after Epeus, had to flee from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, because the sons of Apis indicted him for the <lb/>
            involuntary murder of their father. For Apis the son of <lb/>
            Jason, a native of Pallantium in Arcadia, was killed by <lb/>
            Ætolus’ driving over him in his chariot at the funeral <lb/>
            games in memory of Azan. So Ætolus the son of Endymion <lb/>
            fled to the mainland, to the neighbourhood of the river <lb/>
            Achelous, which was called Ætolia after him. And the <lb/>
            kingdom of the Epeans was reigned over by Eleus, the son <lb/>
            of Eurycyde, the daughter of Endymion and (if we may <lb/>
            believe the tradition) Poseidon. And the people in his <lb/>
            dominions now changed their names from Epeans to <lb/>
            Eleans.</p>
          <p>And Eleus had a son called Augeas. And those who <lb/>
            want to exalt him change his father's name, and say that <lb/>
            he was the son of Helius (the Sun-god). The oxen and <lb/>
            goats of this Augeas were so numerous that most of the <lb/>
            country could not be cultivated for their dung. Her­ <lb/>
            cules therefore, whether for a part of Elis or some other <lb/>
            reward, was persuaded by him to clear the country of this <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            dung. And he effected this by turning the river Menius on <lb/>
            to it. But Augeas, because the work had been effected <lb/>
            by ingenuity rather than toil, refused to give Hercules <lb/>
            his reward, and turned out of doors the eldest of his <lb/>
            sons Phyleus, because he told him he was not acting <lb/>
            with justice to a benefactor. He also made several pre­ <lb/>
            parations to defend himself against Hercules, should he <lb/>
            come into Elis with an army, and entered into an alliance <lb/>
            with Amarynceus and the sons of Actor. Now Amarynceus <lb/>
            had an especial acquaintance with military matters, and his <lb/>
            father Pyttius was a Thessalian by extraction, and had come <lb/>
            from thence to Elis. And to Amarynceus Augeas gave a <lb/>
            share of his power at Elis; and Actor and his sons also, <lb/>
            who were natives of Elis, shared in the administration of <lb/>
            the kingdom. The father of Actor was Phorbas the son <lb/>
            of Lapithus, and his mother was Hyrmina, the daughter <lb/>
            of Epeus, and Actor built and called after her the town of <lb/>
            Hyrmina in Elis.</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            OW in the campaign against Augeas Hercules had no <lb/>
            opportunity to win laurels, for as the sons of Actor <lb/>
            were in their prime for daring and vigour of youth, the <lb/>
            allied forces of Hercules were constantly routed by them, <lb/>
            until the Corinthians announced a truce during the Isth­ <lb/>
            mian games, and the sons of Actor went to see the games, <lb/>
            and Hercules lay in ambush for them and slew them at <lb/>
            Cleonæ. And the perpetrator of the deed being unknown, <lb/>
            Moline the mother of the lads took the greatest pains to <lb/>
            discover their murderer. And when she discovered who it <lb/>
            was, then the people of Elis claimed compensation for the <lb/>
            murder from the Argives, for Hercules dwelt in Argolis at <lb/>
            Tiryns. And as the Argives refused to give up Hercules, <lb/>
            they next begged hard of the Corinthians, that all Argolis <lb/>
            should be scratched from the Isthmian games. But being <lb/>
            unsuccessful in this also, they say Moline put a curse upon <lb/>
            the citizens if they went to the Isthmian games. And these <lb/>
            curses of Moline are observed up to this day, and all the <lb/>
            athletes at Elis make a practice of never going to the <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            Isthmian contest. And there are two different traditions <lb/>
            about this. One of them states that Cypselus the tyrant at <lb/>
            Corinth offered a golden statue to Zens at Olympia, but, <lb/>
            Cypselus dying before his name was inscribed on the votive <lb/>
            offering, the Corinthians asked the people of Elis to allow <lb/>
            them to inscribe publicly the name of Corinth on the votive <lb/>
            offering, and the people of Elis refusing they were angry <lb/>
            with them, and forbade them to contend at the Isthmian <lb/>
            games. But how would the Corinthians have been admitted <lb/>
            at the contests at Olympia, if they had excluded the people <lb/>
            of Elis from the Isthmian games ? But the other tradition <lb/>
            states that Prolaus, a man of much repute among the <lb/>
            people of Elis, and Lysippe his wife had two sons Philan­ <lb/>
            thus and Lampus, and they went to the Isthmian games, <lb/>
            the one intending to compete in the pancratium among'the <lb/>
            boys, the other in wrestling, and before the games came on <lb/>
            they were strangled or killed in some way by their rivals : <lb/>
            and that was why Lysippe imposed her curses on the people <lb/>
            of Elis, if they would not of their own accord cease to <lb/>
            attend the Isthmian games. This tradition too is easily <lb/>
            shewn to be a silly one. For Timon a native of Elis had <lb/>
            victories in the pentathlum in all the other Greek con­ <lb/>
            tests, and there is an effigy of him at Olympia, and some <lb/>
            elegiac verses which enumerate the various crowns that he <lb/>
            carried off as victor, and the reason why he did not partici­ <lb/>
            pate in the Isthmian contest. This is one couplet. " Our <lb/>
            hero was prevented coming to the land of Sisyphus by the <lb/>
            strife that arose in consequence of the sad fate of the sons <lb/>
            of Molione."</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>L <lb/>
            ET this suffice on the matter. To resume, Hercules <lb/>
            afterwards captured and sacked Elis, having got to­ <lb/>
            gether an army of Argives Thebans and Arcadians: and <lb/>
            the people of Elis were assisted by the men of Pylos in Elis <lb/>
            and by the men of Pisa. And the men of Pylos were <lb/>
            punished by Hercules, and he intended marching against <lb/>
            Pisa, but was stopped by the following oracle from Delphi, <lb/>
            " Dear to the Father is Pisa, Pytho has entrusted it to me." <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            This oracle was the salvation of Pisa. And to Phyleus <lb/>
            Hercules gave up Elis and other places, not so much wil­ <lb/>
            lingly as standing in awe of Phyleus, to whom he also <lb/>
            granted the captives and forgave Augeas. And the women <lb/>
            of Elis, as their land was stripped of young men through <lb/>
            the war, are said to have prayed to Athene that they might <lb/>
            conceive directly they married, and their prayer was <lb/>
            granted, and they erected a temple to Athene under the title <lb/>
            of Mother. And both the women and men being exces­ <lb/>
            sively delighted with their union called the place where they <lb/>
            first met Bady (sweet), and also gave the same name in <lb/>
            their national dialect to the river flowing there.</p>
          <p>And when Phyleus, after setting things in order in Elis, <lb/>
            returned to Dulichium, Augeas died being already ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in age, and was succeeded in the kingdom of Elis <lb/>
            by his son Agasthenes, and by Amphimachus, and Thalpius. <lb/>
            For the sons of Actor married two. sisters, the daughters of <lb/>
            Dexamenus who was king at Olenus, and the one had by <lb/>
            Theronice Amphimachus, and the other Eurytus had by <lb/>
            Thereephone Thalpius. Not that Amarynceus or Diores his <lb/>
            son remained all their lives in a private capacity. As we <lb/>
            know from Homer in his catalogue of the men of Elis, <lb/>
            all their fleet was 40 sail, and half of them were under <lb/>
            Amphimachus and Thalpius, and of the remaining half <lb/>
            ten were under Diores the son of Amarynceus, and ten <lb/>
            under Polyxenus the son of Agasthenes. And Polyxenus <lb/>
            coming back safe from Troy had a son Amphimachus, (he <lb/>
            gave his son this name I fancy from his friendship to <lb/>
            Amphimachus the son of Cteatus who perished at Ilium), <lb/>
            and he had a son Eleus, and it was when Eleus was king <lb/>
            at Elis that the Dorian host mustered under the sons <lb/>
            of Aristomachus with a view to return to the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese. This oracle came to the kings, that they must <lb/>
            make a man with three eyes leader of the return. And <lb/>
            as they were in great doubt what the oracle could mean, a <lb/>
            muleteer chanced to pass by, whose mule was blind of one <lb/>
            eye. And Cresphontes conjecturing that the oracle referred <lb/>
            to this man, the Dorians invited him to be their leader. <lb/>
            And he urged them to return to the Peloponnese in ships, <lb/>
            and not force their way through the isthmus with a land <lb/>
            force. This was his advice, and at the same time he piloted <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            the fleet from Naupactus to Molycrium, and they in return <lb/>
            for his services agreed to give him at his request the king­ <lb/>
            dom of Elis. And the man's name was Oxylus, he was the <lb/>
            son of Hæmon, the son of Thoas, who in conjunction with <lb/>
            the sons of Atreus had overturned the kingdom of Priam; <lb/>
            and between Thoas and Ætolus the son of Endymion there <lb/>
            are six generations. And the Heraclidæ were in other <lb/>
            respects kinsmen to the kings in AEtolia, besides the fact <lb/>
            that the sisters of Thoas were mothers by Hercules of <lb/>
            Andræmon and Hyllus. And Oxylus had to flee from <lb/>
            Ætolia in consequence of an accident, in throwing a quoit <lb/>
            (they say) he missed his aim and unintentionally killed his <lb/>
            brother Thermius, or according to some accounts Alcidocus <lb/>
            the son of Scopius.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE is also another tradition about Oxylus, that he <lb/>
            suspected the sons of Aristomachus of an unwillingness <lb/>
            to give him the kingdom of Elis, as it was fertile and well <lb/>
            cultivated everywhere, and this was why he led the Dorians <lb/>
            through Arcadia and not through Elis. And when Oxylus <lb/>
            hastened to take the kingdom of Elis without contention <lb/>
            Dins would not permit him, but challenged him not to a <lb/>
            contention with all their forces, but to a single combat <lb/>
            between two soldiers one from each side. And both agreed <lb/>
            to this. And the men selected for this single combat were <lb/>
            Degmenus a bowman of Elis, and Pyræchmes on the Æto­ <lb/>
            lian side a famous slinger. And as Pyræchmes was victorious <lb/>
            Oxylus got the kingdom, and he allowed the ancient Epeans <lb/>
            to remain there, but introduced Ætolians as colonists with <lb/>
            them, and gave them also a share in the land. And to Dius <lb/>
            he gave various honours, and observed the rights of all the <lb/>
            heroes according to old precedents, and introduced sacrifi­ <lb/>
            cial offerings to Augeas which have continued to our day. <lb/>
            It is said that he also persuaded the men in the villages, <lb/>
            who were at no great distance from the walls, to come into <lb/>
            the city, and thus increased the population of Elis and made <lb/>
            it more powerful in other respects. And an oracle came to <lb/>
            him from Delphi to associate with him as colonist a de­ <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            scendant of Pelops, and he made diligent search, and dis­ <lb/>
            covered Agorius the son of Damasius, the son of Penthilus, <lb/>
            the son of Orestes, and invited him from Helice in Achaia <lb/>
            and with him a few Achæans. And they say Oxylus had a <lb/>
            wife called Pieria, but they record nothing further about <lb/>
            her. And the sons of Oxylus were they say Ætolus and <lb/>
            Laias. And Ætolus dying in his father's lifetime, his <lb/>
            parents buried him and erected a sepulchre to him by the <lb/>
            gate, which leads to Olympia and the temple of Zeus. And <lb/>
            they buried him there in accordance with the oracle, which <lb/>
            said that his dead body was to be neither in nor out of the <lb/>
            city. And annually still the master of the gymnasium <lb/>
            offers victims to Ætolus.</p>
          <p>Oxylus was succeeded in the kingdom by his son Laias. <lb/>
            I could not find that his sons reigned, so I purposely pass <lb/>
            them over, for it has not been my desire in this narrative <lb/>
            to descend to private personages. But some time after­ <lb/>
            wards Iphitus, who was of the same family as Oxylus, and <lb/>
            a contemporary of Lycurgus the Lacedæmonian legislator, <lb/>
            revived the contest at Olympia, and renewed the public <lb/>
            gathering there, and established a truce as long as the games <lb/>
            lasted. Why the meetings at Olympia had been discon­ <lb/>
            tinued I shall narrate when I come to Olympia. And as <lb/>
            Greece at this time was nearly ruined by civil wars and by <lb/>
            the pestilence, Iphitus bethought him to ask of the god at <lb/>
            Delphi a remission from these ills. And they say he was <lb/>
            ordered by the Pythian Priestess to join the people of Elis <lb/>
            in restoring the Olympian games. Iphitus also persuaded <lb/>
            the people of Elis to sacrifice to Hercules, for before this <lb/>
            they had an idea that Hercules was hostile to them. And <lb/>
            the inscription at Olympia says that Iphitus was the son of <lb/>
            Hæmon, but most of the Greeks say he was the son of <lb/>
            Praxonides and not of Hæmon. But the ancient records <lb/>
            of the people of Elis trace him up to a father of the same <lb/>
            name as himself viz. Iphitus.</p>
          <p>The people of Elis took part in the Trojan war, and also <lb/>
            in the battles against the Persians when they invaded <lb/>
            Greece. And to pass over their frequent disputes with the <lb/>
            people of Pisa and the Arcadians in respect to the re-esta­ <lb/>
            blishment of the games at Olympia, they joined the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians not without reluctance in invading Attica, and <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            not long after they fought against the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            having formed an alliance with the Mantineans the Argives <lb/>
            and the Athenians. And on the occasion of Agis making <lb/>
            an incursion into Elis, when Xenias played the traitor, the <lb/>
            people of Elis were victorious at Olympia, and routed the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, and drove them from the precincts of the <lb/>
            temple: and some time afterwards the war came to an end <lb/>
            on the conditions which I have mentioned before in my <lb/>
            account of the Lacedæmonians. And when Philip, the son <lb/>
            of Amyntas, could not keep his hands off Greece, the <lb/>
            people of Elis, worn out with intestine factions, joined the <lb/>
            Macedonians, but not to the point of fighting against the <lb/>
            Greeks at Chæronea. But they participated in the attack <lb/>
            of Philip upon the Lacedæmonians by reason of their <lb/>
            ancient hatred to them. But after the death of Alexander <lb/>
            they joined the Greeks in fighting against Antipater and <lb/>
            the Macedonians.</p>

            ND in process of time Aristotimus, the son of Demare­ <lb/>

            suppliant to the altar of Zeus Soter. These are the chief <lb/>
            wars the people of Elis took part in, just to glance at them <lb/>
            briefly in the present portion of my work.</p>
          <p>Among the wonders of Elis are the flax, which grows here <lb/>
            alone and in no other part of Greece, and also the fact that, <lb/>
            though over the borders mares bear foals to he-asses, it is <lb/>
            never so in Elis. And this phenomenon is they say the <lb/>
            result of a curse. The flax in Elis in respect of thinness <lb/>
            is not inferior to the flax of the Hebrews, but is not as <lb/>
            yellow.</p>
          <p>And as you go from the district of Elis there is a place <lb/>
            by the sea called Samicum, and beyond it on the right is <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            the district called Triphylia, and the city Lepreus in it. <lb/>
            The people of Lepreus think they belong properly to <lb/>
            Arcadia, but it is manifest they were from time imme­ <lb/>
            morial subject to Elis. For the victors at Olympia that <lb/>
            came from Lepreus were pronounced by the herald men of <lb/>
            Elis. And Aristophanes has described Lepreus as a city <lb/>
            in Elis. One way to Lepreus from Samicum is by leaving <lb/>
            the river Aniger on the left, and a second is from Olympia, <lb/>
            and a third from Elis, and the longest of them is only a <lb/>
            day's journey. The city got its name they say from <lb/>
            Lepreus the son of Pyrgeus its founder. There is a tradi­ <lb/>
            tion that Lepreus had an eating contest with Hercules, each <lb/>
            killed an ox at the same time and cooked it for dinner, and <lb/>
            (as he had betted) he was quite a match for Hercules in <lb/>
            eating. But he had the hardihood afterwards to challenge <lb/>
            Hercules to a contest in arms. And they say he was killed <lb/>
            in that contest and buried at Phigalia, however his sepul­ <lb/>
            chre there is not shewn. And I have heard some who <lb/>
            claim that their city was founded by Leprea the daughter <lb/>
            of Pyrgeus. Others say that the inhabitants of this region <lb/>
            were the first lepers, and that the city got its name from <lb/>
            this misfortune of its inhabitants. And the people of <lb/>
            Lepreus say that in their city they once had a temple of <lb/>
            Leucaean Zeus, and the tomb of Lycurgus the son of <lb/>
            Aleus, and also the tomb of Caucon. The last had they <lb/>
            say as a design over it a man with a lyre. But in my time <lb/>
            there is no remarkable tomb there, nor any temple of the <lb/>
            gods except one of Demeter: built of unbaked brick, and <lb/>
            containing no statue. And not far from the city Lepreus <lb/>
            is a spring called Arene: it got this name according to <lb/>
            tradition from the wife of Aphareus.</p>
          <p>And as you return to Samicum, and go through it, the <lb/>
            river Aniger has its outlet to the sea. The flow of this <lb/>
            river is often impeded by violent winds : for they blow the <lb/>
            sand from the shore into it and dam up the flow of the <lb/>
            river. Whenever then this sand becomes soaked with <lb/>
            water, (outside by the sea inside by the river), it, becomes a <lb/>
            very dangerous place for carts and carriages and even for <lb/>
            an active man to ford. This river Aniger rises in the <lb/>
            Arcadian mountain Lapithus, and the water has an un­ <lb/>
            pleasant smell from its source. Before receiving its tributary <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            the Acidas it is too fetid to have any fish whatever, and after <lb/>
            its confluence with the Acidas, though it has fish that come <lb/>
            into its waters from that tributary, they are no longer eat­ <lb/>
            able, which they are when caught in the Acidas. That the <lb/>
            ancient name of the river Acidas was Iardanus I should <lb/>
            not myself have conjectured, but I was so informed by an <lb/>
            Ephesian. The unpleasant smell of the Aniger comes I <lb/>
            believe from the soil through which the river flows, as is <lb/>
            certainly the case with those rivers beyond Ionia, whose <lb/>
            exhalations are deadly to man. Some of the Greeks say <lb/>
            that Chiron, others that Pylenor the Centaur, was wounded <lb/>
            by Hercules, and fled and washed his sore in this river, <lb/>
            and that it was from the Hydra's poison (in which Her­ <lb/>
            cules' arrow had been dipped) that the Aniger got its un­ <lb/>
            pleasant smell. Others refer this condition of the river <lb/>
            to Melampus the son of Amythaon, and to the fact that <lb/>
            the purifications of the daughters of Prcetus were thrown <lb/>
            into it.</p>
          <p>There is at Samicum a cave, not far from the river, called <lb/>
            the cave of the Nymphs of the Aniger. Whoever goes <lb/>
            into it suffering from either black or white leprosy, must <lb/>
            first of all pray to these Nymphs and promise sacrifice to <lb/>
            them, and afterwards wipe clean the diseased parts of his <lb/>
            body. If he next swims across the river he leaves in the <lb/>
            water his foul disease, and comes out of the river sound <lb/>
            and with his skin uniformly clear.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            N the high road, after crossing the Aniger in the direc­ <lb/>
            tion of Olympia, there is at no great distance on the <lb/>
            right an eminence, and on it a town called Samia above <lb/>
            Samicum. This town 1 they say was made into a sort of <lb/>
            offensive fortress against the Arcadians by Polysperchon, an <lb/>
            JEtolian.</p>
          <p>As to the ruins of Arene, none either of the Messenians or <lb/>
            people of Elis could give me a clear account. As their <lb/>
            explanations are different those who like to conjecture are <note type="footnote"> 1 Reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτη̜ τῃ̄ Σαμια</foreign>, (altered into <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σαμιϰψ̃</foreign> ductu literarnm). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            at liberty to do so. The most credible account seems to me <lb/>
            that of those who think that the ancient name of Samicum <lb/>
            earlier than the time of the heroes was Arene. And these <lb/>
            quote the lines in the Iliad. <lb/>
            " There is a river Minyeïus, <lb/>
            That flows into the sea near to Arene." <lb/>
            Iliad, xi. 722, 723. <lb/>
            And these ruins of Arene are very near the Aniger. One <lb/>
            might have doubted about Samicum having been called <lb/>
            Arene, only the Arcadians admit that the ancient name of <lb/>
            the river Aniger was Minyeïus. And one would feel sure <lb/>
            that the river Neda near the sea was the boundary between <lb/>
            Elis and Messenia at the time of the return of the Hera­ <lb/>
            clidae to the Peloponnese.</p>
          <p>And leaving the Aniger, and passing through a district <lb/>
            generally sandy and full of wild pine trees, somewhat back <lb/>
            to the left you will see the ruins of Scillus. Scillus was <lb/>
            one of the towns of Triphylia: and in the war between <lb/>
            the people of Elis and Pisa the people of Scillus openly <lb/>
            allied themselves to the people of Pisa, and in return the <lb/>
            men of Elis dispossessed them from Scillus. But the <lb/>
            Lacedemonians afterwards sliced Scillus from Elis, and <lb/>
            gave it to Xenophon (the son of Gryllus), who was at that <lb/>
            time exiled from Athens. He was banished by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians for joining Cyrus (who hated their democracy) <lb/>
            against the king of the Persians (who was their friend) : <lb/>
            for when Cyrus was at Sardis he gave Lysander, the son of <lb/>
            Aristocritus, and the Lacedæmonians some money for their <lb/>
            fleet. This is why Xenophon was banished, and he lived at <lb/>
            Scillus and built a temple and grove to Ephesian Artemis. <lb/>
            And Scillus affords good hunting of wild animals, as <lb/>
            wild boars and deer. And the river Selinus flows through <lb/>
            the district. And the antiquarians of Elis say that the <lb/>
            people of Elis recovered Scillus, and that Xenophon was <lb/>
            tried in the Olympian council for receiving Scillus from the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, but was acquitted and allowed to con­ <lb/>
            tinue there scot free. And at some little distance from the <lb/>
            temple they show a tomb, and there is an effigy on the <lb/>
            tomb in Pentelican marble, which the people of the place <lb/>
            say is Xenophon. <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            On the road to Olympia from Scillus, before crossing <lb/>
            the Alpheus, is a mountain lofty and precipitous which <lb/>
            is called Typæum. From this mountain it is the custom <lb/>
            to hurl all women of Elis who are detected as competi­ <lb/>
            tors in the Olympian contests, or who merely cross the <lb/>
            Alpheus on forbidden days. Not that any one ever yet was <lb/>
            so detected except Callipatira, whose name according to <lb/>
            some traditions was Pherenice. She after the death of <lb/>
            her husband dressed herself up like an athlete, and brought <lb/>
            her son as a combatant to Olympia. And Pisirodus her <lb/>
            son having been victorious, Callipatira in leaping over the <lb/>
            fence which parted the athletes from the spectators, exposed <lb/>
            her person, and though her sex was detected they let her <lb/>
            go without punishment out of respect to her father and <lb/>
            brothers and son, who had all been victors at Olympia, but <lb/>
            they passed a law that henceforth all athletes should come <lb/>
            to the contests naked.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND when you have got to Olympia immediately you see <lb/>
            the river Alpheus, a full and very pleasant river, and <lb/>
            no less than seven notable rivers are tributaries to it. For <lb/>
            through Megalopolis the Helisson flows into it, and the <lb/>
            Brentheates from the district of Megalopolis, and the Gorty­ <lb/>
            nius near Gortyna where is a temple of AEsculapius, and <lb/>
            from Melæneæ between the districts of Megalopolis and <lb/>
            Heræa the Buphagus, and the Ladon from the district of <lb/>
            the Clitorians, and the river Erymanthus from the moun­ <lb/>
            tain of the same name. All these flow into the Alpheus <lb/>
            from Arcadia, and the Cladeus from Elis also contri­ <lb/>
            butes its stream. And the source of the Alpheus is in <lb/>
            Arcadia and not in Elis. And there are several traditions <lb/>
            about the Alpheus, as that he was a hunter and enamoured <lb/>
            of Arethusa, and that she hunted with him. And as <lb/>
            Arethusa was unwilling to marry him, she crossed over <lb/>
            they say to an island near Syracuse, called Ortygia, and <lb/>
            there became a spring: just as Alpheus in consequence of <lb/>
            his love was changed into a river. This is the tradition <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            about the Alpheus and the Ortygia. As to the river going <lb/>
            under the sea and coming up in another place, there is no <lb/>
            reason why I should discredit that, as I know that the god <lb/>
            at Delphi admitted it, seeing that when he sent Archias the <lb/>
            Corinthian to establish a colony at Syracuse, these were <lb/>
            some of the words he used, " Ortygia lies in the cloudy sea <lb/>
            above Trinacria, where the mouth of the Alpheus mixes and <lb/>
            flows with the springs of the broad Arethusa." From this <lb/>
            circumstance of their union, and not any love passages, I <lb/>
            imagine the traditions about the two rivers originated. <lb/>
            And all the Greeks or Egyptians, that have penetrated into <lb/>
            Ethiopia beyond Syene, and as far as the Ethiopian city of <lb/>
            Meroe, say that the Nile enters into a marsh, and flows <lb/>
            through it as if it were earth, and eventually through lower <lb/>
            Ethiopia into Egypt to Pharos, where it has its outlet at <lb/>
            the sea. And in the land of the Hebrews I know that the <lb/>
            river Jordan flows through the lake of Tiberias, and into <lb/>
            what is called the Dead Sea, by which it is absorbed. The <lb/>
            Dead Sea has properties unlike any other water: living <lb/>
            bodies can float in it without swimming, whereas dead <lb/>
            bodies go to the bottom. And it has no fish, for from their <lb/>
            evident danger they take refuge in water more congenial to <lb/>
            them. And there is a river in Ionia similar to the Alpheus, <lb/>
            its source is in the mountain Mycale, and it flows under the <lb/>
            sea, and comes up again at Branchidæ at the harbour called <lb/>
            Panormus. All this is correctly stated.</p>
          <p>In regard to the Olympian Games those who are in pos­ <lb/>
            session of the most ancient archives of the people of Elis <lb/>
            say that Cronos was the first king of Heaven, and that he <lb/>
            had a temple built to him at Olympia by the mortals who <lb/>
            then lived, who were called the golden age : and that, when <lb/>
            Zeus was born, Rhea entrusted the charge of the boy to the <lb/>
            Idæan Dactyli, who were otherwise called the Curetes: <lb/>
            who afterwards came to Elis from Ida in Crete, and their <lb/>
            names were Hercules, and Epimedes, and Pæonæus, and <lb/>
            Iasius, and Idas. And Hercules the eldest of them chal­ <lb/>
            lenged his brothers in play to run a race together, and they <lb/>
            would crown the victor with a branch of the wild olive: <lb/>
            and there was such abundance of wild olive trees that <lb/>
            they. strewed under them the leaves while they were still <lb/>
            green as beds to sleep on. And they say that the wild olive <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            was introduced to the Greeks by Hercules from the country <lb/>
            of the Hyperboreans, who dwelt north of the wind Boreas. <lb/>
            Olen the Lycian first mentioned in a hymn to Achæia, that <lb/>
            she came to Delos from these Hyperboreans, and when <lb/>
            Melanopus of Cumae composed an ode to Opis and He­ <lb/>
            caerges, he mentioned that they too came from the Hyper­ <lb/>
            boreans to Delos before Achæia. And Aristæus of Procon­ <lb/>
            nesus, who has also mentioned the Hyperboreans, may per­ <lb/>
            haps have heard more of them from the Issedones, to whom <lb/>
            in his poems he says they went. At any rate to Idæan Her­ <lb/>
            cules belongs the glory that he first instituted and gave their <lb/>
            name to the Olympian contests. He appointed them to be <lb/>
            held every fifth year because he and his brothers were five <lb/>
            in number. And some say that it was there that Zeus <lb/>
            contended with Cronos about the sovereignty of Heaven, <lb/>
            others say he appointed these games after his success over <lb/>
            Cronos. Other gods are said to have been victorious, as <lb/>
            Apollo who outran Hermes, who challenged him to the con­ <lb/>
            test, and outboxed Ares. And this is the reason they say <lb/>
            why the Pythian fluteplaying was introduced in the leap­ <lb/>
            ing contest at the pentathlum, because the flute was sacred <lb/>
            to Apollo, and Apollo was on several occasions the victor at <lb/>
            Olympia.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            XD after this they say Clymenus the son of Cardys, (in <lb/>
            the 50th year after Dencalion's flood), a descendant of <lb/>
            Idæan Hercules, came from Crete and established games at <lb/>
            Olympia, and erected an altar to his ancestor Hercules and <lb/>
            to the other Curetes, giving Hercules the title of Assistant. <lb/>
            But Endymion the son of Aethlius deposed Clymenus <lb/>
            from the kingdom, and gave it to his sons as a prize <lb/>
            for the best runner of them at Olympia. And a genera­ <lb/>
            tion after Endymion, Pel ops made the contest to Olym­ <lb/>
            pian Zens more famous than any of his predecessors. <lb/>
            And when the sons of Pelops were scattered from Elis all <lb/>
            over the Peloponnese, Amythaon the son of Cretheus, uncle <lb/>
            of Endymion on the father's side, (for they say Aethlius <lb/>
            was the son of Æolus surnamed Zeus), appointed games at <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            Olympia, and after him Pelias and Neleus in common. So <lb/>
            also did Augeas and Hercules, the son of Amphitryon, after <lb/>
            the capture of Elis. And all that he crowned as victors <lb/>
            were Iolaus, who had borrowed the mares of Hercules for <lb/>
            the race. It was an old custom to be a competitor with <lb/>
            borrowed horses. Homer at least in the funeral games in <lb/>
            honour of Patroclus has represented Menelaus as yoking <lb/>
            together Agamemnon's horse Æthe with one of his own.1 <lb/>
            Iolaus was also Hercules' charioteer. He was the victor in <lb/>
            the chariotrace, and Iasius an Arcadian in the riding race, <lb/>
            and Castor was successful in running, Pollux in boxing. <lb/>
            It is also recorded of Hercules that he was victorious in <lb/>
            wrestling and in the pancratium.</p>
          <p>And after the reign of Oxylus, who also established <lb/>
            games, the Olympian games were suspended till Iphitus. <lb/>
            And when he renewed the games as I have before stated, <lb/>
            there was a general forgetfulness about the ancient games, <lb/>
            but in a short while they got remembered again, and when­ <lb/>
            ever they remembered any little feature of the games, they <lb/>
            added it to the programme. And this proves my state­ <lb/>
            ment. From the time that the Olympian games were <lb/>
            revived continuously, prizes were first instituted for run­ <lb/>
            ning, and Coroebus of Elis was the victor. His statue is at <lb/>
            Olympia, and his grave is on the borders of Elis. And in <lb/>
            the 14th Olympiad afterwards the double course was intro­ <lb/>
            duced : when Hypenus a native of Pisa won the wild <lb/>
            olive crown, and Acanthus was second. And in the 18th <lb/>
            Olympiad they remembered the pentathlum and the wrest­ <lb/>
            ling, in the former Lampis was victor, in the latter Eury­ <lb/>
            batus, both Lacedaemonians. And in the 23rd Olympiad <lb/>
            they ordained prizes for boxing, and Onomastus was victor <lb/>
            from Smyrna (which was at that day reckoned as Ionia). <lb/>
            And in the 25th Olympiad they had a race of fullgrown <lb/>
            horses, and the Theban Pagondas was proclaimed victor in <lb/>
            this race. And in the eighth Olympiad later they intro­ <lb/>
            duced the pancratium and the riding race. The horse of <lb/>
            Crannonian Crauxidas got in first, and the competitors for <lb/>
            the pancratium were beaten by the Syracusan Lygdamis, <lb/>
            who has his sepulchre at the stone quarries of Syracuse. <lb/>
            And I don't know whether Lygdamis was really as big as <note type="footnote"> 1 II. xxiii. 295. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            the Theban Hercules, but that is the tradition at Syracuse. <lb/>
            And the contest of the boys was not a revival of ancient <lb/>
            usage, but the people of Elis instituted it because the idea <lb/>
            pleased them. So prizes were instituted for running and <lb/>
            wrestling among boys in the 307th Olympiad, and Hippos­ <lb/>
            thenes the Lacedæmonian won the wrestling prize, and <lb/>
            Polynices from Elis the running prize. And in the 41st <lb/>
            Olympiad afterwards they invited boxing boys, and the one <lb/>
            who won the prize from all the competitors was Philetas <lb/>
            from Sybaris. And the race in heavy armour was tried <lb/>
            in the 65th Olympiad, as an exercise for war I think: <lb/>
            and of those who ran with their shields Damaretus of <lb/>
            Herseum was the victor. And the race of two fullgrown <lb/>
            horses called a pair was established in the 93rd Olympiad, <lb/>
            and Evagoras of Elis was the victor. And in the 99th <lb/>
            Olympiad they had a fancy to contend with chariots drawn <lb/>
            by colts, and the Lacedæmonian Sybariades had the prize <lb/>
            for this contest. And they afterwards established races of <lb/>
            a pair of colts and for riding a colt, and the victor in the <lb/>
            former was Belistiche, a woman who lived in Macedonia <lb/>
            near the sea, and in the latter Tlepolemus the Lycian in the <lb/>
            131st Olympiad, Belistiche's victory was in the 3rd Olym­ <lb/>
            piad before. And in the 145th Olympiad prizes were <lb/>
            instituted for a pancratium-contest for boys, and Phædimus <lb/>
            an Æolian from the Troad was victor.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND some of the contests at Olympia were put an end <lb/>
            to, the people of Elis having resolved to discontinue <lb/>
            them. For the pentathlum for boys was established in <lb/>
            the 38th Olympiad, but when the Lacedæmonian Eute­ <lb/>
            lidas had won the crown of wild olive, the people of <lb/>
            Elis did not care that their lads should train for the pen­ <lb/>
            tathlum. So it dropped. And the chariot race and the <lb/>
            trotting race, the former established in the 70th Olympiad <lb/>
            and the latter in the 71st Olympiad, were both stopped by <lb/>
            proclamation in the 84th Olympiad. When they were first <lb/>
            instituted Thersius the Thessalian won the prize in the <lb/>
            former, and Pataecus an Achæan from Dyme in the latter. <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            In the trotting race the riders used to jump off towards the <lb/>
            end of the course and run with the horses still holding the <lb/>
            reins, as what are called professional riders do to this day, <lb/>
            only the latter employ stallions and have their own colours. <lb/>
            But the chariot race is not an ancient invention nor a <lb/>
            graceful exhibition, and the people of Elis (who have <lb/>
            always disliked the horse) yoke two mules together instead <lb/>
            of horses.</p>
          <p>The order of the games in our day is to sacrifice vic­ <lb/>
            tims to the god, and then to contend in the pentathlum <lb/>
            and horse-race, according to the programme established in <lb/>
            the 77th Olympiad, for before this horses and men con­ <lb/>
            tended on the same day. And at that period the panera­ <lb/>
            tiasts did not appear till night for they could not compete <lb/>
            sooner, so much time being taken up by the horse-races and <lb/>
            pentathlum. And the Athenian Callias was the victor of <lb/>
            the pancratiasts. But for the future they took care that <lb/>
            neither the pentathlum nor horse-races should stand in the <lb/>
            way of the pancratium. And as regards the umpires of <lb/>
            the games, the original rules and those in vogue in our <lb/>
            day are quite different, for Iphitus was the only umpire, <lb/>
            and after Iphitus the posterity of Oxylus, but in. the <lb/>
            50th Olympiad two men picked by lot out of all Elis were <lb/>
            entrusted with the stewardship of the contests, and this <lb/>
            practice of two umpires continued for a very long time. <lb/>
            But in the 25th Olympiad afterwards 9 general Umpires <lb/>
            were appointed: three for the horse-race, three to watch the <lb/>
            pentathlum, and three to preside over the remaining games. <lb/>
            And in the 2nd Olmpiad after this a tenth Umpire was <lb/>
            appointed. And in the 103rd Olympiad, as the people of <lb/>
            Elis had 12 tribes, a general Umpire was appointed by <lb/>
            each. And when they were hard pressed by the Arcadians <lb/>
            in war, they lost a portion of their territory and all the <lb/>
            villages in this portion, and so they were only 8 tribes in <lb/>
            number in the 104th Olympiad, and had only 8 general <lb/>
            Umpires accordingly. And in the 108th Olympiad they <lb/>
            returned to the number of 10 general Umpires, and that <lb/>
            has continued the number to our day.</p><pb n="319"/>

          <p>M <lb/>
            ANY various wonders may one see, or hear of, in <lb/>
            Greece: but the Eleusinian mysteries and Olympian <lb/>
            games seem to exhibit more than anything else the divine <lb/>
            purpose. And the sacred grove of Zens they have from <lb/>
            old time called Altis, slightly changing the Greek word <lb/>
            for grove 1: it is indeed called Altis also by Pindar, in <lb/>
            the Ode he composed for a victor at Olympia. And the <lb/>
            temple and statue of Zens were built out of the spoils of <lb/>
            Pisa, which the people of Elis razed to the ground, after <lb/>
            quelling the revolt of Pisa and some of the neighbouring <lb/>
            towns that revolted with Pisa. And that the statue of <lb/>
            Zeus was the work of Phidias is shown by the inscription <lb/>
            written at the base of it, <lb/>
            " Phidias the Athenian, the son of Charmides, made me."</p>
          <p>The temple is a Doric building, and outside it is a colon­ <lb/>
            nade. And the temple is built of stone of the district. Its <lb/>
            height up to the gable is 68 feet, its breadth 95 feet, and <lb/>
            its length 230 feet. And its architect was Libon a native <lb/>
            of Elis. And the tiles on the roof are not of baked earth, <lb/>
            but Pentelican marble to imitate tiles. They say such <lb/>
            roofs are the invention of a man of Naxos called Byzes, <lb/>
            who made statues at Naxos with the inscription, <lb/>
            " Euergus of Naxos made me, the son of Byzes, and de­ <lb/>
            scended from Leto, the first who made tiles of stone."</p>
          <p>This Byzes was a contemporary of Alyattes the Lydian <lb/>
            and Astyages (the son of Cyaxaras) the king of Persia. <lb/>
            And there is a golden vase at each end of the roof, and a <lb/>
            golden Victory in the middle of the gable. And under­ <lb/>
            neath the Victory is a golden shield hung up as a votive <lb/>
            offering, with the Gorgon Medusa worked on it. The in­ <lb/>
            scription on the shield states who hung it up, and the <lb/>
            reason why they did so. For this is what it says.</p>
          <p>" This temple's golden shield is a votive offering from <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians at Tanagra and their allies, a gift from <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλσος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            the Argives the Athenians and the Ionians, a tithe offering <lb/>
            for success in war."</p>
          <p>The battle I mentioned in my account of Attica, when <lb/>
            I described the tombs at Athens. And in the same temple <lb/>
            at Olympia, above the zone that runs round the pillars on <lb/>
            the outside, are 21 golden shields, the offering of Mummius <lb/>
            the Roman General, after he had beaten the Achseans and <lb/>
            taken Corinth, and expelled the Dorians from Corinth. And <lb/>
            on the gables in bas relief is the chariot race between Pelops <lb/>
            and CEnomaus, and both chariots in motion. And in the <lb/>
            middle of the gable is a statue of Zeus, and on the right <lb/>
            hand of Zeus is CEnomaus with a helmet on his head, and <lb/>
            beside him his wife Sterope, one of the daughters of Atlas. <lb/>
            And Myrtilus, who was the charioteer of CEnomaus, is seated <lb/>
            behind the four horses. And next to him are two men <lb/>
            whose names are not recorded, but they are doubtless <lb/>
            CEnomaus' grooms, whose duty was to take care of the <lb/>
            horses. And at the end of the gable is a delineation of the <lb/>
            river Cladeus, next to the Alpheus held most in honour of <lb/>
            all the rivers of Elis. And on the left of the statue of <lb/>
            Zeus are Pelops and Hippodamia and the charioteer of <lb/>
            Pelops and the horses, and two men who were Pelops' <lb/>
            grooms. And where the gable tapers fine there is the <lb/>
            Alpheus delineated. And Pelop's charioteer was according <lb/>
            to the tradition of the Trcezenians Sphasrus, but the custo­ <lb/>
            dian at Olympia said that his name was Cilia. The carvings <lb/>
            on the gables in front are by Pæonius of Mende in Thracia, <lb/>
            those behind by Alcamenes, a contemporary of Phidias and <lb/>
            second only to him as statuary. And on the gables is a <lb/>
            representation of the fight between the Lapithæ and the <lb/>
            Centaurs at the marriage of Pirithous. Pirithous is in the <lb/>
            centre, and on one side of him is Eurytion trying to carry <lb/>
            off Pirithous' wife and Cseneus coming to the rescue, and <lb/>
            on the other side Theseus laying about among the Centaurs <lb/>
            with his battle-axe: and one Centaur is. carrying off a <lb/>
            maiden, another a blooming boy. Alcamenes has en­ <lb/>
            graved this story, I imagine, because he learnt from the <lb/>
            lines of Homer that Pirithous was the son of Zeus, and <lb/>
            knew that Theseus was fourth in descent from Pelops. <lb/>
            There are also in bas relief at Olympia most of the Labours <lb/>
            of Hercules. Above the doors of the temple is the hunting <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            of the Erymanthian boar, and Hercules taking the mares of <lb/>
            Diomede the Thracian, and robbing the oxen of Geryon in <lb/>
            the island of Erythea, and supporting the load of Atlas, and <lb/>
            clearing the land of Elis of its dung. And above the <lb/>
            chamber behind the doors he is robbing the Amazon of her <lb/>
            belt, and there is the stag, and the Cretan Minotaur, and the <lb/>
            Stymphalian birds, and the hydra, and the Nemean lion. <lb/>
            And as you enter the brazen doors on the right in front <lb/>
            of the pillar is Iphitus being crowned by his wife Ecechiria, <lb/>
            as the inscription in verse states. And there are pillars <lb/>
            inside the temple, and porticoes above, and an approach by <lb/>
            them to the image of Zeus. There is also a winding stair­ <lb/>
            case to the roof.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE image of the god is in gold and ivory, seated on a <lb/>
            throne. And a crown is on his head imitating the <lb/>
            foliage of the olive tree. In his right hand he holds a <lb/>
            Victory in ivory and gold, with a tiara and crown on his <lb/>
            head: and in his left hand a sceptre adorned with all <lb/>
            manner of precious stones, and the bird seated on the <lb/>
            sceptre is an eagle. The robes and sandals of the god <lb/>
            are also of gold : and on his robes are imitations of flowers, <lb/>
            especially of lilies. And the throne is richly adorned <lb/>
            with gold and precious stones, and with ebony and <lb/>
            ivory. And there are imitations of animals painted on it, <lb/>
            and models worked on it. There are four Victories like <lb/>
            dancers one at each foot of the throne, and two also at <lb/>
            the instep, of each foot: and at each of the front feet <lb/>
            are Theban boys carried off by Sphinxes, and below the <lb/>
            Sphinxes Apollo and Artemis shooting down the children <lb/>
            of Niobe. And between the feet of the throne are four <lb/>
            divisions formed by straight lines drawn from each of the <lb/>
            four feet. In the division nearest the entrance there <lb/>
            are seven models, the eighth has vanished no one knows <lb/>
            where or how. And they are imitations of ancient con­ <lb/>
            tests, for in the days of Phidias the contests for boys were , <lb/>
            not yet established. And the figure with its head muffled <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            up in a scarf is they say Pantarces, who was a native of <lb/>
            Elis and the darling of Phidias. This Pantarces won the <lb/>
            wrestling prize for boys in the 86th Olympiad. And in the <lb/>
            remaining divisions is the band of Hercules fighting against <lb/>
            the Amazons. The number on each side is 29, and Theseus <lb/>
            is on the side of Hercules. And the throne is supported <lb/>
            not only by the four feet, but also by 4 pillars between the <lb/>
            feet. But one cannot get under the throne, as one can at <lb/>
            Amyclæ, and pass inside, for at Olympia there are panels <lb/>
            like walls that keep one off. Of these panels the one oppo­ <lb/>
            site the doors of the temple is painted sky blue only, but <lb/>
            the others contain paintings by Pansenus. Among them <lb/>
            is Atlas bearing up Earth and Heaven, and Hercules stand­ <lb/>
            ing by willing to relieve him of his load, and Theseus <lb/>
            and Pirithous, and Greece, and Salamis with the figure­ <lb/>
            head of a ship in her hand, and the contest of Hercules <lb/>
            with the Nemean lion, and Ajax's unknightly violation <lb/>
            of Cassandra, and Hippodamia the daughter of CEnomaus <lb/>
            with her mother,and Prometheus still chained to the <lb/>
            rock and Hercules gazing at him. For the tradition is <lb/>
            that Hercules slew the eagle that was ever tormenting <lb/>
            Prometheus on Mount Caucasus, and released Prometheus <lb/>
            from his chains. The last paintings are Penthesilea dying <lb/>
            and Achilles supporting her, and two Hesperides carrying <lb/>
            the apples of which they are fabled to have been the <lb/>
            keepers. This Pansenus was the brother of Phidias, and at <lb/>
            Athens in the Painted Stoa he has painted the action at <lb/>
            Marathon. At the top of the throne Phidias has represented <lb/>
            above the head of Zeus the three Graces and three Seasons. <lb/>
            For these too, as we learn from the poets, were daughters <lb/>
            of Zeus. Homer in the Iliad has represented the Seasons <lb/>
            as having the care of Heaven, as a kind of guards of <lb/>
            a royal palace.' And the base under the feet of Zeus, <lb/>
            (what is called in Attic Opavlov), has golden lions engraved <lb/>
            on it, and the battle between Theseus and the Amazons, <lb/>
            the first famous exploit of the Athenians beyond their own <lb/>
            borders. And on the platform that supports the throne <lb/>
            there are various ornaments round Zeus and gilt carving, <lb/>
            the Sun seated in his chariot, and Zeus and Hera, and <lb/>
            near is Grace. Hermes is close to her, and Vesta close to <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, vii. 393-395. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            Hermes. And next to Vesta is Eros receiving Aphrodite <lb/>
            just rising from the sea, who is being crowned by Persua­ <lb/>
            sion. And Apollo and Artemis Athene and Hercules are <lb/>
            standing by, and at the end of the platform Amphitrite and <lb/>
            Poseidon, and Selene apparently urging on her horse. And <lb/>
            some say it is a mule and not a horse that the goddess is <lb/>
            riding upon, and there is a silly tale about this mule.</p>
          <p>I know that the size of the Olympian Zeus both in <lb/>
            height and breadth has been stated, but I cannot bestow <lb/>
            praise on the measurers, for their recorded measurement <lb/>
            comes far short of what anyone would infer looking at <lb/>
            the statue. They make the god also to have testified to <lb/>
            the art of Phidias. For they say when the statue was <lb/>
            finished, Phidias prayed him to signify if the work was to <lb/>
            his mind, and immediately Zeus struck with lightning that <lb/>
            part of the pavement, where in our day there is a brazen <lb/>
            urn with a lid.</p>
          <p>And all the pavement in front of the statue is not of <lb/>
            white but of black stone. And a border of Parian marble <lb/>
            runs round this black stone, as a preservative against <lb/>
            spilled oil. For oil is good for the statue at Olympia, as <lb/>
            it prevents the ivory being harmed by the dampness of the <lb/>
            grove. But in the Acropolis at Athens, in regard to the <lb/>
            statue of Athene called the Maiden, it is not oil but water <lb/>
            that'is advantageously employed to the ivory: for as the <lb/>
            citadel is dry by reason of its great height, the statue being <lb/>
            made of ivory needs to be sprinkled with water freely. <lb/>
            And when I was at Epidaurus, and enquired why they use <lb/>
            neither water nor oil to the statue of Æsculapius, the <lb/>
            sacristans of the temple informed me that the statue of <lb/>
            the god and its throne are over a well.</p><pb n="324"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HOSE who think that the parts of the elephant that <lb/>
            project from the mouth are teeth and not horns, <lb/>
            should consider the case of Celtic elks and Ethiopian bulls. <lb/>
            For male elks have horns on their foreheads, but the female <lb/>
            elk has none whatever. And Ethiopian bulls have horns <lb/>
            growing in their nostrils. Who would therefore think it <lb/>
            very wonderful after these examples that a beast should <lb/>
            have horns growing out of its mouth ? One may also get <lb/>
            further light from the following particulars. Horns in <lb/>
            animals take a certain definite period to grow and grow <lb/>
            more than once: and this is the case with stags and ante­ <lb/>
            lopes as well as elephants. But no animal after full growth <lb/>
            has second sets of teeth. If they are teeth therefore and <lb/>
            not horns that project from elephants' mouths, how could <lb/>
            they grow a second time ? Moreover teeth are not acted <lb/>
            upon by fire, but horns both of oxen and elephants can by <lb/>
            the action of fire be made straight from round, and can in <lb/>
            fact be turned into any shape. [But in hippopotamuses <lb/>
            and boars the lower jaw has projecting teeth : and we do <lb/>
            not see horns growing out of their jaws.] Let anybody be <lb/>
            certain therefore that they are horns in the elephant that <lb/>
            project and grow out from the temples. I don't make this <lb/>
            assertion as mere hearsay, for I have seen the skull of an <lb/>
            elephant in the temple of Artemis in Campania. The <lb/>
            temple I refer to is about 30 stades from Capua, which is <lb/>
            the chief town of Campania. And the elephant is not only <lb/>
            different from other animals in the growth of its horns, but <lb/>
            also in its size and appearance. And the Greeks seem to <lb/>
            me to have shewn great munificence and an absence of par­ <lb/>
            simoniousness in respect to their worship of the gods, see­ <lb/>
            ing that they procured ivory both from India and Ethiopia <lb/>
            for their statues.</p>
          <p>At Olympia also in the temple of Zeus is a woollen veil, <lb/>
            adorned with Assyrian tapestry and dyed with the Phoeni­ <lb/>
            cian purple, the votive offering of Antiochus, who also gave <lb/>
            to the theatre at Athens a golden ægis with the Gorgon's <lb/>
            head on it. This veil is not drawn up to the roof as in the <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            temple of Ephesian Artemis, but let down to the pavement <lb/>
            by ropes. And among the votive offerings in the temple or <lb/>
            ante-chapel is the throne of Arimnestus king of the Tyrrhe­ <lb/>
            nians, (who was the first foreigner that offered a votive <lb/>
            offering to Olympian Zeus,) and the horses of Cynisca in <lb/>
            brass, the memorials of her victory at Olympia. These <lb/>
            horses are rather smaller than life, and are on the right as <lb/>
            you enter the ante-chapel. And there is a tripod covered <lb/>
            with brass, on which before the table was made the crowns <lb/>
            for the victors were laid. And of the statues of the Empe­ <lb/>
            rors, Adrian's in Parian marble was a gift of all the cities <lb/>
            that joined the Achæan league, and Trajan's a gift of all <lb/>
            the Greeks. This last Emperor added the Getæ beyond <lb/>
            Thrace to the Roman Empire, and waged war against <lb/>
            Osroes (the descendant of Arsaces) and the Parthians. <lb/>
            The most famous of all his works are the Baths which <lb/>
            are known as Trajan's Baths, and a large theatre per­ <lb/>
            fectly round, and a building for horse-races two slides <lb/>
            in length, and the forum at Rome well worth seeing for <lb/>
            various beauties and especially its brazen roof. And there <lb/>
            are two statues in the round parts of the building, one of <lb/>
            the Emperor Augustus in amber, the other in ivory is <lb/>
            said to be Nicomedes, the king of Bithynia: from whom the <lb/>
            largest town in Bithynia, that had been previously called <lb/>
            Astacus, got called Nicomedia. It was originally founded <lb/>
            by Zypoetes, a Thracian as one would infer from his name. <lb/>
            And the amber of which they made Augustus' statue, the <lb/>
            native amber which is found in the sands of the Eridanus, <lb/>
            is most rare and precious to man for many purposes. But <lb/>
            the other kind of amber is gold mixed with silver. And in <lb/>
            the temple at Olympia there are several of Kero's votive <lb/>
            offerings, 3 are crowns to imitate the wild olive, the fourth <lb/>
            is an imitation of oak. And there are 25 brazen shields to <lb/>
            be worn by the competitors in the race in armour. And <lb/>
            there are several pillars, and among them one which <lb/>
            has the covenant of the people of Elis and the Athenians <lb/>
            Argives and Mantineans for an alliance for 100 years.</p><pb n="326"/>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND within Altis there is a separate grove to Pelops: <lb/>
            who of the heroes at Olympia is as much held in the <lb/>
            highest honour as Zeus is among the gods. This grove <lb/>
            is on the right of the temple of Zeus towards the North, <lb/>
            just at such a distance from the temple as to admit of <lb/>
            statues and votive offerings between, and it extends from <lb/>
            the middle of the temple to the back, and is surrounded <lb/>
            by a stone wall, and has trees planted in it, and statues. <lb/>
            And the entrance to it is from the west. And it is <lb/>
            said to have been dedicated to Pelops by Hercules the SOIl <lb/>
            of Amphitryon, who was fourth in descent from Pelops. <lb/>
            And he is said to have sacrificed in the trench to Pelops. <lb/>
            And the magistrates for the year sacrifice to him even <lb/>
            now a black ram. The seer has no portion of this sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, the neck of the ram only is usually given to the <lb/>
            person called the wood-cutter. He is one of the temple <lb/>
            servants, and his function is to furnish wood for the sacri­ <lb/>
            fices at a fixed price, both to cities and to any private <lb/>
            individual. And the wood is always of the white poplar <lb/>
            tree. And whatever stranger or native of Elis eats the <lb/>
            flesh of the victim sacrificed to Pelops may not enter the <lb/>
            temple of Zeus. Those who sacrifice to Telephus at Per­ <lb/>
            gamum North of the river Caicus are in a similar predica­ <lb/>
            ment : they may not enter the temple of Æsculapius till <lb/>
            they have had a bath. And the following tradition is still <lb/>
            told about Pelops. During the protracted siege of Ilium <lb/>
            the seers are said to have prophesied that they would <lb/>
            never capture the town till they procured the bows of <lb/>
            Hercules and a bone of Pelops. So they sent it is said for <lb/>
            Philoctetes to the camp, and the shoulder-blade of Pelops <lb/>
            was brought from Pisa. And on the return home of the <lb/>
            Greeks, the ship that had the shoulder-blade of Pelops was <lb/>
            wrecked near Eubcea. And many years after the capture <lb/>
            of Ilium Damarmenus, a fisherman of Eretria, cast his net <lb/>
            into the sea and fished up this bone, and marvelling at the <lb/>
            size of it hid it in the sand. And eventually he went <lb/>
            to Delphi, desiring to know who the bone belonged to, <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            and what he should do with it. And it chanced provi­ <lb/>
            dentially that some persons of Elis, seeking a cure for <lb/>
            the pestilence, were at Delphi at this period. And the <lb/>
            Pythian Priestess told them to preserve the bones of <lb/>
            Pelops, and told Damarmenus to give what he had found to <lb/>
            the people of Elis. And when he had done so the people of <lb/>
            Elis gave him several presents, and made Damarmenus and <lb/>
            his descendants custodians of this bone. But this shoulder- <lb/>
            blade of Pelops has not survived to our day, because in my <lb/>
            opinion it was buried too deep, partly also from time and <lb/>
            the action of the sea. And there are still traces even to <lb/>
            our day of Pelops and Tantalus having brought colonies <lb/>
            to Greece, as the marsh called after Tantalus, and his well- <lb/>
            known grave. And the throne of Pelops is at Sipylus on <lb/>
            the top of the mountain above the temple of the Placianian <lb/>
            mother, and after you have crossed the river Hermus there <lb/>
            is a statue of Aphrodite at Temnus still in existence made <lb/>
            of myrtle: and the tradition is that it was a votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing of Pelops to propitiate the goddess, before begging her <lb/>
            help towards marrying Hippodamia.</p>
          <p>And the altar of Olympian Zeus is about equidistant <lb/>
            from the grove of Pelops and the temple of Hera, and is <lb/>
            situated in front of both. Some say it was erected by Idæan <lb/>
            Hercules, others say by some heroes of the district two <lb/>
            generations after him. It was they say made of the debris <lb/>
            of the thigh bones of the victims sacrificed to Zeus, as <lb/>
            the altar at Pergamum. The Samian Hera has also an <lb/>
            altar made of similar material, an altar not a whit more <lb/>
            handsome than those which in Attica they call extemporary <lb/>
            altars. And the first base of the altar of Olympia, called <lb/>
            the pro-altar, has a circumference of 125 feet, and above <lb/>
            the pro-altar is a circumference of 32 feet. And the whole <lb/>
            height of the altar is 22 feet. It is customary to sacrifice <lb/>
            the victims at the lower part, at the pro-altar: but the <lb/>
            thigh-bones they bring to the highest part of the altar and <lb/>
            burn them there. And stone steps lead up to the pro-altar <lb/>
            on both sides, but up to the high altar there are merely <lb/>
            steps of debris. Maidens may ascend as far as the pro- <lb/>
            altar, and likewise women at the seasons when they are <lb/>
            allowed to be at Olympia, but men alone may ascend to the <lb/>
            high altar. And private individuals, and the people of Elis <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            daily, offer sacrifices to Zens besides at the general Festival. <lb/>
            And annually the seers observe the 19th day of the month <lb/>
            Elaphius by carrying the debris from the Town Hall, and <lb/>
            kneading it with the water of the River Alpheus, and thus <lb/>
            construct their altar. No other water is ever used for this <lb/>
            purpose, and that is why the Alpheus is considered more <lb/>
            friendly to Olympian Zeus than any other river. There <lb/>
            is also at Didymi (a town of the Milesians) an altar made <lb/>
            by Hercules the Theban of victims' blood. So at least <lb/>
            the Milesians say.. But the blood of the victims has never <lb/>
            raised it to any great height even in these latter days.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>B <lb/>
            UT the altar at Olympia has another wonder. Kites, <lb/>
            which are by nature especially birds of prey, never <lb/>
            harm the sacrificers at Olympia. And if on any chance <lb/>
            occasion a kite touch the entrails or flesh of a victim, it is <lb/>
            not considered a good omen for the sacrificer. And they <lb/>
            say when Hercules, the son of Alcmena,. was sacrificing at <lb/>
            Olympia there was a great plague of flies: when, either of <lb/>
            his own idea or at another's suggestion, he sacrificed to Zeus <lb/>
            the Averter of flies, and so they were driven to the other <lb/>
            side of the Alpheus. On similar grounds the natives of <lb/>
            Elis are said to sacrifice -to Zeus the Averter of flies, be­ <lb/>
            cause he drove them from Olympia.</p>
          <p>The wood of the white poplar tree is the only wood that <lb/>
            the people of Elis employ in the sacrifices of Zeus, giving <lb/>
            that tree this especial honour, I imagine, because Hercules <lb/>
            introduced it from Thesprotia into Greece. And I think <lb/>
            there can be little doubt that Hercules himself, when he <lb/>
            sacrificed to Zeus at Olympia, burnt the thighs of the <lb/>
            victims on white poplar wood. Hercules found this tree <lb/>
            growing near the Acheron a river in Thesprotia, and that <lb/>
            is why they say it is called Acherois by Homer. 1 In all <lb/>
            ages rivers have been celebrated for the growth of various <lb/>
            grasses and trees on their banks. Thus the Meander is <note type="footnote"> I Iliad, xiii. 389. xvi. 482. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            most famous for tamarisks, and the Asopus in Bœotia for <lb/>
            immense reeds, and the Persea is found only on the banks <lb/>
            of the Nile. Thus there is no wonder that by the Acheron <lb/>
            first grew the white poplar, and that the wild olive grows <lb/>
            near the Alpheus, and that the black poplar grows on <lb/>
            Celtic soil by the river Eridanus.</p>
          <p>Let us now, as we have made mention of the greatest <lb/>
            altar, enumerate all the altars at Olympia. I will take <lb/>
            them in the order the people of Elis are accustomed to <lb/>
            sacrifice at them. They first sacrifice to Vesta, and next to <lb/>
            Olympian Zeus in the altar inside the temple, thirdly to <lb/>
            Hermes, fourthly to Artemis, fifthly to Athene the Goddess <lb/>
            of Booty, sixthly to Athene Ergane. To this Athene the <lb/>
            descendants of Phidias, (called the cleansers because they <lb/>
            received from the people of Elis the honour of cleansing <lb/>
            the statue of Zeus from anything clinging to it), sacri­ <lb/>
            fice before they commence polishing up the statue. And <lb/>
            there is also another altar of Athene near the temple, <lb/>
            and near it a square altar of Artemis tapering up gradually <lb/>
            at the top. And next to those we have mentioned they <lb/>
            sacrifice to Alpheus and Artemis at one altar : the reason <lb/>
            for this I learnt from one of Pindar's Odes, and I have re­ <lb/>
            corded it in my account of the Letrinæans.1 And at no <lb/>
            great distance from this is another altar to Alpheus, and <lb/>
            near it an altar to Hephæstus, which some of the people <lb/>
            of Elis say is the altar of Martial Zeus, at which Œno­ <lb/>
            maus sacrificed when he proposed the horse-race for the <lb/>
            suitors of his daughter Hippodamia. Next is an altar of <lb/>
            Hercules under the title of Aider, and altars to Her­ <lb/>
            cules' brothers, Epimedes and Idas and Pæonæus and Iasus. <lb/>
            I know that the altar of Idas is called the altar of Ace­ <lb/>
            sidas by some. And at the ruins of the house of CEno­ <lb/>
            maus are two altars, one of Household Zeus, built appa­ <lb/>
            rently by Œnomaus, the other built afterwards I think to <lb/>
            Zeus of the Lightning, when lightning had struck the <lb/>
            house. With reference to the great altar, called the <lb/>
            altar of Olympian Zeus, I have already spoken a little <lb/>
            above. And near it is the altar to Unknown Gods, and <lb/>
            next that of Zeus the Cleanser, and Victory, and next <lb/>
            that of Zeus Chthonius. There are also altars of all the <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book vi. ch. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            gods, and one of Olympian Hera also made of debris, the <lb/>
            votive offering they say of Clymenus. And next to it is a <lb/>
            joint altar to Apollo and Hermes, because the tradition in <lb/>
            Elis is that Hermes was the inventor of the lyre, and <lb/>
            Apollo the inventor of the lute. And next are altars of <lb/>
            Harmony, and Athene, and the Mother of the Gods. And <lb/>
            there are two altars very near the entrance to the race­ <lb/>
            course, one they say of Hermes the Athlete, and the other <lb/>
            of Opportunity. Ion the Chian has I know written an <lb/>
            Hymn to Opportunity, in which he traces his genealogy, <lb/>
            and makes him the youngest son of Zeus. And near <lb/>
            the treasure of the Sicyonians is an altar of Hercules, <lb/>
            either one of the Curetes, or the son of Alcmena, for both <lb/>
            traditions are current. And at what is called Gæum there <lb/>
            is an altar to Earth, this too made of debris: and they say <lb/>
            there was an oracle of Earth earlier still. And at the place <lb/>
            called Stomium there is an altar to Themis. And before <lb/>
            the altar of Zeus, the god of thunder and lightning, is a <lb/>
            fence on all sides, and this altar too is not far from the <lb/>
            great altar formed of debris. Let my reader remember <lb/>
            that I have not enumerated these altars according to the <lb/>
            position of their site, but taken them in a rambling order, <lb/>
            according to the order in which the people of Elis sacrifice <lb/>
            at them. And in the grove of Pelops there is a joint altar <lb/>
            to Dionysus and the Graces, and next one to the Muses, <lb/>
            and one to the Nymphs.</p>

          <p>O <lb/>
            UTSIDE Altis there is a building called the workshop <lb/>
            of Phidias, who used to work here at his statues, <lb/>
            and there is an altar here to all the gods in common. As <lb/>
            you turn back again to Altis you see straight before you the <lb/>
            Hall of Leonidas. It is outside the temple precincts, and <lb/>
            of the various approaches to Altis is the only one used for <lb/>
            processions. It was built by Leonidas, a native of Elis, <lb/>
            and now the Roman governors of Elis make it their head­ <lb/>
            quarters. It is separated by an alley from the approach <lb/>
            used for processions : the people of Elis call alleys what the <lb/>
            Athenians call bylanes. And there is in Altis to the left of <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            the Hall of Leonidas, an altar of Aphrodite, and an altar of <lb/>
            the Seasons next to it. And in the rear of the temple there <lb/>
            is a wild olive tree growing on the right: it is called <lb/>
            the olive beautiful for its crowns, and the victors at <lb/>
            Olympia receive crowns of it. Near this wild olive tree is <lb/>
            a temple of the Nymphs, these too they call beautiful for <lb/>
            their crowns. And inside Altis there is an altar of Arte­ <lb/>
            mis of the Market-place, and on the right of the Hall <lb/>
            of Leonidas is an altar to the goddesses called Mistresses. <lb/>
            Of the goddess whom they call Mistress the portion of <lb/>
            my work about Arcadia will give complete information. <lb/>
            And next is an altar of Zeus of the Market-place, and, in <lb/>
            front of what is called the Seat of Honour, altars of Pythian <lb/>
            Apollo, and Dionysus. This last they say was erected by <lb/>
            private people not so long ago. And as you go to where the <lb/>
            horses start is an altar, with the inscription The Decider of <lb/>
            Fate. This is plainly a title of Zeus who fore-knows all <lb/>
            human events, both what the Fates send, and others. And <lb/>
            near this is an oblong altar of the Fates, and next one of <lb/>
            Hermes, and next two of Zeus Supreme. And at the <lb/>
            middle of the place where the horses start are altars in the <lb/>
            open air to Poseidon the Patron of Horses, and Hera the <lb/>
            Patroness of Horses, and near the pillar an altar of Castor <lb/>
            and Pollux. And at the entrance, near what is called the <lb/>
            Rostrum, is an altar of Ares the Patron of Horses, and an <lb/>
            altar of Athene the Patroness of Horses. And as you enter <lb/>
            the Rostrum there are altars of Good Fortune, and of Pan, <lb/>
            and of Aphrodite. And in the interior of the Rostrum <lb/>
            the Nymphs called Acmenæ have an altar. And as you <lb/>
            return from the Portico which the people of Elis call <lb/>
            Agnaptus' from the name of the Architect, there is on the <lb/>
            right an altar of Artemis. And as you enter Altis again <lb/>
            by the road used for processions there are altars behind the <lb/>
            chapel of Hera of the river Cladeus and of Artemis, and <lb/>
            next to them one of Apollo, and a fourth of Artemis Coccoca, <lb/>
            and a fifth of Apollo Thermius. Thermius I conjecture at <lb/>
            Elis will be the same word as Tliesmius (Law-loving) in <lb/>
            Attic. But why Artemis was called Coccoca I could not <lb/>
            ascertain. There is a building in front of what they call the <lb/>
            Priest's dwelling, and in the corner of it is an altar of Pan. <lb/>
            And the Town Hall of the people of Elis is within Altis, <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            near the outlet beyond the gymnasium, where the athletes <lb/>
            have their races and wrestling-matches. And in front of <lb/>
            the doors of the Town Hall is an altar of Artemis of the <lb/>
            Market Place. And in the Town Hall itself as you pass <lb/>
            into a room where there is a hearth, there is an altar of <lb/>
            Pan on the right of the entrance. And the hearth itself is <lb/>
            made of debris, and there is a fire on it burning continually <lb/>
            day and night. From this hearth as I have already stated <lb/>
            they remove the debris to the altar of Olympian Zeus, <lb/>
            and the height of that altar is largely due to contributions <lb/>
            from this hearth.</p>
          <p>&gt; And once in every month the people of Elis sacrifice at <lb/>
            the altars which I have mentioned. And they sacrifice in <lb/>
            a certain primitive fashion ; for they burn frankincense on <lb/>
            the altars and cakes kneaded with honey. And they deco­ <lb/>
            rate the altars with olive branches, and pour out libations <lb/>
            of wine. But they do not offer libations of wine to the <lb/>
            Nymphs, or the Mistresses, or at the joint altar of all the <lb/>
            gods. And the sacrifices are conducted by the priest, who <lb/>
            has office for one month, and by the seers, the libation­ <lb/>
            offerers, the Interpreter of Antiquities, the flute-player, and <lb/>
            the wood-cutter. But the words that they use in the <lb/>
            Town Hall, and the Hymns which they sing, I am not <lb/>
            allowed to introduce into my account. And they pour <lb/>
            libations not only to Greek gods, but to the god of Libya, <lb/>
            and to Hera of Ammon, and to Parammon (a title of <lb/>
            Hermes). It is manifest also that from time immemorial <lb/>
            they have consulted the oracle at Libya, and there are altars <lb/>
            in the temple of Ammon, votive offerings of the people of <lb/>
            Elis: and there are inscribed on them the questions of the <lb/>
            people of Elis, and the answers returned by the god, and <lb/>
            the names of those who went to Ammon from Elis. All <lb/>
            this is in the temple of Ammon. The people of Elis also <lb/>
            pour libations to heroes, and the wives of heroes, who are <lb/>
            honoured in Elis or Ætolia. And the Hymns sung in the <lb/>
            Town Hall are in the Doric dialect, but by whom composed <lb/>
            they do not tell us. The people of Elis also have a banquet­ <lb/>
            ing-hall, (inside the Town-Hall, opposite the room where the <lb/>
            hearth is,) where they entertain the victors at Olympia.</p><pb n="333"/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            EXT ought I to describe the temple of Hera, and all <lb/>
            that is worth narrating in it. The people of Elis have <lb/>
            a tradition that the people of Scillus in Triphylia built <lb/>
            it about 8 years after Oxylus became king at Elis. Its <lb/>
            architecture is Doric, there are pillars all round it, one <lb/>
            pillar in a chamber at the back of the temple is of oak. <lb/>
            And the length of the temple is 63 feet. The archi­ <lb/>
            tect's name is not recorded. And every fifth year 16 <lb/>
            matrons weave a shawl for Hera, and the same number <lb/>
            preside over her games. And the contest is a race for <lb/>
            maidens of various ages : in the first race are the youngest, <lb/>
            and next those slightly older, and last of all the eldest. <lb/>
            And they all run with their hair down their back, a short <lb/>
            tunic below the knee, and their right shoulder bare to the <lb/>
            breast. They use in this contest the regular race-course at <lb/>
            Olympia, but make it a sixth part of a stade shorter. And <lb/>
            the victors receive crowns of olive, and part of the heifer <lb/>
            sacrificed to Hera: and paintings of them are made for <lb/>
            Hera. And the 16 matrons who preside over the games <lb/>
            have as many handmaids. They trace this contest of the <lb/>
            maidens back to ancient times, saying that Hippodamia in <lb/>
            gratitude to Hera for her marriage with Pelops selected <lb/>
            16 matrons, and in concert with them inaugurated these <lb/>
            games to Hera. And they record that Chloris (with the <lb/>
            exception of one brother the only surviving child of <lb/>
            Amphion) was the victor. And what I learnt about the <lb/>
            children of Niobe I have narrated in my account about <lb/>
            Argos. About these 16 matrons they have also the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing tradition. They say that Damophon, the tyrant <lb/>
            at Pisa, did many grievous injuries to the people of Elis, <lb/>
            and on his death, as the people of Pisa had not publicly <lb/>
            sanctioned his ill deeds, the people of Elis were willing <lb/>
            to annul their charges against them, so 16 of the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal cities in Elis at that day selected each one matron <lb/>
            of age and merit and good name to arbitrate on any <lb/>
            claims. And the cities from which they selected matrons <lb/>
            were Elis and 15 others, and thus their differences with <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            the people of Pisa were arranged. And afterwards the <lb/>
            same 16 were told off to make all the arrangements <lb/>
            about the Hera Festival, and to weave the shawl for Hera. <lb/>
            These 16 matrons also have two dances, one they call <lb/>
            Physcoa's dance, and the other's Hippodamia's. Physcoa <lb/>
            the tradition goes was from hollow Elis, and lived in the <lb/>
            parish they call Orthia, and was mother by Dionysus of a <lb/>
            boy called Narcæus, who, when he grew up, warred with <lb/>
            the neighbouring tribes and came to great power, and built <lb/>
            a temple of Athene Narcæa: and Dionysus was they say <lb/>
            first worshipped by Narcæus and Physcoa. Physcoa had <lb/>
            other honours besides the dance called after her name. <lb/>
            The number of matrons is still kept up by the people of <lb/>
            Elis, but they are somewhat differently chosen. For as <lb/>
            they are divided into 8 tribes they select two matrons from <lb/>
            each. And the functions of these 16 matrons and the <lb/>
            Umpires of Elis are never commenced till after the sacri­ <lb/>
            fice of a pig and lustration with water. And the lustration <lb/>
            takes place at the fountain Piera, which is situated in the <lb/>
            plain between Olympia and Elis. All these things are as <lb/>
            T have described them.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND in Hera's temple there is a statue of Zeus, and also <lb/>
            A one of Hera seated on a throne, and standing by is a <lb/>
            person with a beard and helmet on his head. And the <lb/>
            workmanship is very simple. And next them the Æginetan <lb/>
            Smilis has delineated the Seasons sitting on thrones. And <lb/>
            near them is a statue of Themis as the mother of the <lb/>
            Seasons, the design of Doryclidas, a Lacedaemonian by <lb/>
            race, and the pupil of Dipœnus and Scyllis. And there <lb/>
            are five Hesperides by Theocles, a Lacedaemonian also, <lb/>
            the son of Hegylus, who is also said to have been a <lb/>
            pupil of Scyllis and Dipcenus. And Athene with a helmet <lb/>
            and spear and shield is they say by the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            Medon, who was the brother of Doryclidas, and learnt <lb/>
            his art also from Scyllis and Dipœnus. And Proserpine <lb/>
            and Demeter sit, Apollo and Artemis stand, opposite <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            one another. And there are statues also of Leto and For­ <lb/>
            tune and Dionysus, and a winged Victory, who designed <lb/>
            them I cannot tell, but they appear to me- very antique. <lb/>
            What I have enumerated are in ivory and gold: but in <lb/>
            later times there were other statues placed in the temple <lb/>
            of Hera, as a stone Hermes carrying Dionysus as a babe, <lb/>
            by Praxiteles; and Aphrodite in brass, by Cleon of Sicyon, <lb/>
            whose master was Antiphanes, of the school of Periclytus <lb/>
            the pupil of the Argive Polycletus. And before Aphrodite <lb/>
            there is a little golden boy seated, by the Carthaginian <lb/>
            Boethus, which was brought here from what is called <lb/>
            Philip's house, as well as some statues in gold and ivory, <lb/>
            as Eurydice the wife of Philip, and Olympias.</p>
          <p>* * The chest is of cedar and has figures on it, some in <lb/>
            ivory, some in gold, some carved on the cedar. In this chest <lb/>
            Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth, was hid by his mother at <lb/>
            his birth, as the Bacchidæ were eager to find him. On <lb/>
            account of his safety his descendants, called the Cypselidæ, <lb/>
            made the chest a votive offering at Olympia, and the <lb/>
            Corinthians of that day called chests cypselce: that is the <lb/>
            origin of the name Cypselus given to the boy, so they <lb/>
            say. And on the chest there are inscriptions in large <lb/>
            letters in an old handwriting: some of this writing is <lb/>
            straight, other parts are written in what the Greeks call ox­ <lb/>
            fashion. That is, when one line is finished the next begins <lb/>
            where that left off and runs backward, and so on like the <lb/>
            double course on the race ground. There are also inscrip­ <lb/>
            tions on the chest that are very puzzling and difficult to <lb/>
            make out. And if you begin to examine the chest all over, <lb/>
            beginning at the lower part, you will see first Œnomaus <lb/>
            pursuing Pelops and Hippodamia. Each of them have a <lb/>
            pair of horses but those of Pelops have wings. And next <lb/>
            is the house of Amphiaraus, and some old woman is carry­ <lb/>
            ing Amphilochus the baby, and in front of the house is <lb/>
            Eriphyle with a necklace, and near her her daughters Eury­ <lb/>
            dice and Demonassa, and the little boy Alcmaeon naked. <lb/>
            Asius in his poems has also represented Alcmena as the <lb/>
            daughter of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle. And Baton, the <lb/>
            charioteer of Amphiaraus, has the reins in one hand and a <lb/>
            lance in the other. And one of Amphiarus' feet is in the <lb/>
            chariot, and his sword is drawn, and he is turned towards <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            Eriphyle, and in his rage can scarce refrain from rushing at <lb/>
            her. And next to Amphiaraus' house are the games in <lb/>
            memory of Pelias, and the spectators are looking on the <lb/>
            contests. There is Hercules sitting on a seat, and his wife <lb/>
            behind him, but her name is not given, she is piping with <lb/>
            Phrygian and not Greek pipes. And there are Pisus the son <lb/>
            of Perieres and Asterion the son of Cometes driving a pair <lb/>
            of horses, the latter is said to have sailed in the Argo, and <lb/>
            Pollux and Admetus, and Euphemus the son of Poseidon <lb/>
            (according to the tale of the poets), and the companion of <lb/>
            Jason on his voyage to Colchi, he also was victorious in the <lb/>
            pair-horse-race. And there are Admetus and Mopsus, the <lb/>
            son of Ampyx, both famous boxers. And in the midst is a <lb/>
            man playing on the flute, as in our day they are still wont <lb/>
            to do in the leaping contest in the pentathlum. And Jason <lb/>
            and Peleus are wrestling, they are very evenly matched. <lb/>
            And there is Eurybotas throwing his quoit, a man famous <lb/>
            as a quoit-player whoever he was. And there are Melanion <lb/>
            and Neotheus and Phalareus and Argeus and Iphiclus ready <lb/>
            for the race : and Acastus is holding out the crown to the <lb/>
            victor, who was Iphiclus, the father of Protesilaus who <lb/>
            fought at Ilium. There are also some tripods as prizes for <lb/>
            the winners, and there are the daughters of Pelias, of whom <lb/>
            the name of Alcestis only is inscribed. Iolaus too, who <lb/>
            voluntarily shared in Hercules' Labours, is there, just <lb/>
            having come in first in the chariot-race. And this is the <lb/>
            last of the games in memory of Pelias. And there is <lb/>
            Athene standing by Hercules who is shooting the hydra, the <lb/>
            monster that infested the river Amymone. And because <lb/>
            Hercules was well-known, from his great size as well as the <lb/>
            nature of the contest, his name is not written underneath. <lb/>
            And there is Phineus the Thracian, and the sons of Boreas <lb/>
            driving away the Harpies from him.</p><pb n="337"/>

          <p>O <lb/>
            N the second side of the chest, on the left, to take <lb/>
            them in their order, is a woman supporting with her <lb/>
            right hand a white child sleeping, and with her left a black <lb/>
            child like the sleeping child, but with both its feet twisted. <lb/>
            The inscriptions shew, what one would have inferred with­ <lb/>
            out any inscriptions, that they are Death and Sleep with <lb/>
            their nurse Night. And there is a comely woman dragging <lb/>
            along an ugly one, with one hand holding her fast, and with <lb/>
            the other beating her with a rod, this is Justice punishing <lb/>
            Injustice. And there are two women pounding with pestles <lb/>
            into mortars, apparently compounding drugs, but there is <lb/>
            no inscription in reference to them. But about the man <lb/>
            and woman following him there are two hexameter lines <lb/>
            as follows, " Idas is leading away from the temple by no <lb/>
            means against her will Marpessa of the beautiful ancles, <lb/>
            whom Apollo snatched away for himself."</p>
          <p>And there is a man clad in a tunic, with a cup in his <lb/>
            right hand and in his left a necklace, and Alcmena is seizing <lb/>
            them. According to the Greek tradition, Zeus assumed <lb/>
            the appearance of Amphitryon, and so made Alcmena wel­ <lb/>
            come him as her husband. And there is Menelaus with a <lb/>
            breastplate and sword pursuing Helen to kill her, plainly <lb/>
            during the sack of Ilium. And there is Jason on the right <lb/>
            hand of Medea, who is sitting on a throne, and Aphrodite <lb/>
            is standing by her. And the inscription relative to <lb/>
            them is, <lb/>
            " Jason is wooing Medea, Aphrodite is encouraging them." <lb/>
            The Muses are also represented singing and Apollo lead­ <lb/>
            ing off, and the inscription is as follows, <lb/>
            " Here is the king, the son of Leto, far-darting Apollo, <lb/>
            And round him the Muses, a graceful band, whom he leads in <lb/>
            the songs." <lb/>
            And Atlas is bearing up Heaven and Earth (according to <lb/>
            the legend) on his shoulders, and in his hands are the apples <lb/>
            of the Hesperides. And who the man is with a sword ad­ <lb/>
            vancing to Atlas is nowhere written, but it is evident to all <lb/>
            that it is Hercules. This is all the inscription, <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>

            " Atlas here is bearing up Heaven, he will neglect the <lb/>
            apples.”</p>
          <p>There is also Ares in full armour leading off Aphrodite. <lb/>
            The inscription under him is Enyalius. There too is the <lb/>
            maiden Thetis, and Peleus is laying hold of her, and from <lb/>
            Thetis' hand a serpent is about to dart at Peleus. And <lb/>
            there are the sisters of Medusa with wings pursuing the <lb/>
            fleeing Perseus. His name only is given.</p>
          <p>The third side of the chest is devoted to military views. <lb/>
            Most of the soldiers to be seen are infantry, but there are <lb/>
            also some cavalry in two-horse war-chariots. And some <lb/>
            of the soldiers are you can see engaging, while others are <lb/>
            recognizing and greeting one another. The antiquarians <lb/>
            have two explanations of this, the one party say that it is <lb/>
            the Ætolians with Oxylus and the ancient people of Elis, <lb/>
            and that they are fraternizing and exhibiting friendliness <lb/>
            to one another in remembrance of their ancient consan­ <lb/>
            guinity, the other party say that it is the people of Pylos and <lb/>
            the Arcadians fighting near the town of Pheia and the river <lb/>
            Iardanus. No one would have prima facie expected that <lb/>
            the ancestor of Cypselus, being a Corinthian and in pos­ <lb/>
            session of the chest, would have purposely passed over <lb/>
            Corinthian history, and artistically portrayed on the chest <lb/>
            foreign and even immaterial events. So the following is the <lb/>
            view I am inclined to form. Cypselus and his ancestors <lb/>
            came originally from Gonussa beyond Sicyon, and were de­ <lb/>
            scended from Melas the son of Antasus. And Aletes would <lb/>
            not receive Melas and his army into the city, as I have <lb/>
            stated before in my account of Corinth, thus disobeying the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi, until at last, as Melas paid every attention <lb/>
            to him, and whenever he was rejected returned again with <lb/>
            entreaty, Aletes admitted him but not with a good grace. <lb/>
            One would conjecture therefore that the forces of Melas are <lb/>
            here portrayed.</p><pb n="339"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND on the 4th side of the chest on the left Boreas is <lb/>
            • carrying off Orithyia, and he has serpents' tails in­ <lb/>
            stead of feet. And there is the fight between Hercules and <lb/>
            Geryon, who was three men in one. And there is Theseus <lb/>
            with a lyre, and near him Ariadne with a garland. And <lb/>
            Achilles and Memnon are fighting and their mothers are <lb/>
            standing by. And there is Melanion, and Atalanta by him <lb/>
            with a fawn. And Strife, looking most hateful, stands <lb/>
            by the duel (after challenge) between Ajax and Hector. <lb/>
            A very similar Strife has been depicted in the temple of <lb/>
            Ephesian Artemis by the Samian Calliphon, who painted <lb/>
            the battle at the ships of the Greeks. There are also on <lb/>
            the chest figures of Castor and Pollux, one of them with­ <lb/>
            out a beard, and Helen between them. And Æthra, the <lb/>
            daughter of Pittheus, in a dark dress is prostrate on the <lb/>
            ground at the feet of Helen. And the inscription is an <lb/>
            Hexameter line and one word more.</p>
          <p>“Castor and Pollux ran off with Helen, and dragged <lb/>
            AEthra from Athens."</p>
          <p>These are the very words. And Iphidamas the scn of <lb/>
            Agenor is lying on the ground, and Coon is fighting with <lb/>
            Agamemnon over his dead body. And Fear with the head <lb/>
            of a lion is on Agamemnon's shield. And this is the in­ <lb/>
            scription over the corpse of Iphidamas, <lb/>
            “This is Iphidamas, Coon bestrides him in the fight."</p>
          <p>And on Agamemnon's shield, <lb/>
            "Here is what mortals call Fear, Agamemnon has got <lb/>
            him."</p>
          <p>And Hermes is bringing to Paris, the son of Priam, the <lb/>
            goddesses to the choice of beauty, and the inscription <lb/>
            here is, <lb/>
            “Here is Hermes showing to Paris the dainty sight of <lb/>
            Hera and Athene and Aphrodite in all their beauty."</p>
          <p>And Artemis—I know not why-has wings on her <lb/>
            shoulders, and in her right hand she has a leopard, in her <lb/>
            left a lion. And there is Ajax dragging Cassandra from <lb/>
            the statue of Athene, and the inscription is, <lb/>
            " Locrian Ajax is dragging Cassandra from Athene.”</p><pb n="340"/>
            
          <p>And there are the sons of Œdipus, Polynices has fallen <lb/>
            on his knees, and Eteocles is pressing him hard. And <lb/>
            behind Polynices stands a monster with teeth as sharp as <lb/>
            a wild beast's, and with crooked claws. And the inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion says that it is Doom, and that Polynices was carried <lb/>
            off by Fate, and that Eteocles' end was just. And there <lb/>
            too is bearded Dionysus lying down in a cave, clad in <lb/>
            a long garment, with a golden bowl in his hand: and <lb/>
            there are clusters of vine round him, and apples, and <lb/>
            pomegranates.</p>
          <p>The topmost side of the chest, for there are five in all, <lb/>
            has no inscription, but one can easily conjecture what the <lb/>
            representations are. In a cave there is a woman sleeping <lb/>
            with a man upon a bed, and we infer that they are Odys­ <lb/>
            seus and Circe from the number of handmaids in front <lb/>
            of the cave, and from their tasks. For the women are four <lb/>
            in number, and they are engaged just as Homer has <lb/>
            represented. And there is a Centaur, not with all his feet <lb/>
            horses' feet, for his forefeet are those of a man. And <lb/>
            there are pair-horse chariots and women seated on the <lb/>
            chariots: and the horses have gold wings, and a man is <lb/>
            giving arms to one of the women. This is conjectured to <lb/>
            refer to the death of Patroclus. For it is the Nereids on <lb/>
            the chariots, and Thetis who is receiving arms from He­ <lb/>
            phæstus. For he who is giving the arms is lame, and <lb/>
            behind is a servant with smith's tongs. And the tradition <lb/>
            about Chiron the Centaur is that, though he had left this <lb/>
            world and been received into heaven, he returned to earth <lb/>
            to comfort Achilles. And there are two maidens in a <lb/>
            carriage drawn by mules, one is driving and the other has <lb/>
            a veil on her head, they are thought to be Nausicaa, the <lb/>
            daughter of Alcinous, and her attendant driving to the <lb/>
            wash. And the man shooting at the Centaurs and killing <lb/>
            some of them is manifestly Hercules, for this was one of <lb/>
            his great feats.</p>
          <p>Who it was that constructed this chest it is quite im­ <lb/>
            possible to conjecture : the inscriptions on it might have <lb/>
            been composed by anybody, but suspicion points to Eumelus <lb/>
            the Corinthian, both on other grounds, and because of the <lb/>
            Processional Hymn which he composed in reference to <lb/>
            Delos.</p><pb n="341"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE are also here besides the chest several votive <lb/>
            offerings, as a bed of no great size adorned with much <lb/>
            ivory, and the quoit of Iphitus, and the table on which the <lb/>
            crowns for the victors are deposited. The bed was they <lb/>
            say a plaything of Hippodamia: and the quoit of Iphitus <lb/>
            has written on it the armistice between the people of Elis <lb/>
            and the Olympians not straight down it, but all round the <lb/>
            quoit: and the table is of ivory and gold, the design of <lb/>
            Colotes, who was they say a native of Heraclea. And <lb/>
            those who take interest in artificers say that he was a Parian <lb/>
            and the pupil of Pasiteles, who was himself the pupil of <lb/>
            . . . .1 There too are statues of Hera, and Zeus, and the <lb/>
            Mother of the Gods, and Hermes, and Apollo, and Artemis. <lb/>
            And behind is a representation of the games. On one side <lb/>
            is AEsculapius and Hygiea, one of the daughters of Æscula­ <lb/>
            pius, and Ares and Contest by him, and on another is Pluto <lb/>
            and Dionysus and Proserpine and some Nymphs, one of <lb/>
            them with a ball. And Pluto has his key, with which (they <lb/>
            say) what is called Hades is locked, and then no one can <lb/>
            return from it.</p>
          <p>An account which I received from Aristarchus, the In­ <lb/>
            terpreter of Antiquities at Olympia, I must not omit. He <lb/>
            said that in his youth, when the people of Elis restored the <lb/>
            roof of the temple of Hera, the body of a dead man in heavy <lb/>
            armour, who had been badly wounded, was found between <lb/>
            the sham roof and the roof on which the tiles lay. This <lb/>
            man was a combatant in the battle fought inside Altis be­ <lb/>
            tween the Lacedæmonians and the people of Elis. For the <lb/>
            people of Elis climbed up to the temples of the gods, and <lb/>
            all high buildings alike, for the purpose of defence. This <lb/>
            man therefore probably got up into that place, in a fainting <lb/>
            condition from his wounds, and, on his death, neither the <lb/>
            heat of summer nor the chills of winter would be likely to <lb/>
            injure his dead body, as he lay stowed away and covered up. <lb/>
            And Aristarchus added, that they carried the corpse outside <lb/>
            Altis and buried it armour and all. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hiatus hie deflendus. </note></p><pb n="342"/>
            
          <p>And the pillar, which the people of Elis call the pillar of <lb/>
            CEnomaus, is as yon go from the great altar to the temple <lb/>
            of Zens, and there are 4 pillars on the left and a roof over <lb/>
            them. These pillars support a wooden one worn out by <lb/>
            age, and only held together by iron clamps. This pillar <lb/>
            was once, according to tradition in the house of CEnomaus: <lb/>
            and when the god struck the house with lightning, the fire <lb/>
            consumed all the house but this one pillar. And a brazen <lb/>
            tablet contains some Elegiac lines referring to this.</p>
          <p>" I am the only vestige, stranger, of a famous house, I <lb/>
            once was a pillar in CEnomaus' house, but now near Zeus I <lb/>
            am in iron clamps in honour: the destructive fire has not <lb/>
            consumed me."</p>
          <p>Another curious thing happened on the spot in my time. <lb/>
            A senator of Rome won the prize at Olympia, and wishing <lb/>
            some record of his victory to survive in the shape of a <lb/>
            brazen statue with an inscription, dug for a foundation, <lb/>
            close to this pillar of CEnomaus, and the diggers found <lb/>
            fragments of arms and bridles and bits. These I myself <lb/>
            saw dug up.</p>
          <p>The temple, which is large in size and of Doric architec­ <lb/>
            ture, they call to this day the Temple of the Mother, pre­ <lb/>
            serving its ancient name, though there is no statue in it of <lb/>
            the Mother of the Gods, but only some statues of Roman <lb/>
            Emperors. It is inside Altis, and there is a round building <lb/>
            called Philip's House, on the top of which is a brazen poppy <lb/>
            as a clamp for the beams. This building is on the left hand <lb/>
            as you go to the Town Hall, anq is built of baked brick, <lb/>
            and there are some pillars round it.- It was built for <lb/>
            Philip after the fatal defeat of the Greeks at Chæronea. <lb/>
            And there are statues there of Philip, and Alexander, and <lb/>
            Amyntas the father of Philip. They are by Leochares in <lb/>
            ivory and gold, like the statues of Olympias and Eurydice.</p><pb n="343"/>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND now I shall proceed to the account of the statues <lb/>
            and votive offerings, which I do not care to mix up <lb/>
            together. In the Acropolis at Athens all the statues and <lb/>
            everything else equally are votive offerings: but at Altis <lb/>
            the votive offerings are in honour of the deity, but the <lb/>
            statues of the prizemen are merely a memorial of the con­ <lb/>
            tests. Of them I shall speak hereafter: I shall now take <lb/>
            the most remarkable votive offerings in order.</p>
          <p>As you go to the race-course from the Temple of the <lb/>
            Mother there is on the left at the end of the mountain <lb/>
            Cronius a basement of stone, near the mountain, and some <lb/>
            steps to it. On this basement there are some brazen <lb/>
            statues of Zeus, made with the money from a fine im­ <lb/>
            posed on some athletes who had behaved shamefully at the <lb/>
            games. These statues are called in the national dialect <lb/>
            Zanes. They were six in number at first and were put up <lb/>
            in the 98th Olympiad. For Eupolus the Thessalian bribed <lb/>
            his rivals in boxing to let him win the prize, Agenor'from <lb/>
            Arcadia, and Prytanis from Cyzicus, and Phormio from <lb/>
            Halicarnassus, who was the champion in the preceding <lb/>
            Olympiad. This was the first foul play they say at the <lb/>
            boxing matches, and Eupolus and those who had been <lb/>
            bribed by him were fined by the people of Elis. Two of <lb/>
            the statues are by Cleon of Sicyon, the modeller of the <lb/>
            remaining four we do not know. And all these statues, <lb/>
            but the third and fourth, have elegiac lines on them. The <lb/>
            first says that not with money, but swiftness of foot and <lb/>
            bodily vigour, ought one to win prizes at Olympia. And <lb/>
            the second says that that statue is raised in honour to the <lb/>
            deity, and from piety on the part of the people of Elis, <lb/>
            and to inspire fear in such athletes as do not play fair. As <lb/>
            to the fifth and sixth, the gist of the inscription on one is <lb/>
            a panegyric of the people of Elis, and not least for their <lb/>
            punishment of the cheating boxers, and on the other a <lb/>
            didactic precept to all the Greeks that nobody is to bribe <lb/>
            to win the prize at Olympia.</p><pb n="344"/>
            
          <p>And subsequently to Eupolus they say that the Athenian <lb/>
            Callippus, when contending for the pentathlum, bribed his <lb/>
            antagonists in the 112th Olympiad. And when he and his <lb/>
            antagonists were fined by the people of Elis, the Athenians <lb/>
            sent Hyperides to beg the people of Elis to remit the <lb/>
            fine. And when the people of Elis refused this favour, the <lb/>
            Athenians treated them with much hauteur, not paying the <lb/>
            money and keeping away from Olympia, till the god at <lb/>
            Delphi told them he would no longer give them any oracular <lb/>
            responses, till they paid the fine to the people of Elis. And <lb/>
            when they paid, six more statues were made for Zeus, with <lb/>
            elegiac verses on them no less severe than those about the <lb/>
            fine of Eupolus. And the purport of these verses on the <lb/>
            first statue is that the statues are erected in accordance <lb/>
            with the oracular direction of the god, who honoured the <lb/>
            decision the people of Elis had come to about the competi­ <lb/>
            tors for the pentathlum. And the second and third like­ <lb/>
            wise praise the people of Elis for their conduct in the same <lb/>
            matter. And the fourth desires to point out that the con­ <lb/>
            test at Olympia is one of merit and not of money. And <lb/>
            the inscriptions on the fifth and sixth shew, one why the <lb/>
            statues were made, and the other that the oracle came to <lb/>
            the Athenians from Delphi.</p>
          <p>And next to those I have enumerated are two statues, <lb/>
            made from a fine imposed on some wrestlers, whose names <lb/>
            are unknown both to me and the Antiquarians of Elis. <lb/>
            There are some inscriptions also on these statues, the first <lb/>
            is that the Rhodians paid a fine to Olympian Zeus for the <lb/>
            cheating of their wrestler. And the second is that the <lb/>
            statue was made out of fines imposed on those who wrestled <lb/>
            for bribes. And the Antiquarians of Elis say that the <lb/>
            other statues in connection with athletes were erected in <lb/>
            the 178th Olympiad, when Eudelus was bribed by the <lb/>
            Rhodian Philostratus. I find a discrepancy between this <lb/>
            account and the public records of the people of Elis as <lb/>
            respects the victors at Olympia. For in these records <lb/>
            they say that Straton of Alexandria in the 178th Olympiad <lb/>
            won on the same day the prize both in the pancratium <lb/>
            and in the wrestling. Alexandria, at the mouth of the <lb/>
            Nile near Canopus, was built by Alexander, the son of <lb/>
            Philip, on the site of a former town of no great size called <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            Rhacotis. In the generation before Straton 3, and 3 after <lb/>
            his day, are famous for having received the crown of wild <lb/>
            olive both for the pancratium and the wrestling. The <lb/>
            first was Caprus a native of Elis, and next of the Greeks <lb/>
            beyond the Ægean the Rhodian Aristomenes, and next <lb/>
            Protophanes of the Magnetes at Lethceus. And after <lb/>
            Straton Marion, also from Alexandria, and Aristeas from <lb/>
            Stratonice (both the region and city were anciently called <lb/>
            Chrysaoris), and last Nicostratus from the Cilicians by the <lb/>
            sea, though he had little in common with the Cilicians but <lb/>
            nominally. For, when he was quite a child, he was kid­ <lb/>
            napped from Prymnessus a town in Phrygia by robbers, <lb/>
            who took him to ,Egeas and sold him to the highest bidder. <lb/>
            He was of no obscure family, and some time afterwards <lb/>
            his purchaser dreamed that a lion's whelp lay under the <lb/>
            truckle bed on which he used to sleep. When Nicostratus <lb/>
            grew to man's estate he had several other victories at <lb/>
            Olympia in the pancratium and in wrestling.</p>
          <p>And among others that were fined by the people of Elis <lb/>
            afterwards was a boxer from Alexandria in the 218th <lb/>
            Olympiad. His name was Apollonius, his surname Rhantes, <lb/>
            for it is customary among the people of Alexandria to <lb/>
            have surnames. He was the first Egyptian condemned <lb/>
            by the people of Elis for neither giving nor receiving <lb/>
            money, but for the impropriety of coming too late, for <lb/>
            which he was not allowed to take part in the games. As <lb/>
            to his excuse that he was detained by contrary winds in the <lb/>
            Cyclades, Heraclides, also an Alexandrian, proved it to be <lb/>
            a falsehood : and said he was really too late because he had <lb/>
            been collecting money from the games in Ionia. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly Apollonius and all others not present at the appointed <lb/>
            time for the boxing matches were not. allowed by the people <lb/>
            of Elis to take part in the games, but to Heraclides they <lb/>
            gave a crown without a contest. Thereupon Apollonius, <lb/>
            who had on his boxer's cæstus, rushed at Heraclides, and <lb/>
            attacked him fiercely, just as he had received his crown of <lb/>
            wild olive, and he fled for refuge to the Umpires. This <lb/>
            hotheadedness was severely punished. There are also two <lb/>
            statues made in our own times. For in the 226th Olympiad <lb/>
            they detected some boxers bribing to get the prize. The <lb/>
            money of their fine went to make two statues of Zeus, one <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            on the left of the entrance to the coarse, and the other <lb/>
            on the right. Didas was the name of one of these <lb/>
            boxers, and the other, who gave the bribe, was Sara­ <lb/>
            pammon, both were from the same district, the latest one <lb/>
            formed in Egypt, called Arsinoites. It is wonderful indeed <lb/>
            that from any quarter people should have been found to <lb/>
            despise the god at Olympia, and to receive or give bribes in <lb/>
            connection with the games, but still more wonderful that <lb/>
            any of the people of Elis should have ventured to act in <lb/>
            that manner. But it is said that Damonicus, a native of <lb/>
            Elis, acted so in the 192nd Olympiad. For when Polyctor <lb/>
            (the son of Damonicus) and Sosander (the son of Sosander) <lb/>
            a native of Smyrna had descended to the arena for the <lb/>
            wrestling match, Damonicus, being very anxious that his <lb/>
            son should have the victory, bribed the younger Sosander. <lb/>
            And when the circumstances got known, the Umpires fined <lb/>
            the parents, turning their vengeance on them because they <lb/>
            were really the guilty parties. Statues were made with <lb/>
            this money too: one in the gymnasium at Elis, the other <lb/>
            in Altis, in front of what is called the Painted Portico, <lb/>
            because there were in ancient times paintings on the walls. <lb/>
            This Portico is called by some the Portico of Echo, because <lb/>
            in it a word is re-echoed 7 times, sometimes even more <lb/>
            frequently.</p>
          <p>And they record that the pancratiast Serapion, a native <lb/>
            of Alexandria, in the 201st Olympiad was so afraid of <lb/>
            those who were to compete with him, that the day before <lb/>
            the contest he absconded. He is the only Egyptian, or in­ <lb/>
            deed member of any nationality, that was ever fined for <lb/>
            cowardice in the games.</p>

          <p>s <lb/>
            UCH are the statues made out of fines as far as I <lb/>
            could ascertain. There are also other statues of Zeus, <lb/>
            some erected publicly, some privately, There is also an <lb/>
            altar in Altis near the entrance to the course. On this altar <lb/>
            the people of Elis do not sacrifice to any of the gods, but <lb/>
            the trumpeters and heralds stand here when they proclaim <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            the games. On the brazen base of this altar is a statue to <lb/>
            Zens, six cubits in height, with a thunderbolt in each hand, <lb/>
            the votive offering of the people of Cynaetha. And the <lb/>
            young Zens with a necklace round his neck is the votive <lb/>
            offering of Cleolas of Phlius.</p>
          <p>And near what is called the Hippodamium there is a semi­ <lb/>
            circular basement of stone, and statues on it of Zeus and <lb/>
            Thetis and Aurora supplicating Zeus for their children. <lb/>
            These are in the midst of the basement. And at each ex­ <lb/>
            tremitv of the basement stand Achilles and Memnon in the <lb/>
            attitude of antagonists. Similarly opposite to one another <lb/>
            stand a Greek and barbarian, Odysseus opposite Helenus, <lb/>
            for these are selected as most remarkable for wisdom in <lb/>
            either army, and Paris is opposite Menelaus from their old <lb/>
            hostility, and Æneas opposite Diomede, and Deiphobus <lb/>
            opposite Ajax the son of Telamon. These are all by <lb/>
            Lycius the son of Myron, and are votive offerings of the <lb/>
            people of Apollonia near the Ionian sea. And there are <lb/>
            some elegiac lines in ancient characters under the feet of <lb/>
            Zeus.</p>
          <p>“We are votive offerings from Apollonia, which long­ <lb/>
            haired Phoebus built near the Ionian sea. Those who <lb/>
            seized the borders of Abantis offered this spoil F<foreign xml:lang="grc">̄</foreign>rom <lb/>
            Thronium."</p>
          <p>Now the region called Abantis and the town in it <lb/>
            called Thronium were in Thesprotia near the mountains <lb/>
            Ctraunia. For when the Greek ships were dispersed on <lb/>
            their return from Ilium, the Locrians from Thronium near <lb/>
            the river Boagrins and the Abantes from Eubœa in 8 ships <lb/>
            put in to shore near the mountains Ceraunia. And there <lb/>
            they dwelt and built the town of Thronium, and by common <lb/>
            consent called all the district they lived in Abantis, and <lb/>
            were afterwards beaten in war and expelled by their neigh­ <lb/>
            bours of Apollonia. And Apollonia was a colony from <lb/>
            Corcyra, and the Corinthians had a share in the spoil.</p>
          <p>And as you go on a little further there is a Zeus look­ <lb/>
            ing east, with an eagle in one hand and a thunderbolt in <lb/>
            the other. And he has a crown on his head composed <lb/>
            of lilies. This statue is the votive offering of the people of <lb/>
            Metapontum, and the design of the Æginetan Aristonous. <lb/>
            But who Aristonous learnt his craft from we do not know, <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            nor the period in which he flourished. The Phliasians also <lb/>
            erected as votive offerings statues of Zeus and Asopus' <lb/>
            daughters and Asopus himself. And this is the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the statues. Nemea comes first of the sisters, and <lb/>
            next her is Zeus laying hold of Ægina. And next Ægina is <lb/>
            Harpina, who according to the tradition of the Phliasians <lb/>
            and the people of Elis had an amour with Ares, and bare to <lb/>
            him CEnomaus, the king of the district of Pisa. And next <lb/>
            to her are Corcyra and Thebe, and Asopus comes last. <lb/>
            The tradition about Corcyra is that she had an amour <lb/>
            with Poseidon, and a similar legend about Thebe and Zeus <lb/>
            is sung by Pindar.</p>
          <p>The men of Leontini erected a statue to Zeus privately <lb/>
            and not publicly. The height of it is 7 cubits, and Zeus has <lb/>
            in his hands an eagle and javelin according to the descrip­ <lb/>
            tions of the poets. And it was erected by Hippagoras and <lb/>
            Phrynon and Ænesidemus, not I think the Ænesidemus <lb/>
            who was tyrant at Leontini. I</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND as you pass on to the entrance to the council <lb/>
            chamber there is a statue of Zeus without an inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion, (and another as you turn to the North). This is <lb/>
            towards the East, and was erected by the Greeks who <lb/>
            fought at Platæa against Mardonius and the Medes. On <lb/>
            the right of the basement are inscribed the states that took <lb/>
            part in the action, the Lacedaemonians first, and next the <lb/>
            Athenians, third the Corinthians, fourth the Sicyonians, <lb/>
            fifth the Æginetans, then the Megarians and Epidaurians, <lb/>
            of the Arcadians the men of Tegea and Orchomenus, and <lb/>
            in addition to these the inhabitants of Phlius Trœzen and <lb/>
            Hermion, and in Argolis the men of Tiryns, and of the <lb/>
            Boeotians only the people of Plataea, and of the Argives <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Mycenæ, and the islanders from Ceos <lb/>
            and Melos, and the Ambraciotes from Thesprotia, and <lb/>
            the Tenii and people of Lepreum, the latter only from <lb/>
            Triphylia, but the Tenii not only from the Ægean and the <lb/>
            Cyclades but also from Naxos and Cythnus, and the men <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            of Styra from Eubcea, and next to them the people of Elis <lb/>
            and Potidæa and Anactorium, and lastly the people of <lb/>
            Chalcis near the Euripus. Of these cities the following were <lb/>
            unpeopled in my day. Mycenæ and Tiryns were rased to <lb/>
            the ground by the Argives after the Persian war. And the <lb/>
            Ambraciotes and men of Anactorium, who were colonists <lb/>
            from Corinth, were induced by the Roman Emperor Augus­ <lb/>
            tus to form the colony of Nicopolis near Actium. And the <lb/>
            people of Potidæa were twice ejected from their country, by <lb/>
            Philip, the son of Amyntas, and earlier still by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, and though subsequently they were restored by <lb/>
            Cassander, yet the name of their city was changed to <lb/>
            Cassandrea in honour of their new founder. And the <lb/>
            statue at Olympia, that was a votive offering of the <lb/>
            Greeks, was by Anaxagoras the Æginetan, though those <lb/>
            who have compiled a history of sculptors have omitted to <lb/>
            mention him.</p>
          <p>There is also in front of this statue of Zeus a brazen <lb/>
            pillar, on which are inscribed the conditions of peace for <lb/>
            30 years between the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, <lb/>
            which was made by the Athenians after their second reduc­ <lb/>
            tion of Eubcea, in the 3rd year of that Olympiad in which <lb/>
            Crison of Himera won the prize. And this was one of <lb/>
            the conditions specified, that the city of the Argives <lb/>
            should have no share in this peace between the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and Lacedæmonians, but that privately the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians and Argives if they chose might be friendly to <lb/>
            one another. This is plainly stated in the conditions. <lb/>
            And there is another statue of Zeus near the chariot of <lb/>
            Cleosthenes, (about which I shall speak later), the votive <lb/>
            offering of the Megarians, and the design of the brothers <lb/>
            Phylacus and Onaethus and their sons : I cannot tell their <lb/>
            period or country, or from whom they learned their craft. <lb/>
            And near the chariot of Gelon there is an old statue of <lb/>
            Zeus with a sceptre, the votive offering they say of the <lb/>
            people of Hybla. There are two Hyblas in Sicily, one <lb/>
            called Gereatis, and the other to this day called Hybla <lb/>
            Major. Both are in the neighbourhood of Catana, Hybla <lb/>
            Major is quite deserted, but Gereatis is still inhabited, <lb/>
            and has a temple to the Hyblfean goddess who is wor­ <lb/>
            shipped in Sicily. And I think it was from there that the <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            statue of Zeus came to Olympia. For Philistus the son <lb/>
            of Archomenides records that they were the best inter­ <lb/>
            preters of portents and dreams, and the most noted for <lb/>
            piety of all the barbarians in Sicily. And near the votive <lb/>
            offering of the people of Hybla is a brazen pedestal and a <lb/>
            Zeus upon it, eighteen feet high I conjecture. And who <lb/>
            offered it to the god, and whose design it is, is stated in <lb/>
            the following elegiac lines :</p>
          <p>" The people of Cleitor erected this votive offering to the <lb/>
            god, with the tithe collected from many cities taken by <lb/>
            storm by them. And the artificers were the Laconian <lb/>
            brothers Aristo and Telestas."</p>
          <p>I do not think these Laconians could have been men well <lb/>
            known in Greece, for else the people of Elis would have <lb/>
            had something to say about them, and still more the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians as they were their citizens.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND near the altar of Zeus Lacetas and Poseidon Lacetas <lb/>
            A there is a Zeus on a brazen basement, the gift of the <lb/>
            Corinthian people, and the design of Musus, whoever Musus <lb/>
            was. And as you go from the council chamber to the great <lb/>
            temple there is on the left a statue of Zeus, crowned with <lb/>
            flowers, and in his right hand a thunderbolt. This was the <lb/>
            design of Ascarus a Theban, who was the pupil of the <lb/>
            Sicyonian, * * and it was a votive offering of the people of <lb/>
            Thessaly. But if the people of Thessaly offered it as a <lb/>
            votive offering from spoil taken in a war with the Phocians, <lb/>
            it could not be what is called the Sacred War, for that <lb/>
            was fought before the Modes and the great king came <lb/>
            to Greece. And not far from this is a Zeus, which (as <lb/>
            the inscription on it shews) was a votive offering of Psophi­ <lb/>
            dius after success in war. And on the right of the temple <lb/>
            of great Zeus towards the east is a statue of Zeus 12 feet <lb/>
            high, the votive offering it is said of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            after they had fought the second time with the Messenians <lb/>
            who had revolted. And there is an elegiac couplet inscribed <lb/>
            on it.</p><pb n="351"/>
            
          <p>" Receive Olympian Zeus, Cronus' great son, this noble <lb/>
            statue from the Lacedæmonians with propitious mind."</p>
          <p>Of the Romans we know of none, either plebeian or <lb/>
            patrician, earlier than Mummius who put up a votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing in any Greek temple, but he out of the spoils of <lb/>
            Achaia erected a brazen Zeus at Olympia. It stands on <lb/>
            the left of the votive offering of the Lacedæmonians, on the <lb/>
            first pillar of the temple. But the largest of the brazen <lb/>
            statues of Zeus is in Altis, and was a votive offering of the <lb/>
            people of Elis after the war with the Arcadians, it is 27 <lb/>
            feet high. And near the temple of Pelops there is a small <lb/>
            statue of Zeus upon a not very lofty pillar, with one <lb/>
            of his hands extended. And opposite it are some votive <lb/>
            offerings in a row, statues of Zeus and Ganymede. The <lb/>
            account of Homer is that Ganymede was carried off by the <lb/>
            gods to be cupbearer to Zeus, and that Tros his father had <lb/>
            some horses given him for his son. And this was a votive <lb/>
            offering of Gnathis the Thessalian, and the work of Aris­ <lb/>
            tocles the pupil and son of Cleœtas. And there is another <lb/>
            Zeus without a beard, among the votive offerings of Micy­ <lb/>
            thus. Who this Micythus was, whence he came, and <lb/>
            why be offered these votive offerings at Olympia, will be <lb/>
            described by me hereafter. And if you go on a little from <lb/>
            the statue I have mentioned, there is straight before you <lb/>
            another statue of Zeus without a beard, the votive offering <lb/>
            of the Elaitæ, who came down from the plain of Caicus to <lb/>
            the sea, and were the first settlers in Æolis. Near this is <lb/>
            another statue of Zeus, and the inscription on it is that <lb/>
            the people of the Chersonese in Cnidos erected it as a <lb/>
            votive offering after a triumph over their enemies. They <lb/>
            erected also on one side of Zeus Pelops, and on the other <lb/>
            the river Alpheus. And most of the city of the Cnidians is <lb/>
            built on the continent of Caria, where they performed most <lb/>
            of their most memorable deeds, and the Chersonese is an <lb/>
            island lying near the continent, and connected with it by <lb/>
            a bridge: and the votive offerings to Olympian Zeus were <lb/>
            dedicated by the dwellers there, just as the Ephesians <lb/>
            dwelling at Coressus could say that their votive offering <lb/>
            was a gift of the Ephesians generally. There is also near <lb/>
            the wall of Altis a statue of Zeus facing west without an <lb/>
            inscription: but tradition says it was erected by Mum­ <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            mius from the spoils of his war with Achaia. But the <lb/>
            statue of Zeus in the Council-Chamber is of all the statues <lb/>
            of Zeus most calculated to frighten wicked men, his Title <lb/>
            is Zeus the God of Oaths, and he has a thunderbolt in <lb/>
            each hand. At this statue it is customary for the athletes, <lb/>
            their fathers and brothers, and also their trainers, to swear <lb/>
            over the entrails of a boar that they will not cheat at the <lb/>
            Olympian games. And the athletes make this further oath <lb/>
            that they have carefully trained for the space of 10 months. <lb/>
            And the umpires also, either of boys or the colts that com­ <lb/>
            pete in the races, swear to give their decisions honestly and <lb/>
            without bribes, and not to reveal the reasons for their <lb/>
            selection of the winners. What they do with the boar <lb/>
            afterwards I forgot to ask, but it was the custom among <lb/>
            all the more ancient sacrificers, that the victim over whom <lb/>
            oaths were taken should not be eaten by anybody: as <lb/>
            Homer's evidence very plainly shews, for the boar on whose <lb/>
            entrails Agamemnon swore solemnly that Briseis was a <lb/>
            maid as far as he was concerned, was thrown into the sea <lb/>
            • by the herald. Witness the following lines : <lb/>
            " He spoke, and cut the crackling off the boar <lb/>
            With ruthless knife. And quick Talthybius <lb/>
            Whirled it away into the surging sea, <lb/>
            As food for fishes.” 1 <lb/>
            Such was the ancient use. And before the feet of Zeus <lb/>
            the God of Oaths there is a brazen tablet, on which some <lb/>
            elegiac lines are inscribed, that are meant to inspire fear in <lb/>
            perjurers. <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, xix. 266-268. </note></p><pb n="353"/>

          <p>s <lb/>
            ITCH are the statues of Zeus inside Altis, all of which I <lb/>
            have enumerated. For the statue near the great temple <lb/>
            offered by a Corinthian, is not an offering of the old Corin­ <lb/>
            thians but of those who rebuilt the city in Cæsar’s time, and <lb/>
            is Alexander the son of Philip to imitate Zeus. I shall <lb/>
            also enumerate all the other statues which are not repre­ <lb/>
            sentations of Zeus. And the effigies not erected in honour <lb/>
            of the deity, but in honour of men, I shall describe in my <lb/>
            account of the athletes.</p>
          <p>The Messenians at the Sicilian Strait, who used to send <lb/>
            to Rhegium, according to old custom, a chorus of 35 boys <lb/>
            and a choir-master and a piper to the national feast, had on <lb/>
            one occasion a terrible disaster, none of those that were <lb/>
            sent were saved, but the vessel that had the boys on board <lb/>
            perished boys and all in the depths of the sea. For the <lb/>
            sea at this strait is a most stormy one : for winds lash it to <lb/>
            fury, and two seas meet, the Sicilian and the Tyrrhenian: <lb/>
            and even when the winds are calm, there is a tremendous <lb/>
            swell in the Strait from the strong ebb and flow. And so <lb/>
            many sea-monsters are there, that the air is tainted with <lb/>
            their scent, so that the shipwrecked mariner has no chance <lb/>
            of getting safe to shore. And if Odysseus had chanced to <lb/>
            be wrecked here, one can never believe that he could have <lb/>
            swum off safe to Italy. But a kind Providence in every <lb/>
            conjuncture brings about some alleviation. And the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians sorrowing at the loss of the boys, besides other <lb/>
            things to honour their memory, placed at Olympia brazen <lb/>
            effigies of them and their choir-master and piper. The old <lb/>
            inscription shewed that these effigies were votive offerings <lb/>
            of the Messenians at the Sicilian Strait: and subsequently. <lb/>
            Hippias, who was called by the Greeks the Wise, wrote <lb/>
            some elegiac lines on them. The effigies were by Gallon <lb/>
            of Elis.</p>
          <p>And there is near the Promontory Pachynus, that faces <lb/>
            towards Libya and the South, the town of Motye, peopled <lb/>
            by Libyans and Phoenicians. And the people of Agrigen­ <lb/>
            tum were at war with the people of Motye, and out of the <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            spoil and booty they took from them erected as votive <lb/>
            offerings at Olympia some boys in brass, extending their <lb/>
            right hands like people praying to the deity. They are <lb/>
            on the wall at Altis. I conjectured they were by Calamis, <lb/>
            and tradition states the same. The races that inhabit <lb/>
            Sicily are the Sicani and the Siceli and the Phrygians, <lb/>
            some of whom crossed over from Italy, and others came <lb/>
            from the river Scamander and the Troad. And the Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicians and Libyans sailed to the island with a joint fleet, <lb/>
            as a colony of the Carthaginians. Such are the barbarous <lb/>
            races in Sicily. And of Greeks the Dorians and Ionians <lb/>
            dwell in it, and a few Phocians and Athenians.</p>
          <p>And on the same wall are votive offerings from Agri­ <lb/>
            gentum, two statues of boyish Hercules naked. The Her­ <lb/>
            cules shooting at the Nemean lion is the votive offering <lb/>
            of the Tarentine Hippotion, and the design of the Mænalian <lb/>
            Nicodamus. The other is the votive offering of the Men­ <lb/>
            dæan Anaxippus, and was brought here by the people of <lb/>
            Elis: it used to be at the end of the road leading from <lb/>
            Elis to Olympia, called the Sacred Road. There are also <lb/>
            statues, from the Achaean race in common, of those who, <lb/>
            when Hector challenged a single Greek to single combat, <lb/>
            drew lots who it should be. They are near the great temple <lb/>
            armed with spears and shields. And right opposite on <lb/>
            another basement is Nestor throwing the lots into his <lb/>
            helmet. And the number of those that drew lots for the <lb/>
            single combat with Hector are 8, for the 9th, which was <lb/>
            Odysseus, they say Nero carried to Rome, and of the 8 Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon only has his name inscribed, and it is written from <lb/>
            right to left. And the one with the device of a cock on <lb/>
            the shield is Idomeneus, the descendant of Minos and Pasi­ <lb/>
            phae the daughter of the Sun. And the cock they say is <lb/>
            sacred to the Sun and heralds his approach. The inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion on the basement is, <lb/>
            " To Zeus the Achæans, descendants of the divine Pelops <lb/>
            the son of Tantalus, erected these votive offerings."</p>
          <p>And the name of the artificer is inscribed on the shield <lb/>
            of Idomeneus, <lb/>
            " This and many besides are the work of the skilful <lb/>
            Onatas, the son of Micon of Ægina.”</p>
          <p>And not far from the votive offering of the Achæans is <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            Hercules fighting with an Amazon on horseback for her <lb/>
            belt. This is the votive offering of Evagoras of Zancle, <lb/>
            and the design of Aristocles of Cydonia. Aristocles may <lb/>
            be reckoned amongst the very ancient sculptors, for though <lb/>
            one cannot state his period exactly, it is manifest that he <lb/>
            lived before the change from the old name Zancle to its <lb/>
            present one of Messene.</p>
          <p>The Thasians also (who were Phoenicians originally, and <lb/>
            sailed from Tyre and other parts of Phoenice to Europe <lb/>
            with Thasus the son of Agenor), made a votive offering of <lb/>
            Hercules at Olympia, the base as well as the statue of <lb/>
            brass. The height of the statue is 10 cubits, in the right <lb/>
            hand he holds his club, and in the left his bow. And I <lb/>
            heard in Thasos that they worshipped the same Hercules <lb/>
            as the Tyrians worship, but afterwards, when when they <lb/>
            became naturalized as Greeks, they worshipped Hercules <lb/>
            the son of Amphitryon. And the votive offering of the <lb/>
            Thasians at Olympia has the following elegiac couplet <lb/>
            attached to it, <lb/>
            " Onatas the son of Micon made me, a dweller at iEgina." <lb/>
            This Æginetan Onatas we should regard in the statuary <lb/>
            art as second to none since Daedalus and the Attic school.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVI.</title>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE Dorian Messenians also, who received Naupactus <lb/>
            from the Athenians, erected at Olympia a Victory on <lb/>
            a pillar, the design of the Mendæan Paeonius, and made <lb/>
            from spoils taken from the enemy, I imagine, when they <lb/>
            fought with the Acarnanians and Œniadæ. But the Mes­ <lb/>
            senians themselves say that this Victory was erected for <lb/>
            their share with the Athenians in the action at Sphacteria, <lb/>
            and that they did not insert the name of the enemy from <lb/>
            fear of the Lacedaemonians, and they could have had no fear <lb/>
            of the Œniadæ and Acarnanians.</p>
          <p>I found also many votive offerings of Micythus seat­ <lb/>
            tered about, and three of them together, next to the statue <lb/>
            of Iphitus of Elis and Truce crowning him, viz. Amphi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            trite and Poseidon and Vesta, by the Argive Glaucus. <lb/>
            And near the left side of the great temple he placed Pro­ <lb/>
            serpine the daughter of Demeter, and Aphrodite, and Gany­ <lb/>
            mede, and Artemis, and of the poets Homer and Hesiod, <lb/>
            and of the gods again AEsculapius and Hygiea. And among <lb/>
            the votive offerings of Micythus is Agon with the dumb <lb/>
            bells. These dumb bells are fashioned as follows. They <lb/>
            are semicircular in shape though not a perfect semi-circle, <lb/>
            and are so constructed that the fingers can pass through, <lb/>
            as they do through the handles of a shield. And next the <lb/>
            statue of Agon is Dionysus, and the Thracian Orpheus, and <lb/>
            the statue of Zeus which I mentioned a little above. These <lb/>
            are works of art of the Argive Dionysius. Others besides <lb/>
            they say were given by Micythus, but were removed by <lb/>
            Nero. And the Argives Dionysius and Glaucus had no <lb/>
            master in their craft that we know of, but the period <lb/>
            when they flourished is shewn by the fact that Micythus <lb/>
            placed their works of art at Olympia. For Herodotus in­ <lb/>
            forms us in his history that this Micythus was the slave of <lb/>
            Anaxilas the king at Rhegium, and was afterwards his <lb/>
            treasurer, and after his death went to Tegea. And the <lb/>
            inscriptions on these votive offerings make Micythus the son <lb/>
            of Chœrus, and the Greek colony of Rhegium, or Messene <lb/>
            near the Strait, his native place. But they do not mention <lb/>
            his ever living at Tegea, and these votive offerings at <lb/>
            Olympia were the fulfilment of a vow for the recovery of <lb/>
            his son, who was wasting away in a consumption.</p>
          <p>And near the larger votive offerings of Micythus, the <lb/>
            work of the Argive Glaucus, is a statue of Athene with a <lb/>
            helmet on her head and her AEgis. This was made by <lb/>
            Nicodamus the Mænalian, and is a votive offering of the <lb/>
            people of Elis. And next to Athene is a statue of Vic­ <lb/>
            tory, an offering of the Mantineans, for what war is not <lb/>
            specified in the inscription. And it is said to be an imita­ <lb/>
            tion by Calamis of the wooden statue at Athens of Wing­ <lb/>
            less Victory. And near the smaller votive offerings of <lb/>
            Micythus made by Dionysius are the Labours of Hercules <lb/>
            with the Nemean lion, and the hydra, and Cerberus, and the <lb/>
            Erymanthian boar. They were brought to Olympia by <lb/>
            the men of Heraclea, who overran the territory of the <lb/>
            neighbouring barbarians the Mariandyni. Heraclea is a <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            town near the Euxine, and was colonized by the Megarians. <lb/>
            The Bœotians of Tanagra also had a share in the colony.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XXVII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND opposite those I have mentioned are other votive <lb/>
            offerings in a row, facing the South, and very near the <lb/>
            enclosure sacred to Pelops. Among tnem are tne votive <lb/>
            offerings of Mænalian Phormis, who crossed over from <lb/>
            Mænalus to Sicily to Gelon the son of Dinomenes, and in <lb/>
            the army of Gelon, and afterwards in the army of Gelon's <lb/>
            brother Hiero, displayed great valour, and advanced to <lb/>
            such a pitch of fortune that he offered these votive offer­ <lb/>
            ings at Olympia, and also some others to Apollo at Delphi. <lb/>
            His offerings at Olympia are two horses and two charioteers, <lb/>
            a charioteer by each horse. The first horse and groom is by <lb/>
            Dionysius the Argive, the second by the Æginetan Simo. <lb/>
            And the first has the following inscription on the side, the <lb/>
            first line not in metre, <lb/>
            " Phormis the Arcadian from Mænalus, now a Syracu­ <lb/>
            san, offered me."</p>
          <p>This is the horse about which the people of Elis have a <lb/>
            tradition on the power of lust in horses. It is evident that <lb/>
            several remarkable properties of this horse come from the <lb/>
            cunning of a magician. In size and beauty it is inferior <lb/>
            to many to be seen in Altis : it has also the tail knocked <lb/>
            off, which makes it more unsightly still. Nevertheless <lb/>
            stallions not only in spring but all the year round are <lb/>
            madly in lust after it. For they rush into Altis, breaking <lb/>
            their reins or escaping from their drivers, and endeavour <lb/>
            to mount this horse, with far greater impetuosity than <lb/>
            they exhibit to the handsomest mare alive whom they had <lb/>
            been accustomed to mount. And though their hoofs slip <lb/>
            on the polished basement they do not cease to neigh <lb/>
            fiercely, and try to mount this horse with frantic energy, <lb/>
            till by whips or sheer strength they get pulled off. There <lb/>
            is no other way of getting them away from this brazen <lb/>
            horsed I have seen in Lydia a different kind of marvel to <lb/>
            this horse of Phormis, but equally the cunning work of a <note type="footnote"> 1 On this curious story see Bayle on Hippomanes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            magician. Among the Lydians called Persici there are <lb/>
            temples at Hierocæsarea and Hypæpa, and in each of these <lb/>
            temples there is a chamber in which are ashes on an altar, <lb/>
            not like other ashes in appearance. And a magician enters <lb/>
            into this chamber, and, after placing dry wood upon the <lb/>
            altar, first of all places a tiara on his head, and then calls on <lb/>
            the gods in a foreign tongue not understood by the Greeks. <lb/>
            And this he chants from a book, and the wood gets lighted <lb/>
            evidently without fire and a bright blaze shines forth from <lb/>
            it. Let this digression suffice.</p>
          <p>And among these votive offerings is Phormis himself <lb/>
            contending with an enemy, and fighting with a second <lb/>
            and even a third. And there is an inscription stating that <lb/>
            the soldier fighting is Meenalian Phormis, and that it is a <lb/>
            votive offering of the Syracusan Lycortas, who plainly <lb/>
            offered it out of affection to Phormis. The Greeks however <lb/>
            call these votive offerings of Lycortas the votive offerings of <lb/>
            Phormis. And the Hermes with a ram under his arm, and <lb/>
            a helmet on his head, and a tunic and cloak on, is not one of <lb/>
            the votive offerings of Phormis, but was offered to the god <lb/>
            by the Arcadians of Pheneos. And the inscription states <lb/>
            that Onatas the Æginetan jointly designed it with Calli­ <lb/>
            teles, who must I think have been the pupil or son of <lb/>
            Onatas. And not far from the votive offering of the people <lb/>
            of Pheneos is another statue of Hermes with his herald's <lb/>
            wand, and the inscription on it states that it was the votive <lb/>
            offering of Glaucias of Rhegium, and the work of Gallon <lb/>
            of Elis. And there are two brazen bulls, one the votive <lb/>
            offering of the people of Corcyra, the other of the Eretri­ <lb/>
            enses, both by Philesius of Eretria. Why the Corcyræans <lb/>
            offered one bull at Olympia and another at Delphi, I <lb/>
            shall relate in my account of the Phocians. And about <lb/>
            the votive offering at Olympia I have heard the follow­ <lb/>
            ing circumstance. A little boy sitting down under this <lb/>
            bull had stooped down and was playing, and suddenly lift­ <lb/>
            ing up his head dashed it against the brass, and not many <lb/>
            days afterwards died from the blow. The people of Elis <lb/>
            wanted to remove the bull from Altis as being blood guilty, <lb/>
            but the god at Delphi ordered the same expiatory sacrifices <lb/>
            for the bull as the Greeks ordain for involuntary homicide.</p>
          <p>There is under the plane trees at Altis in the middle of <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            the grove a brazen trophy, and an inscription on the shield <lb/>
            of the trophy, stating that the people of Elis offered it out of <lb/>
            spoils of the Lacedæmonians. This was the battle in which <lb/>
            the man lost his life who was found in his armour in my <lb/>
            day, when the roof of the temple of Hera was being repaired. <lb/>
            The votive offering of the Mendæans in Thrace very nearly <lb/>
            deceived me to think that it was the effigy of a competitor <lb/>
            for the pentathlum. It is near Anauchidas of Elis, and <lb/>
            has ancient dumb-bells. And the following elegiac couplet <lb/>
            is written on the thigh, <lb/>
            " To Zeus, the king of the Gods, the Mendæans put me <lb/>
            here as firstfruits, after taking Sipte by storm."</p>
          <p>It seems that Sipte is a Thracian fort and city, and the <lb/>
            Mendæans are a Greek race from Ionia, and live a little <lb/>
            inland from the sea, at the town of Ænus.</p><pb n="360"/>

            EXT to my account of the votive offerings comes natu­ <lb/>
            rally mention of the horses that contended, and of the <lb/>
            athletes, and of amateurs also. There are not statues of all <lb/>
            the conquerors at Olympia, for even some who displayed <lb/>
            great prowess in the contests, or elsewhere, have yet not <lb/>
            obtained statues. These my subject bids me to pass over, <lb/>
            for it is not a catalogue of all the athletes that were <lb/>
            victors at Olympia, but an account of the statues and other <lb/>
            votive offerings. Neither shall I mention all the statues, <lb/>
            as I well know some who won the crown of wild olive <lb/>
            from unexpected good fortune rather than their own exer­ <lb/>
            tions. I shall therefore merely mention those who had <lb/>
            more renown or finer statues than others.</p>
          <p>On the right of the temple of Hera is a statue of the <lb/>
            wrestler Symmachus, the son of AEschylus, a native of Elis. <lb/>
            And near him, from Pheneos in Arcadia, is Neolaidas the <lb/>
            son of Proxenus, who carried off the prize for boxing among <lb/>
            the boys, and next Archedamus the son of Xenius, also a <lb/>
            native of Elis, who beat all the boys in wrestling. These <lb/>
            statues were made by Alypus the Sicyonian, the pupil of <lb/>
            Naucydes the Argive. And the inscription on the statue <lb/>
            of Cleogenes, the son of Silenus, says that he was of the <lb/>
            district, he won the prize with a fast horse from his own stud. <lb/>
            And next Cleogenes are Dinolochus, the son of Pyrrhus, <lb/>
            and Troilus, the son of Alcinous. They too were natives of <lb/>
            Elis, but their victories were not won in the same manner, <lb/>
            for Troilus owed his victory to his perfect pair of horses <lb/>
            and team of colts: partly also to his being umpire : and <lb/>
            he was victor in the 102nd Olympiad. And from thence­ <lb/>
            forth there was a law among the people of Elis that the <lb/>
            umpires' horses should not be admitted to the races. <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            His statue was by Lysippus. But the mother of Dinolochus <lb/>
            dreamed that she embraced her son after being crowned, <lb/>
            and moved by this dream he trained, and outran the <lb/>
            other lads: and his statue is by Cleon of Sicyon. As <lb/>
            to Cynisca the wife of Archidamus, I have spoken pre­ <lb/>
            viously of her family and victories at Olympia, in my <lb/>
            account of the kings of the Lacedæmonians. And near <lb/>
            the statue of Troilus is a basement of stone, and a chariot <lb/>
            and charioteer, and the effigy of Cynisca herself, by Apelles. <lb/>
            There are inscriptions also in reference to her. And next <lb/>
            her are some Lacedæmonians, who were victors in the <lb/>
            horse-races. Anaxander was the first victor proclaimed in <lb/>
            the chariot-race. And the inscription over him states that <lb/>
            his grandfather was crowned earlier in the pentathlum. He <lb/>
            is represented as praying to the god. And Polycles, sur­ <lb/>
            named Polychalcus, was victor in the chariot-race with 4 <lb/>
            horses abreast, and his effigy has in its right hand a riband. <lb/>
            And by him are two boys, one holding the wheel, the other <lb/>
            asking for the riband. And Polycles was victor with his <lb/>
            horses, as the inscription over him states, in the Pythian <lb/>
            Isthmian and Nemean games.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the statue of the pancratiast next is by Lysippus. <lb/>
            A He carried off the victory as pancratiast from the rest <lb/>
            -of the Acarnanians, and was the first of his own country­ <lb/>
            men. Xenarches was his name and he was the son of Phi­ <lb/>
            landridas. And the Lacedaemonians, after the invasion <lb/>
            of the Medes, turned their attention more than any other <lb/>
            Greeks to breeding horses. For besides those that I have <lb/>
            already mentioned, there are statues of several other Spar­ <lb/>
            tan horse-breeders, next to the effigy of the Acarnanian <lb/>
            athlete, as Xenarches, and Lycinus, and Arcesilaus, and <lb/>
            Lichas his son. Xenarches also had further victories at <lb/>
            Delphi and Argos and Corinth. And Lycinus brought colts <lb/>
            ,to Olympia, and as one of them was rejected, he used his <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            colts in the race of full-grown horses and won the prize. <lb/>
            And he set up two statues at Olympia, by the Athenian <lb/>
            Myro. And Arcesilaus and his son Lichas had two vic­ <lb/>
            tories at Olympia, and Lichas, as the Lacedaemonians were <lb/>
            at that time excluded from the games, entered himself for <lb/>
            the chariot-race as a Theban, and bound the victorious <lb/>
            charioteer with a riband. For this the Umpires scourged <lb/>
            him. And it was on account of this Lichas that the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians under Agis invaded Elis, when the fight took <lb/>
            place at Altis. And at the end of the war Lichas erected <lb/>
            his statue here, but the records of the people of Elis about <lb/>
            the victors at Olympia say that the Theban people, not <lb/>
            Lichas, won the victory.</p>
          <p>And near Lichas is the seer of Elis, Thrasybulus, the <lb/>
            son of AEneas of the family of the Iamidae, who practised <lb/>
            divination for the Mantineans against the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            under Agis the son of King Endamidas, I shall enter into the <lb/>
            circumstances more fully in my account about the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians. And on the effigy of Thrasybulus there is a spotted <lb/>
            lizard creeping on his right shoulder, and a dog lies near <lb/>
            him cut in half as a victim and shewing its liver. Divi­ <lb/>
            nation by kids and lambs and calves is clearly an old <lb/>
            practice among mankind, the Cyprians seem also to have <lb/>
            added divination by swine. But no nations are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to practise divination by dogs. Therefore it was <lb/>
            apparently a peculiarity of Thrasybulus to introduce this <lb/>
            kind of divination. And the seers called the Iamidæ were <lb/>
            descendants of Iamus, who, as Pindar tells us in one of his <lb/>
            Odes, was the son of Apollo, and learnt his divination from <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>And close to the effigy of Thrasybulus is one of Timos­ <lb/>
            thenes, a native of Elis, who won the prize for boys in the <lb/>
            course, and one of the Milesian Antipater, the son of Clino­ <lb/>
            pater, who beat all the boys in boxing. And some Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, who offered sacrifices at Olympia on behalf of <lb/>
            Dionysius, bribed the father of Antipater to let his son be <lb/>
            declared a Syracusan. But Antipater, despising the tyrant's <lb/>
            bribe, declared himself a Milesian, and inscribed on his <lb/>
            effigy that he was a Milesian, and the first Ionian that <lb/>
            had had his effigy at Olympia. It was by Polycletus, and <lb/>
            Timosthenes' was by Eutychides of Sicyon, a pupil of <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            Lysippus. This Eutychides made a statue of Fortune for <lb/>
            the Syrians by the Orontes, which is greatly honoured by <lb/>
            the people of that district.</p>
          <p>And in Altis near the effigy of Timosthenes are statues <lb/>
            of Timon and his son Æsypus, the lad on horseback. For <lb/>
            he won the prize on his racer, while Timon was pro­ <lb/>
            claimed victor in the chariot race. These statues were <lb/>
            made by Daedalus of Sicyon, who also erected a trophy for <lb/>
            the people of Elis, after their victory over the Laconians at <lb/>
            Altis. And the inscription over the Samian boxer states <lb/>
            that Myco was his trainer, and that the Samians are the <lb/>
            best of the Ionians both as athletes and naval heroes, but <lb/>
            gives no information about the particular boxer.</p>
          <p>And next is the statue of the Messenian Damiscus, who <lb/>
            was victor at Olympia when he was only 12. It is a very re­ <lb/>
            markable coincidence, that, when the Messenians were <lb/>
            exiles from the Peloponnese, their luck at Olympia also <lb/>
            failed. For except Leontiscus and Symmachus, who were <lb/>
            Sicilian Messenians from the Strait, no Messenian either <lb/>
            from Sicily or Naupactus was victor at Olympia, and <lb/>
            the Sicilians say they were not Messenians but old in­ <lb/>
            habitants of Zancle. However when the Messenians re­ <lb/>
            turned to the Peloponnese, their luck also at Olympia re­ <lb/>
            turned. For in the year after the restoration to Messene, <lb/>
            when the people of Elis celebrated the Olympian games, <lb/>
            this Damiscus won the prize from all the boys in the course, <lb/>
            and afterwards won victories both at Nemea and at the <lb/>
            Isthmus in the pentathlum.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            EXT to Damiscus is the statue of a man whose name <lb/>
            is not recorded, the votive offering of Ptolemy the­ <lb/>
            son of Lagus. Ptolemy calls himself a Macedonian in the­ <lb/>
            inscription, though he was king of Egypt. There is an in­ <lb/>
            scription also over Chæreas of Sicyon a boy-boxer, stating <lb/>
            that his father was Chæremon, and that though young he <lb/>
            was victor. The inscription also states that the status <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            was by Asterion, the son of Æschylus. And next to <lb/>
            Chæreas there are statues of the Messenian boy Sophius, <lb/>
            and of Stomius a man of Elis, Sophius outran all the boys, <lb/>
            and Stromius won one victory in the pentathlum at <lb/>
            Olympia, and three at Nemea. And the inscription on <lb/>
            Stomius records further that as leader of the cavalry of <lb/>
            the people of Elis he won a victory, and killed the com­ <lb/>
            mander of the enemy, who had challenged him to single <lb/>
            combat. And the people of Elis say that he came from <lb/>
            Sicyon and was ruler of the Sicyonians, and that they <lb/>
            themselves went on an expedition against Sicyon in friend­ <lb/>
            ship to the Thebans together with a force from Bœotia. <lb/>
            It would appear therefore that an expedition against <lb/>
            Sicyon must have set out from Elis and Thebes after the <lb/>
            reverse of the Lacedæmonians at Leuctra.</p>
          <p>Next is the statue of the boxer Labax, the son of Euphron, <lb/>
            who was a native of Lepreus in Elis, and also one of the <lb/>
            wrestlers from Elis, Aristodemus the son of Thrasis, who <lb/>
            had two victories in the Pythian games. And the effigy of <lb/>
            Aristodemus is by Dædalus the Sicyonian, who was the <lb/>
            pupil and son of Patrocles. And the statue of Hippos of <lb/>
            Elis, who beat all the boys in boxing, was by Democritus <lb/>
            of Sicyon, who learnt his art from the Athenian Critias <lb/>
            through 4 intermediate teachers. For Critias was the <lb/>
            tutor of the Corcyræan Ptolichus, and Amphion was the <lb/>
            pupil of Ptolichus, and Piso of Calauria was the pupil of <lb/>
            Amphion, and Democritus was the pupil of Piso. And <lb/>
            Cratinus from Ægira in Achaia was the most handsome of <lb/>
            all his contemporaries, and the greatest wrestler. And as <lb/>
            none of the boys could stand before him in wrestling he <lb/>
            was appointed by the people of Elis as teacher of the boys. <lb/>
            And his statue was by the Sicyonian Cantharus, whose <lb/>
            father was Alexis, and teacher Eutychides.</p>
          <p>And the effigy of Eupolemus of Elis was by the Sicyo­ <lb/>
            nian Dædalus, and the inscription informs us about him <lb/>
            that he was victor at Olympia over men in the course, he <lb/>
            also won two crowns at the Pythian games in the pen­ <lb/>
            tathlum, and one crown at the Nemean games. It is further <lb/>
            recorded about Eupolemus that of the three umpires in the <lb/>
            race two adjudged the prize to him, and the third to the <lb/>
            Ambraciote Leo, and that Leo at the Council of Olympia <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            subsequently got indemnity from both the umpires who had <lb/>
            adjudged the prize to Eapolemus.</p>
          <p>And the statue of CEbotas was set up by the Achæans in <lb/>
            the 80th Olympiad in acordance with the oracle at Delphi. <lb/>
            He had been victor in the course in the sixth Olympiad. <lb/>
            How then could he have fought with the Greeks at Platæa P <lb/>
            For it was not till the 75th Olympiad that Mardonius and <lb/>
            the Medes met with the reverse at Platsea. I am bound <lb/>
            to record the traditions of the Greeks, but I need not be­ <lb/>
            lieve all of them. All else that happened to CEbotas shall <lb/>
            be told in my account of Achaia.</p>
          <p>And the statue of Antiochus was made by Nicodemus. <lb/>
            Antiochus was a native of Lepreus, and won the prize at <lb/>
            Olympia for the pentathlum for men once, and twice in the <lb/>
            Pythian games, twice also at Nemea. For the Isthmians <lb/>
            were not frightened by the people of Lepreus as they were <lb/>
            by the people of Elis, for Hysmon of Elis, whose statue is <lb/>
            next to Antiochus, being an athlete, and having won the <lb/>
            prize for the pentathlum once at Olympia and once at <lb/>
            Nemea, was plainly prevented, like all other people of Elis, <lb/>
            from trying his fortune at the Isthmian games. It is also <lb/>
            recorded of Hysmon that when he was a boy he had a dis­ <lb/>
            charge, and that was why he trained for the pentathlum, <lb/>
            that he might become stronger in constitution, and free <lb/>
            from disease. And this training was destined to get for <lb/>
            him many notable victories. His statue is by Cleon, and <lb/>
            he has in his hands some old-fashioned dumb bells. And <lb/>
            next to Hysmon is the statue of a wrestling boy from <lb/>
            Heræa in Arcadia, Nicostratus the son of Xenoclidas. It <lb/>
            is by Pantias, who by six intermediate links was a pupil <lb/>
            of Aristocles the Sicyonian.</p>
          <p>And Dicon the son of Callibrotus won five races in the <lb/>
            Pythian games, and three in the Isthmian, and four at <lb/>
            Nemea, and at Olympia one for boys, two for men. And <lb/>
            he has as many statues as he won victories at Olympia. <lb/>
            He was a native of Caulonia, and so proclaimed as a boy, <lb/>
            though afterwards for money he proclaimed himself a <lb/>
            Syracusan. Now Caulonia is a colony of Achæans in Italy, <lb/>
            its founder was Typhon of Ægium. And when Pyrrhus <lb/>
            the son of Æacus and the Tarentines were at war with <lb/>
            the Romans, and several cities in Italy were destroyed, <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            some by the Romans, some by the people of Epirus, Cau­ <lb/>
            lonia was laid waste, after being captured by the Cam­ <lb/>
            panians, who were the chief allies of the Romans.</p>
          <p>Next to Dicon is a statue of Xenophon, the son of Mene­ <lb/>
            phylus, the pancratiast from Ægium in Achaia, also one <lb/>
            of Pyrilampes the Ephesian, who obtained the victory in <lb/>
            the long course. Xenophon's statue is by Olympus, Pyri­ <lb/>
            lampes' by a sculptor of the same name, not a Sicyonian, <lb/>
            but from Messene near Ithome.</p>
          <p>The Samians also erected a statue at Olympia to the <lb/>
            Spartan Lysander the son of Aristocritus. And the first <lb/>
            of the inscriptions is, <lb/>
            " In the conspicuous precincts of almighty Zeus I stand, <lb/>
            the votive offering of all the Samians."</p>
          <p>This informs us who erected the statue. And the second <lb/>
            inscription is a panegyric on Lysander, <lb/>
            " Immortal fame, Lysander, on your country and Aristo­ <lb/>
            critus did you confer by your splendid merit."</p>
          <p>Manifest is it therefore that the Samians and other <lb/>
            Ionian s, according to the Ionian proverb, whitewashed two <lb/>
            walls.1 For when Alcibiades had a strong Atbenian fleet <lb/>
            in the neighbourhood of Ionia, most of the Ionians paid <lb/>
            their court to him, and there is a brazen bust of Alcibiades <lb/>
            in the temple of Hera among the Samians. But when the <lb/>
            Athenian fleet was taken at Ægospotamoi, then the <lb/>
            Samians erected this statue of Lysander at Olympia, and <lb/>
            the Ephesians placed in the temple of Artemis statues of <lb/>
            Lysander himself, and Eteonicus, and Pharax, and other <lb/>
            Spartans of no great renown in Greece. And when for­ <lb/>
            tune veered round again, and Conon won the sea-fight off <lb/>
            Cnidus and Mount Dorium, then the Ionians changed sides <lb/>
            again, and you may see a brazen statue of, Conon and <lb/>
            Timotheus at Samos in the temple of Hera, and likewise <lb/>
            at Ephesus in the temple of Artemis. This has been the <lb/>
            case in all ages, for all men, like these Ionians, pay court <lb/>
            to the strongest. <note type="footnote"> 1 This proverb means to play fast and loose, to be a turn-coat, a Vicar <lb/>
            of Bray. The best illustration is Cicero ad Fam. vii. 29. " Noli hanc <lb/>
            epistolam Attico ostendere: sine eum errare et putare me virum bdhum <lb/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next to Lysander is the effigy of an Ephesian boxer, <lb/>
            whose name was Athenaeus, and who beat all the boys <lb/>
            that contended with him, and next him is the Sicyonian <lb/>
            pancratiast Sostratus, whose surname was Acrochersites, <lb/>
            because he laid hold of his adversary's fingers and tried to <lb/>
            break them, and would not let go till he saw that he was <lb/>
            going to give in. And be had 12 victories at Nemea and <lb/>
            Isthmus both together, and in the Pythian games two, at <lb/>
            Olympia three. The 104th Olympiad, in which this Sos­ <lb/>
            tratus was victor for the first time, the people of Elis do <lb/>
            not record, because the games in that Olympiad were not <lb/>
            instituted by them but by the Pisæans and Arcadians. And <lb/>
            next to Sostratus is the wrestler Leontiscus, a Sicilian <lb/>
            from Messene by the Strait. And he is said to have been <lb/>
            crowned by the Amphictyonians, and twice by the people <lb/>
            of Elis, and his wrestling is said to have been somewhat <lb/>
            similar to that of Sostratus of Sicyon in the pancratium, <lb/>
            for he was not an adept at wrestling his antagonists down, <lb/>
            but he used to beat them by trying to break their fingers. <lb/>
            And his statue was by Pythagoras of Rhegium, an excel­ <lb/>
            lent sculptor if ever there was one. And he learnt his <lb/>
            art they say from Clearchus who was also a native of <lb/>
            Rhegium, and a pupil of Euchirns. This Euchirus was a <lb/>
            Corinthian, and pupil of Syadra and Charta, who were both <lb/>
            Spartans.</p>
          <p>And the boy with a fillet on his head must not be omitted <lb/>
            by me, on Phidias' account and his fame as a statuary, for <lb/>
            otherwise we don't know who it is a statue of. And there <lb/>
            is a statue of Satyrus of Elis, the son of Lysianax, of the <lb/>
            family of the Iamidae, who five times won the prize for <lb/>
            boxing at Nemea, and twice at Olympia, and twice at the <lb/>
            Pythian games. This statue is by the Athenian Silanion. <lb/>
            And another Athenian statuary Polycles, the pupil of the <lb/>
            Athenian Stadieus, has made a statue of the Ephesian pan­ <lb/>
            cratiast, Amyntas the son of Hellanicus.</p>
          <p>And Chilon the Achaean of Patre had two victories at <lb/>
            Olympia in wrestling among men, and one at Delphi, and <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            4 at Isthmus, and 3 at Nemea. And he had a public funeral <lb/>
            from the Achæans, as he was killed in war. The inscription <lb/>
            at Olympia bears me out.</p>
          <p>" I won the prize from men in wrestling twice in the <lb/>
            Pythian and Olympian games, three times at Nemea, four <lb/>
            times at the Isthmus near the sea, I Chilon of Patræ the <lb/>
            son of Chilon, whom the Achæans gave a public funeral to <lb/>
            for his valour as he was killed in war."</p>
          <p>Such is what the inscription records. And if one conjec­ <lb/>
            tures from the age of Lysippus, who made the effigy, one <lb/>
            must infer that the war in which Chilon fell was either <lb/>
            at Chæronea when he fought in company with all the <lb/>
            Achæans, or that he alone boldly volunteered to fight at <lb/>
            Lamia in Thessaly against Antipater and the Macedonians.</p>
          <p>And next to that of Chilon are two statues: one of Mol­ <lb/>
            pion, who the inscription states was crooned by the people <lb/>
            of Elis, and the other, which has no inscription, is they say <lb/>
            Aristotle of Stagira in Thrace, and it was erected to <lb/>
            him by some pupil or soldier, as he was greatly honoured <lb/>
            by Antipater and earlier still by Alexander. And Soda­ <lb/>
            mas from Assus in the Troas, near Mount Ida, was the <lb/>
            first Æolian that won the prize for boys in the course at <lb/>
            Olympia. And next to Sodamas is a statue of Archidamus, <lb/>
            the son of Agesilaus, king of the Lacedæmonians. Before <lb/>
            the reign of this Archidamus I cannot find that the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians erected a statue of anyone beyond their own <lb/>
            borders. But they sent I think a statue of Archidamus to <lb/>
            Olympia, not only on other accounts but also because of his <lb/>
            death, for he died fighting against the barbarians, and was <lb/>
            the only one of the Spartan kings that lacked sepulture. I <lb/>
            have narrated the particulars at full length in my account <lb/>
            of Sparta. And Euanthes of Cyzicus had prizes for boxing, <lb/>
            one at Olympia as a man, and at Nemea and the Isthmian <lb/>
            games as a boy. And next to Euanthes is a horse-trainer <lb/>
            and a chariot, and a girl mounting the chariot. The man's <lb/>
            name is Lampus, and his native town was the most recent <lb/>
            of the Macedonian towns, and got its name from its founder <lb/>
            Philip the son of Amyntas. And the effigy of Cyniscus, the <lb/>
            boy boxer from Mantinea, was by Polycletus. And Ergo­ <lb/>
            teles the son of Philanor, who carried off two victories at <lb/>
            Olympia in the long course, and as many at the Pythian <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            Isthmian and Nemean games, was not originally a native <lb/>
            of Himera, as the inscription states, but is said to have been <lb/>
            a Cretan from Gnossus: and being banished from thence <lb/>
            in some faction he went to Himera, and obtained citizen­ <lb/>
            ship there, and had other honours. This is the probable <lb/>
            explanation of his being proclaimed in the games as a native <lb/>
            of Himera.</p>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HE statue which stands on a lofty pedestal is by Lysip­ <lb/>
            pus. It is the statue of Polydamas, the son of Nicias, <lb/>
            the largest man of our times. There may have been larger <lb/>
            men, but only the heroes or some mortal race of giants <lb/>
            earlier than the heroes. Scotusa, which was the native <lb/>
            place of Polydamas, is not inhabited in our day, for Alex­ <lb/>
            ander the king of the Pheræans took it in time of peace, for <lb/>
            when the people of Scotusa were all gathered together in <lb/>
            the theatre, for they held their meetings there at that period, <lb/>
            he surrounded it with targeteers and archers and shot them <lb/>
            all, and slew all besides that were in their prime, and sold <lb/>
            the women and children, and with the proceeds kept up a <lb/>
            mercenary army. This disaster happened to the people of <lb/>
            Scotusa when Phrasiclides was Archon at Athens, in the <lb/>
            102nd Olympiad, in the second year of which Damon of <lb/>
            Thuria was victor for the second time. And those that <lb/>
            escaped of the people of Scotusa were few, and even they <lb/>
            were reduced still further and left the town, when Provi­ <lb/>
            dence brought a second reverse upon all the Greeks in the <lb/>
            war with the Macedonians. In the pancratium several had <lb/>
            notable victories, but Polydamas beside his crowns for the <lb/>
            pancratium had further renown for the following remark­ <lb/>
            able exploits. The mountainous part of Thrace, inside the <lb/>
            river Nestus that flows through the territory of the people <lb/>
            of Abdera, rears several wild beasts and among them lions, <lb/>
            who on one occasion attacked the army of Xerxes, and made <lb/>
            havoc of the camels that carried the corn. These lions also <lb/>
            frequently prowled about the country in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Mount Olympus, one side of which mountain faces Mace- <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            donia, another Thessaly and the river Peneus. Polydamas <lb/>
            unarmed slew a large and stout lion on Mount Olympus: <lb/>
            moved to this exploit from a desire to emulate the actions of <lb/>
            Hercules, who as the tradition goes vanquished the Nemean <lb/>
            lion. Another memorable feat of Polydamas is on record. <lb/>
            He approached a herd of cattle, and seized the strongest <lb/>
            and wildest bull by one of its hind feet; and held on fast by <lb/>
            its hoofs, and would not let it go though it kicked and <lb/>
            struggled, till at last the bull exerting all its strength got <lb/>
            away from him, and left its hoofs in his hands.. It is also <lb/>
            recorded of him that he stopped a chariot which the driver <lb/>
            was urging on at full speed, by laying hold of it behind <lb/>
            with one hand, and thus stopped both horses and charioteer. <lb/>
            And Darius, the illegitimate son of Artaxerxes, (who <lb/>
            with the help of the Persian commonalty had deposed Sog­ <lb/>
            dius, Artaxerxes'legitimate son, and usurped his kingdom), <lb/>
            when he became king sent messengers, for he had heard of <lb/>
            the exploits of Polydamas, and by promising rewards at­ <lb/>
            tracted him to his court at Susa. And there he slew in <lb/>
            single combat three of the Persians called Immortals who <lb/>
            had challenged him. And some of the exploits which I <lb/>
            have mentioned are recorded on the base of his statue at <lb/>
            Olympia, others in the inscription. But eventually the pro­ <lb/>
            phetic utterance of Homer about trusting too much in one's <lb/>
            strength proved true of Polydamas, for he too was destined <lb/>
            to perish through too great confidence in his strength.1 On <lb/>
            one occasion with several boon companions he entered a <lb/>
            cave in summer time, and somehow or other by some <lb/>
            malign fortune the top of the cave cracked, and was evi­ <lb/>
            dently going to fall in in no long time. And when they per­ <lb/>
            ceived the impending disaster all his companions fled, but <lb/>
            Polydamas determined to remain, and stretched out his <lb/>
            hands in the intention of holding up this mass of rock and <lb/>
            not being buried under it, but he was crushed to death. <note type="footnote"> 1 The passage referred to is Iliad, vi. 407. </note></p><pb n="371"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            AND next to the statue of Polvdamas are two Arcadian <lb/>
            athletes, and one Athenian one. The first is the Man­ <lb/>
            tinean Protolaus, the son of Dialces, who beat all the boys <lb/>
            in boxing, by Pythagoras of Rhegium, the second is Nary­ <lb/>
            cidas, the son of Damaretus, a wrestler from Phigalia, by <lb/>
            the Sicyonian Daedalus, and the third is Callias, the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian pancratiast, by the Athenian painter Micon. And there <lb/>
            is a statue, by Nicodamus of Mænalus, of the pancratiast <lb/>
            from Mænalus, Androsthenes the son of Lochæus, who <lb/>
            carried off two victories from men. And next to these is <lb/>
            the statue of Eucles the son of Callianax, a Rhodian by <lb/>
            birth and of the family of the Diagoridæ, (for Diagoras <lb/>
            was his maternal grandfather), who won the prize for <lb/>
            boxing among men at Olympia. His statue is by Nau­ <lb/>
            cydes. And Polycletus the Argive, a pupil of Naucydes, <lb/>
            (not the Polycletus who made the statue of Hera), has <lb/>
            made the statue of a boy-wrestler, the Theban Agenor. It <lb/>
            was made at the expense of the Phocians, to whom Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus the father of Agenor had been friendly. And <lb/>
            Nicodamus, the statuary from Mænalus, made a statue of <lb/>
            Damoxenidas, the man-boxer from Mænalus. There is also <lb/>
            an effigy of Lastratidas the boy of Elis, who won the crown <lb/>
            for wrestling, and also a victory at Nemea among boys and <lb/>
            beardless youths. And Paraballon the father of Lastratidas <lb/>
            won the prize in the double course, and excited the emula­ <lb/>
            tion of posterity, by writing up the names of the victors at <lb/>
            Olympia in the gymnasium at Olympia.</p>
          <p>So far for these last mentioned: but I must not omit <lb/>
            Euthymus the boxer, or his victories and other feats. He <lb/>
            was an Italian from Locri near the promontory of Zephy­ <lb/>
            rium, and his father's name was Astycles. But the natives <lb/>
            of that country say that he was not the son of Astycles but <lb/>
            of the River Cæcinus, which is the boundary between the <lb/>
            districts of Locri and Rhegium, and has a peculiarity in <lb/>
            respect to grasshoppers. For the grasshoppers in Locri <lb/>
            up to the river Cæcinus sing just as other grasshoppers, but <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            after you cross the Cæcinus they cease to sing in the dis­ <lb/>
            trict of Rhegium. Euthymus then is said to be the son of <lb/>
            this River, and he won a boxing prize at Olympia in the <lb/>
            74th Olympiad, but was not equally successful in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing Olympiad. For Theagenes from Thasos, wishing to <lb/>
            win in the same Olympiad prizes both for boxing and <lb/>
            the pancratium, outboxed Euthymus. Theagenes however <lb/>
            could not receive the wild olive crown for the pancratium, <lb/>
            as in the contest with Euthymus he was exhausted first. <lb/>
            Moreover the umpires fined Theagenes a talent as a fine to <lb/>
            the god, and a talent for the injury done to Euthymus, for <lb/>
            they thought he insulted him in the boxing-match, there­ <lb/>
            fore they ordered him also to pay privately money to <lb/>
            Euthymus. And in the 76th Olympiad Theagenes paid his <lb/>
            fine to the god, and in his vexation would not again contend <lb/>
            as a boxer: but Euthymus received the crown for boxing <lb/>
            both in that and the next Olympiad. And his statue is <lb/>
            by Pythagoras and is especially fine. And on his return <lb/>
            to Italy he fought against a Hero. The particulars are <lb/>
            as follows. When Odysseus was on his travels after the <lb/>
            capture of Ilium they say he was driven by the winds to <lb/>
            several towns in Italy and Sicily, and among others to <lb/>
            Temesa; there they say one of his sailors in drink violated <lb/>
            a maiden, and for this outrage was stoned to death by the <lb/>
            inhabitants. Thereupon Odysseus not troubling himself <lb/>
            about his death sailed off, but the ghost of the man that <lb/>
            had been stoned relentlessly continued to slay indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately the people of Temesa, pursuing all ages alike, till <lb/>
            the Pythian Priestess, when they intended to make a <lb/>
            wholesale flitting from Italy, forbade them to leave Temesa, <lb/>
            and bade them propitiate the Hero, by building him a <lb/>
            temple in a grove set apart for that purpose, and annually <lb/>
            giving him as wife the handsomest girl in Temesa. As <lb/>
            they obeyed the orders of the oracle they had no further <lb/>
            trouble with the ghost. But Euthymus happened to arrive <lb/>
            at Temesa at the time when this annual offering to the <lb/>
            ghost was being made, and inquired into the matter, <lb/>
            and had a strong desire to enter the temple and behold <lb/>
            the maiden. And when he saw her, he was first moved <lb/>
            with pity and then with love. And she swore that she <lb/>
            would marry him if he saved her, and Euthymus armed <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            himself and awaited the approach of the ghost. In the <lb/>
            fight that ensued he was victor, and the Hero left the <lb/>
            country, dived into the sea and was never seen again, and <lb/>
            the men of that region had henceforth no more trouble <lb/>
            from him, and the marriage of Euthymus was celebrated <lb/>
            with much pomp. I have also heard that Euthymus lived <lb/>
            to advanced old age, and did not die, but left mankind <lb/>
            some other way. I have also heard that Temesa is in­ <lb/>
            habited still, my informant was a merchant that sails in <lb/>
            those parts. I also have seen a painting, which is an imita­ <lb/>
            tion of an older painting. In it is the young man 'Sybaris, <lb/>
            and the river Calabrus, and the well Lyca, and a hero-chapel, <lb/>
            and the town of Temesa. There too is the ghost whom <lb/>
            Euthymus expelled, dreadfully swarthy and most formid­ <lb/>
            able in all his appearance, and dressed in a wolfskin. And <lb/>
            the letters in the painting give his name, Lycas. So much <lb/>
            for this legend.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next to the statue of Euthymus is that of Pythar­ <lb/>
            chus of Mantinea, a runner in the course, and Char­ <lb/>
            mides a boxer of Elis, both of whom received prizes as <lb/>
            boys. And when you have seen these you will come to the <lb/>
            statues of the Rhodian athletes, Diagoras and his family. <lb/>
            They are all together in the following order, Acusilaus with <lb/>
            the prize for boxing among men, and Dorieus, the youngest, <lb/>
            who won three prizes in succession at Olympia in the <lb/>
            pancratium. Before Dorieus Damagetus, who comes next, <lb/>
            had won the prize against all comers in the pancratium. <lb/>
            Next to his 3 sons comes the statue of Diagoras, who won <lb/>
            a victory among men in boxing. And the statue of Dia­ <lb/>
            goras is by the Megarian Callicles, the son of that Theo­ <lb/>
            cosmus who made the statue of Zeus at Megara. The sons <lb/>
            also of Diagoras’ daughters practised as boxers and won <lb/>
            prizes at Olympia, among the men Eucles the son of Cal­ <lb/>
            lianax and Callipatira (the daughter of Diagoras), and <lb/>
            among the boys Pisirodus, whose mother dressed him up <lb/>
            like a man and brought him to the Olympian games, her­ <lb/>
            self disguised as a trainer. This Pisirodus also has a statue <lb/>

            in Altis near his maternal grandfather. Diagoras they say <lb/>
            also came to Olympia with his sons Acusilaus and Dama­ <lb/>
            getus. And the young men being victorious at the festival <lb/>
            bore their father on their shoulders, who was pelted by the <lb/>
            Greeks with flowers and congratulated on his sons. On <lb/>
            the female side Diagoras was a Messenian by extraction, <lb/>
            as he was descended from the daughter of Aristomenes. <lb/>
            And Dorieus the son of Diagoras, besides his victories at <lb/>
            Olympia, had 8 victories in the Isthmian games, and seven <lb/>
            in the Nemean. It is said that he also won in the Pythian <lb/>
            games without a contest.. And he and Pisirodus were <lb/>
            entered in the games as Thurians, because they were driven <lb/>
            from Rhodes by faction and migrated to Thurii. But <lb/>
            Dorieus returned to Rhodes subsequently. And of all men <lb/>
            he manifestly was most devoted to the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            interests, for he fought against the Athenians with a fleet <lb/>
            he had himself equipped, till he was captured by the <lb/>
            Athenian triremes and taken prisoner to Athens. And the <lb/>
            Athenians before Dorieus was brought before them were <lb/>
            very angry against him and used threats, but when they <lb/>
            came to the popular Assembly and saw there so great and <lb/>
            renowned a man a captive, their intention about him <lb/>
            changed and they let him go, and did no harm to him, <lb/>
            while they might have done so with justice. The circum­ <lb/>
            stances of the death of Dorieus are told by Androtion in <lb/>
            his history of Attica, viz. that the fleet of the great king <lb/>
            was at Caunus and Conon was the Admiral, and the people <lb/>
            of Rhodes were persuaded by Conon to revolt from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and join the alliance of the Athenians and <lb/>
            the great king, and that Dorieus was at the time absent <lb/>
            from Rhodes in the interior of the Peloponnese, and was <lb/>
            arrested by the Lacedæmonians and taken to Sparta, and <lb/>
            condemned by the Lacedemonians for treason and put to <lb/>
            death. And if Androtion's account be correct, he seems to <lb/>
            be desirous of proving the Lacedæmonians as rash as the <lb/>
            Athenians, for the Athenians are charged with acting rashly <lb/>
            with respect to Thrasyllus and those who fought under him <lb/>
            at Arginusæ. To such a pitch of glory then did Diagoras <lb/>
            and his posterity attain.</p>
          <p>Alcænetus, the son of Theantus of Lepreus, and his sons <lb/>
            also had victories at Olympia. Alcænetus himself won <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            prizes for boxing among the men as previously among the <lb/>
            boys. And Hellanicus and Theantus, the sons of Alcæ­ <lb/>
            netus, were proclaimed winners in the boxing match for <lb/>
            boys, Hellanicus in the 89th Olympiad, and Theantus in <lb/>
            the following Olympiad. All three have statues at Olympia. <lb/>
            And next to the sons of Alcænetus are statues of Gnatho, <lb/>
            the Dipæan from the country about Mænalus, and Lycinus <lb/>
            of Elis: who also had prizes for boxing among the boys at <lb/>
            Olympia. That Gnatho, when he conquered, was excep­ <lb/>
            tionally young is stated in the inscription, his statue is by <lb/>
            Callicles the Megarian. And Dromeus from Stymphelus <lb/>
            was as his name indicates a runner in the long course, and <lb/>
            had two victories at Olympia, two at the Pythian games, <lb/>
            three at the Isthmus, and five at Nemea. It is said also <lb/>
            that he introduced eating flesh during training : for athletes <lb/>
            in training before him used to eat only a particular kind of <lb/>
            cheese. His statue is by Pythagoras, and the next to it is <lb/>
            that of Pythocles of Elis, who won in the pentathlum, by <lb/>
            Polycletus.</p>

          <p>w <lb/>
            HO made the statue of Socrates of Pellene, who won <lb/>
            the race for boys, is not recorded, but the statue of <lb/>
            Amertus of Elis, who defeated in wrestling all the men that <lb/>
            came to the Pythian games, was by Phradmon the Argive. <lb/>
            And Euanoridas of Elis won victories in wrestling among the <lb/>
            boys both at Olympia and at Nemea : and he became an <lb/>
            Umpire and made a list of the victors at Olympia.</p>
          <p>As to the boxer Damarchus, a Parrhasian from Arcadia, <lb/>
            I cannot credit, except the victory at Olympia, all the <lb/>
            fictions about him made by boastful people, such as that he <lb/>
            changed from a man into a wolf at the sacrifice of Zeus <lb/>
            Lycæus, and that 10 years afterwards he changed into a <lb/>
            man again. Not that this is the tradition apparently of the <lb/>
            Arcadians about him. Else it would have been inserted in <lb/>
            their inscription at Olympia, which runs as follows.</p>
          <p>" Demarchus the son of Dinnytas erected this statue, a <lb/>
            Parrhasian from Arcadia."</p>
          <p>This is all the inscription. But Eubotas of Cyrene, as <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            he had learnt beforehand from the oracle at Libya that <lb/>
            he would gain the prize in the race at Olympia, had his <lb/>
            statue made first, and on the same day was proclaimed <lb/>
            victor and set up his statue. It is said also that he won <lb/>
            the chariot race in that Olympiad which the people of Elis <lb/>
            do not reckon because the Arcadians instituted the games.</p>
          <p>And the statue of Timanthes of Cleonæ, who won the <lb/>
            prize for men in the pancratium, is by the Athenian Myro, <lb/>
            and that of Baucis of Troezen, who beat all the men in <lb/>
            wrestling, is by Naucydes. The following was they say the <lb/>
            end of Timanthes. When he ceased to be an athlete he con­ <lb/>
            tinued none the less to make trial of his strength, every <lb/>
            day bending a huge bow: and he went away from home <lb/>
            for a time, and during that period the use of the bow was <lb/>
            suspended: and when on his return he found himself no <lb/>
            longer strong enough to bend his bow, he lighted his funeral <lb/>
            pyre and put himself alive on it. All actions of this kind <lb/>
            whether in the past or in the future seem to me rather <lb/>
            madness than bravery.</p>
          <p>And next to Baucis are some statues of Arcadian athletes, <lb/>
            as Euthymenes of Maenalus, who won prizes among men for <lb/>
            wrestling and still earlier among boys, and Philip the son of <lb/>
            Azan from Pellene, who beat all the boys in boxing, and <lb/>
            Critodamus from Clitor, who was himself also proclaimed <lb/>
            victor in the boys' boxing match. That of Euthymenes was <lb/>
            by Alypus, that of Critodamus by Cleon, and that of Philip <lb/>
            the son of Azan by Myro. As to Promachus the pancra­ <lb/>
            tiast, the son of Dryon of Pellene, I shall state more about <lb/>
            him in my account of Achaia. And- not far from Proma­ <lb/>
            chus is the statue of Timasitheus of Delphi, (by Ageladas <lb/>
            the Argive), who won two victories in the pancratium at <lb/>
            Olympia, and three in the Pythian games. He also ex­ <lb/>
            hibited brilliant bravery in war, and had constant good <lb/>
            fortune till then. For his valour on that occasion cost him <lb/>
            his life. For when Isagoras the Athenian occupied the <lb/>
            Acropolis with the view of making himself master of <lb/>
            Athens, Timasitheus joined him, and was one of those who <lb/>
            were captured, and put to death by the Athenians for his <lb/>
            share in the matter.</p><pb n="377"/>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the statue of Theognetus of Ægina, who was <lb/>
            crowned for wrestling among the boys, is by Ptolichus <lb/>
            of Ægina, the pupil of his father Synnoon, who was him­ <lb/>
            self the pupil of Aristocles of Sicyon, the brother of Cana­ <lb/>
            chus and as famous as a statuary. But why Theognetus <lb/>
            carries in his hand the fruit of the cultivated pine and <lb/>
            pomegranate I cannot conjecture, perhaps among some of <lb/>
            the Æginetans there is some national legend about him. <lb/>
            And next to the statue of the man who the people of Elis <lb/>
            say was not registered with the rest, because he was <lb/>
            proclaimed victor in the trotting-race,1 is the statue of <lb/>
            Xenocles of Maenalus, who beat all the boys in wrestling, <lb/>
            and Alcetus the son of Alcinous, who beat all the boys in <lb/>
            boxing, an Arcadian from Clitor. His statue is by Cleon, <lb/>
            and Xenocles' by Polycletus. And the statue of the Argive <lb/>
            Aristeus, who won the prize in the long course, is by the <lb/>
            Chian Pantias, a pupil of his father Sostratus: and next to <lb/>
            him is the statue of Chimon, the father of Aristeus, who <lb/>
            won the prize for wrestling. His statues are in my opinion <lb/>
            the finest works of art of Naucydes, one is at Olympia, and <lb/>
            the other was carried from Argos to the temple of Peace in <lb/>
            Rome. It is also said that Chimon beat Taurosthenes of <lb/>
            Ægina in wrestling, and that in the following Olympiad <lb/>
            Taurosthenes beat all comers in wrestling, and the same <lb/>
            day an apparition very like Taurosthenes appeared at <lb/>
            Ægina and announced his victory. And the statue of <lb/>
            Philles of Elis, who beat all the boys in wrestling, is by <lb/>
            the Spartan Cratinus. As to the chariot of Gelon, I can­ <lb/>
            not agree with the opinion of those who have written <lb/>
            before me, who say that it was a votive offering of Gelon <lb/>
            the tyrant of Syracuse. The inscription says that it was a <lb/>
            votive offering of Gelon of Gela, the son of Dinomenes, who <lb/>
            was a victor in the 73rd Olympiad. But Gelon the tyrant <lb/>
            of Sicily was master of Syracuse when Hybilides was <lb/>
            Archon at Athens, in the second year of the 72nd Olympiad, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book v., ch. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            in which Tisicrates of Croton won the race in the stadium. <lb/>
            Manifestly therefore he would have been entered for the <lb/>
            race as a Syracusan, and not as a native of Gela. So this <lb/>
            Gelon would be some private person, having merely the <lb/>
            same name as the Tyrant. And Glaucias the Æginetan I <lb/>
            made both the chariot and statue of Gelon.</p>
          <p>In the Olympiad previous to this they say that Cleo­ <lb/>
            medes of Astypalsea, boxing with Iccus from Epidaurus, <lb/>
            killed him, and was condemned by the Umpires to be de­ <lb/>
            prived of his prize, and went out of his mind for grief, and <lb/>
            returned to Astypalæa, and standing in a school when <lb/>
            there were about 60 scholars pulled away the pillar which <lb/>
            supported the roof, and when the roof fell in on the boys <lb/>
            he was pelted with stones by the citizens, and fled for <lb/>
            refuge to the temple of Athene : and getting into a chest <lb/>
            which was lying in the temple, and clapping down the lid, I <lb/>
            the people of Astypalæa had immense labour to open the <lb/>
            chest. At last they broke open the woodwork, and found <lb/>
            no Cleomedes either alive or dead, and sent messengers to <lb/>
            Delphi to inquire what had become of him. The Pythian <lb/>
            Priestess they say returned this answer, <lb/>
            " Last of the heroes is Cleomedes of Astypalsea, honour <lb/>
            him with sacrifices as no longer a mortal."</p>
          <p>From that time forward the people of Astypalsea pay <lb/>
            honours to him as a hero.</p>
          <p>And next to the chariot of Gelon is the statue of Philo <lb/>
            by the Æginetan Glaucias. On this Philo Simonides, the <lb/>
            son of Leoprepes, wrote the very apt elegiac couplet: <lb/>
            " My country is Corcyra, my name .Philo. I am the son <lb/>
            of Glaucus, and have won prizes for boxing in two Olym­ <lb/>
            piads."</p>
          <p>There is also a statue of the Mantinean Agametor, who <lb/>
            beat all the boys in boxing.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER X.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next to those I have mentioned is Glaucus of Cary- <lb/>
            A stus, who they say was originally from Anthedon in <lb/>
            Boeotia, and traced his descent from Glaucus the god of the <lb/>
            sea. He was the son of Demylus, and they say originally <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            was a husbandman. And once when the ploughshare came <lb/>
            off his plough, he put it on again using his hand instead of a <lb/>
            hammer. And Demylus marvelled at his son's strength, and <lb/>
            in consequence sent him to Olympia as a boxer. And there <lb/>
            Glaucus, being unpractised in that kind of contest, was <lb/>
            badly handled by his antagonists, and, while boxing with <lb/>
            the last remaining of them, seemed likely to faint away <lb/>
            from his punishment. And they say his father cried out, <lb/>
            My boy, remember the ploughshare. Then he put in a terrible <lb/>
            blow at his antagonist, and won the prize. He is said also <lb/>
            to have been twice crowned at the Pythian games, and <lb/>
            eight times in the demean and Isthmian games. The <lb/>
            statue of Glaucus was erected by his son, but was made by <lb/>
            Glaucias the Æginetan. And the statue is in the attitude <lb/>
            of one boxing, for Glaucus was the most clever of all his <lb/>
            contemporaries in the noble Science. And after his death <lb/>
            the people of Carystus say that he was buried in the island <lb/>
            still called Glaucus' island.</p>
          <p>And Damaretus of Heræa, and the son and grandson of <lb/>
            Damaretus, had two victories each at Olympia, Damaretus <lb/>
            in the 65th Olympiad, when first the race in heavy armour <lb/>
            was instituted, and also in the next Olympiad. His statue <lb/>
            has a shield like those in use in our day, and a helmet on <lb/>
            the head, and greaves on the feet. This race in heavy <lb/>
            armour was abandoned eventually by the people of Elis and <lb/>
            all the Greeks. And Theopompus, the son of Damaretus, <lb/>
            and afterwards his grandson of the same name won the <lb/>
            prize in the pentathlum, and the grandson Theopompus <lb/>
            won prizes also for wrestling; who made his statue we do <lb/>
            not know, but the statues of his father and grandfather <lb/>
            were according to the inscription by the Argives Eutelidas <lb/>
            and Chrysothemis. It does not however state from whom <lb/>
            they learnt their art. This is the inscription.</p>
          <p>" The Argives Eutelidas and Chrysothemis made these <lb/>
            statues, having learnt their art from former generations."</p>
          <p>And Icons the son of Nicolaidas the Tarentine won the <lb/>
            prize at Olympia in the pentathlum, and afterwards be­ <lb/>
            came the best trainer of his day. And next to Iccus is the <lb/>
            statue of Pantarces of Elis, who beat all the boys in wrest­ <lb/>
            ling, and was beloved by Phidias. And next to Pantarces <lb/>
            is the chariot of Cleosthenes, a man of Epidamnus, by <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            Ageladas, behind the Zens erected by the Greeks after the <lb/>
            battle of Platea. He conquered in the 66th Olympiad, <lb/>
            and he erected not only his own statue but also that of <lb/>
            his charioteer and horses. And the names inscribed on <lb/>
            the horses are Phoenix and Corax, and of those in the <lb/>
            traces, on the right Cnacias, and on the left Samos. And <lb/>
            there is this elegiac couplet on the chariot: <lb/>
            " Cleosthenes the Pontian from Epidamnus erected me, <lb/>
            after winning the prize with his horses in the noble contest <lb/>
            of Zeus."</p>
          <p>And of all that reared horses among the Greeks this <lb/>
            Cleosthenes was the first that erected his statue at Olympia. <lb/>
            For the votive offering of Euagoras the Lacedæmonian is <lb/>
            only his chariot, and not Euagoras in it: and as to Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades the Athenian, what he erected at Olympia I shall <lb/>
            narrate elsewhere. And the Epidamnians have the same <lb/>
            territory as formerly, but the town in our days is not the <lb/>
            old one, but one at a little distance : and its name is now <lb/>
            Dyrrhachium from its founder.</p>
          <p>And there is a statue of Lycinus, the native of Heræa <lb/>
            who won in the race for boys, by Cleon, and of three who <lb/>
            won victories among the boys for boxing, Epicradius of <lb/>
            Mantinea by Ptolichus of Ægina, and Tellon the Ores­ <lb/>
            thasian by what statuary is not on record, and Agiadas of <lb/>
            Elis by Serambus of Ægina.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>N <lb/>
            EXT to these are votive offerings of the people of Elis, <lb/>
            as Philip the son of Amyntas, and Alexander the son <lb/>
            of Philip, and Seleucus, and Antigonus; the statues of all <lb/>
            but Antigonus are on horseback, he alone is on foot.</p>
          <p>And not far from these kings is a statue of Theagenes <lb/>
            of Thasos, the son of Timosthenes. But the Thasians say <lb/>
            that he was not the son of Timosthenes, who was a priest <lb/>
            of Hercules at Thasos, but that Hercules disguised as <lb/>
            Timosthenes had an intrigue with the mother of Theagenes. <lb/>
            And when the lad was nine years of age, and was going <lb/>
            home from school, he fancied they say the brazen statue <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            of one of the gods in the market-place, and seized it and <lb/>
            put it upon one of his shoulders and took it home. And <lb/>
            the citizens being angry with him for what he had done, a <lb/>
            man of repute and advanced age would not let them kill the <lb/>
            lad, but bade him restore the statue back to its place, and <lb/>
            he did so. And immediately the fame of the lad for <lb/>
            strength spread abroad, and his exploit was talked of all <lb/>
            over Greece. The most notable of his exploits at Olympia <lb/>
            . I have already recorded, and how he beat Euthymus in <lb/>
            boxing, and how he was fined by the people of Elis. At <lb/>
            that time Dromeus of Mantinea won the victory in the <lb/>
            pancratium, for the first time on record without a con­ <lb/>
            test. But he was beaten by Theagenes the Olympiad after­ <lb/>
            wards in the pancratium. And Theagenes had three vic­ <lb/>
            tories in the Pythian games for boxing, and 9 at Nemea <lb/>
            and 10 at the Isthmus for the pancratium and boxing to­ <lb/>
            gether. And at Phthia in Thessaly he neglected boxing <lb/>
            and the pancratium, and endeavoured to become illustrious <lb/>
            among the Greeks in racing, and beat all comers in the <lb/>
            long course. I cannot but think he was desirous of emu­ <lb/>
            lating Achilles, and to win in the race in the country of the <lb/>
            swiftest of heroes. All the crowns he won were as many <lb/>
            as 1400. And when he died, one of his enemies went up <lb/>
            to his statue every night, and scourged the brass as if it <lb/>
            were Theagenes alive he was maltreating. But at last the <lb/>
            statue fell on him and killed him and so stopped his outrage, <lb/>
            but after his death his sons indicted the statue for murder: <lb/>
            and the Thasians threw the statue into the sea, obeying <lb/>
            the code of Draco, who in legislating for the Athenians <lb/>
            banished even inanimate things if they killed anyone by <lb/>
            falling upon him. But in process of time, as the earth <lb/>
            yielded no fruit to the Thasians, they sent envoys to <lb/>
            Delphi, and the god bade them restore from exile those <lb/>
            that had been banished. Some were accordingly recalled <lb/>
            from exile, but the dearth was not removed. They went <lb/>
            therefore a second time to Delphi, saying that, though <lb/>
            they had done what the oracle ordered, yet the wrath of <lb/>
            the gods remained. Then the Pythian Priestess answered. <lb/>
            " Your great Theagenes you have forgotten." <lb/>
            And when they were quite in despair how, to recover the <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            statue of Theagenes, some fishermen (they say) putting <lb/>
            out to sea for the purpose of catching fish caught the <lb/>
            statue in their net and brought it to land. And the <lb/>
            Thasians restoring it to its original site sacrificed to it as to <lb/>
            a god. And I know that there are statues of Theagenes in <lb/>
            various parts of Greece and among the barbarians also, and <lb/>
            that he is reckoned to cure diseases, and has various <lb/>
            honours from the people of Thasos. His statue in Altis is <lb/>
            by the Æginetan Glaucias.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND at no great distance is a brazen chariot and a man <lb/>
            in it, and some race-horses are on each side of it, and <lb/>
            boys on the horses. They are memorials of the victories in <lb/>
            the Olympian contests of Hiero the son of Dinomenes, the <lb/>
            tyrant of Syracuse after his brother Gelon. They were not <lb/>
            however sent by Hiero, but Dinomenes the son of Hiero <lb/>
            offered them to the god. The chariot is by Onatas the <lb/>
            Æginetan, and the horses on both sides and the boys on <lb/>
            them are by Calamis.</p>
          <p>And next to the chariot of Hiero is Hiero the son of <lb/>
            Hierocles, of the same name as the son of Dinomenes, and <lb/>
            also himself tyrant of Syracuse. This Hiero after the <lb/>
            death of Agathocles, the former tyrant of Syracuse, rose to <lb/>
            the same power in the second year of the 126th Olympiad, <lb/>
            in which Idæus of Cyrene won in the stadium. This Hiero <lb/>
            had friendly relations with Pyrrhus the son of AEacides and <lb/>
            became his kinsman by marriage, Gelon his son marrying <lb/>
            Nereis Pyrrhus' daughter. And when the Romans fought <lb/>
            with the Carthaginians for the possession of Sicily the <lb/>
            Carthaginians had more than half the island, and on the <lb/>
            commencement of the war Hiero resolved to throw in his <lb/>
            lot with the Carthaginians, but in no long time thinking <lb/>
            the Roman power stronger and likely to be more lasting he <lb/>
            joined them. He was assassinated by Dinomenes, a Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan who had an especial hatred to tyranny, and who <lb/>
            afterwards endeavoured to kill Hippocrates the brother of <lb/>
            Epicydes, who had just come to Syracuse from Erbessus <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            and was endeavouring to talk over the people. But he <lb/>
            defended himself, and some of his guards came up and cut <lb/>
            Dinomenes to pieces. And the statues of Hiero in Olympia, <lb/>
            one on horseback and the other on foot, were erected by <lb/>
            his sons, and made by the Syracusan Mico the son of <lb/>
            Niceratus.</p>
          <p>And next to the statues of Hiero are Areus, the son of <lb/>
            Acrotatus, king of the Lacedæmonians, and Aratus the son <lb/>
            of Clinias, and a second one of Areus on horseback: that of <lb/>
            Aratus is the votive offering of the Corinthians, that of <lb/>
            Areus of the men of Elis. Of both Aratus and Areas I <lb/>
            have given an account earlier in this work. Aratns was <lb/>
            also proclaimed victor at Olympia in the chariot-race. And <lb/>
            Timon, the son of Ægyptus, who entered horses at Olympia, <lb/>
            a native of Elis, has a brazen chariot, and on it a maiden who <lb/>
            I think is Victory. And Gallon the son of Harmodius and <lb/>
            Hippomachus the son of Moschion, both of Elis and victors <lb/>
            among boys in the boxing, have statues, Callon's is by <lb/>
            Daippus, we do not know who designed Hippomachus', <lb/>
            but they say he wrestled down three antagonists and re­ <lb/>
            ceived no blow or hurt. And the inscription on the <lb/>
            chariot states that Theochrestus of Cyrene, (who trained <lb/>
            horses according to the national custom of the Libyans), <lb/>
            and his grandfather also of the same name, had victories <lb/>
            with their horses at Olympia, and that the father of Theo­ <lb/>
            chrestus was victorious at the Isthmian games. And that <lb/>
            Agesarchus of Tritæa the son of Hæmostratus beat men in <lb/>
            boxing at the Olympian Nemean Pythian and Isthmian <lb/>
            games is stated in an elegiac couplet, which also states un­ <lb/>
            truly, as I have discovered, that the people of Tritæa are <lb/>
            Arcadians. For of the towns that have attained celebrity <lb/>
            in Arcadia all about their founders is well known, and those <lb/>
            that were obscure from their origin, and lost their popula­ <lb/>
            tion through their weakness, were absorbed into Megalopolis <lb/>
            by a decree from the commonalty of the Arcadians. Nor can <lb/>
            we find any other Tritæa in Greece but the one in Achaia. <lb/>
            One would infer therefore that the people of Tritaea were <lb/>
            reckoned among the Arcadians, as now some of the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians are reckoned in Argolis. And the statue of Agesar­ <lb/>
            chus is by the sons of Polycles, of whom we shall make <lb/>
            mention later on.</p><pb n="384"/>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the statue of Astylus of Croton is by Pythagoras, <lb/>
            he was victorious at three Olympiads in succession in <lb/>
            the stade and in the double course. But because in the two <lb/>
            latter Olympiads he entered himself as a Syracusan, to in­ <lb/>
            gratiate himself with Hiero the son of Dinomenes, the <lb/>
            people of Croton voted that his house should be turned into <lb/>
            a public prison, and removed his statue from the temple <lb/>
            of Lacinian Hera.</p>
          <p>There is also at Olympia a pillar which recounts the <lb/>
            victories of the Lacedaemonian Chionis. They are simple <lb/>
            who think that Chionis erected this statue himself, and not <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonian public. For granted that there is on the <lb/>
            pillar no mention of a race in heavy armour, how could <lb/>
            Chionis know that the people of Elis'would not one day in­ <lb/>
            stitute one ? They are still more simple who think that <lb/>
            the statue on the pillar is by Chionis, seeing it is by <lb/>
            the Athenian Myro.</p>
          <p>Very similar fame to that of Chionis was won by the <lb/>
            Lycian Hermogenes Xanthius, who won the wild olive <lb/>
            crown eight times in three Olympiads, and was nicknamed <lb/>
            Horse by the Greeks. Polites too you would hold in great <lb/>
            admiration. He was from Ceramus in Caria, and mani­ <lb/>
            fested great swiftness of foot at Olympia. For he won the <lb/>
            longest race in the shortest time on record, and on the same <lb/>
            day he won the long race, and the race in the stadium, and <lb/>
            the double race. And on the second day, when they only <lb/>
            allow four chosen by lot to compete in the race and not all <lb/>
            comers, and the victors in each department only contend <lb/>
            for these prizes, Polites was victor again: for the person <lb/>
            who is crowned for the race in the stadium will go off with <lb/>
            two victories. However the most remarkable victories in <lb/>
            the race were won by Leonidas of Rhodes, for in four <lb/>
            Olympiads he was in his prime, and 12 times conqueror <lb/>
            through his swiftness of foot. And not far from the pillar <lb/>
            of Chionis at Olympia is the statue of Scæus the Samian, <lb/>
            the son of Duris, who beat all the boys in boxing, his statue <lb/>
            is by Hippias, and the inscription on it states, that Scæus <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            was victor when the Samian populace fled from their island, <lb/>
            and the statue was put up when they were restored. And <lb/>
            next to the tyrant is a statue of Diallus the son of Poll is, a <lb/>
            native of Smyrna, and the inscription states that he was the <lb/>
            first Ionian that won the prize in the pancratium for boys. <lb/>
            And the statues of Thersilochus of Corcyra, and Aristion of <lb/>
            Epidaurus, the son of Theophiles, the latter victor in boxing <lb/>
            among men, the former among boys, are by the Argive <lb/>
            Polycletus. And the statue of Bycelus, who was the first <lb/>
            of the Sicyonians to conquer among boys in boxing, is by <lb/>
            the Sicyonian Canachus, who was a pupil of the Argive <lb/>
            Polycletus. And next to Bycelus is the hoplite Mnaseas of <lb/>
            Cyrene, surnamed Libyan, by Pythagoras of Rhegium. <lb/>
            And the inscription on Agemachus of Cyzicus states that <lb/>
            he came to Argos from the mainland of Asia Minor. As <lb/>
            to Naxos in Sicily, which was colonized by some of the <lb/>
            Chalcidians Dear the Euripus, there are no ruins even of <lb/>
            the town in our day, and that its name has come down to <lb/>
            posterity is mainly due to Tisander the son of Cleocritus. <lb/>
            For 4 times he beat all the men in boxing at Olympia, and <lb/>
            had as many victories in the Pythian games. There was <lb/>
            not at that time any record of the victors in the Corinthian <lb/>
            games, nor did the Argives keep any record of the victors <lb/>
            in the Nemean games.</p>
          <p>And the mare of the Corinthian Phidolas, which was <lb/>
            called as the Corinthians inform us Aura, though its rider <lb/>
            fell off at the beginning of the race, yet ran straight and <lb/>
            turned at the goal, and when it heard the sound of the <lb/>
            trumpet ran on all the faster, and beat all the other horses <lb/>
            by the decision of the Umpires, and knew that it had come <lb/>
            in first, and stopt running. And the people of Elis pro­ <lb/>
            claimed Phidolas victor, and allowed him to set up a statue <lb/>
            of this mare. The sons of Phidolas also won victories on <lb/>
            a race-horse, and a statue of the horse was put on a pillar <lb/>
            with the following inscription.</p>
          <p>" Once in the Isthmian games, twice at Olympia, did <lb/>
            Lycus the swift courser win the race, and honour for the <lb/>
            sons of Phidolas."</p>
          <p>However this inscription and the records in Elis of the <lb/>
            victors at Olympia do not tally, for in the 68th Olympiad <lb/>
            only do those records record any victory of the sons of <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            Phidolas, Let anyone inquire into this further who likes. <lb/>
            And there are statues of Agathinus the son of Thrasybulus, <lb/>
            and Telemachus who was victorious with his horses, the <lb/>
            former was an offering of the Achæans of Pellene. The <lb/>
            Athenian people also set up a statue to Aristophon the <lb/>
            son of Lycinus who beat all the men in the pancratium at <lb/>
            Olympia.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Pherias the Æginetan, whose statue is next the <lb/>
            A Athenian Aristophon, was not allowed in the 78th <lb/>
            Olympiad to enter the contest because he appeared very <lb/>
            young, and was not thought fit to compete in the wrestling, <lb/>
            but the following year he was allowed to wrestle among the <lb/>
            boys and won the prize. A different fortune to this of <lb/>
            Pherias was that of Nicasylus the Rhodian at Olympia. <lb/>
            For being 18 he was not allowed to contend with the boys <lb/>
            by the people of Elis, but was entered as a man and won the <lb/>
            prize. He was proclaimed victor also at the Nemean and <lb/>
            Isthmian games. But he died in his 20th year, before he <lb/>
            could return home to Rhodes. But the feat of this Rhodian <lb/>
            wrestler at Olympia was outdone in my opinion by Arte­ <lb/>
            midorus of Tralles. He was unsuccessful at Olympia <lb/>
            in his endeavour to win the pancratium among the boys, <lb/>
            but the reason of his failure was his excessive youth. <lb/>
            For when the season came for the contest which the <lb/>
            Ionians have at Smyrna his strength had become so great <lb/>
            that he beat on the same day all his antagonists from <lb/>
            Olympia in the pancratium, and all the boys that they call <lb/>
            unbearded, and thirdly all the best of the men. And <lb/>
            they say that he was cheered on by the trainer in the con­ <lb/>
            test with the boys, but that in the contest with the men he <lb/>
            was reviled by the pancratiast. And Artemidorus won at <lb/>
            Olympia the victory among men in the 212th Olympiad. <lb/>
            And near the statue of Nicasylus is a small brazen horse, <lb/>
            the votive offering of Crocon of Eretria when he won the <lb/>
            victory with a race-horse, and near this horse is an effigy of <lb/>
            Telestas the Messenian, who beat all the boys in boxing, by <lb/>
            Silanion.</p><pb n="387"/>
            
          <p>And the statue of Milo the son of Diotimus is by Dameas, <lb/>
            both natives of Croton. This Milo had six prizes for wrest­ <lb/>
            ling at Olympia, one of them among boys, and at Pythia <lb/>
            six among men and one among boys. And he came to <lb/>
            Olympia to wrestle for the 7th time. But he could not - <lb/>
            beat in wrestling Timasitheus, a citizen and quite young, as <lb/>
            Timasitheus would not contend with him at close quarters <lb/>
            in the arena at all. And Milo is said to have carried <lb/>
            his own statue to Altis. There are also traditions about <lb/>
            Milo in reference to a pomegranate and a quoit. He held <lb/>
            a pomegranate so fast that nobody could get it from him, <lb/>
            and yet he did not hurt it. And on one occasion standing on <lb/>
            an oiled quoit he excited laughter among those who jostled <lb/>
            him and tried to push him off it. And several other <lb/>
            things he did in display. He tied a cord round his fore­ <lb/>
            head as if it were a fillet or a crown, and holding his <lb/>
            breath and filling the veins of his head with blood he would <lb/>
            snap the cord by the strength of his veins. It is recorded <lb/>
            also that he would place against his side his right arm from <lb/>
            the elbow to the shoulder, and stretch out the hand, and <lb/>
            turn his thumb up while the fingers remained together, <lb/>
            and no one could with any exertion move the little finger <lb/>
            from its place. And they say he was killed by wild beasts. <lb/>
            For he chanced in the country near Croton on a withered <lb/>
            tree, in which some wedges were driven to separate the <lb/>
            wood, and he took it into his head to keep the wood apart <lb/>
            with his hands. And the wedges slipt out and he was im­ <lb/>
            prisoned in the tree, and became a prey to the wolves, which <lb/>
            prowl about in great numbers in that neighbourhood. Such <lb/>
            was the end of Milo.</p>
          <p>And Pyrrhus the son of AEacides having been king in <lb/>
            Thesprotia in Epirus, and having done many remarkable <lb/>
            deeds, which I have described in my account of Attica, <lb/>
            Thrasybulus of Elis erected his statue in Altis. And next <lb/>
            to Pyrrhus is the statue of a little man with pipes in his <lb/>
            hand on a pillar. This man had a prize for his piping, the <lb/>
            first time such prizes were bestowed since the Argive <lb/>
            Sacadas. Sacadas first conquered in the games established <lb/>
            by the Amphictyonians (when no prize was given), and <lb/>
            after that he won two prizes. And Pythocritus of Sicyon <lb/>
            won in six of the Pythian contests successively, being the <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            only piper. It is plain also at the contest at Olympia that <lb/>
            he was piper six times in the pentathlum. For all this he <lb/>
            had a pillar at Olympia with the inscription on it, <lb/>
            " This is the memorial of Pythocritus, (the son of Callini­ <lb/>
            cus), the piper."</p>
          <p>The Ætolians also erected a public statue to Cylon, who <lb/>
            freed the people of -Elis from the tyranny of Aristotimus. <lb/>
            And Gorgus the Messenian, the son of Eucletus, who won <lb/>
            the victory in the pentathlum has a statue by the Boeotian <lb/>
            Theron, and Damaretus, also a Messenian, who beat all the <lb/>
            boys in boxing has a statue by the Athenian Silanion. <lb/>
            And Anauchidas of Elis, the son of Philys, won a wrestling <lb/>
            prize among the boys and afterwards among the men. <lb/>
            Who his statue is by we do not know. And the statue of <lb/>
            Anochus the Tarentine, the son of Adamatas, who won the <lb/>
            victory both in the stadium and in the double course, is by <lb/>
            Ageladas the Argive. And the boy seated on a horse and <lb/>
            the man standing by the horse are as the inscription says <lb/>
            Xenombrotus of Cos in Meropis, who was proclaimed <lb/>
            victor in the horse-race, and Xenodicus who was proclaimed <lb/>
            victor in the boxing matches for boys, the latter is by Pan­ <lb/>
            tias, and the former by Philotimus of Ægina. And the <lb/>
            two statues of Pythes, the son of Andromachus, an Abderite, <lb/>
            were made by Lysippus, but his soldiers had them made. <lb/>
            Pythes seems to have been a leader of mercenaries, or <lb/>
            in some other way to have shewn himself a good soldier.</p>
          <p>Here are also statues of those who won prizes in the <lb/>
            course for boys, as Meneptolemus from Apollonia on the <lb/>
            Ionian gulf, and Philo from Corcyra, and Hieronymus from <lb/>
            Andros, who beat Tisamenus of Elis in the pentathlum at <lb/>
            Olympia, that Tisamenus who was afterwards a prophet <lb/>
            for the Greeks against Mardonius and the Medes at Platæa. <lb/>
            And next to the statue of Hieronymus is the statue of a boy- <lb/>
            wrestler also from Andros, Procles the son of Lycastidas. <lb/>
            Stomius made the statue of Hieronymus, and So mis that <lb/>
            of Procles. And Æschines of Elis had two victories in the <lb/>
            pentathlum, and has two statues.</p><pb n="389"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND Archippus of Mitylene, who beat all comers at <lb/>
            boxing, had according to the Mitylenæans this further <lb/>
            fame, that he was crowned at the Olympian Pythian <lb/>
            Nemean and Isthmian games when he was only 20. And <lb/>
            the statue of Xenon, the son of Calliteles, of Lepreus in <lb/>
            Triphylia, who beat all the boys in the stadium, was made <lb/>
            by the Messenian Pyrilampes ; we do not know who made <lb/>
            the statue of Clinomachus of Elis, who was proclaimed <lb/>
            victor in the pentathlum. And the inscription of the <lb/>
            Achæans on Pantarches' statue states that he was a native <lb/>
            of Elis ; he made peace between the Achæans and people <lb/>
            of Elis, and all the prisoners who were captured on both <lb/>
            sides were let go mainly through him. He won his victory <lb/>
            on a race-horse, and there is a record of his victory at <lb/>
            Olympia. And the statue of Olidas of Elis was set up by <lb/>
            the Ætolians. And Charinus of Elis has a statue for the <lb/>
            double course and for a victory in heavy armour, and near <lb/>
            him is Ageles the Chian, who beat all the boys in boxing, <lb/>
            by Theomnestus of Sardis.</p>
          <p>And the statue of Clitomachus the Theban was erected <lb/>
            by Hermocrates his father. His exploits were as follows. <lb/>
            In the Isthmian games he beat all comers in wrestling, and <lb/>
            on one day won prizes from all competitors in boxing and <lb/>
            in the pancratium. And all his 3 victories in the Pythian <lb/>
            games were in the pancratium. And at Olympia he was <lb/>
            proclaimed second to Theagenes of Thasos in the pancra­ <lb/>
            tium and in boxing. And in the 141st Olympiad he won <lb/>
            the prize in the pancratium. And the next Olympiad found <lb/>
            him a competitor in the pancratium and in boxing, and <lb/>
            Caprus of Elis was on the same day anxious to compete in <lb/>
            the pancratium and in wrestling. And when Caprus had <lb/>
            won the wrestling-prize, Clitomachus hinted to the umpires <lb/>
            that it was only fair to call for the pancratium before he <lb/>
            was battered about by boxing. What he said seemed <lb/>
            reasonable, and when the pancratium was called on he <lb/>
            was beaten by Caprus, though he exhibited afterwards in <lb/>
            the boxing a stout heart and untired body.</p><pb n="390"/>
            
          <p>And the Ionians of Erythrae erected a statue to Epi­ <lb/>
            therses the son of Metrodorns, who won two victories in <lb/>
            boxing at Olympia, and two at each of the Pythian Nemean <lb/>
            and Isthmian games, and the Syracusan public erected two <lb/>
            statues to Hiero, and his sons erected a third. As I stated <lb/>
            a little above this Hiero had the same name as the son of <lb/>
            Dinomenes, and was like him Tyrant of Syracuse. And <lb/>
            the inhabitants of Pale, one of the four tribes in Cephal­ <lb/>
            lenia, set up a statue to Timoptolis of Elis the son of <lb/>
            Lampis. These people of Pale were originally called <lb/>
            Dulichii. There is also a statue of Archidamus the son of <lb/>
            Agesilaus, and a man like a hunter. And the statues of <lb/>
            Demetrius, who led an army against Seleucus and was <lb/>
            taken prisoner in the battle, and of Antigonus the son of <lb/>
            Demetrius, were let any one know votive offerings of the <lb/>
            Byzantians. And the Spartan Eutelidas had two victories <lb/>
            for wrestling among the boys in the 308th Olympiad, and a <lb/>
            third in the pentathlum: at that time the boys were called <lb/>
            on first, and last in the pentathlum. And there is an <lb/>
            ancient statue of Eutelidas, the writing on the base is ob­ <lb/>
            scure through lapse of time. And next to Eutelidas is <lb/>
            another one of Areus, the king of the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            next him Gorgus of Elis, who is the only man up to my <lb/>
            day who had four victories at Olympia in the pentathlum, <lb/>
            and one victory for the double course, and one for the race <lb/>
            in heavy armour.</p>
          <p>And the person by whom some boys are standing is they <lb/>
            say Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and next him are two statues <lb/>
            of Caprus of Elis, the son of Pythagoras, who won on the <lb/>
            same day for the first time on record prizes for wrestling <lb/>
            and the pancratium. I have already shown how successful <lb/>
            he was against Clitomachus in the pancratium, and he <lb/>
            beat in wrestling Pæanius of Elis, who had carried off the <lb/>
            prize for wrestling in former Olympiads, and had been <lb/>
            crowned in the Pythian games on the same day for boxing <lb/>
            among boys, and for wrestling and boxing among men.</p><pb n="391"/>

          <p>C <lb/>
            APRUS won his victories not without great effort and <lb/>
            mighty energy : and Anauchidas and Pherenicus, who <lb/>
            were natives of Elis, had statues at Olympia, and won prizes <lb/>
            for wrestling among the boys. And the Thespians erected <lb/>
            the statue of Plistænus, the son of Eurydamus, who was <lb/>
            the general of the Ætolians against the Galati. And Tydeus <lb/>
            of Elis erected statues to Antigonus, the father of Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, and to Seleucus. And the name of Seleucus was <lb/>
            noised abroad among all men on other accounts but chiefly <lb/>
            for his capture of Demetrius. And Timon won victories <lb/>
            in the pentathlum in all the Greek games but the Isthmian <lb/>
            (for like all the other men of Elis he was shut out of com­ <lb/>
            petition in them), and the inscription on his statue mentions <lb/>
            this further particular about him, that he took part in the <lb/>
            expedition of the Ætolians against the Thessalians, and <lb/>
            out of friendship to the Ætolians was leader of the gar­ <lb/>
            rison at Naupactus. And not far from the statue of Timon <lb/>
            are statues of Greece and Elis in juxtaposition : Greece <lb/>
            with one hand crowning Antigonus, the Regent for Philip <lb/>
            the son of Demetrius, and with the other Philip himself ; <lb/>
            and Elis crowning Demetrius, who marched against Seleu­ <lb/>
            cus, and Ptolemy the son of Lagus.</p>
          <p>And the inscription on his statue states that Aristides of <lb/>
            Elis won a victory in heavy armour at Olympia, and in the <lb/>
            double course in the Pythian games, and as a boy in the <lb/>
            horse-race at Kemea. The length of the horse-race is <lb/>
            twice the double course. This race, which had fallen into <lb/>
            desuetude at the Nemean and Isthmian games, was restored <lb/>
            by the Emperor Adrian to the Argives at the winter games <lb/>
            at Nemea.</p>
          <p>And next to the statue of Aristides is Menalcas of Elis, <lb/>
            who was proclaimed victor at Olympia in the pentathlum, <lb/>
            and Philonides the son of Zotus, who was from the Cretan <lb/>
            Chersonese, and the courier of Alexander the son of Philip. <lb/>
            And next is Brimias of Elis, who beat all the men in box­ <lb/>
            ing, and the statue of Leonidas from Xaxos in the Ægæan, <lb/>
            the votive offering of the Psophidian Arcadians, and the <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            statue of Asamon who beat all the men in boxing, and that <lb/>
            of Nicander, who had two victories at Olympia in the <lb/>
            double course, and six at Nemea for racing generally. <lb/>
            Asamon and Nicander were both natives of Elis, and the <lb/>
            statue of the latter was by Daippus, that of the former by <lb/>
            the Messenian Pyrilampes. There are statues also to <lb/>
            Eualcidas of Elis and Seleadas the Lacedæmonian, the <lb/>
            former was victor among the boys in boxing, the latter in <lb/>
            wrestling among the men. Here too is the small chariot of <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonian Polypithes, and on the same pillar <lb/>
            Calliteles (the father of Polypithes) the wrestler, who won <lb/>
            victories by his wrestling, as Polypithes by his horses. <lb/>
            And the statues of some private individuals of Elis, as <lb/>
            Lampus the son of Arniscus, and the son of Aristarchus, <lb/>
            were erected by the Psophidian Arcadians, either because <lb/>
            they were their Consuls, or were otherwise friendly to them. <lb/>
            And between them is Lysippus of Elis, who beat all boys who <lb/>
            contended with him in wrestling, his statue is by Andreas <lb/>
            the Argive.</p>
          <p>And the Lacedaemonian Dinosthenes won a victory over <lb/>
            men at Olympia in the course, and set up a pillar in Altis <lb/>
            next to his statue : the distance from this pillar by road <lb/>
            to another pillar at Lacedæmon is 660 stades. And Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus, who was victor in the pentathlum, and Pyttalus, <lb/>
            the son of Lampis, who beat all the boys in boxing, and <lb/>
            Nicolaidas, who carried off the victory in the course and <lb/>
            in the race in heavy armour, were let any one know natives <lb/>
            of Elis. As to Pyttalus they record still further that, when <lb/>
            there was a dispute between the Arcadians and the men of <lb/>
            Elis about their borders, he was made the arbitrator. <lb/>
            His statue is by the Olynthian Sthennis. And next is a <lb/>
            statue of Ptolemy on horseback, and by him the athlete of <lb/>
            Elis Pæanius the son of Demetrius, who won one prize for <lb/>
            wrestling at Olympia, and two in the Pythian games. <lb/>
            There too is Clearetus of Elis, who won in the pentathlum, <lb/>
            and the chariot of the Athenian Glaucon (the son of Eteo­ <lb/>
            cles), who was proclaimed victor in the chariot race with <lb/>
            a full-grown horse.</p><pb n="393"/>

          <p>W <lb/>
            HAT I have just mentioned are the most notable <lb/>
            things as you approach Altis, but, if you go on the <lb/>
            right from the monument of Leonidas to the great altar, you <lb/>
            will behold the following memorable objects. There are <lb/>
            statues of Democrates of Tenedos and Criannius of Elis, the <lb/>
            latter victor in the contest in heavy armour, the former in <lb/>
            wrestling among men. The statue of Democrates is by the <lb/>
            Milesian Dionysicles, that of Criannius by the Macedonian <lb/>
            Lysus. And the Clazomenian Herodotus, and the Coan <lb/>
            Philinus, the son of Hegepolis, have statues erected to them <lb/>
            by their native cities, to Herodotus because he was the first <lb/>
            Clazomenian pronounced victor (his victory was among <lb/>
            boys in the course), and to Philinus because of his renown, <lb/>
            for he had five victories in running at Olympia, and four <lb/>
            in the Pythian games, four in the Nemean, and eleven in <lb/>
            the Isthmian. And the statue of Ptolemy, the son of <lb/>
            Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, was the offering of Aristolaus a <lb/>
            Macedonian. There is also a statue of a boxer who was <lb/>
            victorious over boys, Butas the Milesian, the son of Poly­ <lb/>
            nices, and Callicrates from Magnesia near the river Lethæus, <lb/>
            who won two victories in the race in heavy armour. His <lb/>
            statue is by Lysippus. And there are statues of Emaution <lb/>
            and AJexibius, the former victor in the course for boys, the <lb/>
            latter in the pentathlum. Heræa in Arcadia was the native <lb/>
            place of Alexibius and his statue is by Acestor, where <lb/>
            Emaution came from the inscription does not state, it only <lb/>
            declares he was an Arcadian. And the Colophonians Her­ <lb/>
            mesianax the son of Agoneus, and Icasius the son of Lyci­ <lb/>
            nus by the daughter of Hermesianax, beat all the boys in <lb/>
            wrestling, and Hermesianax had his statue erected by the <lb/>
            Colophonian community.</p>
          <p>Next to these are natives of Elis that beat all the boys in <lb/>
            boxing, Choerilus by the Olynthian Sthennis, and Theo­ <lb/>
            timus by the Sicyonian Daetondas. Theotimus was the son <lb/>
            of Moschion, who joined Alexander the son of Philip in <lb/>
            his expedition against Darius and the Persians. And next <lb/>
            are two from Elis again, Archidamus who conquered in <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            the four-horse-race, and Eperastus (the son of Theogonus) <lb/>
            who was victor in the race in heavy armour. And Eperastus <lb/>
            states that he was a seer, and descended from the family of <lb/>
            the Clytidae, at the close of the inscription on his statue.</p>
          <p>" I boast to be a seer of the family of the holy-mouthed <lb/>
            Clytidæ, of the blood of the godlike descendants of Me­ <lb/>
            lampus."</p>
          <p>Mantius was the father of CEcles, and the son of Me­ <lb/>
            lampus the son of Amythaon. And Clytius was the son of <lb/>
            Alcmaeon, the son of Amphiaraus the son of CEdes. And <lb/>
            Alcmæon was father of Clytius by the daughter of Phegeus, <lb/>
            and he changed his residence to Elis, objecting to live with <lb/>
            his mother's brothers, because he knew that they had con­ <lb/>
            trived the murder of Alcmaeon.</p>
          <p>And there are some statues interspersed among some not <lb/>
            very remarkable votive offerings, as Alexinicus of Elis (by <lb/>
            the Sicyonian Cantharus), who won a wrestling prize among <lb/>
            the boys, and Gorgias of Leontini, whose statue was placed <lb/>
            at Olympia by Eumolpus, great-grandson of Deicrates <lb/>
            who had married Gorgias' sister. -So Eumolpus himself <lb/>
            tells us. This Gorgias was the son of Carmantides, and <lb/>
            is said to have been the first to have practised Rhetoric, <lb/>
            which had been altogether neglected and nearly come into <lb/>
            desuetude among men. And they say Gorgias was famous <lb/>
            for his eloquence at the public festival at Olympia, and went <lb/>
            with Tisias on an embassy to the Athenians. Tisias too con­ <lb/>
            tributed something to oratory, and most plausibly did he <lb/>
            plead in the case of a Syracusan woman touching some <lb/>
            money, but Gorgias had still greater fame among the <lb/>
            Athenians, and Jason the tyrant in Thessaly put him above <lb/>
            Polycrates, who had the highest renown in the schools at <lb/>
            Athens. And they say Gorgias lived 105 years. And the <lb/>
            town of Leontini, which was dispeopled by the Syracusans, <lb/>
            was in my day colonized again.</p><pb n="395"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND there is the brazen chariot of Cratisthenes of <lb/>
            • Cyrene, and Victory and Cratisthenes on the chariot. <lb/>
            Plainly then he won his victory in the chariot race. There <lb/>
            is a tradition also that he was the son of Mnaseas the runner, <lb/>
            who was surnamed by the Greeks Libyan. And these <lb/>
            votive offerings to him at Olympia are by Pythagoras of <lb/>
            Rhegium.</p>
          <p>Here too I found the statue of Anaximenes, who wrote a, <lb/>
            History of all Antiquities in Greece, and of the exploits of <lb/>
            Philip the son of Amyntas, and afterwards of Alexander. <lb/>
            This honour in Olympia he owed to the people of Lamp­ <lb/>
            sacus: for the following is recorded about him. He got <lb/>
            round Alexander, who was by no means a mild king but <lb/>
            excessively passionate, by the following contrivance. The <lb/>
            people of Lampsacus having espoused the cause of the king <lb/>
            of the Persians, or being thought to have done so by Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, he boiled over in anger against them and threatened <lb/>
            them with the most condign chastisement. And they in all <lb/>
            haste sent Anaximenes to supplicate for their wives and <lb/>
            children and country, as he had been well known to <lb/>
            Alexander and earlier still to Philip. And Anaximenes <lb/>
            went to Alexander, who had learnt the motive of his errand, <lb/>
            and had sworn they say by all the gods that he would do ex­ <lb/>
            actly contrary to what he entreated. Then Anaximenes said, <lb/>
            " 0 King oblige me with this favour, enslave the women <lb/>
            and children at Lampsacus, and rase the whole town to its <lb/>
            foundations, and burn the temples of the gods." This is <lb/>
            what he said, and Alexander having no contrivance to meet <lb/>
            his cunning, and being compelled by his oath, very un­ <lb/>
            willingly pardoned the people of Lampsacus. Anaximenes <lb/>
            seems also to have known how to punish an enemy very <lb/>
            cleverly and exemplarily. He was naturally a sophist and <lb/>
            a very good imitator of the arguments of the sophists. <lb/>
            And having a quarrel with Theopompus, the son of Dama­ <lb/>
            sistratus, he wrote a book full of abuse against the Athenians <lb/>
            and Lacedæmonians and Thebans. And as he had imitated <lb/>
            his style very accurately, and put the name of Theopompus <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            on the title page, and distributed the book about in various <lb/>
            towns, though he himself was really the writer, general <lb/>
            odium was stirred up throughout Greece against Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus. Nor did any one earlier than Anaximenes prac­ <lb/>
            tise extempore oratory. But I cannot think that he was <lb/>
            author of the verses about Alexander that run in his <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>And Sotades, (who was proclaimed a Cretan, as indeed <lb/>
            he was), won the prize in the long course in the 99th Olym­ <lb/>
            piad, but in the next Olympiad, being bribed by the Ephe­ <lb/>
            sian people, he registered himself as an Ephesian, and the <lb/>
            Cretans exiled him for it.</p>
          <p>And the first athletes who had effigies at Olympia were <lb/>
            Praxidamas the Æginetan, who won the prize for boxing in <lb/>
            the 59th Olympiad, and the Opuntian Rhexibius, who won <lb/>
            the prize in the pancratium in the 61st Olympiad. And <lb/>
            their effigies are made of wood, Rhexibius' of figwood, and <lb/>
            the Æginetan's of cypress. This last has suffered less than <lb/>
            the other.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>A <lb/>
            ND there is in Altis a base of tufa stone to the North <lb/>
            of the temple of Hera, at its back is the mountain of <lb/>
            Cronos. On this base are treasuries such as some of the <lb/>
            Greeks have made for Apollo at Delphi. There is a <lb/>
            treasury at Olympia called the treasury of the Sicyonians, <lb/>
            the votive offering of Myron the King of the Sicyonians. <lb/>
            It was constructed by Myron after his chariot victory in <lb/>
            the 33rd Olympiad. In this treasury he constructed two <lb/>
            chambers, one of Doric the other of Ionic architecture. <lb/>
            I myself have seen them : they are of brass : but whether <lb/>
            the brass comes from Tartessus, according to the tradition <lb/>
            of the people of Elis, I do not know. The river Tartessus <lb/>
            is they say in the country of the Iberes, and has two out­ <lb/>
            lets to the sea, and there is a town of the same name that <lb/>
            lies between the outlets of the river. And it is the largest <lb/>
            river in Iberia, and in later times was called Bætis from its <lb/>
            ebb and flow. And the Iberes who inhabit the town of <lb/>
            Carpia believe that their town was originally called Tar­ <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            tessus. And on the smaller of the two chambers at <lb/>
            Olympia there are inscriptions, one on the lintel stating that <lb/>
            there are 500 talents there, another as to the givers of the <lb/>
            votive offering, stating that they were Myron and the <lb/>
            people of the Sicyonians. In this treasury there are three <lb/>
            quoits, which they use in the contest for the pentathlum. <lb/>
            And there is a brazen shield curiously painted inside, and <lb/>
            helmet and greaves to match. And there is an inscription <lb/>
            on this armour that they are an offering to Zeus from the <lb/>
            Myanes. As to who these Myanes were different people <lb/>
            have different ideas. I remember that Thucydides in his <lb/>
            account of the Locrians near Phocis mentions several <lb/>
            towns, among others the Myones.1 These Myanes on the <lb/>
            shield are in my opinion the same as the Myones in the <lb/>
            Locrian mainland: and the letters on the shield are a little <lb/>
            worn away, in consequence of its great antiquity. There <lb/>
            are also here several other curious articles, as the sword of <lb/>
            Pelops with golden hilt, and the horn of Amalthea in <lb/>
            ivory, the votive offering of Miltiades the son of Cimon, <lb/>
            who was the first of his family that reigned in the Thracian <lb/>
            Chersonese: and this is the inscription on the horn in old <lb/>
            Athenian letters, <lb/>
            " I was offered to Zeus by the warriors that took the <lb/>
            fort of Aratus on the Chersonese: their leader was Mil­ <lb/>
            tiades."</p>
          <p>There is also a statue of Apollo made of boxwood with the <lb/>
            head gilt: the inscription states that it was a votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing of the Locrians at the promontory of Zephyrium, and <lb/>
            by Patrocles of Croton, the son of Catillus.</p>
          <p>And next to the treasury of the Sicyonians is that of the <lb/>
            Carthaginians, constructed by Pothæus and Antiphilus and <lb/>
            Megacles. And the votive offerings in it are a huge Zeus <lb/>
            and three linen breastplates, presented by Gelon and the <lb/>
            Syracusans who beat the Phoenicians either on land or sea.</p>
          <p>And the third and fourth treasuries are the votive offer­ <lb/>
            ing of the people of Epidamnus. They contain the world <lb/>
            upheld by Atlas, and Hercules and the apple tree in the <lb/>
            garden of the Hesperides with the dragon coiled round it, <lb/>
            carved in cedar-wood, the carving of Theocles (the son of <lb/>
            Hegylus) who says his SOIl joined him in the carving of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Thucyd. iii. 101. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            world. And the Hesperides, which were removed by the <lb/>
            people of Elis, were in my time in the temple of Hera. And <lb/>
            Pyrrhus and his sons Lacrates and Hermon made this <lb/>
            treasury for the people of Epidamnus.</p>
          <p>The people of Sybaris also built a treasury next to that <lb/>
            of the people of Byzantium. Those who have inquired <lb/>
            most carefully into the history of Italy and its towns say <lb/>
            that Lupiæ, which lies between Brundisium and Hydrus, <lb/>
            has changed its name, and was originally called Sybaris. <lb/>
            And the haven for ships was made by navvies in the reign <lb/>
            of the Emperor Adrian.</p>
          <p>And next to the treasury of the people of Sybaris is the <lb/>
            treasury of the Libyans at Cyrene, containing statues of <lb/>
            the Roman kings. The Carthaginians expelled the Seli­ <lb/>
            nuntian Siceliotes in war, but before that disaster hap­ <lb/>
            pened to them, they had got together the treasury for <lb/>
            Zeus at Olympia. Dionysus is there with his face toes and <lb/>
            hands of ivory.</p>
          <p>And in the treasury of the people of Metapontum, which <lb/>
            is next to that of the Selinuntians, is a statue of Endymion, <lb/>
            all ivory but the dress. The cause of the ruin of Meta­ <lb/>
            pontum I do not know, but in my time nothing but the <lb/>
            theatre and walls round the town was left. The Mega­ <lb/>
            rians also near Attica have a treasury and votive offerings in <lb/>
            it, figures in cedar overlaid with gold, to represent the battle <lb/>
            of Hercules and Achelous. There are Zeus and Deianira <lb/>
            and Achelous and Hercules, and Ares is helping Achelous. <lb/>
            And Athene stands as if in alliance with Hercules, near <lb/>
            the Hesperides that are now in the temple of Hera. And <lb/>
            on a gable of this treasury is the war between the gods and <lb/>
            the giants: and over the gable is a shield, which states <lb/>
            that the Megarians offered the treasury, after triumphing <lb/>
            over the Corinthians. I think they won this victory when <lb/>
            Phorbas was Archon at Athens, who was Archon all his <lb/>
            life, for the Archonship was not yet a yearly office at <lb/>
            Athens, nor were the Olympiads registered at this period <lb/>
            by the people of Elis. The Argives are also said to have <lb/>
            assisted the Megarians against the Corinthians. This <lb/>
            treasury at Olympia was constructed by the Megarians <lb/>
            some years after the battle. But the votive offerings they <lb/>
            probably had from old time, since they were made by the <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            Lacedæmonian Dontas, the pupil of Dipoenus and Scyllis. <lb/>
            And the last of the treasuries is near the course, and the <lb/>
            inscription on it states that it and its statues are the votive <lb/>
            offerings of the people of Gela. The statues however are <lb/>
            no longer there.</p>

          <p>c <lb/>
            RONOS' mountain is, as I have already said, behind <lb/>
            the base, and extends the length of these treasuries. <lb/>
            And on the summit of the mountain those that are called <lb/>
            Basilœ sacrifice to Cronos at the vernal equinox in the <lb/>
            month of Elaphius. And at the North end of Mount <lb/>
            Cronos there is between the treasuries and the mountain a <lb/>
            temple of Ilithyia, and in it is honoured Sosipolis the <lb/>
            tutelary deity of the people of Elis. Ilithyia they surname <lb/>
            the Olympian, and select annually a priestess for her: <lb/>
            the old priestess of Sosipolis also performs holy rites ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the custom of the people of Elis, brings lustral <lb/>
            water to the goddess, and sets before her cakes kneaded <lb/>
            with honey. In the vestibule of the temple is the altar <lb/>
            of Ilithyia, as also the approach to the temple for people <lb/>
            generally: inside Sosipolis is honoured, and no one but the <lb/>
            priestess of the god must enter his sanctuary, with a white <lb/>
            veil drawn over her head and face. And the maidens that <lb/>
            reside in the temple of Ilithyia and the women sing hymns <lb/>
            to Sosipolis, and burn incense to him, but are not accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to pour libations of wine to his honour. And their <lb/>
            most binding oath is by Sosipolis. And it is said that, <lb/>
            when the Arcadians invaded Elis with an army, and the <lb/>
            people of Elis were drawn upin battle array against them, <lb/>
            a woman came to the generals of Elis, with a baby boy at her <lb/>
            breast, saying that she was mother of the boy, and offered <lb/>
            him according to a dream she had had to help the people <lb/>
            of Elis. And the authorities, crediting the woman's tale, <lb/>
            put the child in the front of the army all naked as it was. <lb/>
            And the Arcadians commenced the attack, and the child <lb/>
            was changed into a dragon, and the Arcadians were troubled <lb/>
            at the sight and began to flee, and the people of Elis pursued <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            them hotly, and won a notable victory and called the god <lb/>
            Sosipolis. And where the dragon appeared to glide off <lb/>
            after the battle, they built a temple, and resolved to worship <lb/>
            it and Ilithyia jointly, for they thought it was she who had <lb/>
            introduced the child into the world. And the Arcadians <lb/>
            who were slain in the battle have a monument on the hill <lb/>
            towards the west after you have crossed the Cladeus. And <lb/>
            near Ilithyia there are ruins of a temple of celestial Aphro­ <lb/>
            dite, to whom they sacrifice on the altars which still remain.</p>
          <p>And inside Altis, at the processional entrance, is what <lb/>
            is called the Hippodamium, surrounded by a wall, occupy­ <lb/>
            ing about an acre. This is the entrance every year for <lb/>
            the women, who sacrifice to Hippodamia and perform other <lb/>
            rites in her honour. They say Hippodamia fled to Midea <lb/>
            in Argolis, when Pelops was especially angry with her <lb/>
            owing to the death of Chrysippus: and they say that <lb/>
            according to the oracle they afterwards placed her remains <lb/>
            at Olympia. And at the end of the statues which they <lb/>
            erected out of fines imposed on the athletes is the entrance <lb/>
            which they call Private. For by it the Umpires and com­ <lb/>
            batants enter the course. There is also an embankment, <lb/>
            and seats for the managers of the games. And opposite <lb/>
            the Umpires is an altar of white stone, seated on which the <lb/>
            priestess of Demeter Chamyne watches the Olympian <lb/>
            games, an honour which different priestesses at different <lb/>
            times have received from the people of Elis, for they do <lb/>
            not prevent maidens from seeing the games. And at the <lb/>
            starting-place is the tomb of Endymion, according to the <lb/>
            tradition of the people of Elis.</p>
          <p>And near the place where the Umpires sit is the <lb/>
            ground appointed for the horse-races and the starting-place, <lb/>
            which is in shape like the prow of a ship with its beak <lb/>
            turned to the course. And the prow is broad where it <lb/>
            joins the Portico called Agnaptus. And there is a brazen <lb/>
            dolphin upon a bar at the extremity of the beak. Each <lb/>
            side of the starting-place is more than 400 feet in length, <lb/>
            and there are some buildings there, which those who enter <lb/>
            for the horse-races get by lots. And in front of the chariots <lb/>
            and race-horses is extended a rope as a sort of barrier. <lb/>
            And there is an altar of unbaked brick erected near the <lb/>
            middle of the beak every Olympiad, whitewashed out­ <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            side. And there is a brazen eagle on this altar with its <lb/>
            wings stretched out wide. When the clerk of the course <lb/>
            touches a piece of mechanism on this altar, the eagle is so <lb/>
            constructed as to mount aloft so as to be visible to the <lb/>
            spectators, while the dolphin falls to the ground. First <lb/>
            the ropes on each side of the Portico called Agnaptus are <lb/>
            slackened, and the horses in position there start first, and <lb/>
            run on till they come to the horses in the second position, <lb/>
            and then the ropes there are slackened, and so on along the <lb/>
            whole course where the horses are in position, till they <lb/>
            can all start fair at the beak. Then commences the exhi­ <lb/>
            bition of the skill of the charioteers and the swiftness of <lb/>
            the horses. Clecetas originally contrived this method of <lb/>
            starting, and plumed himself upon his invention, as we find <lb/>
            by the inscription on his statue at Athens, <lb/>
            "I was made by Clecetas the son of Aristocles, who <lb/>
            invented at Olympia the start for horses."</p>
          <p>They say too that Aristides subsequently somewhat im­ <lb/>
            proved the invention.</p>
          <p>But the other side of the Hippodrome is more extended, <lb/>
            being also of raised earth, and at its outlet is Taraxippus <lb/>
            the terror of horses, which is in the shape of a. circular <lb/>
            altar, and as the horses run past it they are immediately <lb/>
            seized with strong fear without any apparent cause, and <lb/>
            this fear generates terror, insomuch that chariots are <lb/>
            often smashed up, and the charioteers badly injured. And <lb/>
            the charioteers sacrifice to avoid this, and pray that Taraxip­ <lb/>
            pus will be propitious to them. About Taraxippus the <lb/>
            Greeks have various views; some say it is the tomb of <lb/>
            an Autochthon, famous for his skill with horses, whose name <lb/>
            was Olenius, and say that the rock Olenia in Elis was named <lb/>
            after him. Others say that Dameon the son of Phlius, an <lb/>
            associate with Hercules in the expedition against Augeas <lb/>
            and the people of Elis, was killed together with the horse <lb/>
            on which he rode by Cteatus the son of Actor, and that <lb/>
            this is the joint tomb of Dameon and his horse. Others say <lb/>
            that Pelops erected here a cenotaph to Myrtilus, and sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to him to avert his anger for his murder, and named <lb/>
            him Taraxippus, because the horses of (Enomaus were dis­ <lb/>
            turbed by his contrivance. But some say that CEnomaus <lb/>
            himself hindered the horses in the course. And I have <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            heard the blame put upon Alcathous the son of Porthaon, <lb/>
            who was buried here after having been slain by Œnomaus as <lb/>
            one of the unsuccessful suitors of Hippodamia, and who, in <lb/>
            consequence of his bad success in the Hippodrome, has an <lb/>
            evil eye and is a malevolent demon to race-horses. But an <lb/>
            Egyptian told me that Pelops received something from Am­ <lb/>
            phion and buried it on the spot called Taraxippus, and <lb/>
            that in consequence of what was buried there the horses <lb/>
            of CEnomaus formerly, and everybody's horses since, have <lb/>
            been terrified. This Egyptian also thought that Amphion <lb/>
            and the Thracian Orpheus were wonderful magicians, and <lb/>
            that by their charms wild beasts followed Orpheus, and <lb/>
            stones formed themselves into houses for Amphion. The <lb/>
            most plausible account however of Taraxippus seems to <lb/>
            me that which makes it a surname of Poseidon Hippius. <lb/>
            There is also at the Isthmus a Taraxippus, Glaucus the <lb/>
            son of Sisyphus, who they say was killed by horses, when <lb/>
            Acastus was holding the funeral games to his father. And <lb/>
            at Nemea in Argolis there is no hero that terrifies horses, <lb/>
            but there is a gleam like fire from a red stone where the <lb/>
            horses turn which frightens the horses. But Taraxippus at <lb/>
            Olympia is far the most formidable panic-inspirer in horses. <lb/>
            And at one of the goals there is a brazen statue of Hippo­ <lb/>
            damia with a fillet, about to bind Pelops with it for his <lb/>
            victory.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the other part of the hippodrome is not an embank­ <lb/>
            ment, but a hill of no great size, on the top of which <lb/>
            is a temple built to Demeter under the name of Chamyne. <lb/>
            And some think that title of hers an ancient one, and that <lb/>
            the earth opened there and took in the chariot of Pluto, and <lb/>
            closed again. Others say that Chamynus of Pisa, (who <lb/>
            opposed the dominion in Pisa of Pantaleon, the son of Om­ <lb/>
            phalion, and stirred the people up to revolt from Elis), was <lb/>
            slain by Pantaleon, and that it was out of his property that <lb/>
            the temple to Demeter was built. And in lieu of the old ones <lb/>
            new statues of Proserpine and Demeter were erected in Pen­ <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            telican marble by the Athenian Herodes. And in the gym­ <lb/>
            nasium at Olympia' they practise for the pentathlum and <lb/>
            the races. And in the open air there is a basement of <lb/>
            stone, and originally on the basement there was a trophy <lb/>
            for a victory over the Arcadians. On the left of the en­ <lb/>
            trance to the gymnasium there is a smaller enclosure where <lb/>
            the athletes practise wrestling. And at the Portico of the <lb/>
            gymnasium facing East are some buildings for the Athletes <lb/>
            facing South and West. And after you have crossed the <lb/>
            river Cladeus you come to the tomb of CEnomaus, a mound <lb/>
            piled up with stones, and above the tomb are some remains <lb/>
            of buildings where they say the horses of CEnomaus were <lb/>
            stabled. And here are the boundaries towards Arcadia, <lb/>
            which now belong to the people of Elis, but formerly be­ <lb/>
            longed to the people of Pisa.</p>
          <p>After you have crossed the river Erymanthus, near the <lb/>
            ridge called after Saurus, is the tomb of Saurus, and a <lb/>
            temple of Hercules, ruins of which are to be seen in our <lb/>
            day. Saurus they say used to molest wayfarers and the <lb/>
            people of the country, till he was killed by Hercules. <lb/>
            From the south side of the ridge called after this robber <lb/>
            a river falls into the Alpheus nearly opposite Erymanthus. <lb/>
            Its name is Diagon, and it divides the district of Pisa <lb/>
            from Arcadia. And 40 stades onwards from the ridge of <lb/>
            Saurus is the temple of Æsculapius, surnamed Demænetus <lb/>
            from the name of the builder. It is in ruins too, and is <lb/>
            built on the high ground along the Alpheus. And not <lb/>
            far from it is the temple of Dionysus Lucyanites, hard by <lb/>
            the river Lucyanias, which rises in Mount Pholoe, and flows <lb/>
            into the Alpheus. When you have crossed the Alpheus you <lb/>
            are in the district of Pisa.</p>
          <p>Here you will see a hill with a steep acclivity, and on it <lb/>
            are ruins of the town of Phrixa, and a temple of Athene <lb/>
            Cydonia, not in my time in complete preservation, there is <lb/>
            only an altar. They say Clymenus, a descendant of Idæan <lb/>
            Hercules, erected the temple to the goddess. He came <lb/>
            from Cydonia in Crete and from the river Iardanus. The <lb/>
            people of Elis say also that Pelops sacrificed to Athene <lb/>
            Cydonia before his race with CEnomaus. And as you <lb/>
            advance a little further you come to the river Parthenia, <lb/>
            on whose banks the horses of Marmax are buried. The <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            story is that Marmax was the first suitor of Hippoda­ <lb/>
            mia, and that he was slain before the rest by CEnomaus, <lb/>
            and the names of his horses were Parthenia and Eripha, <lb/>
            and CEnomaus cut their throats and buried them with their <lb/>
            master, and the river Parthenia got its name from one <lb/>
            of them. There is also another river called Harpinates, <lb/>
            and at no great distance from it some remains of a town <lb/>
            Harpina especially altars : they say that CEnomaus built <lb/>
            the town and gave it its name after his mother Harpina.</p>
          <p>A little further is a lofty mound of earth, the tomb of <lb/>
            the suitors of Hippodamia, CEnomaus did not (they say) <lb/>
            bury them in the ground near one another as a mark of <lb/>
            honour, but it was Pelops subsequently who gave them a <lb/>
            common sepulchre, in honour to them and out of affection <lb/>
            to Hippodamia, and I think also as a record to posterity <lb/>
            how many worthy gentlemen CEnomaus had slain before <lb/>
            he Pelops vanquished him. Indeed according to the poem <lb/>
            called the Great Eœæ the following were killed by <lb/>
            CEnomaus, Alcathous the son of Porthaon next to Alar­ <lb/>
            max, and next to Alcathous Euryalus and Eurymachus <lb/>
            and Crotalus. Their parents and native lands I could not <lb/>
            ascertain. But Acrias, who was killed next, one would <lb/>
            infer to have been a Lacedæmonian and the founder of <lb/>
            Acriæ. And next to Acrias CEnomaus slew Capetus and <lb/>
            Lycurgus and Lasius and Chalcodon and Tricolonus, who <lb/>
            the Arcadians say was a descendant as well as namesake of <lb/>
            Tricolonus the son of Lycaon. And after Tricolonus fate <lb/>
            overtook in this fatal race Aristomachus and Prias and <lb/>
            Pelagon and Æolius and Cronius; Some also add to the <lb/>
            list I have given Erythras, the son of Leucon and grandson <lb/>
            of Athamas, who gave his name to the town in Bceotia <lb/>
            called Erythræ, and Eioneus, the son of Magnes and grand­ <lb/>
            son of Æolus. Here then is the tomb of. all these, and they <lb/>
            say Pelops offered them funeral rites every year when he <lb/>
            was king of Pisa.</p><pb n="405"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            IsD if you go about a stade forward from this tomb <lb/>
            there are traces of a temple of Artemis surnamed Cor­ <lb/>
            dace, because the attendants of Pelops used to offer their <lb/>
            sacrifices to the goddess there, and dance the national dance <lb/>
            of Sipylus called the cordax. And not far from the temple is <lb/>
            a building not very large, and in it is a brazen coffer, in <lb/>
            which are deposited the remains of Pelops. And there is <lb/>
            no vestige of a wall or any other building, but vines are <lb/>
            planted all over the site on which Pisa was built. The <lb/>
            founder of the town was they say Pisus, the son of Perieres <lb/>
            and grandson of Æolus. And the people of Pisa brought on <lb/>
            their own misfortunes by making themselves objectionable <lb/>
            to the people of Elis, and by their desire to start the Olym­ <lb/>
            pian games instead of the people of Elis, and in the 8th <lb/>
            Olympiad they invited Phido the Argive, the most haughty <lb/>
            of all the Greek tyrants, and made him the patron of the <lb/>
            games. And in the 34th Olympiad the people of Pisa and <lb/>
            their king Pantaleon, the son of Omphalion, assembled to­ <lb/>
            gether the neighbouring people, and instituted the Olym­ <lb/>
            pian games instead of the people of Elis. During these <lb/>
            Olympiads, and also in the 104th Olympiad which was set <lb/>
            on foot by the Arcadians, the people of Elis kept no register, <lb/>
            nor do they include them in the Olympiads. And in the <lb/>
            48th Olympiad Damophon the son of Pantaloon gave the <lb/>
            people of Elis reason to suspect that he intended to act <lb/>
            treacherously against them, so they invaded Pisæa, but did <lb/>
            not at this time do any damage, because they returned <lb/>
            home again being persuaded by entreaties and promises. <lb/>
            But when Pyrrhus the son of Pantaleon succeeded his <lb/>
            brother Damophon on the throne, then the people of Pisa of <lb/>
            their own accord commenced war with the people of Elis. <lb/>
            And the people of Macistus and Scillus in Triphylia <lb/>
            joined them in their revolt from the people of Elis, and of <lb/>
            the other neighbouring people the Dyspontii, whose rela­ <lb/>
            tions had always been very friendly with the people of <lb/>
            Pisa, and whose founder Dysponteus was they state the <lb/>
            son of Œnomaus. And the people of Elis eventually rased <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            Pisa to the ground and all the towns that had assisted her <lb/>
            in the war.</p>
          <p>The ruins of Pylos in Elis are visible as you go over the <lb/>
            mountains from Olympia to Elis. And from Pylos to Elis <lb/>
            is 80 stades' distance. This Pylos was built, as I have <lb/>
            already mentioned, by the Megarian Pylon the son of <lb/>
            Cleson. And being destroyed by Hercules, and once again <lb/>
            peopled by the people of Elis, it was destined once more to <lb/>
            lack inhabitants. Near it the river Ladon flows into the <lb/>
            Peneus. And the people of Elis say that it is about this <lb/>
            Pylos that the lines of Homer' are.</p>
          <p>" He derived his origin from the river Alpheus, which <lb/>
            flows in broad volume through the territory of Pylos."</p>
          <p>And they persuaded me by what they said, for the <lb/>
            Alpheus flows through this district, and the lines cannot <lb/>
            refer to the other Pylos. For by the Pylos near the island <lb/>
            Sphacteria the Alpheus does not flow at all, nor do we <lb/>
            know of any town in Arcadia formerly called Pylos. And <lb/>
            about 50 stades from Olympia is the village belonging to <lb/>
            Elis called Heraclea, and near it is the river Cytherus. <lb/>
            There is a well that flows into the river, and there is a <lb/>
            temple to the Nymphs by the well. And the proper names <lb/>
            of these Nymphs individually are Calliphæa and Synallaxis <lb/>
            and Pegæa and Iasis, and collectively Ionides. And people <lb/>
            bathing in this well get cured from pains and aches of all <lb/>
            kinds. And they say the Nymphs got their name Ionides <lb/>
            from Ion, the son of Gargettus, who migrated to this place <lb/>
            from Athens.</p>
          <p>But if you wish to go to Elis through the plain, it is 120 <lb/>
            stades to Letrini, and 180 from Letrini to Elis. Letrini <lb/>
            was a small town originally founded by Letreus the son <lb/>
            of Pelops, but now there are only a few buildings, and <lb/>
            a temple and statue of Alphean Artemis. They give the <lb/>
            following legend to account for the goddess being called <lb/>
            Alphean. Alpheus they say was deeply in love with her, <lb/>
            and when he found he could not marry her for all his <lb/>
            wooing and vows, he had the boldness to try and force her, <lb/>
            and went to a nightly revel at Letrini, which was to bo <lb/>
            held by her and the Nymphs with whom she associated in <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, v. 544,. 545. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            sport: and she, suspecting his plot, smeared with mud her <lb/>
            own face and the faces of all the Nymphs present, and so <lb/>
            Alpheus when he got there could not distinguish her <lb/>
            from the Nymphs, and accordingly had to depart without <lb/>
            effecting his object. So the people of Letrini called the <lb/>
            goddess Alphean from Alpheus' passion for her. And the <lb/>
            people of Elis, for they had an ancient friendship for the <lb/>
            people of Letrini, say that they borrowed their worship of <lb/>
            the Elaphiæan Artemis from them, and used to perform <lb/>
            rites to her as Alphea, but in process of time the name <lb/>
            Elaphiæa prevailed. But in my opinion the people of Elis <lb/>
            called Artemis Elaphiæa from her love of hunting deer: <lb/>
            but their own tradition is that Elaphius was the name of a <lb/>
            woman who was Artemis' nurse. And about six stades <lb/>
            beyond Letrini is a perennial lake about three stades in <lb/>
            diameter.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the notable things in Elis are an old gymnasium, <lb/>
            in which before they go to Olympia the athletes go <lb/>
            through all the customary training. There are some lofty <lb/>
            plane trees inside a wall growing all along the course, <lb/>
            arid the whole enclosure is called Colonnade, because Her­ <lb/>
            cules the son of Amphitryon used to exercise there, and all <lb/>
            the thorns and weeds that grew there were plucked up <lb/>
            every day. There is a course called by the people of the <lb/>
            place sacred, set apart for the races, and there is another <lb/>
            course where they practise for the races and the pen­ <lb/>
            tathlum. There is also in the gymnasium a place <lb/>
            called Plethrium, where the Umpires pit the athletes to­ <lb/>
            gether according to their ages or difference in their train­ <lb/>
            ing, and put them to wrestling to test their capaci­ <lb/>
            ties. And there are in the gymnasium altars to some of <lb/>
            the gods, as Idæan Hercules under the title of Champion, <lb/>
            and Eros, and the god whom the Athenians and people of <lb/>
            Elis alike call Anteros, and Demeter and Proserpine. <lb/>
            There is no altar to Achilles, but he has a cenotaph in <lb/>
            accordance with an oracle. And at the commencement of <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            the general festival on a given day, when the sun begins to <lb/>
            set, the women of Elis among other rites in honour of <lb/>
            Achilles are wont to wail and strike the breast.</p>
          <p>And there is another enclosure, smaller than the gymna­ <lb/>
            sium but adjacent to it, which they call from its shape the <lb/>
            Square. And here the athletes practise their wrestling, and <lb/>
            here they test the athletes who are past wrestling, sometimes <lb/>
            even applying blows with mild whips. And one of the <lb/>
            statues is erected here, which were made of Zeus out of the <lb/>
            fine-money of Sosander of Smyrna and Polyctor of Elis. <lb/>
            There is also a third enclosure used as a gymnasium, which <lb/>
            is called Maltho from the softness of its floor, and this is <lb/>
            given up to the lads all the time the general festival lasts. <lb/>
            And in a corner of Maltho there is a statue of Hercules, <lb/>
            merely the head and shoulders, and in one of the wrest­ <lb/>
            ling-places is a figure of Eros and Anteros, Eros has <lb/>
            a branch of palm which Anteros is trying to take away. <lb/>
            And on each side of the entrance to Maltho is the statue of <lb/>
            a boy-boxer, and the Custos Rotulorum at Elis says that it <lb/>
            is a native of Alexandria above the island Pharos, called <lb/>
            Serapion, who came to Elis and gave the people food when <lb/>
            they were short of corn. That was why he received these <lb/>
            honours: and the date when he received the crown at <lb/>
            Olympia, and did this kindness to the people at Elis, <lb/>
            was the 217th Olympiad. In this gymnasium the people <lb/>
            of Elis also have a Council Chamber, where they practise <lb/>
            extempore rhetoric, and submit all kinds of writings to <lb/>
            public criticism: it is called Lalichmium from the name of <lb/>
            its originator. And round it are some shields hung up, <lb/>
            well worth seeing, not made for purposes of war, but simply <lb/>
            for ornament.</p>
          <p>You go from the gymnasium to the baths by the street <lb/>
            called Silence near the temple of Artemis the Lover of <lb/>
            Youths. The goddess was so called from her proximity to <lb/>
            the gymnasium. And the street was called Silence from <lb/>
            the following circumstance. Some men in the army of <lb/>
            Oxylus being sent forward to reconnoitre Elis, and having <lb/>
            cheered one another on the road, when they got near the <lb/>
            walls, passed round the word for silence, and to listen if <lb/>
            they could hear any sound within the town, ana so stole <lb/>
            into the town without being observed by this street, and <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            returned again to Ætolia after having got the wished for <lb/>
            intelligence. And the street received its name from the <lb/>
            silence of these spies.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            XOTHER way out of the gymnasium leads to the <lb/>
            market-place, and to what is called the Umpires' Hall <lb/>
            beyond the tomb of Achilles, and it is by this way that the <lb/>
            Umpires are accustomed to enter the gymnasium. And <lb/>
            they enter the gymnasium to pit together the runners <lb/>
            before the sun gets too powerful, and at noon they call the <lb/>
            competitors together for the pentathlum and the arduous <lb/>
            contests.</p>
          <p>And the market-place at Elis is not like that of the <lb/>
            Ionians, or of the Greek cities in Ionia, but is built after a <lb/>
            more antique type, with porticoes and streets at regular <lb/>
            intervals. And the name of the market-place in our day is <lb/>
            Hippodrome, and there the people of the place exercise their <lb/>
            horses. The architecture of the portico facing South is <lb/>
            Doric, and it is divided into 3 portions by pillars: it is <lb/>
            there that the Umpires mostly spend the day. And there <lb/>
            are altars erected to Zeus, and several other altars in the <lb/>
            open air in the market-place, and they are easily removed as <lb/>
            they are only improvised altars. And at the end of this <lb/>
            portico, on the left as you go to the market-place, is the Um­ <lb/>
            pires' Hall, and a street separates it from the market-place. <lb/>
            In this Umpires' Hall those who are chosen as Umpires live <lb/>
            ten months together, and are instructed by the Custodes <lb/>
            Rotulorum in all things that appertain to the games. And <lb/>
            near the portico where the Umpires spend the day is <lb/>
            another portico, called the Corcynean, and a street runs <lb/>
            between the two porticoes. It was so called because when <lb/>
            the Corcyræans invaded Elis in their ships, the people <lb/>
            of Elis they say drove them off and took much booty <lb/>
            from them, and built their portico with a tenth of the <lb/>
            spoil. And the architecture of the portico is Doric : it has <lb/>
            a double row of pillars, one towards the market-place, the <lb/>
            other in the opposite direction. In the middle are no <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            pillars, but a wall supports the roof, and there are statues <lb/>
            on either side of this wall. And at the end of the portico <lb/>
            near the market-place is a statue of Pyrrho the son of the <lb/>
            Sophist Pistocrates, who had great persuasiveness on any <lb/>
            topic. Pyrrho's tomb is at no great distance from Elis, at <lb/>
            a place called Petra, an old hamlet according to tradition. <lb/>
            And the people of Elis have in the open air near the market­ <lb/>
            place a most noble temple and statue of Apollo the <lb/>
            Healer. This would probably be much the same title as <lb/>
            his Athenian title of Averter of Evil.1 And on another side <lb/>
            are stone statues to the Sun and Moon, she has horns on <lb/>
            her head, he has his beams. There is also a temple to the <lb/>
            Graces, and their wooden statues, their dresses gilt, and <lb/>
            their heads hands and feet of white marble, and one of <lb/>
            them holds a rose, the second dice, and the third a small <lb/>
            branch of myrtle. The meaning of which things we may con­ <lb/>
            jecture thus. The rose and myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite, <lb/>
            and have a place in the legend of Adonis, and the Graces <lb/>
            have most intimate connection with Aphrodite: and dice <lb/>
            are playthings of striplings and maidens, who have not yet <lb/>
            lost all grace through old age. And on the right of the <lb/>
            Graces is a statue of Eros on the same pedestal. There <lb/>
            is also there a temple of Silenus, dedicated to Silenus <lb/>
            alone, and not in common to him and Dionysus, and <lb/>
            Drunkenness is filling his cup. That the Silent are mortal <lb/>
            we should infer from their tombs, for there is the tomb of <lb/>
            one Silenus in the country of the Hebrews, and of another <lb/>
            at Pergamum.2 And in the market-place the people of Elis <lb/>
            have the following remarkable thing; which I have myself <lb/>
            seen, in the shape of a temple. It is no great height, and <lb/>
            has no walls, and the roof is supported by pillars made of <lb/>
            oak. The people of the country say that it is a monument, <lb/>
            but whose they do not record, but if the account of the old <lb/>
            man whom I asked be correct, it would be the monument <lb/>
            of Oxylus. There is also in the market-place a room for the <lb/>
            16 matrons, where they weave the shawl for Hera.3 <note type="footnote"> 1 See Book i. ch. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 One might also infer the same from the fate of Marsyas. </note><note type="footnote"> a See Book v. ch. 16. </note></p><pb n="411"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND next the market-place is an ancient temple, a colon­ <lb/>
            nade with pillars all round. The roof is fallen in with <lb/>
            age, and there is no statue remaining. It was dedicated to <lb/>
            the Roman Emperors.</p>
          <p>And behind the Corcyræan Portico is a temple of <lb/>
            Aphrodite, and a grove in the open air sacred to her, not <lb/>
            far from the temple. The statue of the goddess in the <lb/>
            temple is called Celestial Aphrodite, and is by Phidias <lb/>
            in ivory and gold, she has one foot on a tortoise. Her <lb/>
            grove is surrounded by a wall, and inside the grove is <lb/>
            a basement on which is a brazen statue by Scopas of the <lb/>
            Pandemian Aphrodite sitting on a brazen he-goat. The <lb/>
            meaning of the tortoise and he-goat I leave my readers tc <lb/>
            guess.</p>
          <p>And the sacred precincts and temple of Pluto (for the <lb/>
            people of Elis have both) are opened once every year, but <lb/>
            no one may enter them even then but the sacrificing priest. <lb/>
            And as far as we know the men of Elis are the only ones <lb/>
            that honour Pluto, for the following reason. When Her­ <lb/>
            cules led an army against Pylos in Elis they say Athene <lb/>
            cooperated with him. Then it was that Pluto came and <lb/>
            helped the people of Pylos out of hostility to Hercules, and <lb/>
            was accordingly honoured at Pylos. And they cite as their <lb/>
            witness Homer's lines in the Iliad.1</p>
          <p>" Mighty Pluto also endured the swift arrow, when this <lb/>
            man, the son of Ægis-bearing Zeus, wounded him at Pylos, <lb/>
            and gave him pain among the dead."</p>
          <p>-Nor if in the expedition of Agamemnon and Menelaus <lb/>
            against Ilium Poseidon, according to the tradition of <lb/>
            Homer, helped the Greeks, was it against probability that <lb/>
            Pluto should have helped the people of Pylos in the opinion <lb/>
            of the same poet. Anyway the people of Elis erected this <lb/>
            temple to Pluto as being friendly to them and hostile to <lb/>
            Hercules. And once every year they are accustomed to <lb/>
            open the temple to indicate, I think, that men once descend <lb/>
            to Pluto's gloomy realm. The people of Elis have also a <note type="footnote"> 1 T. 393-397. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            temple to Fortune, and in the portico of this temple is a <lb/>
            huge statue of wood, gilt all over except the head the <lb/>
            hands and the toes, which are of white marble. Here too <lb/>
            Sosipolis is honoured on the left of Fortune, in a rather small <lb/>
            shrine: represented, according to the appearance of him seen <lb/>
            in a dream, as a boy with a particoloured cloak on cqvered <lb/>
            with stars, and in one of his hands the horn of Amalthea.</p>
          <p>And in that part of the town where the people of Elis <lb/>
            have most of their population, there is a statue not larger <lb/>
            than life of a beardless man, who has his feet crossed, and leans <lb/>
            against his spear with both his hands, his dress is of wool <lb/>
            and linen and flax. This statue is said to be of Poseidon, <lb/>
            and was worshipped of old at Samicum in Triphylia. And <lb/>
            it was honoured even still more when removed to Elis, and <lb/>
            they give it the name of Satrapes and not Poseidon, having <lb/>
            learnt this name from their neighbours at Patrae. And <lb/>
            Satrapes is the surname of Corybas.</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            ND the old theatre between the market-place and the <lb/>
            . temple of the goddess Mene is the theatre and temple <lb/>
            of Dionysus, the statue of the god is by Praxiteles. And of <lb/>
            all the gods the people of Elis honour Dionysus most, and <lb/>
            say that he frequents their festival in his honour called the <lb/>
            Thyia, a festival which they celebrate about 8 stades from <lb/>
            the city. The priests deposit 3 empty flagons in the <lb/>
            chapel, in the presence of the citizens and strangers who <lb/>
            may chance to be at the feast, and the priests themselves or <lb/>
            any others who like seal the doors of the chapel. And the <lb/>
            next day they come to the chapel to observe the miracle, and <lb/>
            on entering find the flagons full of wine. Those held in the <lb/>
            highest repute at Elis, and strangers as well, have sworn <lb/>
            that this is as I have said, I was not myself there at the <lb/>
            time of the festival. The people of Andros also say that <lb/>
            annually at the feast of Dionysus wine flows spontaneously <lb/>
            from the temple. If one can believe the Greeks in this <lb/>
            matter, one might equally credit the tradition of the <lb/>
            Ethiopians beyond Syene as to the .Table of the Sun.</p><pb n="413"/>
            
          <p>And in the citadel at Elis is a temple of Athene, her <lb/>
            statue is of ivory and gold, and said to be by Phidias, and <lb/>
            on her helmet is a cock, because that bird is said to be <lb/>
            most pugnacious, or perhaps because it is sacred to Athene <lb/>
            the Worker.</p>
          <p>And abont 120 stades from Elis is Cyllene, which faces <lb/>
            Sicily, and is a fine harbonr for ships. The dockyard <lb/>
            belongs to the people of Elis bnt got its name from an <lb/>
            Arcadian. Homer has not mentioned Cyllene in his Cata­ <lb/>
            logne of the people of Elis, but subsequently in the Iliad <lb/>
            shews that he knew that there was such a town as Cyllene.</p>
          <p>" And Polydamas killed Otus of Cyllene, the companion <lb/>
            of Phyleides, the leader of the brave Epeans." 1</p>
          <p>The gods who have temples in Cyllene are Æsculapius <lb/>
            and Aphrodite. Hermes also has an Ithyphallic statue, <lb/>
            which the natives pay extravagant hononr to.</p>
          <p>The country of Elis is fertile in fruits of all kinds but <lb/>
            especially in flax. As to hemp and flax all sow them whose <lb/>
            land is favourable to their growth. But the threads which <lb/>
            the Seres make their garments of are not from any plant, <lb/>
            but are produced in the following manner. There is an <lb/>
            insect on the earth which the Greeks called Ser, but the <lb/>
            Seres give it another name. Its size is about double that <lb/>
            of the largest beetle, and in other respects it is like the <lb/>
            spiders that weave their webs under trees, and has also 8 <lb/>
            feet like spiders. These insects the Seres breed, and put <lb/>
            summer and winter into little domiciles specially constructed <lb/>
            for them. And what these insects produce is a slender <lb/>
            thread, which rolls round their feet. For 4 years they feed <lb/>
            them on grain, and in the fifth year (for they know they <lb/>
            will not live longer) they give them green reed to eat. <lb/>
            This food is the most agreeable of all to this insect, and <lb/>
            when it has taken its fill of this it bursts from repletion. <lb/>
            And when it is dead they find the thread in its inside. It <lb/>
            is well-known that the island Seria is in the Red Sea. But <lb/>
            I have heard that it is not the Red Sea, bnt a river called <lb/>
            the Ser that makes this island, just as in Egypt the Delta <lb/>
            is formed by the Nile and not by sea. Such a kind of <lb/>
            island is Seria. The Seres are of Ethiopian race, and so <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad, XT. 518, 519. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            are those that inhabit the neighbouring islands Abasa and <lb/>
            Sacaea. Some however say that they are not Ethiopians <lb/>
            but a cross-breed of Scythians and Indians. Such are the <lb/>
            various traditions.</p>
          <p>As you go from Elis to Achaia it is about 127 stades to <lb/>
            the river Larisus, which is in our day the boundary between <lb/>
            Elis and Achaia, but in ancient times the boundary was the <lb/>
            promontory Araxus near the sea.</p>
