          <p>T <lb/>
            HE works which go by the name of Plutarch's " Mo­ <lb/>
            rals " (though certainly not all from his hand) are a <lb/>
            collection of short treatises upon a great variety of subjects <lb/>
            -Ethics, History, Politics, Preservation of Health, Face­ <lb/>
            tiæ, Love-stories, and Philosophy. The last of these com­ <lb/>
            prise dissertations upon the nature of the unseen world and <lb/>
            spiritual beings, upon the creation and government of the <lb/>
            universe, upon the human soul, upon the hidden sense of <lb/>
            religious institutions, and similar speculations, which the <lb/>
            ancients classed under the general head of " Theosophy," <lb/>
            that is, " knowledge of the things pertaining unto God." <lb/>
            In this series is preserved the only complete and circum­ <lb/>
            stantial account of the religion of Egypt that has come down <lb/>
            to us; and written at a time when that religion was still <lb/>
            in full vigour, when, in fact, it alone (besides the' Mithraic), <lb/>
            of all the ancient creeds, as yet preserved its original vita­ <lb/>
            lity—written, too, by a person who had been initiated into <lb/>
            its deepest mysteries, and who had sought out the hidden <lb/>
            sense of its myths and ceremonies with equal intelligence <lb/>
            and industry. That the present treatise “upon Isis and <note type="footnote"> A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            Osiris," became, from the time of its publication, the chief <lb/>
            authority upon the subject, is evident from the influence <lb/>
            it exerted upon the writings of the Emperor Julian of the <lb/>
            same character, such as his “Hymns to the Mother of the <lb/>
            Gods, and to the Sun." Three other essays are devoted, <lb/>
            more or less, to the subject of Oracles, and to the discus­ <lb/>
            sion of the question whether their inspiration proceeded <lb/>
            from natural or supernatural causes ; in which discussions <lb/>
            the parts of the " rationalist" and the " believer " (in <lb/>
            modern phrase), are most ably supported by the interlo­ <lb/>
            cutors of the dialogue. This is, perhaps, the most curious <lb/>
            and most interesting phenomenon in the history of ancient <lb/>
            civilization. These three treatises, therefore, are of the <lb/>
            highest value, for, in the first place, they preserve the only <lb/>
            particular description now extant of the most important <lb/>
            of these fountains of prophecy, of the physical facts con­ <lb/>
            nected with its working, and the mode in which its powers <lb/>
            were employed, and, what is yet more to the purpose, we <lb/>
            have here the observations made upon all these circum­ <lb/>
            stances by a clear-headed and highly educated man, far <lb/>
            removed from all religious enthusiasm (which had not, at <lb/>
            that time, been roused to blind partiality through opposi­ <lb/>
            tion and vituperation from the other side) ; and who, re­ <lb/>
            siding in the neighbourhood of the mystic cavern, and <lb/>
            regularly attending the consultation, had ample opportu­ <lb/>
            nity of detecting any deception or jugglery on the part of <lb/>
            its ministers. We can, therefore, accept for truth what he <lb/>
            relates concerning the visible and sensible effects of the <lb/>
            Pythonic vapour; but of the conflicting theories as to its <lb/>
            final cause (between which the writer himself is evidently <lb/>
            at a loss to choose), we may decide upon the one best <lb/>
            adapted to our own modes of thought. And if we sub­ <lb/>
            stitute modem terms for ancient, and read " Scriptural" <lb/>
            for " Delphic " inspiration, we can from the disputes of <lb/>
            the present day, form a very accurate notion of the state of <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            feeling upon this subject that prevailed in Plutarch's <lb/>
            times. We find then also, people urging the same objec­ <lb/>
            tions against the Divine origin of sacred teachings, based <lb/>
            upon the imperfections of the vehicle conveying them to <lb/>
            mankind; and parried by the same arguments derived <lb/>
            from the consideration of the nature of such vehicles. <lb/>
            And in the same connection, how curious it is to discover <lb/>
            that the Divine government of “more worlds than one " <lb/>
            was even then, too, a problem that puzzled far brighter <lb/>
            minds than those which have attempted its solution in <lb/>
            these later days!</p>
          <p>In order to place the trustworthiness of Plutarch, as <lb/>
            our guide in similar researches, in a still clearer light by <lb/>
            exhibiting his own view of religion, I have added his short <lb/>
            treatise " On Superstition," one of the most eloquent and <lb/>
            closely reasoned compositions of the kind to be found in <lb/>
            antiquity; and which, from its intrinsic merit (the ster­ <lb/>
            ling coin of every period) might be studied with advantage <lb/>
            by many a religious disputant of the present day.</p>
          <p>It is now almost three centuries since my ancient brother- <lb/>
            fellow, the indefatigable Philemon Holland, published his <lb/>
            gigantic translation of the whole “Moralia." Although <lb/>
            he has done his work admirably, its unwieldy bulk, sum­ <lb/>
            cient to deter most readers, in itself furnishes me with a <lb/>
            plausible excuse for presenting a single section of its con­ <lb/>
            tents in a new dress. My translation was made some <lb/>
            years ago, in the course of collecting materials for an <lb/>
            undertaking then in hand, but now through untoward cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances of necessity abandoned. The text used was <lb/>
            principally Wyttenback's ; it is in many places hopelessly <lb/>
            corrupt, words and even whole sentences are often missing; <lb/>
            the source was, apparently, a single manuscript, and that <lb/>
            in bad condition. In such cases, conjectural emendations <lb/>
            and supplements were unavoidable: but notice of all such <lb/>
            attempts has always been given at the foot of the page. <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            My translation keeps as close to the original as our lan­ <lb/>
            guage will allow-much too closely, indeed, to admit of <lb/>
            any. elegance of style ; the faithful rendering of the sense <lb/>
            in this antique report of discussions often very abstruse and <lb/>
            curiously involved, being the sole object I kept in view <lb/>
            when making it.</p>

          <p>D <lb/>
            IANA of the Ephesians, a palm-branch in each hand, a hind on <lb/>
            each side, looking up to her as their mistress: in the field over <lb/>
            head, two scorpions. This deity originally symbolized Earth, and was <lb/>
            actually identified with Isis; but in later times, being called by the name <lb/>
            of the Grecian Artemis, she similarly became the President of the <lb/>
            Moon. Trebellius Pollio therefore speaks of the Goths burning the <lb/>
            Temple of the " Luna Ephesia," in the reign of Gallienus. (Black <lb/>
            Jasper.)</p>
          <p>P. v. A group of the chief attributes of Apollo, in his double <lb/>
            character. The Gryphon, composed of the lion and eagle (types of <lb/>
            solar power), grasps the lyre belonging to the god of Poetry, whilst on <lb/>
            the Delphic rock behind is perched the raven, the most sure prophet of <lb/>
            all birds of augury. (Amethyst.)</p>
          <p>P. viii. Apollo seated before the Delphic tripod, wearing the topknot <lb/>
            and flowing robe alluded to by Plutarch (p. 165). He takes the title of <lb/>
            “Musagetes" when arrayed in this costume; which therefore became <lb/>
            the professional dress of all musicians. Nero, who thought himself the <lb/>
            Roman Apollo, appeared in statues and struck coins (still extant) with <lb/>
            his own figure " citharœdico habitu," as Suetonius has recorded. (Sard.)</p>
          <p>P. 71. Bust of Isis, with the lotus-flower on her forehead, and the <lb/>
            sceptre in her hand. (Sard.)</p>
          <p>P. 137. The Pythia, seated in profound meditation in front of the <lb/>
            Tripod. (Antique Paste.)</p>
          <p>P. 172. The Delphic E, "of gold," as the inscription declares. This <lb/>
            symbol became a talisman in much request amongst the Romans, for <lb/>
            reasons sufficiently obvious to any one who reads Plutarch's exposition <lb/>
            of its meaning. (Cameo.)</p>
          <p>P. 275. Erinnys, the Avenger of Blood, hastening in pursuit of the <lb/>
            guilty. Archaic Greek style. (Sard.)</p>
          <p>P. 278. Apollo, seated in the attitude of meditation : by his side <lb/>
            stands the earliest Pythia, Herophile; the staff is placed in her hand to <lb/>
            symbolize her extreme age. (Sard.)</p><pb n="XII"/>
            
          <p>P. 287. “Deus Lunus," the Asiatic conception of the Spirit of the <lb/>
            Moon. The earliest of all, the Assyrian, embodied the idea in the form <lb/>
            of an aged man, " Sin," leaning on his staff, and almost the counterpart <lb/>
            of our popular notion of the " Man in the Moon;” but in process of time <lb/>
            it was softened down into the effeminate boy represented on the present <lb/>
            gem. The chief seat of his worship was Carrhæ in Mesopotamia, where <lb/>
            it flourished down to a late period of the Roman Empire : for Julian paid <lb/>
            him worship there, " after the established custom," as he marched by on <lb/>
            his Persian expedition. (Sard.)</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>A <lb/>
            LL good things, 0 Clea, it behoves persons that have <lb/>
            sense to solicit from the gods. But more especially <lb/>
            now that we are in quest of the knowledge of themselves <lb/>
            (so far as such knowledge is attainable by man), do we <lb/>
            pray to obtain the same from them with their own consent: <lb/>
            inasmuch as there is nothing more important for a man to <lb/>
            receive, or more noble for a god to grant, than Truth. For <lb/>
            all other things which people require, the Deity who gives <lb/>
            them doth not possess, nor use for his own purposes. For <lb/>
            the Godhead is not blessed by reason of his silver and <lb/>
            gold, nor yet almighty through his thunders and light­ <lb/>
            nings, but on account of knowledge and intelligence, and <lb/>
            this is the finest thing of all that Homer hath said, when <lb/>
            he pronounced concerning the gods :— <lb/>
            " Both have one source, and both one country bore, <lb/>
            But Jove was first born, and his knowledge more." <lb/>
            He has represented the sovereignty of Jupiter as more <lb/>
            majestic on account of his knowledge and wisdom, being <lb/>
            at the same time the more ancient of the two. And I am <lb/>
            of opinion that the happiness of the eternal life which is <lb/>
            the attribute of God consists in his not being ignorant of <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            future events, in virtue of his knowledge, for if the <lb/>
            knowing and understanding of events were taken away, <lb/>
            then immortality becomes not life but duration.</p>
          <p>II. On this account a desire for religious knowledge is <lb/>
            an aiming at Truth, particularly that relating to the gods <lb/>
            —a pursuit containing both in the acquisition and in the <lb/>
            search a reception, as it were, of things sacred-an occu­ <lb/>
            pation more pious than any observation of abstinence, or <lb/>
            religious service: but particularly well-pleasing to this <lb/>
            goddess who is the special object of thy devotion; for she <lb/>
            is both wise, and a lover of wisdom ; as her name appears <lb/>
            to denote that, more than any other, knowing and know­ <lb/>
            ledge belong to her. For “Isis " is a Greek word, and so <lb/>
            is “Typhon," her enemy, for he is " puffed up " by want <lb/>
            of knowledge and falsehood, and tears to pieces, and puts <lb/>
            out of sight, the sacred word which the goddess again <lb/>
            gathers up and puts together, and gives into the charge <lb/>
            of those initiated into the religion ; whilst by means of a <lb/>
            perpetually sober life, by abstinence from many kinds of <lb/>
            food and from venery, she checks intemperance and love of <lb/>
            pleasure, accustoming people to endure her service with <lb/>
            bowels not enervated by luxury, but hardy and vigorous ; <lb/>
            the object of all which is the knowledge of the First, the <lb/>
            Supreme, and the Intelligible ; whom the goddess exhorts <lb/>
            you to seek after, for he is both by her side, and united <lb/>
            with her. The very name of her Temple clearly promises <lb/>
            both the communication and the understanding of That <lb/>
            which is—for it is called the " Ision," 1 inasmuch as That <lb/>
            which is shall be known if we enter with intelligence and <lb/>
            piously into the sacred rites of the goddess.</p>
          <p>TII. Besides this, many have made her out to be <lb/>
            daughter of Hermes; many others, of Prometheus: of <lb/>
            whom the latter they hold to be the inventor of wisdom <lb/>
            and fore-knowledge ; Hermes, of grammar and of music. <note type="footnote"> 1 “The entering-place," as if derived from the Greek. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            For which reason, of the Muses at Hermopolis they call <lb/>
            the foremost one " Isis," and " Justice-Wisdom," as hath <lb/>
            been stated ; and they show the divine mysteries to such <lb/>
            as be truly and rightfully styled " carriers of sacred <lb/>
            things," and " wearers of sacred robes ": these are they <lb/>
            that carry in the soul, as it were in a copper, the sacred <lb/>
            story respecting the gods that cleanses the recipient from <lb/>
            all superstition, and magical follies : and who wrap them­ <lb/>
            selves up, sometimes in things black and dusky, at other <lb/>
            times bright and conspicuous-darkly showing forth the <lb/>
            same notions as regards opinion of the gods as are ex­ <lb/>
            pressed with respect to the sacred vestment. For which <lb/>
            reason, the circumstance that the votaries of Isis, upon <lb/>
            their death, are clothed with these robes, is a symbol that <lb/>
            they go into the next world carrying with them this <lb/>
            Word,' and nothing else. For it is not, Clea, the wearing <lb/>
            of beards and the dressing in long gowns that makes <lb/>
            people philosophers; neither does the linen surplice and <lb/>
            shaven crown make votaries of Isis, but the real Isiacist is <lb/>
            he that is competent to investigate by the aid of the <lb/>
            Word, the symbolism, and the ceremonies connected with <lb/>
            these deities (after he has been lawfully empowered so <lb/>
            to do) ; and who meditates upon the Truth which is <lb/>
            involved in them.</p>
          <p>IV. For it is a fact that most people do not understand <lb/>
            that most general, and insignificant circumstance, for <lb/>
            what reason the priests cut off their hair, and wear linen <lb/>
            robes : some do not trouble themselves at all to know the <lb/>
            cause for these two rules, whilst others say that they <lb/>
            abstain from the use of wool, as they do from the flesh, <lb/>
            out of veneration for the sheep; that they shave the head <lb/>
            in token of their mourning (for Osiris), and that they <lb/>
            wear linen on account of the colour the flax in blossom <lb/>
            displays, which resembles the smiling atmosphere encom- <note type="footnote">1 The revealed Truth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            passing the earth. But the real cause is the same for all, <lb/>
            because (as Plato observes), it is not lawful for one <lb/>
            not pure to handle what is pure. Now no superfluity of <lb/>
            nutrition or excrement is either chaste or pure. Now it <lb/>
            is out of such superfluity that wool and hair, and down, <lb/>
            and the nails, spring and grow. For it were absurd that <lb/>
            people should divest themselves of their own hair, shaving <lb/>
            the body very smoothly, during the fasts, and yet should <lb/>
            envelope themselves in the hair of beasts, and we ought to <lb/>
            suppose that when Hesiod says:­ <lb/>
            " Nor from the five-branched thing, on holy day, <lb/>
            Cut with the steel the dry from green away,” <lb/>
            He teaches that people ought to make themselves clear <lb/>
            from such things beforehand, and so keep the festival, <lb/>
            not in the middle of the religious services to occupy them­ <lb/>
            selves with the cleaning and the removal of excre­ <lb/>
            mentitious things. Again, the flax springs out of what is <lb/>
            immortal, the earth, and produces an edible fruit, and <lb/>
            furnishes a smooth and cleanly clothing, that does not <lb/>
            weigh one down with the covering, and well-suited also to <lb/>
            any season, and is least of all others apt to breed lice, as <lb/>
            they say, concerning all which points there is another <lb/>
            legend.</p>
          <p>V. The priests so greatly dislike the nature of excre­ <lb/>
            mentitious things, that they not only reject most kinds of <lb/>
            pulse, and the flesh of sheep and swine, as producing <lb/>
            much superfluity of nutriment, but during the fasts <lb/>
            they even banish all salt from their meals, assigning <lb/>
            many other reasons for so doing, and particularly that <lb/>
            salt makes people more fond of drinking and of eating, <lb/>
            by sharpening the appetite: for to consider, as Arista­ <lb/>
            goras pretends, that salt is not pure because multi­ <lb/>
            tudes of little insects are caught and die in it as it <lb/>
            is congealing, is mere folly. They are said also to give <lb/>
            the Apis drink out of a well of his own, but to keep <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            him away from the Nile; not that they hold the Nile <lb/>
            water to be polluted by reason of the crocodiles, as some <lb/>
            think, for nothing is so venerated by Egyptians as the <lb/>
            Nile, but because drinking the water of the Nile is sup­ <lb/>
            posed above all other to fatten, and produce corpulence; <lb/>
            for they do not wish to have the Apia in such condition, <lb/>
            nor themselves either, but to render their bodies active <lb/>
            and lightly moved by their souls, and not to weigh down <lb/>
            and crush the divine part by the mortal ones growing <lb/>
            strong and preponderating.</p>
          <p>VI. As for wine, they that serve the god at Heliopolis, <lb/>
            do not usually carry it into the temple, for the reason that <lb/>
            it is not decent to drink when the Lord and King of day <lb/>
            is looking on. The others use it indeed, but sparingly, <lb/>
            and keep many fasts where wine is forbidden; during <lb/>
            which they spend their time in arguing, learning, and <lb/>
            seeking things pertaining to religion : but the kings used <lb/>
            to drink a measured quantity, prescribed by the sacred <lb/>
            books (as Hecataeus relates in his History), although they <lb/>
            were also priests. They began to drink from the reign of <lb/>
            Psammetichus, for before him they drank no wine, neither <lb/>
            did they make libation of it as a thing acceptable to the I <lb/>
            gods, but as the blood of the gods' greatest enemies, out <lb/>
            of whom they believe it sprung when they were fallen, and <lb/>
            mingled with the earth, for which reason the being drunk <lb/>
            makes men out of their senses and furious, inasmuch as <lb/>
            they are then possessed by the authors of the blood. This <lb/>
            story Eudoxus tells us in the second book of his " Travels," <lb/>
            is so related by the priests.</p>
          <p>VII. As to sea fish, all do not abstain from every sort, <lb/>
            but from some kinds only, as for instance, the natives of <lb/>
            Oxyrynchites abstain from all that are caught with a hook ; <lb/>
            for worshipping as they do the fish called oxyrynchus, they <lb/>
            are afraid that the hook may not be unpolluted in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of an oxyrynchus having been caught by the same. <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            The Syennites abstain from eating the phagrus; for that <lb/>
            fish is thought to make its appearance together with the <lb/>
            swelling of the Nile, and to announce its rise to rejoicing <lb/>
            people, showing itself as a self-sent herald. But the priests <lb/>
            abstain from all fish alike, and when on the first day of <lb/>
            the ninth month the Egyptians feast each one on broiled <lb/>
            fish before his house door, the priests do not taste thereof, <lb/>
            but burn fish to ashes in front of their own doors, assign­ <lb/>
            ing two reasons for this usage; the one of which being <lb/>
            religious and important, and connected with the pious in­ <lb/>
            quiry concerning Osiris and Typhon, I will take up again <lb/>
            further on; the other, an obvious and ready explanation, <lb/>
            making out fish to be an unnecessary and over-luxurious <lb/>
            article of diet, agrees with Homer who represents neither <lb/>
            the luxurious Phaeaceans, nor the Ithacans, although is­ <lb/>
            landers, as making use of fish, nor yet the shipmates of <lb/>
            Ulysses on so long a voyage and out at sea, before they <lb/>
            were reduced to the extreme of want. And in fine, they <lb/>
            (the priests) hold the sea to proceed from fire, and as dis­ <lb/>
            tinct from all else; neither a part nor an element of nature <lb/>
            but something of a different sort, both destructive and <lb/>
            the occasion of disease.</p>
          <p>VIII. For nothing that is irrational or fabulous, or <lb/>
            springing out of superstition (as some suppose), has been <lb/>
            established in the religious rites but what has partly moral <lb/>
            and salutary reasons, partly others not devoid of ingenuity <lb/>
            in their bearings upon history and physics. For ex­ <lb/>
            ample, take the garlic (for the fable that Dictys, foster <lb/>
            father of Isis, fell into the river and was lost as he was <lb/>
            laying hold of some garlic is improbable to the last degree), <lb/>
            but the priests entertain religious scruples about it and <lb/>
            avoid and dislike the garlic, because this is the only plant <lb/>
            that naturally grows and flourishes while the moon is on <lb/>
            the wane; and it is suitable neither for persons keeping <lb/>
            fast, nor holding festival, because it makes the one thirsty, <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            the other to shed tears when they eat thereof. In the <lb/>
            same way they hold the swine to be an unholy animal be­ <lb/>
            cause it seems to copulate most of all when the moon is <lb/>
            on the wane, and of those who drink its milk, the bodies <lb/>
            break out into leprosies and itchey eruptions; for the <lb/>
            legend which they repeat over it, when they sacrifice (once <lb/>
            for all) and eat a swine at the new moon, namely, that <lb/>
            Typhon was pursuing a swine by the light of the full moon, <lb/>
            and so found the wooden coffer, in which lay the body of <lb/>
            Osiris and scattered the pieces, is not accepted by all; for <lb/>
            they hold this, like many other things, to belong to false <lb/>
            traditions. But they say that those of old were so hostile <lb/>
            to luxury, extravagance, and delicate living, that they re­ <lb/>
            late there was a column set up in the Temple of Thebes <lb/>
            containing a curse engraved thereon against King Mnevis, <lb/>
            the first that drew away the Egyptians from their old way <lb/>
            of living without voyaging, without money, and of primi­ <lb/>
            tive simplicity. It is further said that Technatis, father <lb/>
            of Banchoreus, once when marching towards Arabia, when <lb/>
            his table-service was behindhand, dined upon what food <lb/>
            was procurable and afterwards slept soundly upon a mat­ <lb/>
            tress, and thus became enamoured of simple fare; and in <lb/>
            consequence of this, uttered a curse upon Mnevis, and with <lb/>
            the approval of the priests, set up a pillar publishing the <lb/>
            anathema.</p>
          <p>IX. For the kings used to be elected out of either the <lb/>
            sacerdotal or the military class, the latter enjoying dignity <lb/>
            and honour on account of valour, the former on account of <lb/>
            wisdom; but he that was elected out of the military class <lb/>
            immediately became one of the priests, and was initiated <lb/>
            into their wisdom, which was for the most part shrouded in <lb/>
            fables and stories giving obscure indications and glimpses <lb/>
            of the truth, as indeed they themselves half acknowledge <lb/>
            by kindly setting up the Sphinxes in front of their temples, <lb/>
            as though their religious teaching contained wisdom hidden <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            in enigmas. And the shrine of Minerva at Sais (whom <lb/>
            they consider the same with Isis) bears this inscription, <lb/>
            “I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be ; and my <lb/>
            veil no mortal has hitherto raised." Furthermore, as most <lb/>
            people believe that the proper name of Jupiter amongst <lb/>
            the Egyptians is " Ammies" (which we corruptly call <lb/>
            “Ammon”). Manetho the Sebennyte is of opinion that <lb/>
            the " hidden" and " hiding" is expressed by this word. <lb/>
            Hecataeus of Abdera says that the Egyptians use this word <lb/>
            to one another, when they are calling anyone to them ; for <lb/>
            the word is one of calling to, for which reason the Supreme <lb/>
            God (whom they consider the same with the All) they in­ <lb/>
            voice as being hidden and invisible, and exhort him to make <lb/>
            himself visible and apparent, and therefore call him <lb/>
            “Amun”: so great therefore was the piety of the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians in their teaching respecting the gods.</p>
          <p>X. The wisest of the Greeks bear testimony to this, <lb/>
            such as Solon, Thales, Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras (some <lb/>
            say Lycurgus also), by their travelling into Egypt and con­ <lb/>
            versing with the priests. Eudoxus, for example, they say, <lb/>
            received lessons from Chonupheus of Memphis; Solon, <lb/>
            from Sonchis of Sais; Pythagoras from Oenuphis of He­ <lb/>
            liopolis; and he being probably the most admired of these <lb/>
            visitors, and himself admiring the people, copied their <lb/>
            symbolical and mysterious style, aad wrapped up his doc­ <lb/>
            trines in enigmas; for the most part of the Pythagorean <lb/>
            precepts do not fall short of the so-called hieroglyphic <lb/>
            writings in obscurity ; such, for instance, as, Not to eat <lb/>
            off a chair ; " " Not to sit down upon a corn-measure;" <lb/>
            " Not to plant a palm-tree ;" " Not to stir the fire with <lb/>
            a sword in the house." And I myself think that the fact <lb/>
            that the men (of his sect) call the unit " Apollo," the two <lb/>
            " Diana," the seven, " Minerva;" and " Neptune " the first <lb/>
            Cube; is analogous to the things set up upon the temples, <lb/>
            and in truth to those done and painted there. For the <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            king and lord, Osiris, they represent by an eye and a <lb/>
            sceptre, and some even interpret the name as " Many-eyed," <lb/>
            the " os " signifying many, and the " iri," eye, in the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tian language: and Heaven, as being exempt from old <lb/>
            age by reason of its eternity, by a heart with an altar of <lb/>
            incense placed below it. And in Thebes there were dedi­ <lb/>
            cated statues of Judges wanting the hands : whilst that of <lb/>
            the chief-judge had also the eyes closed, showing that <lb/>
            Justice is above bribes, and not to be moved by prayer. <lb/>
            The Military class had the beetle for device on signet, for <lb/>
            the beetle is never female, but all are males, and they <lb/>
            breed by depositing their seed [in balls of dung]; since <lb/>
            they make these balls, not so much to provide material for <lb/>
            food, as a place for propagation of their kind.</p>
          <p>XI. When therefore you shall hear the fables the <lb/>
            Egyptians tell about the gods-their wanderings, cutting <lb/>
            to pieces, and many such like mishaps you ought to bear <lb/>
            in mind what has been above stated, and not to suppose <lb/>
            that any of them happened or was done in the manner re­ <lb/>
            lated. For they do not really call the dog " Hermes," <lb/>
            but the animal's watchfulness, sleeplessness, and sagacity <lb/>
            (for by knowledge and absence of knowledge it distin­ <lb/>
            guishes between friend and foe, as Plato says) make it <lb/>
            appropriate to the most sagacious of the gods : neither do <lb/>
            they suppose that the sun rises as a new born child out of <lb/>
            a lotus, but it is in this way they picture the rising of the <lb/>
            sun, enigmatically expressing that the solar fire is derived <lb/>
            from moisture. For that most savage and terrible King of <lb/>
            the Persians, Ochus—who put many to death, and finally <lb/>
            butchered Apis and dined upon him along with his friends <lb/>
            -they styled " The Sword," and still call him by that <lb/>
            name in the list of kings ; that is not actually describing <lb/>
            his person, but likening the hardness and wickedness of <lb/>
            his disposition to an instrument of slaughter. In the <lb/>
            same way must you hear the stories about the gods, and <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            receive them from such as interpret mythology, in a reve­ <lb/>
            rent and philosophic spirit, both performing constantly <lb/>
            and observing the established rites of the worship, and <lb/>
            believing that no sacrifice nor act is more well pleasing <lb/>
            to the gods, than is the holding the true faith with respect <lb/>
            to them, so will you escape an evil no less great than <lb/>
            Atheism, namely, Superstition.</p>
          <p>XII. The following myth is related in the briefest terms <lb/>
            possible, divested of everything unnecessary and super­ <lb/>
            fluous. They tell that the sun having discovered Rhea <lb/>
            secretly copulating with Saturn, laid a curse upon her, <lb/>
            that she should not bring forth a child in either month or <lb/>
            year: that Hermes being in love with the goddess copulated <lb/>
            with her; and afterwards playing at counters with the Moon <lb/>
            and winning from her the seventieth part of each one of her <lb/>
            lights, out of the whole composed five days, the which he <lb/>
            added to the three hundred and sixty, which days now <lb/>
            the Egyptians call " additional," and keep as the birth­ <lb/>
            days of the gods; that on the first of these was born <lb/>
            Osiris, and that, a voice issued forth with him in the birth, <lb/>
            that " the Lord of all is entering into light." But some <lb/>
            relate that a certain Pamyle, when drawing water out of <lb/>
            the Temple of Jupiter at Thebes, heard a voice ordering <lb/>
            her to proclaim with a loud cry, " A great king, beneficent <lb/>
            Osiris, is born," and for this cause she nursed Osiris, <lb/>
            when Saturn put him into her hands; and also the festival <lb/>
            “Pamylia," is celebrated in his honour, resembling in <lb/>
            character the phallic processions. On the second was born <lb/>
            Aroeris, whom some call Apollo, some the elder Horns. <lb/>
            On the third Typhon, neither in due time, nor in the right <lb/>
            place, but, breaking through with a blow, he leaped out <lb/>
            through his mother’s side. On the fourth was Isis born, <lb/>
            in very wet places. On the fifth was Nephthys, the same <lb/>
            as the “End," and "Venus," whom some call Victory. <lb/>
            They say that Osiris was begotten by the Sun, as also <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            Aroeris, by Hermes Isis, by Saturn Typhon and Nephthys; <lb/>
            that Osiris and Isis fell in love with each other and copu­ <lb/>
            lated under the cloak of darkness in the womb; some say <lb/>
            that in this manner was Aroeris begotten, and therefore is <lb/>
            called by Egyptians, the elder Horus, by the Greeks, <lb/>
            Apollo.</p>
          <p>XIII. That when Osiris reigned over the Egyptians he <lb/>
            made them reform their destitute and bestial mode of <lb/>
            living, showing them the art of cultivation, and giving <lb/>
            them laws, and teaching them how to worship the gods. <lb/>
            Afterwards he travelled over the whole earth, civilizing it; <lb/>
            far from requiring arms, he tamed mankind through per­ <lb/>
            suasion and reasoning joined with song of all kinds and <lb/>
            music which he brought over; wherefore he is held by the <lb/>
            Greeks to be the same with Bacchus. That Typhon, during <lb/>
            his absence, did not rebel, because Isis was on her guard, <lb/>
            and able to keep watch upon him vigorously; but after <lb/>
            Osiris returned Typhon laid a plot against him, having <lb/>
            taken seventy and two men into the conspiracy, and having <lb/>
            for helper a queen coming out of Ethiopia, whom they call <lb/>
            A sO. That she secretly measured the body of Osiris, and <lb/>
            made to the size a handsome and highly ornamented coffer <lb/>
            which he carried into the banqueting room. And as they <lb/>
            were all delighted with its appearance and admired it; <lb/>
            Typhon promised in sport that whoever should lie down <lb/>
            within it, and should exactly fit, he would make him a <lb/>
            present of the chest; and after the others had tried, one <lb/>
            by one, and nobody fitted it; then Osiris got in, and laid <lb/>
            himself down, thereupon the conspirators running up shut <lb/>
            down the lid, and fastened it with spike-nails from the <lb/>
            outside, and poured melted lead over them, and so carried <lb/>
            it out to the River, and let it go down down the Tanaite <lb/>
            branch into the sea : which branch on that account is hate­ <lb/>
            ful, and unlucky for Egyptians to name. These things <lb/>
            are said to have been done on the 17th day of the month <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            Athor, when the sun is passing through the Scorpion, <lb/>
            Osiris then being in the eight and twentieth year of his <lb/>
            reign. Some have it that he had lived, not reigned, such <lb/>
            a time.</p>
          <p>XIV. The first to discover the mischief were the Pans <lb/>
            and Satyrs inhabiting the country round Chemmis and to <lb/>
            give intelligence1 about what had happened, whence the <lb/>
            sudden terrors and fears of the multitude are to the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day called panics." Isis on the news, sheared off one <lb/>
            of her tresses, and put on a mourning robe, whence the <lb/>
            city, even to the present day has the name of " Copto " (I <lb/>
            beat the breast); but others think the name signifies be­ <lb/>
            reavement, from " coptein " to deprive." As she wandered <lb/>
            about everywhere, not knowing what to do, she met no <lb/>
            one without speaking to him, nay, even when she fell in <lb/>
            with little children, she inquired of them about the coffer; <lb/>
            these last chanced to have seen it, and told her the branch <lb/>
            of the River through which Typhon's accomplices had let <lb/>
            the chest drift into the sea. From this circumstance the <lb/>
            Egyptians believe that little children possess the faculty <lb/>
            of prophesy, and that especially the future is fore-shown <lb/>
            by their cries when they are playing in the temple courts, <lb/>
            and calling out whatever it may be. And having discovered <lb/>
            that he (Typhon) had fallen in love and copulated with his <lb/>
            sister, in ignorance, as Osiris had done with herself, and <lb/>
            seeing the proof thereof in the garland of melilote flower <lb/>
            which he had left behind him with Nephthys, she sought <lb/>
            for the infant (for she had brought it forth at once, through <lb/>
            her fear of Typhon), she found it at last with trouble and <lb/>
            difficulty, through dogs guiding her to the place. This <lb/>
            infant Isis nursed, and he grew up her guard and minister, <lb/>
            being denominated Anubis; and said to watch for the gods <lb/>
            just as dogs do for men. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον ἐμβαλόντων</foreign>, looks like a false reading for <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόβον</foreign>: "spreading <lb/>
            the alarm." </note> <pb n="13"/>
            </p>
          <p>X V. Proceeding thence, she learnt by inquiry that the chest <lb/>
            had been washed up by the sea at a place called Byblus, and <lb/>
            that the surf had gently laid it under an Erica tree. This <lb/>
            Erica, a most lovely plant, growing up very large in a very short <lb/>
            time had enfolded, embraced, and concealed the coffer with­ <lb/>
            in itself. The king of the place being astonished at the <lb/>
            size of the plant, and having cut away the clump that con­ <lb/>
            cealed the coffer from sight, set the latter up as a pillar to <lb/>
            support his roof. They tell how Isis having learnt all this <lb/>
            by the divine breath of fame, came to Byblus, and sitting <lb/>
            down by the side of a spring all dejected and weeping <lb/>
            spoke not a word to any other persons, but saluted and <lb/>
            made friends of the maid servants of the queen, by dressing <lb/>
            their hair for them, and infusing into their bodies a won­ <lb/>
            derful perfume out of herself; when the queen saw her <lb/>
            maids again, she fell a longing to see the stranger, whose <lb/>
            hair and whose body breathed of ambrosial perfume ; and <lb/>
            so she was sent for, becoming intimate with the queen, <lb/>
            was made nurse of her infant. The king's name they <lb/>
            say was Malacander, herself some call Astarte, others <lb/>
            Sooses, others Neinanoë, who is the same with the Greek <lb/>
            , Athenais.</p>
          <p>XVI. Isis is said to have suckled the child by putting, <lb/>
            instead of her nipple, her finger into his mouth, and by <lb/>
            night she singed away the mortal parts of his body. She <lb/>
            turned herself into a swallow and flew around the pillar <lb/>
            until the queen watched her, and cried out when she saw <lb/>
            her child all on fire, and so took away the boy's immor­ <lb/>
            tality. Then the goddess, manifesting herself, asked for <lb/>
            the pillar of the roof, and having removed it with the <lb/>
            greatest ease, she cut away the Erica that surrounded it. <lb/>
            This plant she wrapped up in a linen cloth, pouring per­ <lb/>
            fume over it, and gave it in charge to the king; and to <lb/>
            this day the people of Byblus venerate the wood, which is <lb/>
            preserved in the temple of Isis. The coffin she clasped in <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            her arms, and wailed so loud that the younger of the <lb/>
            king's sons died of fright at it, the elder she took with her <lb/>
            and putting the coffer on board a ship, put to sea; but <lb/>
            when the river Phaedrus sent forth too rough a gale, she <lb/>
            grew wrath, and dried up the stream.</p>
          <p>XVII. As soon as ever she obtained privacy, and was <lb/>
            left by herself, having opened the coffer and laid her face <lb/>
            upon the face of the corpse, she wailed and wept; but <lb/>
            when the little boy observed this, and came up quietly <lb/>
            from behind to spy, she perceived him, and turning round <lb/>
            gave him a dreadful look in her rage, the child could not <lb/>
            stand the fright, and died. Some say it was not so, but <lb/>
            in the manner just stated he tumbled (in his flight) into <lb/>
            the sea, but that he receives honours for the sake of the <lb/>
            goddess, for the Maneros, whom the Egyptians sing about <lb/>
            at their feasts, is this child. Others say that the boy is <lb/>
            called Palaestinos, or Pelusios, and that the city was named <lb/>
            after him, having been founded by the goddess. The <lb/>
            Maneros that is sung about, they relate, first invented <lb/>
            music. But some pretend " Maneros ” is not the name of <lb/>
            of a person, but an expression suited to people drinking <lb/>
            and keeping holiday and signifying " May things of the <lb/>
            sort come with good luck," for that the Egyptians exclaim <lb/>
            this, each time, upon the Maneros being uttered; just as, <lb/>
            indeed, the exhibition of a dead man in his coffin carried <lb/>
            round at feasts is not a reminder of the mourning for <lb/>
            Osiris, as some interpret it, but merely intended1 to warn <lb/>
            one to make use of the present and enjoy it, as very soon <lb/>
            they themselves shall be as he, which is why they bring it <lb/>
            in to the feast.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But when Isis had gone to see her son Horns <lb/>
            (who was at nurse in the city Buto), and had put the coffer <lb/>
            away, Typhon being out a hunting by moonlight came upon <lb/>
            it, and recognising the corpse, tore it into fourteen pieces, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰομένους</foreign> in text makes no sense, perhaps olov <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνον</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            and scattered them abroad. Isis having heard of this, <lb/>
            sought after the fragments, passing over the swamps in <lb/>
            a papyrus boat; for which cause such as sail in papyrus <lb/>
            boats are never injured by the crocodiles, because they <lb/>
            either fear or respect the goddess, from this circumstance <lb/>
            there are many places called " Tombs of Osiris " all over <lb/>
            Egypt, because she, whenever she came upon a fragment <lb/>
            of the body, there celebrated a funeral. Some deny this, <lb/>
            but say that she made images and gave them to the several <lb/>
            cities, giving them as the actual body, in order that they <lb/>
            may receive honours from those sailing past, and that if <lb/>
            Typhon should get the better of Horus, when searching for <lb/>
            the real tomb he may be baffled, from many being so called <lb/>
            and pointed out. Of the members of Osiris the only one <lb/>
            Isis was unable to find was the genital member, for it had <lb/>
            been thrown at first into the River, and lepidotus, phagrus, <lb/>
            and oxyrynchus had fed upon it, which kinds of fish the <lb/>
            natives scruple to eat above all others, and that Isis in its <lb/>
            stead made a model and consecrated it, namely the phallus, <lb/>
            in honour whereof the Egyptians hold a festival.</p>
          <p>XIX: Afterwards Osiris came from the shades to Horus, <lb/>
            and trained and exercised him for war, and then asked <lb/>
            him " What he thought the finest thing possible ?" and <lb/>
            when he replied " to avenge one's father and mother when <lb/>
            ill treated;" he asked him secondly “what he considered <lb/>
            the most useful animal to people going to battle ?" and <lb/>
            when Horus answered, " the horse," Osiris wondered at it <lb/>
            and was puzzled why he said the horse instead of the lion. <lb/>
            But when Horus explained that the lion indeed was ser­ <lb/>
            viceable to one standing in need of aid, but the horse can <lb/>
            both save him that flees and also destroy the enemy: <lb/>
            Osiris on hearing this was rejoiced at the supposition that <lb/>
            Horus had provided himself with horses. And as numbers <lb/>
            came over from time to time to the side of Horus, Typhon's <lb/>
            concubine, Thucris by name, came also, and a serpent pur­ <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            suing her was cut to pieces by the friends of Horus; and <lb/>
            now in memory of this event, they throw down a rope in <lb/>
            the midst of all, and chop it to pieces. The battle lasted <lb/>
            for many days, and Horus vanquished, but Isis having re­ <lb/>
            ceived from him Typhon in chains, did not destroy, but on <lb/>
            the contrary unbound and let him go free. This Horus <lb/>
            did not endure with patience, but he laid hands on his <lb/>
            mother, and pushed the crown off her head; whereupon <lb/>
            Hermes placed a bull's skull upon her instead of helmet. <lb/>
            And when Typhon brought a charge of illegitimacy against <lb/>
            Horus, Hermes acting as his counsel, Horus was pro­ <lb/>
            nounced legitimate by the gods. After this Typhon was <lb/>
            beaten in two other battles; and Isis conceived by Osiris <lb/>
            copulating with her after death,! and brought forth the <lb/>
            prematurely born, and weak in his lower limbs, Harpo­ <lb/>
            crates.</p>
          <p>XX. These are pretty nearly the heads of the legend, <lb/>
            the most blasphemous parts being omitted ; for example, <lb/>
            about the dismemberment of Horus, and the decapitation <lb/>
            of Isis, because if these things people believe and say con­ <lb/>
            cerning blessed and incorruptible natures (by whose <lb/>
            medium the idea of the deity is mainly conceived) as <lb/>
            having been really done, and really having happened to <lb/>
            them=then, as Æschylus hath it:­ <lb/>
            “We must spit at the tale, and rinse the mouth:” <lb/>
            and there is no more need of talking to you, in fact, you <lb/>
            are yourself disgusted at people holding such absurd and <lb/>
            uncivilized notions respecting the gods. Are not these <lb/>
            things exactly like the fine-spun fables and empty tales <lb/>
            that poets and story tellers, like spiders, breed out of <lb/>
            themselves, without foundation from first to last, and <lb/>
            weave and spread them out ? Nevertheless, this history <note type="footnote"> I Alluding to the incident of the opening of his coffer, and explaining <lb/>
            the sad late of the too inquisitive little boy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            contains certain questions, and descriptions of real events <lb/>
            and in the same way as mathematicians say that the rain­ <lb/>
            bow is the image of the sun, variously coloured through <lb/>
            the reflection of the image upon the cloud, so the legend <lb/>
            before us is a kind of reflection of a history reflecting the <lb/>
            true meaning upon other things ; as is shown forth by the <lb/>
            sacrifices containing a representation of mourning and sad. <lb/>
            ness ; as also by the ground plan of the temples, in some <lb/>
            parts spreading out into colonnades, and courts open to <lb/>
            the sky and lightsome, in others having under ground <lb/>
            hidden and dark galleries (like that at Thebes), and halls <lb/>
            as well; and above all, by the belief of the Osiris wore <lb/>
            shippers, where his body is said to be deposited in several <lb/>
            places at once. Abydos, perhaps, or the little town Mem­ <lb/>
            phis, they say, is celebrated for possessing the only true <lb/>
            body: and that at Abydos are buried the rich and noble of <lb/>
            the Egyptians, ambitious to share the burial place of Osiris' <lb/>
            body, whilst in Memphis is kept the Apis, the "Image <lb/>
            of the soul of Osiris," where his body also is said to lie.</p>
          <p>XXI. That city's name also some interpret as " Harbour <lb/>
            of good things," others as "Tomb of Osiris;" but the <lb/>
            " Nisbitane" placed close to the gates, is universally <lb/>
            shunned and unapproachable, not even a bird perches upon <lb/>
            it, nor a fish comes up to it; but at a particular season the <lb/>
            priests cross over, and offer burnt offerings, and crown the <lb/>
            monument which is overshadowed with the shrub called <lb/>
            " methides," and exceeding in size any olive tree. But <lb/>
            Eudoxus states that though there are many so-called Tombs <lb/>
            in Egypt, yet that the true monument was erected at <lb/>
            Busiris, for that that was the birthplace of Osiris; for the <lb/>
            name " Taphosiris" requires no explanation since the <lb/>
            name itself means “Tomb of Osiris." I approve of the <lb/>
            chopping of wood,1 the cutting down of flax, the pouring out <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably explaining the trunk, with lopped off branches, so fre­ <lb/>
            quently figured on the Gnostic stones. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            of libation, inasmuch as the generality of mystic rites are <lb/>
            interspersed with these ceremonies, and not only the <lb/>
            priests of this, but also of the other gods (that is of all <lb/>
            that are not unborn and incorruptible) assert that their <lb/>
            "bodies are deposited with them, and are taken care of after <lb/>
            their decease, but that their souls shine in heaven as stars ; <lb/>
            and that of Isis so called by the Greeks the Dog-star, but <lb/>
            by the Egyptians Sothis; that of Horus, Orion, that of <lb/>
            Typhon, the Bear, and towards the keep of the sacred <lb/>
            animals, all the rest of Egypt pay an assessment, but the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the Thebaid alone refuse to pay, because <lb/>
            they do not bold with mortal deities ; but with them whom <lb/>
            they themselves call " Kneph," who is unborn and incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible.</p>
          <p>XXII. Since many places of the sort are called and <lb/>
            shown as divine Tombs, those who suppose them to be in <lb/>
            reality those of kings and tyrants (who by reason of their <lb/>
            extraordinary merit, or power, had arrogated honours to <lb/>
            themselves by the fame of their superhuman nature, and <lb/>
            had afterwards shared the common lot), whose terrible or <lb/>
            mighty deeds or fates are thus commemorated, such per­ <lb/>
            sons find a very easy evasion of the legend, and shift its <lb/>
            indecency from the gods upon men; and they obtain sup­ <lb/>
            port from the religious rites. For the Egyptians relate <lb/>
            that Hermes had one arm bent so that it could not be <lb/>
            straightened, that Typhon was red in complexion, Horus <lb/>
            white, and that Osiris was black skinned-just as so many <lb/>
            men born in the course of nature. Besides, they call a <lb/>
            general “Osiris," and a pilot “Canopus" (after whom the <lb/>
            star is named); also that the ship which the Greeks call <lb/>
            the Argo, was the representation of the bark of Osiris, <lb/>
            made a constellation of in his honour; and it moves along <lb/>
            at no great distance from Orion and the Dog-star, of which <lb/>
            the Egyptians hold the one to be sacred to Horus, the <lb/>
            other to Isis.</p><pb n="19"/>
            
          <p>XXIII. I am afraid that this is " moving things that <lb/>
            ought not to be moved, and making war not only upon <lb/>
            antiquity " (as Simonides hath it), but upon many tribes <lb/>
            and families of man, possessed with veneration for these <lb/>
            particular deities, when people let nothing alone, but trans­ <lb/>
            fer these great names from the heavens to the earth, and <lb/>
            do their best to eradicate and destroy (or nearly so) the <lb/>
            respect and faith implanted in men from their infancy, <lb/>
            and opening a wide door to the atheistical sort,1 and also to <lb/>
            him that humanizes the gods, and giving a splendid oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity to the deceptions of Evemerus, the Messenian, who, <lb/>
            by composing treatises upon his false and unfounded <lb/>
            mythology, disseminated atheism all over the world, re­ <lb/>
            ducing all deities alike to the names of generals, admirals, <lb/>
            and kings, pretended to have flourished in old times; <lb/>
            transcribing all this forsooth from the inscriptions in <lb/>
            letters of gold set up at Panchon which said inscriptions <lb/>
            no foreigner nor Greek, save Evemerus alone, as it seems, <lb/>
            has met with, when he made his voyage to the Panchoans <lb/>
            and Triphyllans, people that never were, nor are, in any <lb/>
            part of the globe.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And yet great exploits are sung amongst <lb/>
            Assyrians, namely those of Semiramis, and great in Egypt <lb/>
            those of Sesostris; the Phrygians even to this day call <lb/>
            splendid exploits " Manic," on account of Manis, one of <lb/>
            their ancient kings, having been good and powerful amongst <lb/>
            them, whom some also call " Masdes." 2 Cyrus led the <lb/>
            Persians, Alexander the Macedonians, conquering as they <lb/>
            went, to all but the utmost limits of the world; they <lb/>
            nevertheless have the name and the memory of good kings <lb/>
            (not of gods); and if some few, puffed up with vanity, as <lb/>
            Plato says, " with souls inflamed by youth and ignorance," <note type="footnote"> I An evident allusion to the Christians. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The common title of the Sassanean kings was " Masdesin," " ser­ <lb/>

             <pb n="20"/>
            have out of insolence assumed the style of gods, and the <lb/>
            dedication of temples in their honour, yet their glory has <lb/>
            flourished but a brief space, and thereafter they incurred <lb/>
            the charge of vanity and arrogance, coupled with that of <lb/>
            impiety and transgression of law :— <lb/>
            " Raised up like smoke, they quickly fell to earth: * <lb/>
            And now like fugitives that can be arrested, they are <lb/>
            dragged out from their temples and altars, they keep <lb/>
            nothing but their names and tombs. On which account, <lb/>
            Antigonus the Elder, when a certain Hermodatus, in his <lb/>
            verses, compared him to the Sun, and styled him a god, <lb/>
            replied, " The carrier of my night-stool has not so good an <lb/>
            opinion of me"; and with reason did Lysippus, the <lb/>
            sculptor, censure Apelles, the painter, because in painting <lb/>
            Alexander's portrait he had put a thunderbolt into his <lb/>
            hand, whereas he himself had put a spear, the glory of <lb/>
            which no time shall efface, inasmuch as it is genuine and <lb/>
            appropriate.</p>
          <p>XXV. Do they, therefore, better, who believe the legends <lb/>
            told about Typhon, Osiris, and Isis, not to refer to either <lb/>
            gods or men, but to certain great Powers (dæmons), whom <lb/>
            Plato, Pythagoras, Xenocrates, and Chrysippus (following <lb/>
            the ancient theologians) assert to have been created far <lb/>
            stronger than men, and greatly surpassing our nature in <lb/>
            power, but yet having the divine part not entirely unmixed <lb/>
            nor unalloyed, but combined with the nature of the soul <lb/>
            and the senses of the body, susceptible of pleasure and <lb/>
            pain, and all other emotions the result of these, that by <lb/>
            their vicissitudes disturb, some in a greater, others in a <lb/>
            less degree; for, in that case, as amongst men, so amongst <lb/>
            daemons, exist degrees of virtue and of vice. For the <lb/>
            deeds of the Giants and Titans, sung of by the Greeks, <lb/>
            certain atrocious actions of Saturn, the pitched battle <lb/>
            between Python and Apollo, the flight of Bacchus, the <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            wanderings of Ceres do not fall short in absurdity of the <lb/>
            legends about Osiris and Typhon, and the others that one <lb/>
            may hear told by mythologists to any amount—all the <lb/>
            things that are shrouded in mystic ceremonies, and are <lb/>
            presented by rites, being kept secret and out of sight from <lb/>
            the vulgar, and have a shape similar to those mentioned <lb/>
            of the Egyptians.</p>
          <p>XXV. We also hear Homer perpetually styling the sur­ <lb/>
            passingly good, “godlike," and " equal to gods," and­ <lb/>
            ..." having from gods their sense:" <lb/>
            whereas he applies the epithet derived from daemons in. <lb/>
            differently to good and bad:­ <lb/>
            “Approach Dæmonian; wherefore fearest thou so--The Argives? ” <lb/>
            And again­ <lb/>
            " When like a dæmon the fourth time he charged :” <lb/>
            “0 dæmon-like I what harm bath Priam done thee, <lb/>
            Or Priam's race, that thus thou aye should strive <lb/>
            The beauteous town of Troy from earth to raze ?” <lb/>
            As though the daemons had a mixed and inconsistent nature <lb/>
            and disposition. For which reason Plato attributes to the <lb/>
            Olympian gods all things ingenious and extraordinary; <lb/>
            but the opposite of these to daemons; and Xenocrates <lb/>
            thinks that the unlucky days of the month, and whatever <lb/>
            festivals are accompanied with stripes and blows, abusive or <lb/>
            obscene language, have nothing to do with honouring the <lb/>
            gods or good daemons: but that there are certain Powers <lb/>
            of Nature existing in the circumambient air, great and <lb/>
            strong indeed, but malignant and ill-tempered, who take <lb/>
            delight in such things, and if they obtain them, betake <lb/>
            themselves to nothing worse. But the good ones, on the <lb/>
            contrary, Hesiod styles " pure dæmons,” and " guardians <lb/>
            of men ”;— <lb/>
            u Givers of wealth; and with such royal power." <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            And Plato terms this species " Hermeneutic " and " Dæ­ <lb/>
            monean," a middle class between gods and men, conveying <lb/>
            up thither vows and prayers from mankind, and bringing <lb/>
            down from thence to earth prophesies and gifts of things <lb/>
            good. Empedocles even asserts that daemons suffer punish­ <lb/>
            ment for their sins both of commission and omission:— <lb/>
            “Celestial wrath pursues them down to sea; <lb/>
            Sea spits them out on earth : earth to the rays <lb/>
            Of Sol unweared: he to the eddying air <lb/>
            Sends back the culprits; each receives in turn, <lb/>
            And all alike reject the hateful crew :" <lb/>
            until having been thus chastened and purified, they obtain <lb/>
            once more their natural place and position.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Akin to these and suchlike stories are, they <lb/>
            say, the legends told concerning Typhon; how that he <lb/>
            committed dreadful crimes out of envy and spite, and by <lb/>
            throwing all things into confusion he filled with evils all <lb/>
            the land and sea as well, and finally was punished for it. <lb/>
            But the avenger of Osiris, his Sister and Wife, who extin­ <lb/>
            guished and put a stop to the madness and fury of Typhon, <lb/>
            did not forget the contests and struggles she had gone <lb/>
            through, nor yet her own wanderings, nor did she suffer <lb/>
            oblivion and silence to envelope1 her many deeds of <lb/>
            wisdom, many feats of courage, but by intermingling with <lb/>
            the most sacred ceremonies, images, hints, and representa­ <lb/>
            tions of her sufferings of yore, she consecrated at one and <lb/>
            the same time, both lessons of piety and consolation in <lb/>
            suffering for men and women when overtaken by misfor­ <lb/>
            tune. And she, together with Osiris, having been trans­ <lb/>
            lated from the rank of good daemons up to that of gods, by <lb/>
            means of their virtue (as later was done with Hercules and <lb/>
            Bacchus) receive, not inappropriately, the united honours <lb/>
            of gods and of daemons everywhere, both in the regions <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπολάβουσα</foreign>, which makes no sense, add v and it agrees with <lb/>

            above earth, and in those under ground, possessing the <lb/>
            supreme power, for they say that Serapis is no other than <lb/>
            Pluto, and Isis Proserpine, as Archemoros of Euboea has <lb/>
            asserted; as also Heraclitus of Pontas, when he supposes <lb/>
            the Oracle at Canopas to belong to Pluto.</p>
          <p>XX VIII. Ptolemy Soter beheld in a dream the Colossus <lb/>
            of Pluto at Sinope, (though he had not before known not <lb/>
            seen what it was in appearance,) ordering him to bring it <lb/>
            as soon as possible to Alexandria; and when he was <lb/>
            ignorant and at a loss as to where the statue then stood, <lb/>
            and was relating the vision to his friends, there was found <lb/>
            a man, a great traveller, by name Sosibius, that declared <lb/>
            he had seen at Sinope just such a Colossus as the king <lb/>
            had dreamt he saw. He therefore despatched Soteles and <lb/>
            Dionysius, who after much time and with difficulty (not, <lb/>
            however, without divine aid) stole and brought away the <lb/>
            statue. And when it was brought and seen, then Timo­ <lb/>
            theus, the interpreter, and Manetho, the Sebennite, and <lb/>
            their fellows, conjecturing that it was a figure of Pluto <lb/>
            (drawing this conclusion from the Cerberus and the Ser­ <lb/>
            pent), made Ptolemy believe that it is of no other god, but <lb/>
            of Serapis, for it did not come bearing such a name from <lb/>
            the other place, but after it had been brought to Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, it got the name that Pluto bears amongst the <lb/>
            Egyptians, namely, Serapis. And seeing that Heraclitus, <lb/>
            the natural philosopher, asserts that “Hades and Dionysos <lb/>
            are the same person, when they are infuriated and rave," <lb/>
            they (the Egyptians) slip unconsciously into the same <lb/>
            belief. For such as explain that Hades means the Body, <lb/>
            because the Soul is as it were out of its senses, and <lb/>
            drunken,1 when confined therein, such people are too far <lb/>
            fetched in their interpretation. It is better, therefore, to <lb/>
            connect Osiris with Bacchus, and Serapis with Osiris, for <note type="footnote"> I The doctrine of the Alexandrian Platonists, as is fully set forth by <lb/>
            Macrobius in his description of the descent of the Soul. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            the latter obtained this appellation after he had changed <lb/>
            his nature,1 inasmuch as Serapis is common' to all, in the <lb/>
            same way as such as have partaken of the sacred rites <lb/>
            know that Osiris is.</p>
          <p>XXIX. For it is not worth while paying any attention <lb/>
            to the Phrygian sacred books, wherein it is said that <lb/>
            Serapis3 was the daughter of Hercules, and Typhon, son <lb/>
            of Isaicus, son of .... , nor yet to avoid treating Phylar­ <lb/>
            chus with contempt for saying that Bacchus first brought <lb/>
            two oxen out of India to Egypt; the name of one of which <lb/>
            was Apis , of the other Osiris. For Serapis is the name of <lb/>
            Him who puts in order the universe (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πα̃ν</foreign>), joined to <lb/>
            is sairein" which some say means " to beautify and ar­ <lb/>
            range."4 For these remarks of Phylarchus are absurd ; <lb/>
            yet far more absurd the opinion of such as say Serapis is <lb/>
            no god at all, but the coffin of Apis is so called :5 (they <lb/>
            also talk of certain brazen doors at Memphis, named the <lb/>
            "Doors of Oblivion and Wailing," which when they bury <lb/>
            Apia utter a deep and harsh sound, for which reason [we <lb/>
            are forbidden] to touch any sounding vessel of brass.) <lb/>
            More endurable is the explanation of such as derive it <lb/>
            from " stimulating (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σεύεσθαι</foreign>) the motion of the universe. <lb/>
            But the most part of the priests say that " Osiris" and <lb/>
            " Apis" are united into the same word, for they explain <lb/>
            and inform us that we ought to consider the Apia as a <lb/>
            beautiful image of the soul of Osiris. But for my part, if the <lb/>
            name of Serapis is really Egyptian, and I think it signifies <lb/>
            Cheerfulness and Rejoicing, founding my conjecture on <lb/>
            the fact that the Egyptians call the festival of Rejoicing, <note type="footnote"> 1 The name being compounded of Osiris and Apis, expresses that his <lb/>
            soul, after death, had pasaed unto the sacred bull. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Probably meaning, universal god, not a mere local Egyptian divinity. </note><note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαρωπὼς</foreign> in text. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This preposterous etymology is evidently that of Phylarchua. </note><note type="footnote"> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">σορὸς</foreign> “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απιδος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            “Sai rei," in fact Plato says that Hades1 is so named as <lb/>
            the " Son of Respectfulness," and a god benevolent to <lb/>
            such as dwell with him; and amongst the Egyptians <lb/>
            many other of the names (of gods) are significant words; <lb/>
            also that subterraneous place whither they believe the <lb/>
            souls go after death, they call "Amenthen," the name <lb/>
            signifying that which gives and takes," But whether <lb/>
            this be one of the names carried out of Greece in ancient <lb/>
            times, and brought back again, we will consider further <lb/>
            on ; at present it is our business to go through the remain­ <lb/>
            ing parts of this belief.</p>
          <p>XXX. Osiris and Isis passed from the rank of good <lb/>
            dæmons to that of deities; but the power of Typhon al­ <lb/>
            though dimmed and crushed, and still, as it were, in the <lb/>
            last agony and convulsions, they nevertheless propitiate <lb/>
            and soothe by means of certain sacrifices : but occasionally <lb/>
            they humiliate and insult him at certain festivals, when <lb/>
            they abuse red haired men and tumble an ass down a pre­ <lb/>
            cipice ; for example this is done by the people of Memphis, <lb/>
            because Typhon was red haired, and like an ass in com­ <lb/>
            plexion. The people of Busiris and Lycopolis do not use <lb/>
            trumpets at all because they make a sound like the ass: <lb/>
            and altogether, they regard the ass as an unclean and <lb/>
            dæmon-like animal on account of his resemblance to that <lb/>
            personage: they make cakes also at the sacrifice of the <lb/>
            month Paÿni and of Phaophi, and print upon them for <lb/>
            device an ass tied. And at the sacrifice to the Sun, they <lb/>
            enjoin those that worship this god, not to wear upon the <lb/>
            person ornaments of gold,2 nor to give food to an ass. The <lb/>
            Pythagoreans, too, prove that they regard Typhon as a <lb/>
            dæmonic Power, for they say in perfect measure that Ty­ <lb/>
            phon was born on the fifty-sixth; and again that the <note type="footnote"> I “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αδης</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰδο̄υς ὑιὸς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hence the Mohammedan rule of taking off all gold ornaments before <lb/>

            (figure) of the Triangle belongs to Pluto, Bacchus and <lb/>
            Mars ; that of the Tetragon to Rhea, Venus, Ceres, Testa, <lb/>
            and Juno ; that of the Dodecagon to Jove; but that of the <lb/>
            Fifty-six sided figure to Typhon—as Eudoxus hath related.</p>
          <p>XXXI. The Egyptians, believing that Typhon was born <lb/>
            with red hair, dedicate to sacrifice the red coloured oxen, <lb/>
            and make the scrutiny so close that if the beast should <lb/>
            have even a single black or white hair, they consider it <lb/>
            unfit for sacrifice ; because such beast, offered for sacrifice, <lb/>
            is not acceptable to the gods, but the contrary (as is) what­ <lb/>
            soever has received the souls of unholy and unjust men, <lb/>
            that have migrated into other bodies. For which reason <lb/>
            they heap curses on the head of the victim, cut it off, and <lb/>
            formerly used to throw it into the River, but nowadays <lb/>
            they sell it to foreigners. But the ox intended for sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, those of the priests entitled " Sealers " used to seal : <lb/>
            the signet bearing (as Castor relates) an engraving of a <lb/>
            man forced down on his knees, with hands twisted round <lb/>
            upon his back, having a sword placed against his throaty <lb/>
            The ass has got the credit of this resemblance [to Typhon] <lb/>
            as they think, on account of his stupidity and unruliness, <lb/>
            as well as his colour; for which reason as they detest <lb/>
            Ochus especially of the Persian Kings, as sacrilegious and <lb/>
            polluted, they surnamed him the Ass," and he replying, <lb/>
            “The Ass shall feast upon your Bull," he slaughtered <lb/>
            the Apia, as Dinon tells us. But those who say that <lb/>
            Typhon made his flight out of the battle during seven <lb/>
            days upon an ass ; and after escaping begot Hierosolymus <lb/>
            and Judæus—these are discovered by that very fact to be <lb/>
            lugging the Jewish history into the legend.</p>
          <p>XXXII. These things, then, afford grounds for the ex. <lb/>
            planations above advanced. Let us start afresh, and con­ <lb/>
            sider the most straightforward expositions ; that is to say, <lb/>
            those who are reputed to treat the subject in a more phi- <note type="footnote"> A Showing that the primitive human victim was commuted thus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            losophic manner. These are such as pretend, like the <lb/>
            Greeks, that Saturn symbolizes Time, Juno the Air, the <lb/>
            birth of Vulcan, the change of Air into Fire; and simi. <lb/>
            larly amongst the Egyptians, that Osiris is the Nile, copu­ <lb/>
            lating with Isis the Earth; Typhon, the Sea, into which <lb/>
            the Nile flowing vanishes and is dispersed, except as much <lb/>
            part as the earth has taken from him and received, and <lb/>
            becomes productive thereby. There is, too, a religious <lb/>
            lament made over Saturn, and it laments " him that is <lb/>
            born in the left region, and that dies in the right." For <lb/>
            the Egyptians hold that the Eastern parts are the face of <lb/>
            the World, the Northern its right hand, the Southern its <lb/>
            left. The Nile, therefore, flowing from the North, and in <lb/>
            the South swallowed up by the sea, is as reasonably said <lb/>
            to have his birth in the left hand region, and his death in <lb/>
            the right. On which account the priests abominate the <lb/>
            sea, and call salt " the foam of Typhon,” and it is one of <lb/>
            their prohibitions, " Not to put salt upon the table," and <lb/>
            they do not speak to mariners, nor make use of the sea, <lb/>
            and they keep the ox away from the sea, and from this <lb/>
            cause principally do they reject fish, and write up " Hate <lb/>
            fish." At any rate, at Sais, in the forecourt of the temple <lb/>
            of Minerva, there was sculptured a child, an old man, after <lb/>
            this a hawk, next, a fish, and at the end of all, a river- <lb/>
            horse, and it signifies symbolically, "0 ye that are coming <lb/>
            into life, and ye that are going out of it [The Deity abhors <lb/>
            impudence]1 ... for the reason [they put the] old man . . . <lb/>
            By the hawk they mean God, by the fish, hatred, on account <lb/>
            of the sea, as has been above stated; by the river horse, <lb/>
            impudence, for that beast is reported to kill its sire, and copu­ <lb/>
            lates forcibly with its dam : and the saying of the Pytha­ <lb/>
            goreans that the sea is Saturn's tears, seed, may seem to imply <lb/>
            the impurity and unsociable nature of the same element. <note type="footnote"> 1 Some words are here lost, but their sense appears from the context <lb/>

          <p>XXXIII. Let these stories then be told by foreigners, <lb/>
            since they offer an explanation within everybody's reach ; <lb/>
            but the more learned among the priests do not only call <lb/>
            the Nile, " Osiris," and the sea, “Typhon," but give the <lb/>
            name of Osiris generally to every Principle and Power pro­ <lb/>
            ductive of moisture; regarding this as the cause of gene­ <lb/>
            ration and the essence of seed. " Typhon" they call <lb/>
            everything dry, fiery, dessicative, and antagonistic to mois­ <lb/>
            ture ; for which reason as they believe him to have been <lb/>
            red skinned and yellowish in person, they do not very <lb/>
            willingly meet, or converse with pleasure with people <lb/>
            having such a complexion ; on the other hand they fable <lb/>
            that Osiris was black-coloured because all water blackens <lb/>
            earth, clouds, and garments, when mingled therewith; and <lb/>
            in young people the presence of moisture renders the hair <lb/>
            black, whereas greyness is, as it were, a growing pale, that <lb/>
            by reason of dessication, comes upon them who are past <lb/>
            their prime. The Spring too is flourishing, generative, <lb/>
            and agreeable; but Autumn through the deficiency of <lb/>
            moisture is both injurious to plants, and pestilential to <lb/>
            animals. And the Ox that is kept at Heliopolis, which <lb/>
            they call Mnevis (sacred to Osiris, and which some believe <lb/>
            to be the sire of the Apis) 1 is black, and receives secon­ <lb/>
            dary honours to those paid to Apis. Besides, Egypt which <lb/>
            is of a black soil to the highest degree, as well as the <lb/>
            black part of the eye, they call " Chemia," 2 and compare <lb/>
            it to a heart, for it is hot and moist, and is chiefly inclosed <lb/>
            and annexed to the southern parts of the habitable world, <lb/>
            in the same manner as the heart is in the left hand parts <lb/>
            of man.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. The Sun and the Moon they symbolize as <note type="footnote"> I The Bull that was kept at Memphis. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Is this the long sought for root of " Cameo ? " The Nicolo was dis­ <lb/>

             <pb n="29"/>
            using not chariots but boats for vehicles in performing <lb/>
            their courses, expressing allegorically their nourishment <lb/>
            and origin from moisture: and they think that Homer, <lb/>
            like Thales, had learnt from the Egyptians to lay down <lb/>
            that Water was the beginning and origin of all things, for <lb/>
            that his ocean is Osiris, and his Tethys Isis, as nursing, <lb/>
            and helping to breed up all things. For the Greeks call <lb/>
            the emission of seed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπουσία</foreign>, and copulation <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνουσία</foreign>; and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑιὸς</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὔδωρ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑ̃σαι</foreign>, and Bacchus they entitle " <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυς</foreign>,” <lb/>
            as being lord of the moist principle, he being no other than <lb/>
            Osiris, in fact Hellenicus has put down that he heard Osiris <lb/>
            called Ysiris by the priests; and he persists in so denomi. <lb/>
            nating that god, probably on account of his nature, and his <lb/>
            invention.</p>
          <p>XXXV. That indeed he is the same with Bacchus, who <lb/>
            is more fitted to know than yourself, Clea, you who have <lb/>
            headed the Bacchanals at Delphi, and have been initiated <lb/>
            into the rites of Osiris, ever since your childhood ? But <lb/>
            if for the sake of other people we must produce testimony, <lb/>
            let us put on one side the things not to be revealed; but <lb/>
            the ceremonies the priests perform in public when they are <lb/>
            conveying the body on a raft, at the burial of the Apis, <lb/>
            differ in nothing from the Bacchanalea; for they tie <lb/>
            fawn-skins about them, and carry thyrsi, and make shout­ <lb/>
            ings and motions like those possessed with the divine <lb/>
            frenzy in honour of Bacchus ; for which cause many of the <lb/>
            Greeks represent Dionysos in the form of a Bull in his <lb/>
            images ; and the women of the Eleians when praying, ex­ <lb/>
            hort the " god with the bull's foot," to come to them. The <lb/>
            Argives too have a Bacchus by title the “Bull-born <lb/>
            and they call him up out of water by the sound of trum­ <lb/>
            pets, casting into the deep pool as offerings to the " Pyla­ <lb/>
            ochus." The trumpets they conceal within the thyrsi as <lb/>
            Socrates has described it in his treatise on Rituals. The <lb/>
            Titanic also and Nyctelean rites are of the same kind with <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            the fabled tearing to pieces of the body of Osiris, his re­ <lb/>
            turnings to life, and his new births; and, similarly, the <lb/>
            stories about his burials. For the Egyptians, as already <lb/>
            stated, show Tombs of Osiris in many places; and the <lb/>
            Delphians believe that the relics of Bacchus are deposited <lb/>
            with themselves by the side of the Oracle:1 and their <lb/>
            “Holy Ones " offer a secret sacrifice in the Temple of <lb/>
            Apollo at what time the Bacchantes waken up " Him of <lb/>
            the winnowing fan." And that the Greeks hold Bacchus <lb/>
            for lord and leader not only of the wine but of the whole <lb/>
            element of Moisture, Pindar is sufficient testimony where <lb/>
            he says, " May Bacchus that rejoiceth greatly in trees and <lb/>
            pastures, augment the pure light of Autumn," for which <lb/>
            reason it is forbidden to those that worship Osiris to de­ <lb/>
            stroy any cultivated tree, or to stop up any spring of water.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. For not the Nile only, but all moisture in <lb/>
            general they call the Issue of Osiris," and the water vase <lb/>
            always leads the procession of the priests in honour of the <lb/>
            god, and by the figure of a fig-leaf they represent a king, <lb/>
            and the Southern quarter of the world; and the fig-leaf is <lb/>
            interpreted as the watering and stimulation of all things, <lb/>
            and it is supposed to resemble in its shape the organ of <lb/>
            generation. And when they celebrate (as already stated) <lb/>
            the feast of Pamylia, which is a phallic one, they expose <lb/>
            and carry about an image of which the genital member is <lb/>
            thrice the natural size ; for the god is the Final Cause, and <lb/>
            every Final Cause multiplied by generation a function, that <lb/>
            which proceeds from itself : and for " often " we are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to say " thrice," for example " thrice-happy," and---­ <lb/>
            “Three times as many chains, without an end." <lb/>
            Unless perhaps, this triplication of the member was under­ <lb/>
            stood by the ancients in its strict sense; inasmuch as the <note type="footnote"> I Another proof of Indian origin, relics of a Buddha being indis <lb/>
            'pensable for the foundation of any dagobah. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            moist Principle being the Final Cause and origin of all <lb/>
            things, has produced from the beginning the three first <lb/>
            elements, Earth, Air, Fire. For the tale that is tacked on <lb/>
            to the myth, how that Typhon threw away the genital <lb/>
            member of Osiris into the River, and that Isis could not <lb/>
            find it, but deposited and prepared a model of the same, <lb/>
            ordaining that people should honour it and carry the <lb/>
            phallus about-all this permits us to infer that the gene­ <lb/>
            rative and seminal power of the god had first for materials <lb/>
            moisture, and by means of moisture was mixed up with the <lb/>
            things fitted by Nature to participate in birth. There is <lb/>
            another legend of the Egyptians that Apopis, being brother <lb/>
            of the Sun, made war upon Jupiter, and that Jupiter <lb/>
            adopted for son Osiris who had assisted him, and had <lb/>
            brought the war to an end along with him, and surnamed <lb/>
            him Bacchus. Of this legend the fabulous character can <lb/>
            be shown to contain a touch of truth as regards natural <lb/>
            history. For the Egyptians give the name of Jupiter to <lb/>
            the breath,l to which everything dry and fiery is antago­ <lb/>
            nistic. This latter element is not the Sun, but has a <lb/>
            certain affinity to the Sun; now moisture quenching the <lb/>
            excess of dryness, augments and strengthens the exhala. <lb/>
            tions by means of which the wind is nourished and made <lb/>
            rigorous.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. And, moreover, the Greeks consecrate the <lb/>
            ivy to Bacchus, and amongst the Egyptians it is called <lb/>
            " Kenosiris," the name signifying (as they say) the "plant <lb/>
            of Osiris ”—Ariston, therefore, who wrote the " Colonies <lb/>
            of the Athenians," met with an epistle of Alexarchus (a <lb/>
            writer without any knowledge of the subject) in which it <lb/>
            is related that Bacchus, being son of Isis, was not called <lb/>
            “Osiris" by the Egyptians, but " Arsaphes " (in his First <lb/>
            Book), this name signifying manliness. Hermæus, too, <lb/>
            declares the same thing in his First Book " Upon the <note type="footnote"> I Or wind. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            Egyptians," for he says that “Osiris" interpreted is <lb/>
            " weighty." I pass by Mnaseas who identifies with Epa­ <lb/>
            phus both Bacchus, Osiris, and Serapis ; I also pass over <lb/>
            Anticlidas who, says that Isis was daughter of Prometheus, <lb/>
            and consort of Bacchus—for the above-stated peculiarities <lb/>
            in the sacrifices and ceremonies carry with them proof <lb/>
            more convincing than any testimony.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Of the stars, they hold Sirius to be Isis' <lb/>
            Water-carrier, they honour the Lion, and decorate the <lb/>
            gateways of temples with gaping lions' heads, because the <lb/>
            Nile swells :­ <lb/>
            " When first the Sun doth with the Lion join." <lb/>
            And as they hold and believe the Nile the issue of Osiris, <lb/>
            so do they regard the earth as the body of Isis: not <lb/>
            indeed the whole earth but just as much as the Nile <lb/>
            inundates, fecundating and mingling with it; for from <lb/>
            the union they beget Horus. Horus is that which pre­ <lb/>
            serves and nourishes all thing, namely the Seasons and <lb/>
            the regulator of the circumambient air ; and they tell that <lb/>
            he was nursed by Leto in the marshes round Buto, <lb/>
            because the watery and thoroughly soaked earth chiefly <lb/>
            nurses the exhalations that quench and relax the dryness <lb/>
            and drought of the air. " Nephthys” they call the <lb/>
            remotest parts and boundaries of the land, and those <lb/>
            contiguous to the sea; for which reason they style <lb/>
            Nephthys the " end," and say that she is the consort of <lb/>
            Typhon. And when the Nile rising beyond the usual <lb/>
            height, and growing great, approaches on the opposite <lb/>
            side towards the extremities of the country, they call this <lb/>
            the copulation of Osiris with Nephthys, which is betrayed <lb/>
            by the springing up of plants; amongst which is the <lb/>
            melilote, by which flowers having fallen off and been left <lb/>
            behind (by Osiris) Typhon made the discovery of the <lb/>
            injury done to his bed: from which same copulation <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            Isis indeed conceived Horns legitimately, but Nephthys <lb/>
            had Anubis, a bastard. However, in the " Successions of <lb/>
            the Kings " they record that Nephthys, being married to <lb/>
            Typhon, was at first barren, and if they tell this not of a <lb/>
            woman, but of a goddess, they express enigmatically that <lb/>
            the entire extent of the country was unproductive, and <lb/>
            bore no crops from barrenness.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. The conspiracy and tyranny of Typhon means <lb/>
            the power of drought getting the better of, and destroying <lb/>
            the moisture that both generates and augments the Nile : <lb/>
            and his helper, the Queen of the Ethiopians, signifies the <lb/>
            south winds from Ethiopia; for when these prevail over <lb/>
            the Etesian winds (which drive the clouds towards <lb/>
            Ethiopia), and hinder them from dissolving into rains <lb/>
            and swelling the Nile, then does Typhon take possession <lb/>
            and burn; and at that time he has completely mastered <lb/>
            the Nile, which through weakness is contracted and <lb/>
            shrunk up within itself; and drives it out, hollow and <lb/>
            humble, into the sea: for the shutting up of Osiris in the <lb/>
            coffer probably means nothing else than the concealment <lb/>
            and disappearance of the water: for which reason they say <lb/>
            that Osiris vanished in the month Athyr, at which time, <lb/>
            the Etesian winds having entirely ceased, the Nile recedes, <lb/>
            and the country is laid bare, and night lengthening, dark­ <lb/>
            ness is increased, and the power of light wastes away and <lb/>
            is subdued, and the priests also perform other dismal rites, <lb/>
            and cover a gilt ox with a black veil of linen ; and so ex­ <lb/>
            hibit it in mourning for the goddess (for they consider <lb/>
            the ox as the animated image of Osiris) for four con­ <lb/>
            secutive days, beginning with the seventeenth. For the <lb/>
            things mourned for are four in number: first, the Nile <lb/>
            failing and shrinking; secondly, the Northerly breezes <lb/>
            entirely extinguished through the Southerly getting the <lb/>
            upper hand; thirdly, the day growing shorter than the <lb/>
            night; and in addition to all this, the exposure of the <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            land, coupled with the stripping of the trees, which <lb/>
            cast their leaves at that very time. But on the nineteenth <lb/>
            at night they go down to the sea, and the " Dressers " and <lb/>
            priests bring out the sacred coffer containing a little <lb/>
            golden ark, into which they take and pour water from the <lb/>
            river, and a shout is raised by the assistants, as though <lb/>
            Osiris had been found: next, they knead garden earth <lb/>
            with this water, and mingling therewith frankincense and <lb/>
            precious spices, they model a little image in the shape of <lb/>
            the Moon, and this they robe and decorate, expressing <lb/>
            thereby that they hold these deities to be the Principles of <lb/>
            Earth and Water.</p>
          <p>XL. But when Isis has recovered Osiris, and is making <lb/>
            Horus grow, strengthened by means of exhalations clouds <lb/>
            and mists, Typhon has been conquered indeed, but not <lb/>
            destroyed, because the goddess of the Earth hath not <lb/>
            suffered the Principle opposed to moisture to be entirely <lb/>
            exterminated, but she lowered and slackened the same, <lb/>
            wishing that the mixture might still continue: inasmuch <lb/>
            as it was not possible for the world to be complete if the <lb/>
            fiery principle failed and were exterminated, and if all this <lb/>
            is not told in so many words, yet one may not reasonably <lb/>
            regret the story that Typhon of old conquered the party <lb/>
            of Osiris. For Egypt was once sea ; for which cau3e many <lb/>
            places in the mines and in the mountains are found to <lb/>
            contain shells to the present day; and all springs, and <lb/>
            wells, whereof there are many, have their water brackish <lb/>
            and bitter; as though being a stale remnant of the former <lb/>
            sea which had collected there. But in time, Osiris got <lb/>
            the better of Typhon; that is a good season of rains <lb/>
            having come on the Nile drove off the sea, and brought to <lb/>
            light the flat ground, and filled up the same with its <lb/>
            alluvial deposits : a thing that has for it the testimony of <lb/>
            our senses : for we see even now that through the River's <lb/>
            perpetually bringing down fresh mud, and adding on the <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            land, the deep water gradually recedes, and the sea runs <lb/>
            back, in consequence of the bottom rising up through the <lb/>
            alluvial deposit: and the Pharos which Homer knew as <lb/>
            distant a, day's sail from Egypt, is now a part thereof : <lb/>
            not that the island itself has grown larger, or come <lb/>
            nearer, but because the sea has retreated through the <lb/>
            river's forming and making the mainland to grow. This <lb/>
            however is of the same kind with the theological theories <lb/>
            of the Stoics, for they too say that the generative and <lb/>
            nutritive spirit is Bacchus; the impulsive and separative, <lb/>
            Hercules ; the receptive, Ammon ; Ceres and Proserpine, <lb/>
            that which pervades the earth and her fruits; and Nep­ <lb/>
            tune that pervading the sea.</p>
          <p>XLI. But such as mix with these physical doctrines <lb/>
            others derived from astrology and the mathematics, think <lb/>
            that Typhon signifies the solar world, and Osiris the <lb/>
            Lunar : for that the moon having her light of a fertilising <lb/>
            and more watery nature is favourable to the breeding of <lb/>
            animals and the growing of plants: but that the sun is <lb/>
            ordained with his unmitigated light to heat and parch up <lb/>
            things that grow up and flourish, and to render the great <lb/>
            part of the earth utterly uninhabitable through his <lb/>
            blazing, and also to get the better of the Moon herself. <lb/>
            For which reason the Egyptians always call Typhon <lb/>
            " Seth," 1 which signifies that which tyrannises, and which <lb/>
            forcibly constrains, and they fable that Hercules resides in <lb/>
            the Sun, and travels about with him, but Hermes does <lb/>
            the same with the Moon; for the effects of the Moon <lb/>
            resemble the actions of reason, and those dictated by <lb/>
            wisdom; whereas those of the Sun are like strokes <lb/>
            brought to pass through violence and force, and the <lb/>
            Stoics say that the Sun is set on fire, and derives his <lb/>
            nutriment from the sea, whereas to the Moon the foun- <note type="footnote"> I This has no connection with the Hebrew name, which means <lb/>
            " Placed,” “Settled." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            tain and lacustrine waters send up a sweet and gentle <lb/>
            exhalation.</p>
          <p>XLII. On the seventeenth day of the month took place, <lb/>
            as the Egyptians fable, the death of Osiris, on which day <lb/>
            the full Moon being completed becomes most conspicuous: <lb/>
            on which account the Pythagoreans call that day " Anti­ <lb/>
            phraxis," (precaution) ; and generally abominate that par­ <lb/>
            ticular number, for sixteen being a square number and <lb/>
            eighteen having sides of unequal length which alone of the <lb/>
            integral numbers have the peculiarity of possessing ex­ <lb/>
            ternal measurements equal to the areas contained by them,l <lb/>
            the seventeen intruding hedges off and disjoins them from <lb/>
            one another, and distracts the proportion of one to eight, <lb/>
            because it is itself cut up into unequal parts. The number <lb/>
            of years that some say Osiris lived, others that be reigned, <lb/>
            was eight-and-twenty: for just so many are the lights of the <lb/>
            moon,, and for so many days doth she revolve about her circle. <lb/>
            By the wood they cut down at the so-called burials of <lb/>
            Osiris, and construct therewith a crescent-shaped coffer, <lb/>
            they signify that the Moon when she approaches the Sun, <lb/>
            becomes crescent-shaped and hides herself: and the tearing <lb/>
            up of Osiris into fourteen parts they interpret of the days <lb/>
            during which the luminary wanes after full moon, until the <lb/>
            new moon, and the day when she first appears after escaping <lb/>
            the brightness of, and passing by the Sun, they style " Im­ <lb/>
            perfect Good " ; for Osiris is a doer of good, and his name <lb/>
            signifies many things, but especially, as they say, " the <lb/>
            power that is active and beneficial" ; and the other name <lb/>
            of Osiris, namely, " Ompis" means, according to Her­ <lb/>
            maeus, by interpretation " Benefactor." <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτερομήκης</foreign> is applied to Eighteen, because it may be represented by a <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XLIII. For they are of opinion that to the lights of <lb/>
            the Moon the risings of the Nile bear a certain analogy: <lb/>
            for the greatest rising, that about Elephantine, is of <lb/>
            eight-and-twenty cubits, the same in number as the lights <lb/>
            and measures of her monthly revolutions, the lowest, <lb/>
            around Mendes and Xois, is of six cubits, analogous to <lb/>
            her half-quartering; and the mean, that round Memphis, <lb/>
            when it is of the regular height, is fourteen cubits, cor­ <lb/>
            responding to the full moon. Apis, they say, is the ani. <lb/>
            mated image of Osiris, and he is conceived when a gene­ <lb/>
            rative light falls strongly from the Moon, and touches a <lb/>
            cow that is in heat; for which cause many of the decora­ <lb/>
            tions of Apis resemble the appearances of the Moon; for <lb/>
            he blackens over his shining parts with dusky robes, <lb/>
            because it is on the new moon of the month Phamenath <lb/>
            that they hold the festival, called by them " the Entrance <lb/>
            of Osiris into the Moon ”; being the commencement of <lb/>
            spring. Thus they place the power of Osiris within the <lb/>
            Moon, and say that Isis, being cause of his birth is also <lb/>
            his consort. On this account they call the Moon the <lb/>
            Mother of Saturn, and hold that she is of hermaphrodite <lb/>
            nature, for she is filled and impregnated by the Sun, and <lb/>
            again she emits and disseminates in the air generative <lb/>
            principles: for that she doth not always express the <lb/>
            mischief wrought by Typhon ; but being after conquered <lb/>
            by the birth, and bound thereby, she nevertheless emerges <lb/>
            again and fights her way through to Horus: this latter is <lb/>
            the universe surrounding the earth, which is not entirely <lb/>
            exempt either from generation or destruction.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Some make an allegory out of the rule of the <lb/>
            eclipses, for the Moon is eclipsed at her full, when the Sun <lb/>
            holds the station opposite to her when she falls into the <lb/>
            shadow of the earth, in the same way as they tell Osiris <lb/>
            did into the coffer; and she herself, upon the thirtieth <lb/>
            conceals and puts out of sight, yet does not altogether de­ <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            stroy, the Sun, as neither did Isis Typhon. And when <lb/>
            Nephthys conceives Anubis, Isis adopts him, for Nephthys <lb/>
            signifies what is under the earth and invisible ; Isis, what <lb/>
            is above ground and visible; and the circle touching these, <lb/>
            called the Horizon, and common to both, has been named <lb/>
            Anubis, and is figured as a dog; for the dog has the use of <lb/>
            his sight both by night and by day ; and Anubis appears to <lb/>
            have the same office with the Egyptians that Hermes has <lb/>
            with the Greeks, being both infernal and celestial. Some, <lb/>
            however, think that Anubis signifies Time, wherefore as he <lb/>
            brings forth all things out of himself, and conceives all <lb/>
            things within himself, he gets the title of Dog. Besides, <lb/>
            the votaries of Anubis celebrate a certain mystery,1 and <lb/>
            in old times the dog enjoyed the highest honours in <lb/>
            Egypt. But when Cambyses had slain the apis and cast <lb/>
            him out, nothing approached, or tasted of the carcase, <lb/>
            except the dog, so he lost his place of the first, and the <lb/>
            most honoured of all the other animals. And there are <lb/>
            some that think he is the shadow of the earth into which <lb/>
            the Moon passes when she is eclipsed, and they call him <lb/>
            Typhon.</p>
          <p>XLV. From all which, it is not unreasonable to con­ <lb/>
            elude that no one singly says what is right, and that all <lb/>
            collectively do so ; for it is neither drought, nor wind, nor <lb/>
            the sea, nor darkness, but generally every hurtful and mis­ <lb/>
            chievous part that earth contains, which belongs to Typhon. <lb/>
            For we must not place the principles of the all in lifeless <lb/>
            bodies, as do Democritus and Epicurus: nor yet assume <lb/>
            as modeller of uncreated matter, one Reason and one Pro­ <lb/>
            vidence, like the Stoics, that prevails over and subdues all <lb/>
            things: for it is impossible that anything at all, whether <lb/>
            bad or good, should exist, where God is cause of nothing. <lb/>
            For the harmony of the universe is reciprocal, like that <note type="footnote"> I A passage is lost here, containing a description of this rite, in which <lb/>
            it is evident a dog played the principal part. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            of a lyre or bow, according to Heraclitus, and according to <lb/>
            Euripides:— <lb/>
            " Evil and good cannot occur apart; <lb/>
            There is a mixture to make all go well." <lb/>
            Consequently this is a most ancient notion, that comes <lb/>
            down from theologians and lawgivers to poets and philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, which has its origin unattributed, but the belief <lb/>
            therein strong and not to be effaced, not consisting in <lb/>
            words and reports, but in ceremonies and sacrifices, of <lb/>
            Barbarians and Greeks alike, and diffused in many places, <lb/>
            that neither is the Universe without mind, without reason, <lb/>
            and without guidance, and tossed about at random, nor yet <lb/>
            is there One Reason that rules and directs all things as it <lb/>
            were, by a rudder and by guiding reins,1 but that there are <lb/>
            many such directors, and made up out of good and bad; <lb/>
            or rather, to speak generally, inasmuch as Nature produces <lb/>
            nothing unmixed here below, it is not one Dispenser that <lb/>
            like a retail dealer mixes together things for us out of two <lb/>
            vessels and distributes the same,2 but it is from two oppo­ <lb/>
            site Principles and two antagonistic Powers; the one guiding <lb/>
            us to the right hand and along the straight road, the other <lb/>
            upsetting and rebuffing us, that Life becomes of a mixed <lb/>
            nature; and also the Universe (if not the whole, yet that <lb/>
            which surrounds Earth, and lies below the Moon), is made <lb/>
            inconsistent with itself, and variable and susceptible of <lb/>
            frequent changes. For if nothing can happen without <lb/>
            cause, and good cannot furnish cause for evil, it follows <lb/>
            that the nature of Evil, as of Good, must have an origin <lb/>
            and principle of its own.</p>
          <p>XLVI. And this is the opinion of most men, and those <note type="footnote"> 1 The Epicurean and Stoic theories of the government of the universe, <lb/>
            as opposed to the Neo-Platonic. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Alluding to the Homeric picture of Jove, and his two vases of good <lb/>
            and evil. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            the wisest, for they believe, some that there axe Two Gods, <lb/>
            as it were of opposite trades-one the creator of good, the <lb/>
            other of bad things; others call the better one “ God," <lb/>
            the other " Daemon," as did Zoroaster the Magian, who, <lb/>
            they record, lived 5,000 years before the Trojan War. He <lb/>
            therefore calls the former " Oromazes," the latter “ Ari­ <lb/>
            manios ;” and furthermore explains that of all the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of sense, the one most resembles Light, the other <lb/>
            Darkness, and Ignorance; and that Mithras is between the <lb/>
            two, for which reason the Persians call Mithras the " Me­ <lb/>
            diator," and he [Zoroaster] taught them to offer sacrifice <lb/>
            of vows and thanksgiving to the one, of deprecation and <lb/>
            mourning to the other. For they bruise a certain herb <lb/>
            called " omoine " in a mortar and invoke Hades and Dark­ <lb/>
            ness, and mixing it with the blood of a wolf they have <lb/>
            sacrificed, they carry away and throw it into a place where <lb/>
            the Sun never comes, for of plants they believe some to be­ <lb/>
            long to the good God, others to the evil Dæmon; and <lb/>
            similarly of animals, dogs, birds, and land hedgehogs be­ <lb/>
            long to the Good, but to the Bad One water rats, for which <lb/>
            reason they hold happy men that have killed the greatest <lb/>
            number of such things.</p>
          <p>XLVII. They too, nevertheless, tell many fabulous <lb/>
            stories concerning their gods-for example, the following: <lb/>
            that Oromazes sprang out of the purest Light, but Arimanios <lb/>
            out of Darkness; they wage war upon each other. Oro­ <lb/>
            mazes created six gods, the first of Goodwill, the second of <lb/>
            Truth, the third of Order, of the rest one of Wisdom, one <lb/>
            of Wealth, one of Pleasure in things beautiful.1 The <lb/>
            other God created, as it were, opponents to these deities,, <lb/>
            equal in number. Then Oromazes, having augmented <lb/>
            himself threefold, severed from the Sun as much space as <lb/>
            the Sun is distant from Earth, and adorned the heavens <lb/>
            with stars; and one star he appointed before all for guard <note type="footnote"> I The same notion is expressed in the Jewish Sephiroth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            and look out, namely Sinus. And having created four­ <lb/>
            and-twenty other gods, he shut them up in an egg ; but <lb/>
            those made by Arimanios, being as many as they, pierced <lb/>
            the egg that had been laid, and so the bad things were <lb/>
            mixed up with the good. But a time appointed by fate <lb/>
            is coming, in which Arimanios having brought on famine <lb/>
            and pestilence must needs be destroyed by the same and <lb/>
            utterly vanish ; when the earth becoming plain and level <lb/>
            there shall be one life and one government of men, all <lb/>
            happy and of one language. Theopompus says that, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the Magi, one of the Gods shall conquer, the <lb/>
            other be conquered, alternately for 3,000 years; for another <lb/>
            3,000 years they shall fight, war, and undo one the works <lb/>
            of the other; but in the end Hades shall fail, and meu <lb/>
            shall be happy, neither requiring food nor constructing <lb/>
            shelter: whilst the God who hath contrived all this is <lb/>
            quiet and resting himself for a time, for that God may <lb/>
            well slumber, but not long, like as a man reposing for a <lb/>
            moderate space. The religious system of the Magi is of <lb/>
            the aforesaid character.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. The Chaldeans hold that the gods belong to <lb/>
            the planets, of whom two they call “ doers of good," two <lb/>
            it makers of evil;" the other three they describe as inter­ <lb/>
            mediate and neutral. But the notions of the Greeks are, <lb/>
            I suppose, plain enough to every one, for they make the <lb/>
            good part that of the Olympian Jove, that of the hostile <lb/>
            deity they give to Hades; and they fable that Harmony <lb/>
            was the child of Venus and Mars, of whom the one is cruel <lb/>
            and quarrelsome, the other gentle, and presiding over birth: <lb/>
            Consider too the philosophers that side with them, for <lb/>
            Heraclitus directly calls Mars, father, lord, and ruler of <lb/>
            all things; and says that Homer, when he prays that <lb/>
            " Perish Contention, both from gods and men," <lb/>
            forgets that he is cursing the origin of all things, inas­ <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            much as they derive their origin from contention and <lb/>
            antipathy, and the Sun will not overpass his appointed <lb/>
            limits, otherwise: <lb/>
            " The avenging tongue of Law would find him out," <lb/>
            and Empedocles calls the Beneficent Principle " Love” <lb/>
            and " Friendship,” and frequently too, Harmony, " with <lb/>
            glowing face," but the Evil Principle he styles <lb/>
            " Contentiousness accurst, and blood-stained War." <lb/>
            Now the Pythagoreans characterize these Principles by <lb/>
            several names: the Good One, as the " One," the " Defi­ <lb/>
            nite," the " Abiding," the " Straight," the " Exceeding," <lb/>
            the " Square," the " Equal," the " Right-handed," the <lb/>
            “ Bright;” the Bad One as the “Two,” the “Indefinite,” <lb/>
            the " Unstable," the " Crooked," the " Sufficient," the <lb/>
            "Unequally-sided" (parallelogram), the "Unequal," the <lb/>
            " Left-handed," the " Dark "-inasmuch as these are sup­ <lb/>
            posed the final causes of existence—Anaxagoras defines <lb/>
            them as "Mind," and the " Infinite;" Aristotle, the one <lb/>
            as " Form," the other as " Deprival." Plato, as it were <lb/>
            mystifying and veiling the matter, denominates in many <lb/>
            places one of the opposing Principles as " The Same;" <lb/>
            the second, as " The Other;" but in his " Laws," being <lb/>
            now grown older, he no longer speaks in riddles and sym­ <lb/>
            bolically, but names them directly. " Not by one soul," <lb/>
            says he, " was the universe set in motion, but by several, <lb/>
            perhaps, at all events, by not less than Two; whereof the <lb/>
            One is beneficent, the other antagonistic to this, and the <lb/>
            creator of opposite effects: and there is room for a Third <lb/>
            Principle to exist, one intermediate between the Two, which <lb/>
            is neither destitute of soul, nor of reason, nor of impulse <lb/>
            from within (as some suppose), but subordinate to those <lb/>
            Two Principles, ever seeking after the Better One, and <lb/>
            desiring and following after it," as the part of the treatise <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            which follows will show, for he adopts into this system <lb/>
            chiefly the religious notions of the Egyptians.</p>
          <p>XLIX. For the origin and constitution of this world are <lb/>
            mixed, being formed out of opposite principles-not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, of equal force with each other, but the superiority <lb/>
            belonging to the Better One. But it is impossible that the <lb/>
            Bad One should be entirely destroyed, as it is largely im­ <lb/>
            planted in the body, largely in the soul of the all, and <lb/>
            always contending against the Better One. Now in the <lb/>
            soul, Mind, and Reason, the best masters and guides, are <lb/>
            Osiris; but in Earth and Water, Winds and Stars, that <lb/>
            which is ordered, permanent, and healthy, in seasons, tem­ <lb/>
            perament, and revolutions, are the issue of Osiris, and the <lb/>
            image of him made visible. But Typhon is the part of the <lb/>
            soul that is subject to the passions, Titan-like, unreason. <lb/>
            able, and impulsive ; but of the body (he is) the part that is <lb/>
            unsound, subject to disease, and liable to disturbance by bad <lb/>
            seasons and inclement weather, by the concealments of the <lb/>
            Sun, and the disappearances of the Moon-such as devia­ <lb/>
            tions from its course, vanishings, and whirlwinds. And <lb/>
            the name " Seth," by which they call Typhon, proves this; <lb/>
            for it signifies " That which tyrannizes and constrains by <lb/>
            force," it likewise signifies a " return," and again an <lb/>
            “ overleaping." Bebaeon, again, some say, was one of the <lb/>
            companions of Typhon, whilst Manethos asserts that Ty­ <lb/>
            phon was called " Bebon," and that the name signifies a <lb/>
            "holding back," and “ hindrance,”— implying that the <lb/>
            power of Typhon stands in the way of things going on re­ <lb/>
            gularly and towards their proper end.</p>
          <p>L. For which reason, they give him for attribute the <lb/>
            most stupid of all tame animals, namely, the ass; and of <lb/>
            the wild, the most savage, namely, the crocodile and the <lb/>
            hippopotamus. With respect to the ass we have already <lb/>
            explained the meaning, but at Hermopolis they show as a <lb/>
            figure of Typhon a hippopotamus, upon which stands a <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            hawk fighting with a serpent; by the hippopotamus signi­ <lb/>
            fying Typhon, by the hawk power and virtue, [ or sovereignty,] <lb/>
            which Typhon frequently gains by force, and never ceases1 <lb/>
            to be disturbed by his own wickedness, and to disturb <lb/>
            others ; for which cause when they sacrifice on the 7th of <lb/>
            the month Sybi (which they call " The Coming of Isis out <lb/>
            of Phœnicia”) they stamp upon the consecrated cakes the <lb/>
            figure of a hippopotamus bound. In the city Apollinopolis, <lb/>
            it is the custom that every one must by all means eat a <lb/>
            bit of crocodile [once a year]. And on one day they catch <lb/>
            and kill as many crocodiles as they can, and lay them out <lb/>
            in front of the temple, saying that Typhon ran away from <lb/>
            Horus changing himself into a crocodile,-thus making <lb/>
            out all animals, plants, and feelings, that are noxious <lb/>
            and bad, to be the productive parts and instigations of <lb/>
            Typhon.</p>
          <p>LI. Osiris, on the contrary, they represent by an eye and <lb/>
            a sceptre, whereof the one signifies foresight, the other <lb/>
            power; in the same way as Homer by calling Jupiter, who <lb/>
            governs and reigns over all, by the titles “ Supreme ” and <lb/>
            “ Knowing," probably indicates by the “ Supreme ” his <lb/>
            power, by the" Knowing" his good counsel and intelligence. <lb/>
            They frequently represent this god by the figure of a hawk, <lb/>
            for that bird excels all in acuteness of sight and swiftness <lb/>
            of flying; and by nature digests its food most rapidly of <lb/>
            all. The bird is also said, when corpses are lying about <lb/>
            unburied, to hover over them, and drop earth upon their <lb/>
            eyes. And when in order to drink it descends upon the <lb/>
            river, it sets its wings upright, and having drank bends them <lb/>
            back again ; by which it is evident that it protects itself, <lb/>
            and escapes from the crocodile, for if it should be swal­ <lb/>
            lowed up, the wing remains as it stood, fixed upright.2 In <lb/>
            many places also, they exhibit a statue of Osiris in the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνια̃ται</foreign> in text, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνίετα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the crocodile'is gullet, and so prevents his gulping down the bird. </note> <lb/>

            human shape, erecting the genitals, on account of his ge­ <lb/>
            nerative and nutritive character, whilst the flame-coloured <lb/>
            robe investing his images, is [put] because they regard the <lb/>
            Sun as the body of the Good Principle, the visible form of <lb/>
            the Intelligible Being. Hence we ought to pay no attention <lb/>
            to such as assign to Typhon the sphere of the Sun—he <lb/>
            that has nothing bright, nor salutary, neither order, nor <lb/>
            power of generating, nor motion regulated by measure and <lb/>
            reason; but all the opposite qualities belong to him. For <lb/>
            drought which destroys many things, both of animals and <lb/>
            vegetables, must not be put down as the effect of the Sun, <lb/>
            but of the winds and waters in earth and air not being <lb/>
            seasonably mingled together, when the Principle of dis­ <lb/>
            orderly and unregulated force has got loose and has ex­ <lb/>
            tinguished the exhalations.</p>
          <p>LII. In the sacred hymns to Osiris they invoke " Him <lb/>
            that is carried within the arms of the Sun," and on the <lb/>
            30th day of the month Emphi they celebrate " the Birth­ <lb/>
            day of the Eyes of Horus," when the Sun and the Moon are <lb/>
            come into one straight line, inasmuch as they consider not <lb/>
            the Moon alone, but the Sun also as the eye and the light <lb/>
            of Horus. And on the 8th day from the end of the month <lb/>
            Phaophi they celebrate that of " The Sun's walking-stick," <lb/>
            after the autumnal equinox, signifying that he requires as <lb/>
            it were a support, and strengthening, as he grows weak <lb/>
            both in heat and light, and moves away from us, bending <lb/>
            down, and crooked. And again upon the eve of the winter <lb/>
            solstice they carry the Cow seven times around the temple; <lb/>
            and this circular procession is named the " Seeking for <lb/>
            Osiris," as though the goddess were longing for the <lb/>
            winter rays from the Sun; and they walk round so many <lb/>
            times, because be completes his journey from the winter <lb/>
            solstice to the summer solstice in the seventh month. And <lb/>
            on the 4th day from the beginning of the month it is said <lb/>
            that Horus, son of Isis, was the first that offered sacrifice, <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            as it is written in what are entitled " The Birthdays of <lb/>
            Horus," and in fact they on each day burn incense to the <lb/>
            Sun of three different sorts, namely, resin at his rising, <lb/>
            myrrh at noontide, that which is called " kyphi," at his <lb/>
            setting, of which the signification that each bears I will <lb/>
            explain further on; and by means of all these they be­ <lb/>
            lieve they propitiate and worship the Sun. And what <lb/>
            need is there to bring together many things to the same <lb/>
            effect? There are some that assert point-blank that Osiris <lb/>
            is the Sun, and is named Sirius by the Greeks (for amongst <lb/>
            the Egyptians the prefixing of the article has caused the <lb/>
            name to be mistaken 1), and make out Isis to be no other <lb/>
            than the Moon; and one particular of her images, those <lb/>
            figured with horns, are (say they) imitations of the cres­ <lb/>
            cent ; whilst by those covered with black they interpret <lb/>
            her wanings, and envelopment in darkness, during which <lb/>
            she longs fer, and follows after the Sun : for which reason <lb/>
            they invoke the Moon for aid in love affairs; and Isis, says <lb/>
            Eudoxus, presides over amours. These stories, indeed, <lb/>
            have a certain share of plausibility, but as for those that <lb/>
            make out Typhon to be the Sun, these are not even to be <lb/>
            listened to. Let us, however, now resume our proper <lb/>
            theme.</p>
          <p>LIII. For Isis is the Female Principle of Nature, and <lb/>
            that which is capable of receiving all generation, in virtue <lb/>
            of which she is styled by Plato, " Nurse," and “ All-re­ <lb/>
            ceiving," but by the generality, “ The one of numberless <lb/>
            names ; " because she is converted by the Logos (Reason) <lb/>
            into, and receives, all appearances and forms. But she has, <lb/>
            implanted in her nature, the love for the First and Supreme <lb/>
            of all, the which is identical with the Good, and this she <lb/>
            longs after and continually pursues: whereas the part <lb/>
            that belongs to the Bad One she flees from and repels, <note type="footnote"> I The Greeks mistaking <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄσιρις</foreign> for o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σείοιος</foreign>.“ Egyptians" in text <lb/>
            must be a slip of the scribe. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            though she is the field and material for them both ; of <lb/>
            herself always inclining towards the Better One, and per­ <lb/>
            mitting it to generate and discharge into herself emissions <lb/>
            and likenesses, wherewith she rejoices and is glad to be <lb/>
            impregnated, and to be filled with births—for birth is an <lb/>
            image of existence in Matter, and that which is born is a <lb/>
            copy of that which is.</p>
          <p>LIV. From all this, they do not absurdly to fable that <lb/>
            the soul of Osiris is eternal and incorruptible, but that his <lb/>
            body Typhon did tear to pieces and put out of sight; and <lb/>
            Isis wandered about, sought for it, and joined it together <lb/>
            again ; for that which is, the Intelligible and the Good, is <lb/>
            above all change or corruption, but the Sensible and Cor­ <lb/>
            poreal models certain images after His likeness, and bor­ <lb/>
            rows certain rational principles, forms, and resemblances, <lb/>
            which, like seal-impressions in wax, do not last for ever, <lb/>
            but the disorderly and turbulent Principle, driven down <lb/>
            hither from above, seizes upon them-that Principle which <lb/>
            is at war with the Horus whom Isis bore, who is the Sen­ <lb/>
            sible image of the Intelligible World. For this reason he <lb/>
            (Horus) is related to have had a charge of illegitimacy <lb/>
            brought against him by Typhon, because he is not pure <lb/>
            and without alloy like his father the Word (Reason), (who <lb/>
            exists by himself free from admixture and from passion), <lb/>
            but is bastardized by Matter, on account of his bodily <lb/>
            part. Nevertheless he gains his cause through Hermes, <lb/>
            that is the Word (Reason), bearing witness and proving <lb/>
            how that Nature changing her from after the model of the <lb/>
            Intelligible, produces the World. For the birth of Apollo <lb/>
            that came to pass between Isis and Osiris, whilst the (twin) <lb/>
            gods as yet lay within the womb of Rhea, darkly expresses <lb/>
            that this world first became visible, and that Matter, <lb/>
            being proved to be incomplete in itself, was perfected by <lb/>
            the Word (Reason), and thus produced the first birth. On <lb/>
            which account they tell that this god was lame and lying <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            in darkness, and they name him the “ Elder Horus; " for <lb/>
            the world did not exist, but an image as it were, a spectre <lb/>
            of the world that was to be.</p>
          <p>LV. Now this Horus is well-defined, and complete, he <lb/>
            has not destroyed Typhon utterly, but stripped him of his <lb/>
            activity and strength: for which reason they say the statue <lb/>
            of Horus at Coptos grasps in his one hand the genitals of <lb/>
            Typhon, and they fable that Hermes cut out the sinews of <lb/>
            Typhon, and used them for lyre strings, thereby meaning <lb/>
            that the Word brought the all into harmony, made it <lb/>
            concordant out of discordant parts, and did not destroy its <lb/>
            destructive principle, but merely ham-strung it. Hence, <lb/>
            this principle is weak and inoperative here below, mingling <lb/>
            itself and clinging close to such members as are subject to <lb/>
            corruption and to change, it is the creator of earthquakes <lb/>
            and tremors in the ground, of droughts in the air, and <lb/>
            strange blasts; and, again, of whirlwinds and lightnings, <lb/>
            and it infects waters and winds with pestilences, and <lb/>
            rears up and tosses itself as far as the Moon, oftentimep <lb/>
            checking and darkening her lustre, as the Egyptians be. <lb/>
            lieve. And they tell that Typhon at one time hit Horus ; <lb/>
            at another struck out his eye and swallowed it up, and <lb/>
            then gave it back to the Sun; signifying by blow the <lb/>
            monthly waning of the Moon, by blinding, her eclipse, <lb/>
            which the Sun remedies, when he again reflects himself <lb/>
            upon her, after she has passed through the shadow of the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>LVI. Now the better and more divine Nature is made <lb/>
            up of Three—the Intelligible, Matter, and that formed out <lb/>
            of these two, which the Greeks denominate World. Plato <lb/>
            calls the Intelligible "Idea," "Model," "Father," and <lb/>
            Matter he terms " Mother," " Nurse," the seat and recep­ <lb/>
            tacle of generation; and that which results from both he <lb/>
            is accustomed to denominate " Issue," and " Birth," and <lb/>
            we may conjecture that the Egyptians [reverence] the <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            most beautiful kind of triangle,1 because they liken it to the <lb/>
            nature of the universe, and Plato seems to employ this <lb/>
            figure in his " Republic," when drawing up his Marriage <lb/>
            scheme. The triangle, too, has this property—three the <lb/>
            right angle, and four the base, and five the hypothenuse, <lb/>
            being of equal value with the lines containing it. We <lb/>
            must therefore compare the line forming the right angle to <lb/>
            the male, the base to the female, the hypothenuse to the <lb/>
            child of the two; and the one to be Osiris, as the Final <lb/>
            Cause; the other, Isis as the recipient; the third, Horus <lb/>
            as the result; for as to the Three, the first, it is uneven <lb/>
            and perfect; for the Four, a square with a perfect side, is <lb/>
            the produce of the Two: as for the Five, it partly re­ <lb/>
            sembles the father, partly the mother, being made up of <lb/>
            the three and the two ; also the All derives its name from <lb/>
            the Five (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα,πέντε</foreign>) and to reckon is called " count­ <lb/>
            ing by fives," for the number Five produces when squared <lb/>
            the same number as that of the letters of the Egyptian <lb/>
            alphabet, and also the number of years that Apis lived. <lb/>
            Horus they are accustomed to style " Kaimis," that is <lb/>
            " He that is seen," for the world is an object of sense, <lb/>
            . and visible to the eye; and Isis is sometimes styled <lb/>
            " Mouth," sometimes " Athyri " and " Methyer ;" by the <lb/>
            first of these names they signify " Mother," by the second <lb/>
            " The worldly house of Horus " (in the same way as Plato <lb/>
            has the “ Seat ” and Receptacle of generation"); the <lb/>
            third title is a compound from " full" and " cause," be­ <lb/>
            cause Matter is full of the world; and is made up of that <lb/>
            which is good, pure, and well arranged.</p>
          <p>LVII. Hesiod too may be thought, when he makes the <lb/>
            first elements of Creation to be Chaos, Earth, Tartarus, <lb/>
            Love, to assume no other first Principles than those afore­ <lb/>
            said. Let us therefore distribute his names and assign <lb/>
            them thus: to Isis that of Earth, to Osiris that of Love, <note type="footnote">1 The right-angled. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            to Typhon that of Tartarus, for his Chaos seems to imply <lb/>
            a certain place or basis for the Universe; and the case, some­ <lb/>
            how or other, recalls that fable of Plato's which Socrates has <lb/>
            related in the " Symposean " concerning the birth of Love, <lb/>
            how that Poverty, being desirous of having children, laid <lb/>
            herself down by the side of Wealth as he was asleep, and, <lb/>
            conceiving by him, brought forth Love, who is small and <lb/>
            of every shape, inasmuch as he is the offspring of a father <lb/>
            that is good, wise, and competent for all things, but of a <lb/>
            mother that cannot help herself, destitute, and through <lb/>
            her need is always attaching herself to someone else and <lb/>
            suing to someone else. For his " Wealth " is no other <lb/>
            than the Primal Lover, Projector, Finisher, and All-suffi­ <lb/>
            cient; and by “ Poverty " he means Matter, which is by <lb/>
            itself in need of the Good One, is impregnated by him, <lb/>
            is ever craving and ever receiving, whilst he that springs <lb/>
            from the two (the World, or Horus), is neither eternal, <lb/>
            nor free from passions, nor incorruptible, yet being ever <lb/>
            re-born, contrives by means of the changes and revolutions <lb/>
            of the passions to continue always young and never to be <lb/>
            destroyed.</p>
          <p>LVIII. For we must make use of myths, not entirely <lb/>
            as [real] histories, but taking out of them that which is to <lb/>
            the purpose, and is in the form of a similitude. When, <lb/>
            therefore, we speak of Matter, we must not borrow our <lb/>
            notions from certain philosophers, and think of it as a body <lb/>
            without soul, uncreative, idle, and inactive of itself, for we <lb/>
            call oil the material of perfume, and gold of an ornament, <lb/>
            though they are not devoid of every quality by themselves : <lb/>
            and the soul itself and intellect of man we hand over to <lb/>
            Reason to beautify and to regulate, as being the material <lb/>
            of knowledge and virtue: and the mind some have made <lb/>
            out to be the region of Ideas, and a thing modelled after <lb/>
            the Intelligible world: and some are of opinion that the <lb/>
            seed of generation is not a power nor final cause, but only <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            the material and instrument of generation. These [theorists] <lb/>
            we ought to follow, and conceive this goddess as having <lb/>
            part in the Primal God, and ever joined with him out of <lb/>
            love for the goodness and beauty that surround him, yet <lb/>
            is never satiated; but like as we say that a man who is <lb/>
            obedient to law and what is just, is enamoured of justice, <lb/>
            and a virtuous woman that has a husband and lives with <lb/>
            him, always desires him, so we must conceive this goddess <lb/>
            as always craving after the Good One, though she be ever <lb/>
            in his presence, and is ever being filled with the most <lb/>
            powerful and purest influences.</p>
          <p>LIX. But where Typhon intrudes, laying hold of the <lb/>
            extremities, in this case, where she appears to be of sad <lb/>
            countenance, and is said to mourn and be seeking after <lb/>
            certain scattered members of Osiris, and to robe the same, <lb/>
            [she is] receiving into her lap and concealing the things that <lb/>
            were destroyed, in the same way as she again brings to <lb/>
            light the things that are born, and sends them forth out <lb/>
            of herself. For the things that be in the heavens and the <lb/>
            stars, the reasons, forms, and emissions of the God are un­ <lb/>
            changeable, whereas those disseminated through the things <lb/>
            subject to passion, namely, in earth, sea, vegetables, <lb/>
            animals, are interchangeable, perishable, and buried: and <lb/>
            again afterwards come to light once more, and are made <lb/>
            visible by their births: for which reason the fable tells <lb/>
            that Nephthys was the wife of Typhon, but that Osiris lay <lb/>
            with her by stealth ; because the extreme parts of Matter <lb/>
            (which parts they denominate “Nephthys” and "End") <lb/>
            are chiefly possessed by the destructive Power, whereas <lb/>
            the generative and life-giving Principle distributes amongst <lb/>
            them but a weak and dull seed, and which is destroyed by <lb/>
            Typhon, except what little Isis takes up and saves and <lb/>
            nourishes, and unites together, for on the whole this world <lb/>
            is more good than bad, as Plato suspected, as well as Aristotle.</p>
          <p>LX. For the generative and conservative Principle of <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            Nature is set in motion against him (Typhon) for the PUT­ <lb/>
            pose of Being, whilst the determinating and corrupting <lb/>
            part is moved by him for the purpose of not being. Hence <lb/>
            they name the former Isis, from its being sent out" <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴεσαι</foreign>), and travelling, with knowledge, as being a “ motion <lb/>
            endued with soul," and intelligence, since her Name is not <lb/>
            a foreign word; for just as all gods have a common desig­ <lb/>
            nation derived from " Visible " and " Running " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεοὶ</foreign> from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεατὸς</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέειν</foreign>), so this goddess do we call Isis, and the <lb/>
            Egyptians also Isis, from the word signifying " know­ <lb/>
            ledge " and " Motion " at the same time. And thus Plato <lb/>
            says that the ancients signified " Holy One " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁσία</foreign>) by <lb/>
            calling her " Isia," and similarly " Intelligence" and <lb/>
            " Perception," as being a current and movement impulse of <lb/>
            the mind that longs for an object and is carried onwards; <lb/>
            and that they placed understanding (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">συίεναι</foreign>)and, <lb/>
            generally, goodness and virtue in the things that flow and <lb/>
            that run; as on the other hand that thing is reviled by <lb/>
            the opposite names, the which, according to its nature, is <lb/>
            an impediment, binds down, holds back, and hinders from <lb/>
            rushing after and going, for we denominate it " badness," <lb/>
            " inability," "cowardice," " pain."</p>
          <p>LXI. Now " Osiris ”has got his name compounded out <lb/>
            of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵσος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίερὸς</foreign>: for he is the common Word <lb/>
            (Reason) of the things in heaven, and of those in hell, of <lb/>
            which the former the ancients were wont to term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱε</foreign>p'a, the <lb/>
            latter <foreign xml:lang="grc">δσια</foreign>.And he that reveals the things of heaven, the <lb/>
            WORD of those that move above, is named "Anubis," <lb/>
            sometimes " Hermanubis,” 1 the former as belonging to <lb/>
            those above, the latter as belonging to those below; for <lb/>
            which reason people sacrifice to the one a white cock, to <lb/>
            the other a saffron-coloured 2 one; for they believe the <note type="footnote"> I The deity, so frequent on Gnostic talismans, bearing the caduceus of <lb/>
            Hermes, and accompanied with the Cock. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To typny infernal flames. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            former character of the god to be unmixed and public, the <lb/>
            latter composite and multifarious. You must not be sur­ <lb/>
            prised at this derivation of names from the Greek, for <lb/>
            there are an infinite number of other words that went into <lb/>
            exile along with those that emigrated1 from Greece, but <lb/>
            remain in use and sojourn as foreigners amongst other <lb/>
            nations; for adopting some of which certain people cen­ <lb/>
            sure poetry as talking barbarously; those writers, [critics] <lb/>
            I mean, who term things of the kind " dialects " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γλώσσι</foreign>). <lb/>
            And in what are named “ the Books of Hermes," they <lb/>
            relate that it is written concerning the Sacred Names, that <lb/>
            the Power appointed to preside over the circuit of the <lb/>
            Sun, Horus, the Greeks call Apollo ; and that which pre­ <lb/>
            sides over the Wind some call Osiris, some Sarapis, others <lb/>
            Sothi, in the Egyptian language. The last word signifies <lb/>
            “ pregnancy," and " to conceive hence, through a cor­ <lb/>
            ruption of the word, the star is called the Dog2 in Greek, <lb/>
            which they consider an attribute of Isis. But we ought <lb/>
            by no means to dispute about names, not but that we <lb/>
            might have reclaimed from the Egyptians their name of <lb/>
            “ Sarapis " rather than that of Osiris, the former being a <lb/>
            foreign and the latter a Greek word; but we hold them <lb/>
            both as belonging to one God and to one Power.</p>
          <p>LXII. The Egyptian usage is cognate to the aforesaid, <lb/>
            for they often designate Isis by the name of Athene, which <lb/>
            expresses the same meaning, " I have proceeded out of <lb/>
            myself," and is expressive of self-communicated motion. <lb/>
            But Typhon, as above stated, is called Seth, Bebon, and <lb/>
            Syn—these names being meant to declare a certain forcible <lb/>
            and impeding check, opposition, and turning upside down. <lb/>
            Besides, they call a loadstone " Bone of Osiris," but iron <lb/>
            " of Typhon It (as Manetho relates), for just as the iron is <note type="footnote"> 1 Alluding to the old tradition about Danaus, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύων</foreign>, as if from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύειν</foreign>: these derivations cannot be preserved in trans­ <lb/>
            lation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            often, like something alive, attracted to and following <lb/>
            after the loadstone, but often turns away and is repelled <lb/>
            from it in the opposite direction, in like manner the salu­ <lb/>
            tary good and rational motion of the world often attracts <lb/>
            by persuasion, draws to itself, and renders more gentle <lb/>
            that harsh and Typhonian force; and again, when it has <lb/>
            been driven back into itself, it upsets the latter, and <lb/>
            plunges it once more into helplessness. Besides, with <lb/>
            respect to Jupiter, Eudoxus relates that the Egyptians <lb/>
            have a legend that in consequence of his legs having <lb/>
            grown into one, he was unable to walk, and out of shame <lb/>
            remained in solitude, but that Isis, having cut asunder and <lb/>
            separated these parts of his body, rendered his walking <lb/>
            powers sound footed. Through these things also does <lb/>
            Fable hint, that the Mind and Word of God, which had <lb/>
            walked in the Invisible and the Hidden, came out into <lb/>
            Knowledge by means of Motion. t</p>
          <p>LXIII. The Sistrum too shows that the things that are <lb/>
            must be shaken, and never cease from motion, but be as it <lb/>
            were aroused and stirred up when they slumber and <lb/>
            are slothful, for they pretend they drive off and repulse <lb/>
            Typhon with the sistra, showing that when Corruption <lb/>
            has tied fast and brought it to a standstill, Generation <lb/>
            again unlooses and restores Nature by means of Motion. <lb/>
            And as the sistrum is circular in the upper part, the arch <lb/>
            contains the four things that are shaken, because the <lb/>
            part of the universe that is born and perishes, is sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by the Lunar sphere, but all things are set in <lb/>
            motion and changed within it by means of the four ele­ <lb/>
            ments, Fire, Earth, Water, Air. And on the arch of the <lb/>
            sistrum, at the top, they figure a Cat having a human <lb/>
            face [sphinx], and on the lower part, below the things <lb/>
            that are shaken, sometimes a head of Isis, sometimes of <lb/>
            Nephthys, symbolizing by these heads Generation and End <note type="footnote"> 1 Hence the idea of driving away the Devil by the sound of bells. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            (for these are the Changes and Motions of the elemental <lb/>
            and by the Cat, the Moon, on account of the pied colour,l <lb/>
            nocturnal habits, and fecundity of the animal, for it is <lb/>
            said to bring forth one, and then two, then three, then <lb/>
            four, up to five at a birth, and always adds by one up to <lb/>
            seven [to her litter], so that in all it produces eight-and- <lb/>
            twenty young, the which are equal in number to the illu­ <lb/>
            minations of the Moon. This, however, may be somewhat <lb/>
            fabulous, but the pupils in its eyes appear to grow full <lb/>
            and dilate themselves at the full of the moon, but become <lb/>
            thin and dull during the wane of that luminary; and <lb/>
            by the human head of the Cat they express the intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and rationality of the changes connected with the <lb/>
            Moon.</p>
          <p>LXIV. And to speak comprehensively, neither Water, <lb/>
            nor Sun, nor Earth, nor Rain, is it correct to regard as <lb/>
            Osiris or Isis; nor on the other hand, Drought, or Sea, or <lb/>
            Fire, as Typhon; but simply whatever in these elements <lb/>
            is either excessive or disordered in its changes, or de. <lb/>
            ficiencies, to assign this to Typhon: whilst all that is <lb/>
            well-ordered, good, and beneficial, we must regard as the <lb/>
            work indeed of Isis, but as the image, imitation, and Reason <lb/>
            of Osiris. If so we worship and honour them, we shall <lb/>
            not go wrong. Nay more, we shall make Eudoxus cease <lb/>
            from disbelieving, and being perplexed, wherefore the <lb/>
            superintendence of love-affairs is not given to Ceres, but <lb/>
            to Isis; and why Bacchus is not empowered to raise the <lb/>
            Nile or to rule over the Shades ;-for by one common rule <lb/>
            we hold that these two deities are ordained to preside over <lb/>
            the whole empire of the Good; and that all whatever <lb/>
            exists in Nature beautiful and good, exists through their <lb/>
            means; the one supplying the final causes, the other <lb/>
            receiving them, and continuing permanent.</p>
          <p>. LXV. In this way we shall also meet those common <note type="footnote"> I Showing the original colour of the Cat to be tabby. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            and trivial stories of people whether to identify the legends <lb/>
            concerning these deities with the seasonable changes of <lb/>
            the atmosphere, or with the growth, sowings, and plough­ <lb/>
            ings of the grain; and who say that Osiris is then buried <lb/>
            when the sown grain is hidden in the ground, and that he <lb/>
            comes to life and shows himself again when there is <lb/>
            a beginning of sprouting; wherefore Isis perceiving that <lb/>
            she is pregnant, ties an amulet round her neck on the 6th <lb/>
            of the first quarter of the month Phaophi, and that Harp­ <lb/>
            ocrates is born about the winter solstice, unfinished and <lb/>
            infant-like in the plants that flower early and spring up <lb/>
            early, for which reason they offer to him first fruits of <lb/>
            growing lentiles, and they celebrate her being brought to <lb/>
            bed after the vernal equinox. For when they hear all <lb/>
            this, people are satisfied and believe it; drawing as they <lb/>
            do conviction from home, from things at hand, and with <lb/>
            which they are familiar.</p>
          <p>LXVI. And it is no great harm if in the first place they <lb/>
            make the gods our common property, and not the exclu­ <lb/>
            sive possession of the Egyptians; instead of by confining <lb/>
            these names to the Nile alone, and the region the Nile <lb/>
            waters, or by talking of marshes, lotus-flowers, and god­ <lb/>
            making, thereby deprive the rest of mankind of deities <lb/>
            of the highest order nothing to do with either-who <lb/>
            have neither Nile, Butos, or Memphis. But Isis, and <lb/>
            the gods connected with her, all men have and know <lb/>
            -Borne of them indeed they have, not long ago, learnt to <lb/>
            call by names brought from Egypt; but of each one they <lb/>
            knew and reverenced the power from time immemorial. <lb/>
            And secondly, and what is more important-let them <lb/>
            take good heed, and fear lest they unwittingly degrade and <lb/>
            resolve divine beings into winds and currents and sowings <lb/>
            and ploughings, and affections of the earth, and changes <lb/>
            of seasons; like as those who say that Bacchus is wine, <lb/>
            Vulcan flame ; and, as Cleanthes somewhere or other says, <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            that Proserpine means the air that pervades the crops, <lb/>
            and is slaughtered; and as a poet has it :­ <lb/>
            " What time the youths cut Ceres, limb from limb." <lb/>
            For these persons differ in no respect from such as should <lb/>
            consider sails, cables, and anchor as a pilot, or yarn and <lb/>
            thread as a weaver; or a jug and basin as a potter, or <lb/>
            else honeyed potions and gruel as a physician.</p>
          <p>LXVII. But those theorists engender horrible and <lb/>
            impious notions, who apply the names of deities to natural <lb/>
            productions and to things that be without sense, without <lb/>
            life, and necessarily consumed by men in want of and <lb/>
            making use of them. For these things themselves it is <lb/>
            impossible to conceive as gods (for we cannot conceive <lb/>
            God as an inanimate thing, subject to man), but from <lb/>
            these productions we have drawn the inference that they <lb/>
            who created them, and bestow, and dispense them to us <lb/>
            constantly and sufficiently, are gods-not different gods <lb/>
            amongst different people, nor Barbarian or Grecian, of the <lb/>
            South or of the North-but like as the Sun, Moon, Sky, <lb/>
            Earth, Sea, are the common property of all men, but yet <lb/>
            are called by different names by different nations ; in the <lb/>
            same manner, as one reason regulates all things, and one <lb/>
            Providence directs, and subordinate Powers are appointed <lb/>
            over all things, yet different honours and titles are by <lb/>
            custom assigned to them amongst different peoples : and <lb/>
            these have established, and do employ, symbols, some <lb/>
            obscure, some more intelligible, in order to lead the <lb/>
            understanding into things divine. And this not without <lb/>
            danger: for some having entirely missed their meaning, <lb/>
            have slid into superstition ; whilst others shunning every <lb/>
            superstition like a quagmire, have unknowingly fallen <lb/>
            into Atheism1 as down a precipice. <note type="footnote"> 1 Another allusion to the spread of Christianity, the preachers of <lb/>
            which drew their strongest arguments from the, apparently, absurd <lb/>
            symbolism of the old religions. </note> <pb n="58"/>
            </p>
          <p>LXVIII. For which cause it is especially fitting in this <lb/>
            case that we borrow from Philosophy Reason for our <lb/>
            guide, and so consider each particular of the things told <lb/>
            and done: in order that we may not, as Theodorus ex­ <lb/>
            presses it, " when he offers words with his right hand some <lb/>
            of his hearers take them with their left;" in the same <lb/>
            way we should go wrong by taking in a different sense <lb/>
            what the laws have ordained well concerning sacrifices <lb/>
            and festivals. For that we ought to construe all things <lb/>
            according to their sense, we may learn from these people <lb/>
            themselves of whom we are treating : for on the nineteenth <lb/>
            day of the first month they hold a festival to Hermes, and <lb/>
            eat honey and figs, repeating “ A sweet thing is the <lb/>
            Truth ; " and again the charm which Isis hangs about her <lb/>
            neck is interpreted as " A TRUE VOICE 1 and Harpo­ <lb/>
            crates we must not regard as an incomplete and infant <lb/>
            god, or some sort of pulse, but as presiding over and cor­ <lb/>
            recting men's notions of the deities, when as yet new, <lb/>
            incomplete, and inarticulate ; for which reason he has his <lb/>
            finger laid upon his mouth in token of reticence and <lb/>
            silence. And in the month Mesori, they serve up pulse, <lb/>
            repeating " The Tongue is Fortune, the Tongue is a <lb/>
            deity," and of all the plants growing in Egypt they say <lb/>
            the Persea is the most sacred to the gods, because its <lb/>
            fruit resembles a heart, and its leaf a tongue. For of all <lb/>
            that man possesses by nature nothing is more divine than <lb/>
            speech, especially that which concerns the gods ; nor has <lb/>
            anything greater weight towards his happiness: where­ <lb/>
            fore I enjoin 2 upon him that goes down here to consult <note type="footnote"> I Translation of the Coptic inscription upon the amulet, perhaps the <lb/>
            famous “ Abracadabra." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some words are lost here; the sense requires, I enjoin on you in <lb/>

            the oracle "to think religiously, to speak auspiciously:" <lb/>
            but most people act ridiculously, when in the processions <lb/>
            and festivals they bid us speak auspiciously, whilst they <lb/>
            both speak and think most blasphemously about the gods <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>LXIX. In what manner therefore must we conduct <lb/>
            those melancholy, laughter less, and mournful sacrifices, if <lb/>
            it is neither right to omit what is established by custom, <lb/>
            nor yet to adulterate our notions about the gods, and <lb/>
            disorder them with absurd fancies? For amongst the <lb/>
            Greeks also many things are done (and at the same time <lb/>
            of year too) resembling the Egyptian ceremonies: for at <lb/>
            Athens the women fast at the Thesmophoria, seated on <lb/>
            the ground; and the Bœotians “ move the house of <lb/>
            Achæa,”naming the festival " Epachthe; " as though <lb/>
            Ceres were in mourning on account of the descent of <lb/>
            her daughter into the shades. Moreover, this month <lb/>
            coincides with the rising of the Pleiads, which the <lb/>
            Egyptians call Athor, the Athenians Pyanepsion, and the <lb/>
            Bœotians Damatrios ; the Western nations 1 also, as Theo­ <lb/>
            pompus relates, consider and call the winter Saturn, the <lb/>
            summer Venus, and the spring Proserpine; and believe <lb/>
            that all things come out of Saturn 2 and Venus. But the <lb/>
            Phrygians believing that God sleeps by winter, but wakes <lb/>
            up in spring, at the one time hold with revelry the feasts <lb/>
            of his " Going to bed," at the other those of his " Getting <lb/>
            up:" whilst the Paphlagonians say He is bound down <lb/>
            and imprisoned by winter, but loosened, and set in motion <lb/>
            by spring.</p>
          <p>LXX. The time of year too suggests a suspicion that <lb/>
            the mourning takes place upon the burial of the corn; <note type="footnote"> 1 The Celts; the regular expression for them in the early Greek <lb/>
            writers. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This seems connected with the belief of the Gauls that they sprung <lb/>
            from Dis Pater, as Caesar mentions. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            which corn, indeed, those of old time did not regard as <lb/>
            gods, but as gifts of the gods, both great and indispensable <lb/>
            to the not living savagely and like the beasts: and at <lb/>
            what season they saw the fruits of the trees vanishing <lb/>
            entirely, and failing them, whilst those they themselves <lb/>
            had sown as yet sparingly and clumsily, scraping away <lb/>
            the soil with their hands, and covering them over again, <lb/>
            so depositing them with the uncertainty of their reap­ <lb/>
            pearing and arriving at maturity-they used to do many <lb/>
            things like to those that bury and that mourn:—and then, <lb/>
            just as we say that one that buys the works of Plato, <lb/>
            buys Plato; and he acts Menander that represents Men­ <lb/>
            ander's plays, so did they not scruple to call by the names <lb/>
            of the gods the gifts and creations of the gods ; doing <lb/>
            them honour and reverence by use: whilst those who <lb/>
            came after, receiving these names without understand­ <lb/>
            ing, and ignorantly transferring to the gods the vicis­ <lb/>
            situdes of the seed corn, and not merely calling, but <lb/>
            believing the appearances and concealments of the ne­ <lb/>
            cessaries of life, " births " and " destructions " of gods, <lb/>
            filled their heads with absurd, wicked and confused <lb/>
            ideas.</p>
          <p>LXXI. And yet people, having in view the absurdity of <lb/>
            the contradiction, like Xenophanes of Colophon, and those <lb/>
            following him, who said " that the Egyptians, if they be­ <lb/>
            lieve in gods, do not mourn for them, and if they mourn <lb/>
            for them do not believe in them ;" but that it was ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous to lament and in the same breath to pray for the <lb/>
            seed corn to show itself again, and ripen itself, in order <lb/>
            that it may be again consumed and mourned for. But <lb/>
            such is not really the case; for they mourn for the seed <lb/>
            corn, but pray to the gods, the givers and authors of the <lb/>
            same, to make more anew and cause it to spring up in the <lb/>
            place of that which has perished. Whence there is a very <lb/>
            good maxim amongst philosophers, " that they who learn <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            not how rightly to understand names make a bad use of <lb/>
            things;” just as those Greeks that have not learnt or ac­ <lb/>
            customed themselves to call the brazen, painted, and <lb/>
            marble images, not ornaments and honours of gods, but <lb/>
            actual gods, in the next place do not scruple to say that <lb/>
            Lachares stripped Minerva bare; that Dionysius cropped <lb/>
            an Apollo that wore curls of gold; that the Capitoline <lb/>
            Jupiter was burnt and perished in the Civil Wars. Let <lb/>
            them learn therefore that they are led astray, and imbibe <lb/>
            false notions, modelled upon the names. This is especially <lb/>
            the case of the Egyptians with respect to the animals to <lb/>
            which honours are paid; whereas the Greeks in this par­ <lb/>
            ticular, at all events, both speak and believe correctly, <lb/>
            saying that the dove is the sacred animal of Venus, the <lb/>
            dragon 1 of Minerva, the raven of Apollo, the dog of Diana <lb/>
            (as Euripides hath it­ <lb/>
            " Thou wilt be a dog, torch-bearing Dian's pet"). <lb/>
            But the most part of the Egyptians, by worshipping the <lb/>
            sacred animals, and treating them as gods, have not only <lb/>
            covered their rites with ridicule and mockery; although <lb/>
            this is the least evil resulting from their simplicity ; for a <lb/>
            horrible belief grows up that gives over the weak-minded <lb/>
            and innocent to superstition pure and unmitigated, whilst <lb/>
            the acuter and bolder sort it leads into atheistical and <lb/>
            bestial incredulity: hence it is not out of place to discuss <lb/>
            the subject in the way that seems most appropriate to <lb/>
            treat it.</p>
          <p>LXXII. The notion that the gods changed themselves <lb/>
            into these animals out of fear of Typhon, as it were hiding <lb/>
            themselves in the bodies of ibises, dogs, and hawks, ex­ <lb/>
            ceeds in absurdity every kind of jugglery and fabulous <lb/>
            tale. Also the notion that the new births of the souls of <lb/>
            the deceased, so many as continue to exist, is merely the <note type="footnote"> 1 Crested serpent, much resembling the Hindoo cobra. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            being born again under these shapes, is equally incredible. <lb/>
            And of such as attempt to assign some political cause for <lb/>
            these legends, some pretend that Osiris upon his great ex­ <lb/>
            pedition divided his forces into several parts (" com­ <lb/>
            panies " and " ranks" the Greeks call them), and gave <lb/>
            them badges of the figures of animals, each of which be­ <lb/>
            came sacred and venerated by the family of those banded <lb/>
            under it. Others, that the succeeding kings, for the sake <lb/>
            of striking terror unto their adversaries, used to make their <lb/>
            appearance in the battles wearing the heads of wild <lb/>
            beasts made of gold and silver: but one of these clever and <lb/>
            ingenious monarchs, they tell, observing that the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians were naturally fickle and disposed to change and in­ <lb/>
            novation, because they were easily cajoled, whilst from <lb/>
            their numbers they possessed irresistible and ungovernable <lb/>
            strength in unanimity and joint action-on that account <lb/>
            taught them an everlasting superstition in the sowing of <lb/>
            the ground, as a pretext for unceasing dissension among <lb/>
            themselves. For, inasmuch as the beasts, different kinds <lb/>
            of which he ordered different tribes to honour and wor­ <lb/>
            ship, behave with illwill and hostility towards each other, <lb/>
            and are respectively inclined by nature to live upon diffe­ <lb/>
            rent sorts of food, each party, in defending their own <lb/>
            animals and being indignant when they suffered harm, <lb/>
            should unwittingly be involved and compromised in quar­ <lb/>
            rels against each other through the enmities between the <lb/>
            different beasts. For even at the present day the people <lb/>
            of Lycopolis are the only Egyptians that eat the sheep, <lb/>
            because the Wolf, whom they worship, does the same; <lb/>
            and the Oxyrynchites on one day, when the people of <lb/>
            Cynopolis (Dog-Town) were eating the fish called Oxyryn­ <lb/>
            chus, collected dogs and sacrificed and eat them as victims ; <lb/>
            and from this occasion setting to war, they handled each <lb/>
            other roughly, and afterwards being punished for it by the <lb/>
            Romans, were equally ill-treated.</p><pb n="63"/>
            
          <p>LXXIII. And as many pretend that the soul of Typhon <lb/>
            himself is divided amongst these animals, the fable may <lb/>
            be thought to express enigmatically that every irrational <lb/>
            and bestial nature belongs to the share of the Evil Spirit: <lb/>
            and that people in order to propitiate and soothe Him, treat <lb/>
            . these animals well, and do them worship: and if a long and <lb/>
            severe drought should come on, inducing to an extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary degree either pestilential diseases, or other strange <lb/>
            and inexplicable calamities, then some of these honoured <lb/>
            animals do the priests lead out in darkness, quietly and in <lb/>
            silence, and at first they threaten and scare away the creature; <lb/>
            but if it remains fixed,1 then they consecrate and sacrifice <lb/>
            it, as though this were some kind of punishment for its <lb/>
            deity, or else a great mean of purification in the greatest <lb/>
            emergencies. For in the city Idisthyas they used to burn <lb/>
            men alive, as Manetho relates, calling them " Typhonians," <lb/>
            and by tossing their ashes in a winnowing-fan made away <lb/>
            with and scattered the same. This, however, was done pub­ <lb/>
            lickly, every year, in the Dogdays, whereas the sacrificings <lb/>
            of the worshipped animals are secret, taking place at irre­ <lb/>
            gular times according to the emergency, and are unknown <lb/>
            to the commonalty, except at what time the animals re­ <lb/>
            ceive burial, when the priests produce some of the other <lb/>
            animals, and in the presence of all throw them along with <lb/>
            the rest into the grave; thinking to retaliate upon Typhon's <lb/>
            conduct and to prevent what he delights in. For the apis, <lb/>
            along with a few others, is reputed sacred to Osiris, and if <lb/>
            this explanation be true, I am of opinion it indicates what <lb/>
            we are in search of in the case of the animals that are ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged and have joint honours with him, for instance, <lb/>
            the ibis, the hawk, the baboon, and the apis himself; for <lb/>
            so do they call the goat, that is, at Mendes.</p>
          <p>• LXXIV. There remains the utilitarian and symbolical <lb/>
            part of the question, where some of these figures partake <note type="footnote"> I The ceremony of the scape-goat. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            of one quality, some of the other, many of both combined. <lb/>
            The ox, the sheep, the ichneumon, it is evident they vene. <lb/>
            rated on account of their usefulness to man, just as the <lb/>
            Lemnians do the larks that seek out and break the eggs <lb/>
            of the locusts; and the Thessalians the storks, because <lb/>
            when their land bred many snakes the birds made their <lb/>
            appearance, and destroyed them all; wherefore they made <lb/>
            a law that whosoever killed a stork should be banished the <lb/>
            country. The asp, weasel, beetle,-because they discerned <lb/>
            in them certain faint reflexions of the power of the gods, <lb/>
            like that of the sun in raindrops. And of the weasel <lb/>
            many hold and say that as it is impregnated through the <lb/>
            ear, and brings forth its young through the mouth, it is <lb/>
            a similitude of the generation of Reason; whilst the beetle <lb/>
            has no female, all being males, and discharge their semen <lb/>
            into the material they have rolled into balls, which they <lb/>
            roll along, pushing it with their feet as they walk in the <lb/>
            opposite direction, in the same manner as the sun seems <lb/>
            to surround the heavens backwards, whilst he himself is <lb/>
            travelling from west to east. The asp as being immortal <lb/>
            and capable of motion without limbs, with equal facility <lb/>
            and suppleness, they likened to a star.</p>
          <p>LXXV. Not even the crocodile receives honours that <lb/>
            are devoid of any plausible reason, for it is said to have <lb/>
            been made an emblem of the Deity, as being the sole ani. <lb/>
            mal destitute of a tongue. For the Divine Reason stands <lb/>
            not in need of voice, but walking along a silent path and <lb/>
            rule, guides mortal affairs according to justice; and the <lb/>
            crocodile alone, of things living in liquid, veils its eyes <lb/>
            with a thin transparent membrane which it draws down <lb/>
            from the upper lid, so as to see without being seen, which <lb/>
            is the attribute of the Supreme Deity; and wherever in <lb/>
            the ground the female may have laid her eggs, that place they <lb/>
            know is beyond reach of the rising of the Nile, because she <lb/>
            cannot lay eggs in the wet, and yet is afraid to lay them at <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            a distance from the water; so exactly do they foresee the <lb/>
            future that they make use of the advancing river as they <lb/>
            are bringing forth and hatching, and yet keep the eggs dry <lb/>
            and free from damp, for they lay sixty and hatched them <lb/>
            in as many days, and so many years live those that live <lb/>
            longest, the which number is the first measure to the pheno­ <lb/>
            mena in the heavens. Again, as regards the animals wor­ <lb/>
            shipped-concerning the dog we have already spoken, but <lb/>
            the ibis, besides destroying the venomous reptiles, first <lb/>
            taught men the use of medicinal purging, when they ob­ <lb/>
            served the bird using clysters and getting cleared out by <lb/>
            herself. Those of the priests that be most observant of <lb/>
            rules, when they sanctify themselves use for the water of <lb/>
            purification that out of which an ibis has drunk, because <lb/>
            it neither drinks unwholesome or poisoned water, and does <lb/>
            not even go near it, whilst by the relative position of its <lb/>
            legs to each other (and the beak), it forms an equilateral <lb/>
            triangle; besides, the variation and mixture of the black <lb/>
            feathers with the white resembles the figure of the half <lb/>
            moon.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. We ought not to wonder at the Egyptians being <lb/>
            so pleased with these imperfect resemblances ; the Greeks <lb/>
            too, in their painted and in their sculptured images of the <lb/>
            gods, have employed many things of the same kind; for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, in Crete there was a statue of Jupiter, which had no <lb/>
            ears, because it behoves the Ruler and Lord of gods to hearken <lb/>
            unto no one; at the side of his Minerva, Phidias has placed <lb/>
            the serpent; at the side of the Venus at Elis, the tortoise, <lb/>
            implying that virgins stand in need of watching after, but <lb/>
            home-keeping and silence are suitable to married women; <lb/>
            and Neptune's trident is an emblem of the third place which, <lb/>
            the sea occupies, assigned to it after sky and air, on which <lb/>
            account Amphitrite and the Tritons have been so named [as <lb/>
            derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριτὸς</foreign>]. The Pythagoreans have even adorned <lb/>
            pumbers and geometrical figures with the appellations of <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            the gods ; for the equilateral triangle they have named <lb/>
            Minerva, " bom out of the head," and " Tritogeneia," be­ <lb/>
            cause it is described by three lines drawn from the angles: <lb/>
            Unity they call Apollo; and by a plausible pretext, when <lb/>
            the unit is doubled, the Two they name strife and audacity: <lb/>
            but the Three they call justice, for it seems that wronging <lb/>
            and being wronged exists by means of deficiency and excess, <lb/>
            but what is just stands in the middle by reason of equality: <lb/>
            and what is called the Four (the six and thirty), was their <lb/>
            mightiest oath, as has been commonly reported; and the <lb/>
            world1 has been so denominated because it was completed by <lb/>
            the four first elements, and the four superfluous qualities <lb/>
            being joined together into One. If, therefore, the most <lb/>
            illustrious philosophers when they discerned an emblem of <lb/>
            the Divinity even in lifeless and incorporeal things did not <lb/>
            think right to neglect or slight any of them, still less, I <lb/>
            fancy, did they do so,2 when they discerned moral qualities <lb/>
            in natural objects endowed with sense, possessing life, <lb/>
            passions, and tempers.</p>
          <p>LXXVII. We must therefore put up with, not indeed <lb/>
            their paying honours to these creatures, but their discern­ <lb/>
            ing through their medium (as in clearer mirrors) the work <lb/>
            of Nature ; and conceiving rightly that which is Divine as <lb/>
            being the instrument and act of the God who ordereth all <lb/>
            things. And it is right that nothing without a soul be <lb/>
            held superior to that with a soul, or that which is without <lb/>
            sense to what possesses sense, not even though one should <lb/>
            bring together all the gold and emeralds that are in the <lb/>
            world (for Divinity does not reside in uses, forms, and <lb/>
            polish), but those things hold a place lower in estimation <lb/>
            than the dead, whatever neither have participated, nor by <lb/>
            their nature can participate in life ; whereas that Nature <lb/>
            which lives and sees, and has the final cause of motive <note type="footnote"> 1 Allusive to the primary sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοσμὸς</foreign>,order, arrangement. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The early Egyptians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            from within itself, as also the knowledge both of what is <lb/>
            its own and that of others, and besides, hath derived an <lb/>
            influence and a portion from the Wisdom by which the <lb/>
            universe (according to Heraclitus) is governed. For which <lb/>
            reason, the Deity is not worse shadowed forth in these <lb/>
            things, than in artistic works in bronze, which, while <lb/>
            equally susceptible of decay and defilement, are by their <lb/>
            nature devoid of perception and understanding. As re­ <lb/>
            gards the worshipped animals, therefore, this explanation <lb/>
            I approve of the most of all those offered.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. Now to treat of the vestments of Isis, dif­ <lb/>
            fering in their colours (for her power relates to Matter, as <lb/>
            it turns itself into and embraces all things-light, dark­ <lb/>
            ness,day, night, life, death, beginning, end), whereas that <lb/>
            of Osiris has no shadow nor variation but one, simple, the <lb/>
            image of light; for pure is the Final Cause, and free from <lb/>
            mixture the Primal and Intelligible. Wherefore, when <lb/>
            they have once for all taken off that (vestment) they put <lb/>
            it away, and preserve it out of sight and untouched. Whereas <lb/>
            those of Isis they use on many occasions, because the <lb/>
            objects of sense, being obvious and in constant use, present <lb/>
            many unfoldings and exhibitions of themselves, as they <lb/>
            succeed one after the other, whereas the conception of the <lb/>
            Intelligible, the Unmixed, and the Holy, shines through <lb/>
            at once, like a flash of lightning, touches the soul, and <lb/>
            allows itself to be seen. For which reason Plato and <lb/>
            Aristotle termed this part of philosophy " Speculative," <lb/>
            because they passed over in reasoning these apparent, <lb/>
            heterogeneous, and multiform ideas, and soar up towards <lb/>
            the Primal, the Simple, and the Everlasting, and when they <lb/>
            touch in any way the clear truth concerning these matters <lb/>
            they think that philosophy is complete, and has gained its <lb/>
            end.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. And what the present priests of these days <lb/>
            darkly reveal, making scruples about it, and disguising it <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            with caution, namely, that this deity presides over and is <lb/>
            king of the dead (being no other than the Hades and <lb/>
            Pluto amongst the Greeks)—since it is not known in what <lb/>
            sense the doctrine is true, disturbs the minds of the vulgar, <lb/>
            when they have the idea that the sacred and truly holy <lb/>
            Osiris dwells in the earth, and under the earth, where are <lb/>
            hidden the corpses of such as seem to have come to an <lb/>
            end. But He Himself dwells at the greatest distance from <lb/>
            the earth, being unmixed, undefiled, and pure from all <lb/>
            nature admitting of corruption and of death ; but the souls <lb/>
            of men here below, enveloped in bodies and passions, have <lb/>
            no participation in the Deity, except as far as lies in grasp­ <lb/>
            ing Him by conception, like an indistinct dream, by means <lb/>
            of philosophy; but where they are set free and migrate to <lb/>
            the Formless, Invisible, Impassive, and Good, then this <lb/>
            God becomes leader and king over them, whilst they hang, <lb/>
            as it were, upon him, and contemplate without ever being <lb/>
            satiated, and long for that Beauty which can neither be <lb/>
            spoken nor described-for which the old legend makes Isis <lb/>
            desire, seek after, and dwell with, and fills things here <lb/>
            below, whatever partake of birth, with all things beautiful <lb/>
            and good. Such notions as these, then, have a sense best <lb/>
            befitting the idea of the deity.</p>
          <p>LXXX. And if I must speak of the kinds of Incense <lb/>
            offered or their respective days (as I promised), let the <lb/>
            reader before all things bear in mind that men have always <lb/>
            felt the greatest anxiety about practices connected with <lb/>
            health, especially as to religious ceremonies, purifications, <lb/>
            and ways of living; this being done no less on account of <lb/>
            religion than of health, because they did not consider it <lb/>
            fitting to worship with festering or sickly bodies or souls, <lb/>
            that which is pure, entirely exempt from decay, and free <lb/>
            from pollution. And inasmuch as the air of which we <lb/>
            make the most use and have most to do with, does not al­ <lb/>
            ways keep the same constitution, but at night is condensed <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            and weighs down the body, and disposes the soul to gloom <lb/>
            and thoughtfulness, becoming, as it were, misty and <lb/>
            heavy, therefore as soon as they get up they burn for in­ <lb/>
            cense Resin, thereby rectifying and purifying the air by its <lb/>
            virtue, and blowing away the corrupted exhalation natu­ <lb/>
            rally given forth by the body, because this perfume pos­ <lb/>
            sesses a strong and penetrating quality; and again at mid­ <lb/>
            day, perceiving that the sun draws strongly out of the <lb/>
            earth a heavy exhalation, and mixes it with the air, they <lb/>
            burn Myrrh., because its hot nature dissolves and disperses <lb/>
            the turbid and muddy element in the surrounding air; in <lb/>
            fact, physicians think they counteract pestilential diseases <lb/>
            by making a great blaze, on the supposition that it sub­ <lb/>
            tilizes the air. It subtilizes it better, if they burn woods <lb/>
            of a dry nature, such as of cypress, juniper, and pine. <lb/>
            Acron, therefore, the physician at Athens during the Great <lb/>
            Plague, is said to have gained credit by ordering fires to <lb/>
            be burnt by the side of the sick, for he benefited them <lb/>
            not a little thereby. And Aristotle asserts that the sweet <lb/>
            smelling exhalations of perfumes, flowers, and meadows, <lb/>
            conduce no less to health than to enjoyment, because by <lb/>
            their warmth and subtileness, they spread themselves <lb/>
            through the brain, which is by nature cold and in a state <lb/>
            of congelation, and if amongst the Egyptians they call <lb/>
            myrrh " Bal," and this word interpreted signifies pretty <lb/>
            nearly " sweeping out of evacuations," the name furnishes <lb/>
            some evidence to my explanation of the reason for which it <lb/>
            is used.</p>
          <p>LXXXI. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυφὶ</foreign> is composed of sixteen ingredients: <lb/>
            honey, wine, raisins, sweet-rush, resin, myrrh, frank­ <lb/>
            incense, seselis, and besides, of calamus, asphalt, thryon, <lb/>
            dock, and besides these of both arceuthids (one of which <lb/>
            is called the greater, the other the less), and cardamums, <lb/>
            and orris-root. These are compounded not at random, but <lb/>
            sacred books are read aloud to the perfume-makers, whilst <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            they are mixing the ingredients. And as for their number, <lb/>
            if it certainly looks like a square made out of a square, <lb/>
            and alone containing the equal number an equal number <lb/>
            of times, and to bring its external measurement exactly <lb/>
            equal to the area, this accidental circumstance must by no <lb/>
            means be said to contribute nothing to this effect: but <lb/>
            the majority of the ingredients possessing aromatical pro­ <lb/>
            perties, send out a sweet breath and salubrious exhalation, <lb/>
            whereby, when the air is changed and the body excited in <lb/>
            the proper manner, they are 1 themselves lulled to sleep, <lb/>
            and have a seductive tendency; whilst the trouble­ <lb/>
            someness and tension of our daily anxieties they loosen <lb/>
            and untie, like so many knots; and the imaginative and <lb/>
            prophetic part of dreams, they brighten up and render <lb/>
            more clear, like as it were a mirror, to no less degree than <lb/>
            do the tunes on the lyre which the Pythagoreans used to <lb/>
            play before going to sleep; thus charming down and <lb/>
            doctoring the irrational and passionate portion of the soul. <lb/>
            For things smelt at often call back the failing sense, often <lb/>
            on the other hand blunt and stupify the. same; their <lb/>
            evaporations diffusing themselves through the body by <lb/>
            reason of their subtilty in the same way as some phy­ <lb/>
            sicians say that sleep is produced when the exhalations <lb/>
            from the food taken, creeping gently, and as it were feel­ <lb/>
            ing their way around the inward parts, cause a kind of <lb/>
            tickling. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυφὶ</foreign> they use both as a drink and as a <lb/>
            composition [pastile] ; for taken in drink, it is thought to <lb/>
            purge the intestines, having the property of loosening the <lb/>
            bowels.</p>
          <p>LXXXII. And apart from these considerations, resin is <lb/>
            the work of the Sun ; whilst the shrubs drop their tears <lb/>
            of myrrh under the influence of the Moon: whereas the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυφὶ</foreign> is compounded of those things that delight most in <lb/>
            night, inasmuch as they are made by Nature to be <note type="footnote"> 1 Rather, " they of themselves lull people to sleep." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            nourished by cold airs, shade, dews, and moisture: <lb/>
            because the light of day is one and unmixed (for Pindar <lb/>
            says, "the Sun rushes through empty æther”), whereas the <lb/>
            night air is a compound and medley of many lights and <lb/>
            properties; as it were, of seeds showered down from every <lb/>
            star into one place. With good cause then do the first- <lb/>
            named perfumes, as being simple and deriving their origin <lb/>
            from the Sun, exhibit their virtues by day, whereas the <lb/>
            last-mentioned do so when night begins to set in. <pb n="72"/>

            OME eagles, or swans, as the legend goes, my Teren­ <lb/>
            tius Priscus, starting from the opposite extremities <lb/>
            of the earth, met together on the same point at Pytho, <lb/>
            around what is now called the " Omphalos: " and in later <lb/>
            times Epimenides of Phæstos, putting questions con­ <lb/>
            cerning this legend before the god of the place, and having <lb/>
            received an unintelligible and ambiguous response, de. <lb/>
            clared that :— <lb/>
            " There is no tumbril of the land or sea: <lb/>
            God only knows, man knows not, if there be." <lb/>
            With good cause, therefore, did the god repulse him when <lb/>
            he was testing the ancient story, like some old painting, <lb/>
            by the touch.</p>
          <p>II. Shortly before the Pythian games held under Callis­ <lb/>
            tratus, there happened to be two holy men, met together <lb/>
            from the opposite limits of the world at Delphi, visiting <lb/>
            me. They were Demetrius the grammarian,1 returning <lb/>
            home to Tarsus out of Britain, and Cleombrotus the <note type="footnote"> I Of whom a most interesting memorial is still extant in the Museum <lb/>
            at York, a little bronze tablet inscribed with the letters, Ɵ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΕΟΙΣ</foreign> TOIS <lb/>

            cation tallying with the epithet "holy" here given to him. He was, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            Lacedemonian, after long wandering in Egypt, and up <lb/>
            and down the region of the Troglodytes, and after voyag­ <lb/>
            ing beyond the Red Sea—not for the purpose of trading, <lb/>
            but as being a person fond of seeing and fond of learning, <lb/>
            having sufficient wealth, and not esteeming it a matter of <lb/>
            importance to have more than sufficient, he employed his <lb/>
            leisure for such purposes, and was collecting information <lb/>
            as the materials for philosophy that had, as he himself <lb/>
            expressed it, Theology for its end. Having lately been to <lb/>
            the temple of Ammon, he evidently had not been greatly <lb/>
            struck with the other things there, but with respect to the <lb/>
            unextinguishable Lamp he relates a story well deserving of <lb/>
            attention, told him by the priests; namely, that every <lb/>
            year it consumes less oil, and that they took this for <lb/>
            a proof of the inequality [diminution] of the years always <lb/>
            making the last one shorter than that preceding it; for it <lb/>
            was to be expected that with a shorter time the consump­ <lb/>
            tion of oil would be less also.</p>
          <p>III. When the rest of the company expressed our <lb/>
            astonishment, and Demetrius had remarked " that it was <lb/>
            ridiculous to draw such important inferences from trifling <lb/>
            facts; which was not, as Alcæus hath it, 'painting the <lb/>
            lion from his talon,' but the measuring1 the heavens and <lb/>
            universe with a wick and a lamp, and utterly upsetting <lb/>
            all matbematicks." Cleombrotus answered, " Those people <lb/>
            make no such attempt to upset that science: only they <lb/>
            will not concede the point of accuracy to the mathema. <lb/>

            been employed in the finance department in the government office at <lb/>

             <pb n="74"/>
            tions so far remote, than they themselves can be mistaken <lb/>
            in the quantity of oil, which they continually observe and <lb/>
            watch, on account of the singularity of the fact. And not <lb/>
            to allow, my Demetrius, that small things are indications <lb/>
            of great, has often been an obstacle to knowledge ; for in <lb/>
            that case the result will be that we shall deprive ourselves of <lb/>
            the demonstrations of many facts, and of the prognosticks <lb/>
            of many others. And yet it is no insignificant thing which <lb/>
            is proved to us, namely that people in the Heroic Age <lb/>
            used to smooth their persons with a razor, when we find <lb/>
            Homer mentioning a razor; and again, lending on usury, <lb/>
            for he speaks of a ' debt accumulating, neither a recent <lb/>
            one, nor yet a small one,' as though this signified the <lb/>
            growth of the obligation. Again, when he styles Night <lb/>
            (* rapid' or ' pointed'), you ought to be glad to lay hold <lb/>
            upon this epithet, and say this very thing implies the <lb/>
            shadow of the earth to be conical out of spherical. The <lb/>
            medical art, too, foretells a sickly summer from the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of spiders, 1 and from the Spring fig-leaves, when they <lb/>
            grow like a crow's foot-facts omitted by none of those <lb/>
            that pretend small things to be the signs of great ones. <lb/>
            And who will have the impudence to measure the magni­ <lb/>
            tude of the Sun against a pitcher and a cup of water; 2 or <lb/>
            that this square here, which makes what is called an acute <lb/>
            angle with the plane, should be the measurement of the <lb/>
            altitude by which the .... 3 always visible from <lb/>
            the horizon is elevated from the poles-for this fact was <lb/>
            to be learnt from means like these.</p>
          <p>" This was the story told by the oracle-interpreters of <note type="footnote"> 1 Conversely, a remarkable absence of house-flies has been noticed <lb/>
            here in the summers followed by cholera. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Astronomers made their observations upon the aun's disk reflected <lb/>

            the place; wherefore those persons (the objectors) must <lb/>
            make some other reply to them, when they, judging <lb/>
            according to the rule of their fathers, pronounce that <lb/>
            the sun's appointed course is no longer passable by that <lb/>
            luminary."</p>
          <p>IV. Ammonius the philosopher, who was present, ex­ <lb/>
            claimed, “ This remark applies not to the sun alone, but <lb/>
            to all the visible heavens; for it follows as a matter of <lb/>
            course that his revolution from one tropic to the other is <lb/>
            thereby contracted, and does not continue to be so <lb/>
            large a part of the horizon as the mathematicians say; <lb/>
            but grows less, continually suffering contraction from <lb/>
            south to north: whilst our summer is shorter, and the <lb/>
            temperature colder, because he turns his course within <lb/>
            (short of) his proper limits, and touches wider parallels of <lb/>
            latitude in the tropical signs. Besides, the gnomons at Syene <lb/>
            are proved to be no longer without casting shadow at the <lb/>
            summer solstice; and several of the fixed stars have passed <lb/>
            out of sight, whilst some touch, and are confounded with <lb/>
            each other, from the failure of the space between. And if <lb/>
            you should pretend that whilst all the rest remain as they <lb/>
            were, only the sun grows irregular in his motions, you 1 will <lb/>
            neither be able to assign the cause that accelerates his <lb/>
            course alone out of so vast a number of others; and you <lb/>
            will at once throw into confusion the greatest part of astro­ <lb/>
            nomical facts, those connected with the moon utterly, so <lb/>
            that there will be no need of measurement of oil in order <lb/>
            to prove the discrepancy: for the eclipses will convict him <lb/>
            of too frequently casting a shadow on the moon ; and the <lb/>
            moon also with her shadow .. each other, so there is <lb/>
            little need to expose the falsity of the assertion at greater <lb/>
            length.” " But yet," replied Cleombrotus, " I saw the <lb/>
            measure of oil also; for they showed me many curiosities; <note type="footnote"> I “ They " in text, which changes the person very awkwardly. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            and the annual quantity fell short of the most ancient by <lb/>
            not a little." But Ammonius, taking him up, said:—“Then <lb/>
            this fact has escaped the notice of all the other people <lb/>
            amongst whom ever-burning fires are kept up, and main­ <lb/>
            tained for a term of years, so to speak, without limit ? <lb/>
            And if one should assume that the story is true, were it <lb/>
            not better to suspect the existence of some coolness or <lb/>
            moisture in the air, by which the flame is deadened, and <lb/>
            naturally does not take hold of or consume so much <lb/>
            nutriment; or, on the other hand, to assign heat and <lb/>
            dryness as the cause. For I have long ago heard say <lb/>
            respecting fire, that it burns better in winter through <lb/>
            compulsion, because it is contracted and condensed in <lb/>
            itself by the cold, whereas during hot weather, it grows <lb/>
            weak, and becomes dull and relaxed: and if it be kindled <lb/>
            in the sunshine it works worse, and lays hold of the fuel <lb/>
            lazily, and consumes it more slowly. But, above all, one <lb/>
            may ascribe the cause to the oil itself, since it is not <lb/>
            unlikely that in old times it was less nutritious, and more <lb/>
            watery, because of its coming from a young tree; but <lb/>
            afterwards when ripened to perfection, and condensed, <lb/>
            with an equal quantity it possesses more strength, and <lb/>
            gives better nourishment to the flame—that is, if we needs <lb/>
            must save their theory for the priests of Ammon, however <lb/>
            absurd and unnatural it may appear."</p>
          <p>V. Now Ammonius having finished, “ Tell us rather," <lb/>
            said I," my dear Cleombrotus, something about the oracle : <lb/>
            for great was the ancient fame of the religion there-but <lb/>
            nowadays it appears to have withered away." But as <lb/>
            Cleombrotus made no reply, and kept his eyes fixed on the <lb/>
            ground, Demetrius put in :—" There is no need to inquire <lb/>
            about this matter, or to discuss the decay of the oracle, <lb/>
            but rather, as we see the extinction of them all in general, <lb/>
            except one or two, to consider this subject-for what <lb/>
            reason they have so decayed. For what need is there <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            to cite other instances, when Bceotia herself, that was so <lb/>
            celebrated for oracles in former times, has now failed <lb/>
            utterly like the water-springs, and a great drought of <lb/>
            prophesy hath overspread the land ; for in no other place, <lb/>
            save at Lebadeia does Bœotia, afford means to draw from <lb/>
            the oracular fount: as for the rest, either silence or utter <lb/>
            desolation has taken possession of them, and yet, at the <lb/>
            time of the Persian War, that of Amphiaraus was in no <lb/>
            less repute than the one at Lebadeia, and [Mardonius], as <lb/>
            was natural, consulted both. And the prophet of the <lb/>
            oracle there uttered in the Æolic language a response to <lb/>
            the envoys of the foreigners, so that none of the holy men <lb/>
            present understood what he was saying: because bar­ <lb/>
            barians have no partnership in inspiration-neither is it <lb/>
            granted unto them to receive a language that subserves <lb/>
            what is ordained. 1 And the slave who was sent to the <lb/>
            temple of Amphiaraus dreamed in the usual sleepy that a <lb/>
            minister of the god appeared, and at first drove him away by <lb/>
            word of mouth alone, on the score that the deity was not <lb/>
            at home, but afterwards pushed him out with his hands, <lb/>
            but when he persisted in staying, the minister took up a <lb/>
            good-sized stone, and knocked him on the head; and <lb/>
            these things were, as it were the counterparts of what <lb/>
            came to pass, for Mardonius was beaten not by a king, <lb/>
            but by the guardian and ministers of a king, who was <lb/>
            general of the Greeks, and was hit by a stone, and <lb/>
            fell, in the same way as the Lydian fancied he was struck <lb/>
            in his sleep. At that time, too, the oracle at Tagyrae <lb/>
            was in a flourishing condition, at which place the legend <lb/>
            goes that the god (Apollo) was born ; and of two brooks <lb/>
            that flow past, the one is called the Palm, the other the <lb/>
            Olive-tree to this day: and in the Persian War, Eche- <note type="footnote">1 i. e. declares the will of Fate. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The answers were communicated in dreams to the inquirers sleeping <lb/>
            inside the Temple. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            crates being prophet there, the god predicted victory and <lb/>
            successive war to the Greeks. And it is said that <lb/>
            during the Peloponnesian War an oracle from Delphi was <lb/>
            brought to the Delians, who had been expelled from their <lb/>
            native island, bidding them look out for the place where <lb/>
            Apollo was born, and to perform certain sacrifices there. <lb/>
            And when they had offered these sacrifices, and were dis­ <lb/>
            puting whether the god was born not amongst themselves, <lb/>
            but in some other place, the Pythia gave an additional <lb/>
            response that a crow would tell them the spot. They <lb/>
            went off therefore and arrived at Chaeronea, where they <lb/>
            heard their landlady talking with some guests that were <lb/>
            going to Tagyrae, about the oracles; and when the guests, <lb/>
            as they were departing, saluted and addressed their <lb/>
            hostess by the name she was called, namely Coronè, the <lb/>
            Delians understood the meaning of the response, offered <lb/>
            sacrifice, and obtained permission to return home after <lb/>
            no long time. There have also been manifestations of the <lb/>
            divine will at these same oracles more recent than the <lb/>
            above-named events, but now they are completely come <lb/>
            to an end, so that it were worth one's while to inquire at <lb/>
            the Pythian oracle respecting the cause of the change."</p>
          <p>VI. And now, walking forward from the Temple, we <lb/>
            arrived at the doors of the Hall of the Cnidians; and <lb/>
            having passed within, we perceived the friends to whom <lb/>
            we were going, sitting down and waiting for us. There <lb/>
            was silence on the part of the others, on account of <lb/>
            the hour, for they were either engaged in anointing <lb/>
            themselves, or else in looking at the wrestlers: then <lb/>
            Demetrius said with a smile: “ Shall I be wrong, or shall <lb/>
            I speak truth ? You appear to me to be attending to a <lb/>
            spectacle not worth your trouble, for I see you seated very <lb/>
            listlessly, and with an idle air upon your countenances." <lb/>
            Then Heraclitus of Megara, taking him up, replied: <lb/>
            " Yes, for we are not seeking after the solution of the pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            blem why the verb should lose one of its two lambdas <lb/>
            in the future tense, or from what word in the positive the <lb/>
            comparative <foreign xml:lang="grc">χει̃ρον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βλτον</foreign>,or the superlatives <foreign xml:lang="grc">χείριστον</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βέλτιστον</foreign> are derived; for these and such like ques­ <lb/>
            tions, perhaps, do contract and consolidate the face. Other <lb/>
            subjects you will find people inquiring into and discussing, <lb/>
            with their eyebrows in their proper places, and looking <lb/>
            untroubled, and not terrific, and not quarrelling with all <lb/>
            present." " Admit us, therefore," replied Demetrius, and <lb/>
            " in company with us follow up the question which has <lb/>
            just occurred to us, as being one proper for the place, <lb/>
            and, on account of the god, a matter of interest to all, <lb/>
            and consider in what way you shall not have to contract <lb/>
            your brows in discussing the same."</p>
          <p>VII. As soon therefore as we had joined company and <lb/>
            sat down amongst them, and he had laid the question <lb/>
            before us, then Didymus the Cynic, by surname Plane­ <lb/>
            tiades, jumped up, and striking on the ground two or <lb/>
            three times with his staff,1 cried out, " Ho, ho ! A <lb/>
            difficult problem, truly, one demanding much investiga­ <lb/>
            tion, is what you are come to bring us: for it were a <lb/>
            wonder, when so much wickedness is spread abroad, <lb/>
            if not merely Modesty and Shame (as Hesiod said of <lb/>
            old) should have abandoned mankind, but if the divine <lb/>
            Providence should not have packed up its oracles out of <lb/>
            every quarter, and taken its departure! On the contrary, <lb/>
            I propose to you to inquire how it was that oracles did not <lb/>
            come to an end long ago, and why Hercules did not for a <lb/>
            second time (or else some other of the gods), steal away <lb/>
            the Tripod, all bewrayed as it was with filthy and impious <lb/>
            questions that people propound to the deity; while some <lb/>
            make trial of his cleverness, as though he were a sophist, <lb/>
            and others tease him with questions about treasure-troves, <lb/>
            successions to property, and illegal marriages: so that <note type="footnote"> 1 The regular badge of his sect. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            Pythagoras is most signally confuted in saying that men <lb/>
            are then at their best when they are going to worship the <lb/>
            gods: in such a way, those very thoughts and passions of <lb/>
            the soul, which it were but decent to disclaim and to hide, <lb/>
            if one's elder should be present, these same thoughts do <lb/>
            they carry naked and fully exposed, into the presence of <lb/>
            the gods." And while he was still intending to speak, <lb/>
            Heracleon caught hold of his cloak; I too, being about <lb/>
            the most intimate with him. of all the company, said; <lb/>
            " Stop, my dear Planetiades, from provoking the god, for <lb/>
            he is irritable and not good-tempered, for ‘ he has been <lb/>
            blamed for having been angry with mortals,' as old Pindar <lb/>
            hath it; and whether he is the Sun, or the lord and father <lb/>
            of the Sun, and placed at the farthest side of the visible <lb/>
            creation-it is not likely he deems unworthy of his voice <lb/>
            men as they now are; to whom he is the source of life, <lb/>
            of nutrition, of being, and of thought, nor at the same <lb/>
            time that Providence, who like a benevolent and kind <lb/>
            mother makes and keeps aright every thing for our <lb/>
            benefit, should be revengeful in the matter of oracles alone, <lb/>
            and take the benefit away from us, after having given it <lb/>
            at first—just as though the greatest part of mankind were <lb/>
            not evil in more respects than now at the very time when <lb/>
            the oracles were established in many places. Come hither, <lb/>
            pray, sit down again, and after making a ‘ Pythian truce' <lb/>
            with Vice, which you are wont ever to chastise with your <lb/>
            speech, assist us in seeking for some other cause of the <lb/>
            aforesaid cessation of oracles; but keep the god in good <lb/>
            humour, and exempt from blame." 1 By saying this I <lb/>
            effected thus much-that Planetiades walked out through <lb/>
            the folding-doors without saying a word.</p>
          <p>VIII. There was a silence for a short time, when Am­ <lb/>
            monius addressing himself to me said, " Take heed, Lam­ <lb/>
            prias, to what we are doing, and look carefully to the <note type="footnote"> I Or perhaps " refraining from abusive language." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            argument, as to how we drop the god out of the case. For <lb/>
            he that supposes the extinct oracles to have failed from <lb/>
            some other " reason otherwise than the will of the gods <lb/>
            incurs the suspicion of believing that they did not arise, <lb/>
            nor had their being through the agency of the gods, but <lb/>
            through some third means, since there is no greater and <lb/>
            stronger power to take away and extinguish prophecy, it <lb/>
            being an operation of the deity. The argument of Plane­ <lb/>
            tiades does not satisfy me for many reasons, especially for <lb/>
            the inconsistency which he imputes to the god in his, at <lb/>
            some places, turning his back upon Vice, and denying it <lb/>
            admission to his presence, whilst in other places he admits <lb/>
            her, just as though some king or tyrant should shut out <lb/>
            the wicked at one door, but admit them at the other and <lb/>
            do business with them. But as for the cause-the greatest, <lb/>
            satisfactory, nowhere extravagant, everywhere sufficient, <lb/>
            reason, and above all others suitable to the character of the <lb/>
            gods, is if one should assume this for the final cause, and say <lb/>
            that in the general depopulation which the former factions <lb/>
            and wars have brought about over nearly all the world, <lb/>
            Greece has had the largest share, so that she, taken alto­ <lb/>
            gether, can hardly raise three thousand fighting men, the <lb/>
            same number that the single town of Megara sent to <lb/>
            Plateae, and that the fact, therefore, that many oracles of <lb/>
            the gods are become extinct is nothing else than a proof <lb/>
            of the desolation of Greece. I would grant him the credit <lb/>
            of exactly hitting the mark. For what use would be an <lb/>
            oracle in Tegyrae, as there formerly was, or at Ptoum, <lb/>
            where now it would take you a good part of a day to meet <lb/>
            a man keeping of sheep! For certainly the latter place, <lb/>
            though the most ancient in point of time, and the most <lb/>
            celebrated by fame, according to report has now been long <lb/>
            deserted and unapproachable in consequence of a terrible <lb/>
            animal, a dragon that haunts it, which they improperly <lb/>
            assume as the cause, though it is the converse, for it is the <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            desertion that brought the creature thither, and not the <lb/>
            creature has caused the desertion of the place. For at <lb/>
            what time, as it so pleased God, Greece was strong in cities, <lb/>
            and the place1 was thronged with people, they used to <lb/>
            employ two prophetesses, sitting in turn, whilst a third was <lb/>
            appointed as assistant to them. At present, there is a <lb/>
            single prophetess, and we do not grumble, for she is <lb/>
            amply sufficient for those that want her services. We <lb/>
            ought not therefore to make the god in fault, for the ora­ <lb/>
            cular power 2 that still exists and survives is sufficient for <lb/>
            all requirements, and sends away everyone satisfied in what <lb/>
            they demand. Just as Agamemnon employed nine criers <lb/>
            and yet hardly kept the assembly in order, by reason of its <lb/>
            greatness, whereas you will see here in a few days' time a <lb/>
            single voice, in the theatre, making itself audible to all; in <lb/>
            the same way, in those times, did the oracular power use <lb/>
            more voices to speak to more people. But, on the contrary, <lb/>
            one would be surprised at the god's suffering prophecy to <lb/>
            run to waste, like so much water, or else to echo to the <lb/>
            voices of shepherds and their flocks in the loneliness, after <lb/>
            the manner of the rocks."</p>
          <p>IX. When Ammonius had said this, and I remained <lb/>
            silent, Cleombrotus addressing me, observed: " You have <lb/>
            already conceded the point, that the god did both establish <lb/>
            and abolish these oracles here." “ Not so," I replied, " I <lb/>
            assert that no oracle or place of prophecy is abolished <lb/>
            through the fault of the god, but as with many other <lb/>
            things that she makes and provides for us, Nature produces <lb/>
            a wasting away and a deprivation, or to put it better, <lb/>
            Matter being itself a deprivation, reverts to itself, and dis- <note type="footnote"> I Should read " this place," Delphi, the scene of the dialogue. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. the intoxicating exhalation from the Delphic Cave was as <lb/>
            powerful as formerly—an important notice, as refuting the story that it <lb/>

            buked him for his matricide. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            solves what was made by the Better Cause ; and thus ob­ <lb/>
            scurations and extinctions of oracular powers are brought <lb/>
            about, inasmuch as God giveth many good things to men, <lb/>
            but not one that is everlasting, so that' the things of the <lb/>
            gods do die, but not God,’ as Sophocles hath it. Their <lb/>
            essence and their operation, such as be knowing in Nature <lb/>
            and in Matter ought to investigate, their final cause being, <lb/>
            as is right, reserved for God. For it is silly, and very <lb/>
            childish to suppose that the god, like the ventriloquist <lb/>
            spirits formerly called ‘ Eurycles' now ‘ Pythons,' enters <lb/>
            into the bodies of the prophets and makes proclamation, <lb/>
            employing their mouths and voices in the way of instru­ <lb/>
            ments ; for in mixing Himself up with human means, He <lb/>
            does not respect His own majesty, neither does He main­ <lb/>
            tain His dignity, nor the superiority of His being."</p>
          <p>X. Then Cleombrotus: " You say right; but since the <lb/>
            assuming and defining how and how for we must employ <lb/>
            the idea of a providence, is a difficult thing, whilst some <lb/>
            make out the Deity to be simply the author of nothing at all, <lb/>
            others, of all things universally, they miss what is reason­ <lb/>
            able and proper. Now, they say well who say that Plato <lb/>
            having discovered the element that is the subject of the <lb/>
            existing qualities (to which element they nowadays give <lb/>
            the name of Matter, or Nature), has delivered philosophers <lb/>
            from many and great difficulties. But to me those men <lb/>
            appear to have solved more and greater difficulties who <lb/>
            have made out a family of Dcemons, intermediate between <lb/>
            gods and men, and after a certain fashion bringing together <lb/>
            and uniting in one the society of both; whether this doc­ <lb/>
            trine belong to the Magi and the followers of Zoroaster, or <lb/>
            is a Thracian one coming from Orpheus, or Egyptian, or <lb/>
            Phrygian, as we may infer from the rites which point in <lb/>
            either direction, for we perceive many things belonging to <lb/>
            death, and of lugubrious sort in the orgies done and the <lb/>
            ceremonies performed of the Greeks. Homer appears to have <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            used both names indifferently, in some places calling the <lb/>
            gods ‘ dæmons;’ Hesiod, however, was the first clearly and <lb/>
            distinctly to make four species of rational beings-gods, <lb/>
            then daemons ‘ numerous and beneficent,' then heroes, <lb/>
            lastly men, the demigods being ranged in the class of <lb/>
            heroes. Others make out a change in the bodies equally <lb/>
            with the souls, in the same way as water is seen to be pro­ <lb/>
            duced from earth, air from water, fire from air, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the essence tending upwards, so from men to <lb/>
            heroes, from heroes to daemons, souls of the better kind go <lb/>
            through a transition. Of daemons, some few in long pro­ <lb/>
            cess of time, having been thoroughly purified by means of <lb/>
            virtue, become partakers of divinity; whilst with others it <lb/>
            comes to pass that they do not contain themselves, but <lb/>
            becoming relaxed and dissolved again into mortal bodies, <lb/>
            they receive an existence without light and without form, <lb/>
            like an exhalation. But Hesiod is of opinion that after <lb/>
            certain periods of time daemons themselves have an end, <lb/>
            for he says, speaking in the person of the Naiad and even <lb/>
            obscurely defining the period :— <lb/>
            , Nine generations lives the noisy Crow <lb/>
            Of lusty men: four times the crow the Stag. <lb/>
            Three stags outlives the Raven : but the Phoenix <lb/>
            Nine times the raven : ten phenices we <lb/>
            The long-haired Nymphs, daughters of mighty Jove.' <lb/>
            This space is calculated at a vast extent of time by people <lb/>
            incorrectly understanding the word ‘ generation' (for it <lb/>
            really means a year), so that they make the total duration <lb/>
            of the life of daemons to be nine thousand seven hundred and <lb/>
            twenty years. Most mathematicians assign them a shorter <lb/>
            duration, none a longer. Pindar hath said in verse, <lb/>
            ‘ Nymphs that have allotted them a term of life equal to a <lb/>
            tree's;' for which cause, too, people call them ‘ Hama­ <lb/>
            dryads and whilst he was still speaking, Demetrius in­ <lb/>
            terrupting him said, “How do you mean, Cleombrotus, <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            that' a generation of man' means a year, for such a period <lb/>
            is neither that of a life that is ‘young,’ or that is ‘ old,' as <lb/>
            some people read the passage? But those who read <lb/>
            ‘ young,’ reckon the generation at thirty years, according <lb/>
            to Heraclitus, in which space of time, he who has begotten <lb/>
            furnishes that which has sprung from himself capable of <lb/>
            propagation in its own turn; whilst they who read ‘ old' in <lb/>
            the place of ‘ young,’ assign one hundred and eight years <lb/>
            to a generation, on the ground that fifty and four years are <lb/>
            the mark of the middle of human life, being a number <lb/>
            made up out of unity, the two first even numbers, two <lb/>
            squares, and two cubes,1 which calculations Plato too has <lb/>
            accepted in his ‘ Generation of Souls.' But the whole <lb/>
            story of Hesiod's seems to have an obscure allusion to the <lb/>
            general conflagration, when it is natural to suppose that <lb/>
            together with all things moist the Nymphs shall come to <lb/>
            an end :­ <lb/>
            ‘ Who haunt the beauteous groves, <lb/>
            The river-fountains and the grassy meads.’ ”</p>
          <p>XII. " I hear," replied Cleombrotus," the same story from <lb/>
            many people, and I behold the Stoical ‘ general conflagra­ <lb/>
            tion,' as it devours the verses of Heraclitus and of Orpheus, <lb/>
            at the same time attacking the lines of Hesiod: but I do <lb/>
            not put up with talk about the destruction of the universe, <lb/>
            and as for things impossible, particularly stories about <lb/>
            the Crow and the Deer 2 For the year3 does <lb/>
            not supply all at once within itself (its course) every <lb/>
            thing that the seasons bring forth, and the earth produces, <lb/>
            neither is it called a “ generation " according to the rule <note type="footnote"> 1 1+2+4+4+9+8+27 = 55, not 54; but this is near enough <lb/>
            for the argument. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This passage is hopelessly corrupt, but seems to have implied that <lb/>

            with mankind. For you admit, I suppose, that Hesiod <lb/>
            calls a man's lifetime a ' generation,' is it not so ? " De­ <lb/>
            metrius assented. " But this also is evident," Cleombrotus <lb/>
            went on, " that both the measure and the things measured <lb/>
            are called by the same names: for example, the pint, the <lb/>
            quart, the cask, the butt, according to which rule there­ <lb/>
            fore, Unity, which is the smallest measure and beginning <lb/>
            of all number, we call ‘ number.' In the same manner, <lb/>
            the year by which first we measure the life of man, the <lb/>
            poet has styled 'a generation,' as synonymous with the <lb/>
            thing measured. For what those philosophers take for <lb/>
            their numbers in this calculation have nothing in them, as <lb/>
            numbers, of what is considered striking and conspicuous, <lb/>
            whereas he has got his nine thousand seven hundred and <lb/>
            twenty by the product of the four numbers following, unity <lb/>
            being made successively four times four, these being four <lb/>
            times squared produce the sum specified. But on these <lb/>
            points it is not necessary for us to argue with Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, for if the time be more or if it be less, if it be <lb/>
            fixed or if it be indefinite, in which the soul of a daemon <lb/>
            comes to an end, and the life of a hero also, the thing at <lb/>
            which he if aiming will be proved for him all the same, <lb/>
            and by testimony the most clear and ancient, namely, that <lb/>
            beings exist, as it were, in the intermediate place between <lb/>
            gods and men, that are susceptible of mortal vicissitudes <lb/>
            and of involuntary changes, whom it is right for us, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the law of our fathers, to regard as and name ‘ dæ­ <lb/>
            mons,' and to hold in reverence.</p>
          <p>XIII. " As an illustration of the subject, Xenocrates the <lb/>
            friend of Plato, has taken the different kinds of Triangles, <lb/>
            comparing the equilateral to the divine, the scalene to the <lb/>
            mortal, the isosceles to the nature of daemons. For the first <lb/>
            is equal every way, the second unequal every way, the third <lb/>
            equal in one way, unequal in another, just as the being of <lb/>
            daemons, which has in it mortal passions and divine power. <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            And nature has produced sensible images and visible like­ <lb/>
            nesses of the gods in the sun and stars, of men in flashes <lb/>
            of light, comets, and falling meteors, as Euripides hath <lb/>
            said in his verse: <lb/>
            ‘ The man erst sturdy, like some falling star <lb/>
            Is clean gone out, leaving his breath in air.' <lb/>
            But as a mixed body, and truly a copy of a daemon, she <lb/>
            (Nature) exhibits to us the moon, through her resembling <lb/>
            the revolution (cycles) of the class, and her being subject <lb/>
            to visible decrements, augmentations, and changes; from <lb/>
            seeing which, some have called her an ‘ earthy star,' some <lb/>
            a ‘ heavenly earth,' others the ‘ province of Hecate,' who <lb/>
            is at once celestial and infernal. For just as if one should <lb/>
            take away the Air, and withdraw that which is between the <lb/>
            earth and moon, he would destroy the unity and the con­ <lb/>
            nexion of the universe, because a void and disunited space <lb/>
            would be made in the middle ; similarly they who do not <lb/>
            admit the existence of the order of daemons, necessarily <lb/>
            make gods and men out as having no intercourse and no <lb/>
            compact with each other, by taking away the ‘ interpreting <lb/>
            and communicating being,' as Plato calls it; or else they <lb/>
            force us to mix up and huddle all things together by mak­ <lb/>
            ing the Deity enter into human passions and affairs, and <lb/>
            drawing him down to our wants, just as the Thessalian <lb/>
            women are said to do the moon. But the craft of the latter <lb/>
            received confirmation amongst women, when Aglaonice, <lb/>
            daughter of Hegetor, as they tell, being one skilled in as­ <lb/>
            trology, did always, during an eclipse of the moon, pretend <lb/>
            to use enchantment and draw her down. Let us, then, <lb/>
            neither listen to people saying that oracles are not divinely <lb/>
            inspired, or that certain ceremonies and wild rites are un­ <lb/>
            heeded by the gods; nor, on the other hand, let us imagine <lb/>
            that the Deity goes up and down, and is present at, and <lb/>
            assists in, things of the sort; but as is right and proper, <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            let us assign these operations to agents, or as it were, ser­ <lb/>
            vants and clerks of the gods, and believe in daemons, presid­ <lb/>
            ing over the performers in the divine rites and mysteries, <lb/>
            whilst others go about as punishers of the proud and <lb/>
            mighty sinners: some of them Hesiod has styled, very <lb/>
            solemnly, <lb/>
            ' Of wealth the pure and sanctified bestowers, <lb/>
            Whoso royal privilege is this to do,’ <lb/>
            as though doing good were part of the kingly office. For <lb/>
            in daemons, as in men, there are degrees of virtue; some <lb/>
            having but a feeble and obscure trace, as it were a rem­ <lb/>
            nant, of the part subject to passion and destitute of reason, <lb/>
            whilst others have in them a large and scarcely extinguish­ <lb/>
            able portion of the same, the vestiges and symbols of which <lb/>
            ceremonies, sacrifices, and legends do in many places pre­ <lb/>
            serve and lock up interspersed amongst their own pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings."</p>
          <p>XIV. " Now with respect to matters belonging to the <lb/>
            Mysteries, in which one can obtain the plainest manifesta­ <lb/>
            tions, and hints of the truth respecting daemons, ‘ let a <lb/>
            bridle be set upon my tongue,' as Herodotus hath it; but <lb/>
            as for festivals and sacrifices, as well as inauspicious and <lb/>
            mourning days, upon which the eating of raw flesh, and the <lb/>
            tearing to pieces of victims, as also fastings and beatings <lb/>
            of the breast are in use, and again in many places, abusive <lb/>
            language at the sacrifices and other mad doings attended <lb/>
            with tumult and head-tossing, all which I should say they <lb/>
            perform for the sake of no one of the gods, but for the <lb/>
            purpose of turning away wicked spirits, as being actions <lb/>
            propitiatory and soothing to the same. And the human <lb/>
            sacrifices offered of old, it is not credible that it was the <lb/>
            gods who demanded and accepted them; neither would <lb/>
            kings and chiefs have vainly submitted to give up their <lb/>
            own children, to cut off their hair as a preliminary, and to <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            slaughter them, but that they were averting and satiating <lb/>
            the rage of certain malignant and hardly pacified evil genii, <lb/>
            and satisfying of some the furious and imperious lusts, <lb/>
            that were neither able nor willing to have intercourse with <lb/>
            living bodies, and by the instruments of bodies. But like <lb/>
            as Hercules besieged Oechalia for the sake of a maid, so <lb/>
            do powerful and impetuous daemons, when craving for a <lb/>
            human soul yet enveloped in a body, and unable to have <lb/>
            intercourse with it by the organs of the body, bring upon <lb/>
            cities pestilences and barrenness of the earth, and stir up <lb/>
            wars and seditions until, they get and obtain what they <lb/>
            lust after. Some people, on the contrary (as I observed <lb/>
            when spending a considerable time in Crete), celebrate an <lb/>
            absurd festival, in which they exhibit the headless figure <lb/>
            of a man, and say that this was Molos, father of Meriones, <lb/>
            who, lying with a nymph against her will, found himself <lb/>
            without his head.</p>
          <p>XV. And again, all the stories they tell and sing of in <lb/>
            legends and hymns, here the rapes, there the wanderings, <lb/>
            the hidings, and banishments, and servitudes, are not of <lb/>
            the gods, but are the sufferings and vicissitudes of daemons, <lb/>
            converted into legends on account of the superiority and <lb/>
            power of these beings, and neither has Æschylus said,1 <lb/>
            ‘ Apollo pure, from heaven a banished god ;’ <lb/>
            nor the Admetus of Sophocles, <lb/>
            ‘ My consort made him labour at the mill.' <lb/>
            But the farthest of all from the truth wander the theolo­ <lb/>
            gians of Delphi, in believing that the battle took place <lb/>
            there between the god and serpent for possession of the <lb/>
            Oracle; and in allowing historians and poets to tell the <lb/>
            tale, when contending for the prize in the theatres, as <lb/>
            though purposely bearing witness against their own pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings at the most sacred rites. But when Philip (for <note type="footnote"> I Of the real Apollo, that is. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            the historian was present) expressed his surprise at this <lb/>
            statement, and inquired upon what deities 1 he supposed <lb/>
            the actors in the theatre declaimed ? ‘ upon those,' replied <lb/>
            he, ‘ that belong to this Oracle, into whose mysteries the <lb/>
            city lately initiated all the Greeks dwelling beyond Pylæ, <lb/>
            and marched out as far as Tempe. For the nest of faggots <lb/>
            that is built up here around the threshing floor every tenth <lb/>
            year is not a memorial of the subterraneous lurking hole <lb/>
            of the Serpent, but of the habitation of some tyrant or <lb/>
            king. The procession also made to it in silence along the <lb/>
            road called ‘ Doloneia,' in which they conduct, with lighted <lb/>
            torches and in a zigzag course (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀίολυ</foreign>), the virgin with both <lb/>
            parents living, and having set fire to the nest, and over­ <lb/>
            turning the table, they fly without looking back, through <lb/>
            the gates of the Temple; and finally, the wanderings up <lb/>
            and down, and the servitude of the boy, as also the rites of <lb/>
            purification at Tempe, all raise a suspicion of some great <lb/>
            crime or atrocity thereby implied. For it is utterly ridi­ <lb/>
            culous to suppose, my good friend, that Apollo after slay­ <lb/>
            ing the reptile, fled away to the other end of Greece, seek­ <lb/>
            ing after purification, and caused a few pitchers to be <lb/>
            poured over him, and did all the other things people do <lb/>
            when they wish to propitiate and end the wrath of the dæ­ <lb/>
            mono whom they call ‘ Alastors' and ‘ avengers of blood,' <lb/>
            as if they were following up the recollections of some never <lb/>
            to-be-forgotten and antique atrocities. As for the tale I <lb/>
            have heard long ago about the ‘ Flight,' and the ‘ Change <lb/>
            of place," it is terribly absurd and marvellous, but if it <lb/>
            contains some portion of truth, let us not think it was <lb/>
            something trifling and commonplace that was done with <lb/>
            respect to the Oracle in those ancient times. But that I <lb/>
            may not appear to be as Empedocles says, ‘to be fitting 2 <note type="footnote"> 1 The real object of their verses and declamations was not the god, <lb/>
            but the genii who haunted Delphi. </note><note type="footnote"> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσάπτωνι</foreign>n text, must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσάπτειν</foreign> </note> <lb/>

            the heads of one set of fables to another set, and not to <lb/>
            follow one path in my discourse,' permit me to put the <lb/>
            proper end to the first discussion, for now we are arrived <lb/>
            at it; and let me be bold enough to say, as many have <lb/>
            already done, that together with the extinction of the dæ­ <lb/>
            mons appointed to preside over oracles and places of pro­ <lb/>
            phecy, this sort of thing does likewise come to an end, and <lb/>
            lose their force when the spirits aforesaid either'flee from <lb/>
            or change the place, and then, after a long interval, when <lb/>
            they return, the places give out a sound like organs when <lb/>
            those that play thereon are present and stand over them."</p>
          <p>XVI. When Cleombrotus had finished thus, Heracleon <lb/>
            said : " There is no one present of such as be profane, un­ <lb/>
            initiated, and holding opinions about the gods, unconge­ <lb/>
            nial with your own; but yet, my dear Philip, we must <lb/>
            take heed to ourselves, lest we unconsciously assume ab­ <lb/>
            surd, and very extravagant hypotheses to support the <lb/>
            argument." " Well said," replied Philip, " but, what is it <lb/>
            in the opinions expressed by Cleombrotus, that particu­ <lb/>
            larly displeases you?" " The remark," replied Heracleon, <lb/>
            " that it is not the gods (whom it is right to relieve-keep <lb/>
            distinct-from matters pertaining to earth), but daemons <lb/>
            subserving to them, seems to me a reasonable postulate <lb/>
            enough; but to take these daemons, all but bodily, out of <lb/>
            the verses of Empedocles, and impute to these some dæ­ <lb/>
            mons' sins committed, calamities endured, wanderings im­ <lb/>
            posed by heaven, and finally to suppose in their case deaths, <lb/>
            as if they were mere men, seems to me too bold and un­ <lb/>
            civilized a theory." Hereupon, Cleombrotus inquired of <lb/>
            Philip, who and whence the young man was that had just <lb/>
            spoken, and having learnt his name and country answered: <lb/>
            “ We do not, Heracleon, conceal from ourselves that we <lb/>
            are fallen into a strange line of argument; but in the case of <lb/>
            great subjects, it is not possible, without making use of <lb/>
            great assumptions, to arrive at an end consistent with our <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            expectation. But you yourself do not perceive that you are <lb/>
            retracting what you concede, for you allow there are dæ­ <lb/>
            mons ; but by your claiming that there are none bad, nor <lb/>
            yet subject to mortality, you no longer keep your daemons; <lb/>
            for in what respect do they differ from gods, if in regard <lb/>
            to essence they possess immortality, and in regard to vir­ <lb/>
            tue, freedom from passion and immunity from sin."</p>
          <p>XVII. Thereupon, whilst Heracleon was considering <lb/>
            something with himself in silence, Cleombrotus continued, <lb/>
            " Nay, but not only Empedocles has bequeathed to us evil <lb/>
            daemons that be evil by nature, but Plato, too, has done <lb/>
            the same, as well as Xenocrates and Chrysippus; besides, <lb/>
            Democritus, when he prays that ‘ he may meet with aus­ <lb/>
            picious idola' (apparitions), shows plainly that he knows <lb/>
            of others that have morose and mischievous dispositions <lb/>
            and inclinations. But with respect to the mortality of <lb/>
            beings of the kind, I have heard a tale from a man who is <lb/>
            neither a fool nor an idle talker-from that Æmilian the <lb/>
            rhetorician, whom some of you know well; Epitherses was <lb/>
            his father, a townsman of mine, and a teacher of grammar. <lb/>
            This man (the latter) said, that once upon a time he made <lb/>
            a voyage to Italy, and embarked on board a ship con­ <lb/>
            veying merchandise and several passengers. When it was <lb/>
            now evening, off the Echinad Islands, the wind dropped, <lb/>
            and the ship, carried by the current, was come near Paxi; <lb/>
            most of the passengers were awake, and many were still <lb/>
            drinking, after having had supper. All of a sudden, a <lb/>
            voice was heard from the Isle of Paxi, of some one calling <lb/>
            ‘ Thamus ' with so loud a cry as to fill them with amaze­ <lb/>
            ment. This Thaumus was an Egyptian pilot, known by <lb/>
            name to many of those on board. Called twice, he kept <lb/>
            silence; but on the third summons he replied to the caller, <lb/>
            and the latter, raising yet higher his voice, said, ‘When <lb/>
            thou comest over against Palodes, announce that the great <lb/>
            Pan is dead.' All, upon hearing this, said Epitherses, <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            were filled with consternation, and debated with them­ <lb/>
            selves whether it were better to do as ordered, or not to <lb/>
            make themselves too busy, and to let it alone. So Thamus <lb/>
            decided that if there should be a wind he would sail past <lb/>
            and hold his tongue; but should there fall a calm and <lb/>
            smooth sea off the island, he would proclaim what he had <lb/>
            heard. When, therefore, they were come over against Pa­ <lb/>
            lodes, there being neither wind nor swell of sea, Thamus, <lb/>
            looking out from the stern, called out to the land what he <lb/>
            had heard, namely, ‘ That the great Pan is dead:' and <lb/>
            hardly had he finished speaking than there was a mighty <lb/>
            cry, not of one, but of many voices mingled together in <lb/>
            wondrous manner. And inasmuch as many persons were <lb/>
            then present, the story got spread about in Rome, and <lb/>
            Thamus was sent for by Tiberius Cæsar ; and Tiberius gave <lb/>
            so much credence to the tale that he made inquiry and re­ <lb/>
            search concerning this Pan ; and that the learned men <lb/>
            about him, who were numerous, conjectured he was the <lb/>
            one that was born from Hermes and Penelope."</p>
          <p>Now, Philip found amongst those present witnesses to <lb/>
            the truth of the story, who had heard it from the aged <lb/>
            Æmilian.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Demetrius said, that of the islands lying round <lb/>
            Britain, there were many desert, and scattered about, some <lb/>
            of which were named after dæmons and heroes ; and that <lb/>
            he, for the purpose of inquiry and investigation, sailed, by <lb/>
            the emperor's order,1 to that which lay nearest of the desert <lb/>
            isles, which had but a few inhabitants, and those religious <lb/>
            men, and held sacred by the Britons. Just after his land- <note type="footnote"> I This emperor must be Trajan, as Demetrius was just returned from <lb/>
            Britain at the time of the dialogue. The island, as lying nearest to the <lb/>
            coast, must have been Anglesey, the focus of Druid ism. If Æmilian <lb/>
            was an " old man " when he told the story just quoted, and his father <lb/>
            had flourished under Tiberius. this dialogue comes down to the end of <lb/>
            the first century. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            ing, there occurred a great tumult in the air, and many <lb/>
            meteors, and blasts of wind burst down, and whirlwinds <lb/>
            descended. But when it was calm again, the islanders <lb/>
            said, that the extinction had taken place of some one of <lb/>
            the superior powers, for as (said they) a lamp when burn­ <lb/>
            ing does no harm, but being put out is noxious to many <lb/>
            people,' in like manner great souls, when first kindled, are <lb/>
            benignant and harmless, whilst their going out and disso­ <lb/>
            lution, often, as in the present case, stirs up stormy winds, <lb/>
            and aerial tumults ; nay, often infects the air with pesti. <lb/>
            lential tendencies. In that region also, they said, Saturn <lb/>
            was confined in one of the islands by Briareus, and lay <lb/>
            asleep; for that his slumber had been artfully produced <lb/>
            in order to chain him, and round about him were many <lb/>
            daemons for his guards and servants."</p>
          <p>XIX. Then Cleombrotus, taking him up, said : " I, too, <lb/>
            have something of the same sort to narrate, and it suffices <lb/>
            for the supposition, that there is nothing that is con­ <lb/>
            trary to, or prevents these things being so constituted. <lb/>
            And yet the Stoics, we know, hold the same opinion that <lb/>
            you mention, not only as regards the daemons, but also of <lb/>
            the gods, so numerous as they be; they keep One as the <lb/>
            Eternal and Incorruptible, but believe that the others are <lb/>
            both born and die. As for the jeers and scoffs of the <lb/>
            Epicureans, we must by no means be afraid of them, for <lb/>
            such (weapons) they employ against Divine Providence, also <lb/>
            making it out to be a fable. But we say their own igno­ <lb/>
            rance is a fable that has, amongst so many worlds, not one <lb/>
            that is guided by Divine order, but all of them spon­ <lb/>
            taneously created and put together. But if we must laugh <lb/>
            in matter of philosophy, we ought to laugh at their spectra, <lb/>
            which, being both dumb, blind, and lifeless, where do they <lb/>
            remain2 during infinite periods of time ? making their ap- <note type="footnote"> I Lucretius mentions that the fumes of a smouldering lamp-wick <lb/>

            pearance, and roaming about everywhere–spectra thrown <lb/>
            off, partly from persons yet living, partly from those long <lb/>
            ago reduced to ashes, or mouldered into dust, whilst their <lb/>
            inventors drag bubbles and shadows into the domains of <lb/>
            Natural History, and go into a rage1 if any one says there <lb/>
            are daemons, not only by nature, but by report, and that <lb/>
            they possess the power of preserving themselves and last­ <lb/>
            ing for an immense time."</p>
          <p>XX. After these things had been said, Ammonius went <lb/>
            on: “ Theophrastus seems to me to have given sentence <lb/>
            rightly,2 for what objection is there to accepting a senti­ <lb/>
            ment at once noble and in the highest degree philo­ <lb/>
            sophical. Rejecting as it does many of things possible, yet <lb/>
            not capable of being proved, it ignores them entirely; and <lb/>
            being accepted as a rule, will involve many consequences, <lb/>
            both impossible and without any shadow of reality. The <lb/>
            only thing, however, that I have heard Epicureans ad­ <lb/>
            vancing against the daemons introduced by Empedocles– <lb/>
            ‘that it is not conceivable that being wicked and liable to <lb/>
            error, they should be at the same time happy and long­ <lb/>
            lived, inasmuch as wickedness involves the idea of blindness, <lb/>
            and a liability to fall into things destructive’–is a silly <lb/>
            argument. For, according to this way of reasoning, Epi­ <lb/>
            curus is made out worse than Hippias the sophist, and <lb/>
            Metrodorus than Alexis the comedian, for the latter lived <lb/>
            twice as long as Metrodorus, and the former above one­ <lb/>
            third longer than Epicurus. Besides, we say that virtue <lb/>
            is a strong and vice a weak thing, not in reference to any <lb/>
            durability or dissolution of body; for amongst animals <lb/>
            we observe many that be dull and stupid, and again, <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιμαίνουσιν</foreign> is clearly the original reading, and gives the fanny image <lb/>

            others that be lascivious and untameable, live longer <lb/>
            lives than the intelligent and sagacious kinds. Hence, they <lb/>
            do not well to make God's eternity result from the guard­ <lb/>
            ing against and repulsion of the causes of destruction; <lb/>
            because the freedom from passion and from corruptibility <lb/>
            must necessarily exist in the nature of the Blessed One, <lb/>
            and stand in need of no exertion on his part. But, per­ <lb/>
            haps, to talk of people behind their backs is not very <lb/>
            polite; and therefore Cleombrotus, who lately dropped the <lb/>
            word about the ‘ flight and migration of dæmons,’ has a <lb/>
            right to resume the subject."</p>
          <p>XXI. Then Cleombrotus: " I shall be surprised if it <lb/>
            does not strike you as even stranger than what has already <lb/>
            been advanced by me; and yet it appears to be connected <lb/>
            with Natural History, and Plato even has allowed its <lb/>
            possibility-not that he has stated it directly, but from a <lb/>
            vague supposition, and throwing out an enigmatical hint <lb/>
            in a cautious manner-but, nevertheless, a great outcry <lb/>
            was made against it by the other philosophers, and seeing <lb/>
            that a bowl of mingled fables and facts is set before us, <lb/>
            and, possibly, some one amongst our kinder listeners, as <lb/>
            though he had met with foreign coins, will put these same <lb/>
            stories to the touchstone. I do not scruple to present you <lb/>
            with the narrative of a man, a barbarian, whom I hardly <lb/>
            found out after long wanderings, and paying heavily for <lb/>
            information, who made his appearance once every year <lb/>
            among the tribes living round the Red Sea, and spent the <lb/>
            rest of his time in company with the pastoral nymphs, and <lb/>
            with the daemons, as he asserted, and with whom I <lb/>
            obtained a conference and friendly reception. He was the <lb/>
            handsomest of all men to look at, lived ever free from all <lb/>
            disease, eating once a month the fruit of a certain herb <lb/>
            that was like a drug 1 and bitter to taste. He understood <note type="footnote"> 1 The chewing of betel-nut may be at the bottom of this story, and <lb/>
            the man a Buddhist hermit. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            several languages, but to me he chiefly spake Doric,1 not <lb/>
            far removed from poetry. Whilst he was speaking, per-, <lb/>
            fume filled the air, from his mouth sending forth the <lb/>
            sweetest smell. His other learning and recollections con­ <lb/>
            tinued with him the whole time ; but as regards prophecy <lb/>
            he was inspired but for one day in each year, at which <lb/>
            time he went down to the sea and delivered his predic­ <lb/>
            tions, and nobles and secretaries of different princes <lb/>
            flocked to hear him, and then sailed away. His inspira­ <lb/>
            tion he ascribed to daemons. He talked with much <lb/>
            pleasure about Delphi; as for the things related concerning <lb/>
            Dodona, and the rites performed there he was ignorant of <lb/>
            none; he said they all were the mighty workings of <lb/>
            daemons, and the same respecting the Python, and that the <lb/>
            slayer of the Python did not suffer an exile of nine years, <lb/>
            or to the distance of Tempe; but that being expelled <lb/>
            thence he went into another world, and there abode for <lb/>
            the revolutions of nine Great Years, until at length <lb/>
            having become pure, and really ‘ bright' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φο</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">βος</foreign>) he <lb/>
            returned, and received possession of the Oracle, which had <lb/>
            in the meanwhile been taken care of by Themis. Of the <lb/>
            same nature was the story of Typhon; and the affair of <lb/>
            the Titans was only the fights of daemons against daemons, <lb/>
            succeeded by the fleeing away of the vanquished ; or else <lb/>
            the punishment taken by a god upon such as had offended <lb/>
            in the same way that Typhon is said to have sinned against <lb/>
            Osiris, and Saturn against Uranus ; of both of whom the <lb/>
            honours have consequently become tarnished; or else <lb/>
            these legends refer to such as have completely migrated to <lb/>
            another world,; since I learn that the Solymi, neighbours <lb/>
            of the Lyceans, pay the highest honours to Saturn; 2 but <note type="footnote"> I The popular dialect at Alexandria, which was peopled by emigrants <lb/>

            when, after killing their chiefs, Arsilas, Dryos, and Tro. <lb/>
            sobeos, he fled away, and migrated somewhere or other, <lb/>
            (for I cannot tell you this), he is neglected, and the <lb/>
            Lycians call Arsilas and his companions hard-hearted <lb/>
            gods, and utter solemn imprecations upon this crime, both <lb/>
            in public and in private. Many like instances to these <lb/>
            you can extract out of religious legends. And if we <lb/>
            designate daemons by the customary names of the gods, <lb/>
            there is nothing to be surprised at in our so doing (said <lb/>
            the stranger), since to whatever god each daemon is <lb/>
            assigned, and from whom he derives his power and <lb/>
            privileges, after this one he is wont to be called. For <lb/>
            amongst ourselves one man is ‘ Dims,' another ‘ Ath­ <lb/>
            enæus,’ another ‘ Apollonius * or ‘ Dionysius * or ‘ Her­ <lb/>
            maeus,’ but only some few are by accident properly so en­ <lb/>
            titled, the most part have taken possession of the names <lb/>
            of gods far from appropriately, in fact quite the reverse."</p>
          <p>XXII. And when Cleombrotus had done speaking, his <lb/>
            story appeared to all a strange one. But on Heracleon's <lb/>
            asking whereabouts in Plato these things are to be found, <lb/>
            and in what way he had afforded a foundation for the <lb/>
            argument, Cleombrotus replied : " You do well to remind <lb/>
            me; for Plato from the first acknowledged the plurality of <lb/>
            worlds, but with respect to their precise number he re­ <lb/>
            mained in doubt: and though as far as five he conceded <lb/>
            the probability, to humour such as supposed one world for <lb/>
            each element-yet he confined himself to a single one. <lb/>
            And this appears to be peculiar to Plato, for the others <lb/>
            were terribly alarmed at the notion of a plurality, as <lb/>
            though when they did not limit the number to one, but <lb/>
            went farther, an indefinite and perplexing infinity would <lb/>
            take them up." " But," said I, " did the stranger decide <lb/>
            about the plurality of worlds in the same way as does <lb/>
            Plato, at what time you were in his company,1 or dil you <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄθενεὖ</foreign> kyyvov in text, must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτε συνεγένου</foreign>, </note> <lb/>

            fail to put the question to him ? " "I was not likely," <lb/>
            replied Cleombrotus, " not to be an inquisitive and glad <lb/>
            hearer of his opinion upon this subject, above all others, <lb/>
            when he gave me the occasion, and showed himself so well <lb/>
            disposed. He told me, in fact, that there were neither an <lb/>
            infinite number of worlds, nor a single one, nor yet five, <lb/>
            but one hundred and eighty-three, arranged in the form <lb/>
            of a triangle, each side of which contains sixty worlds. Of <lb/>
            the remaining three, one is placed at each angle; and those <lb/>
            in line touch each other, revolving gently as if in a dance. <lb/>
            The area within this triangle is the common hearth of <lb/>
            them all, and is named the ‘ Plain of Truth,' in which <lb/>
            the reason, the forms, and the pattern of all things that <lb/>
            have been, and that shall be, are stored up not to be <lb/>
            disturbed; and as eternity dwells around them, from <lb/>
            thence Time, like a stream from a fountain, flows down <lb/>
            upon the worlds. The sight and contemplation of these <lb/>
            things is vouchsafed to the souls of men, once in every ten <lb/>
            thousand years: that is, if they shall have lived a virtuous <lb/>
            life. The best of our initiatory rites here below are the <lb/>
            dreamy shadow of that spectacle, and of that rite; and the <lb/>
            words used therein are ingeniously devised for the purpose <lb/>
            of reminding us of the beauties of that place-or else are <lb/>
            used to no purpose at all.1 All this did I hear him <lb/>
            reciting exactly as though he were so doing at some <lb/>
            ceremony, or rite of initiation, without offering any evidence <lb/>
            or proof of his statements."</p>
          <p>XXIII. Then I, addressing Demetrius, said: " How do <lb/>
            the words of the suitors run, when they are wondering at <lb/>
            Ulysses whilst handling the bow ? ” and when Demetrius <lb/>
            had repeated them,2 I continued: “ The very same thing <note type="footnote"> 1 According to this explanation, the Mysteries taught the theory of <lb/>
            the creation, and of the government and laws of the universe ; a doc­ <lb/>
            trine clearly set forth in Julian’s “ Mother of the Gods.* </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Perhaps he makes bows or perhaps he steals." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            it occurs to me to say with respect to this stranger. Sup­ <lb/>
            posing he were really some seeker after, and pillager of <lb/>
            creeds and legends of all sorts; one much versed in books <lb/>
            of religion; no foreigner at all, but a Greek by birth, and <lb/>
            well-stocked with Grecian learning ? The number of his <lb/>
            worlds betrays him, that being neither Egyptian nor <lb/>
            Indian, but Dorian, and coming out of Sicily, and the pro. <lb/>
            perty of a man of Himera, by name Petron. The treatise of <lb/>
            that philosopher I have not read, nor indeed know whether <lb/>
            it be still extant. But Hippys of Rhegium, whom Phaneas <lb/>
            of Eresos quotes, bears witness that this notion and tale <lb/>
            belongs to Petron, that is, about there being one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and eighty-three worlds, all touching one another <lb/>
            in a row; but what this ‘ touching one another in a row ’ <lb/>
            means, he neither explains, nor adduces anything plausible <lb/>
            in its support." Demetrius taking me up replied: “ What <lb/>
            plausible argument can be found in matters of the sort, <lb/>
            where not even Plato would say anything reasonable or <lb/>
            probable when he commenced the subject." Then Hera­ <lb/>
            cleon: " But again, we hear you grammarians referring <lb/>
            your notions to Homer, as though he divided the Uni­ <lb/>
            verse into Five Worlds ; viz., Heaven, Water, Air, <lb/>
            Earth, Olympus: of which, two he leaves in common; <lb/>
            Earth, belonging to all that is below; Olympus to all <lb/>
            that is above; and the three in the middle are assigned <lb/>
            unto the three gods. In this way, then, Plato appears <lb/>
            to connect the first and most beautiful forms and patterns <lb/>
            of bodies with the divisions of the Universe, and calls <lb/>
            them Five Worlds–viz., that of Earth, that of Water, <lb/>
            that of Air, that of Fire, and last, that which envelopes <lb/>
            them all-namely, that of the Twelve-sided figure, which is <lb/>
            widely diffused and versatile,1 by which supposition, for­ <lb/>
            sooth, he has invented a figure the most appropriate and <note type="footnote"> 1 Julian's <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεμπτὸν, είλιϰτὸν σω̃μα</foreign> : the Quintessence of the later <lb/>
            Aristotelians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            congenial to the revolutions and the movements of souls." <lb/>
            Thereupon Demetrius : " Why do we meddle with Homer <lb/>
            in the present case ? we have had quite enough of fables. <lb/>
            But Plato is very far from calling the five varieties of the <lb/>
            universe Five Worlds-in which he is at war with those <lb/>
            that suppose an infinity of Worlds : in fact he says thus <lb/>
            much–“ that he is of opinion this world is One, the sole <lb/>
            production of God, and satisfying Him; being generated <lb/>
            whole, perfect, and self-sufficient out of the entire Bodily <lb/>
            element." Whence one may well be surprised how he, <lb/>
            after having told the truth, has furnished others with the <lb/>
            grounds of a notion equally improbable and irrational. <lb/>
            For the very fact of not retaining one single world involves <lb/>
            somehow the hypothesis of the Infinity of worlds ; whilst <lb/>
            to make them a definite number, just so many, neither <lb/>
            more nor less than Five, is exceedingly strange, and remote <lb/>
            from all probability-unless you have anything to say to <lb/>
            the contrary," he added, looking at me. “ It seems then, <lb/>
            replied I," that so we have thrown aside the question about <lb/>
            Oracles as entirely concluded, and are taking up another <lb/>
            quite as extensive." “ Not throwing aside the former <lb/>
            question," answered Demetrius, " but not passing over the <lb/>
            present one that equally claims our attention, for we will <lb/>
            not dwell upon it, but only sketch it out sufficiently to <lb/>
            examine its probability, and then pass on to the original <lb/>
            subject of discussion."</p>
          <p>XXIV. " In the first place then (said I) the objections <lb/>
            to supposing an infinity of worlds do not preclude our <lb/>
            supposing there is more than one, for it is possible for <lb/>
            prophecy and foreknowledge to exist in several worlds at <lb/>
            once, and Chance comes into the question very slightly ; <lb/>
            whilst the greatest part of, and those the most important <lb/>
            things, are susceptible of birth and of change, neither of <lb/>
            which does infinity by its nature admit of. In the next <lb/>
            place, it is more consistent with reason to suppose the <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            world neither to be the sole production of God, nor yet <lb/>
            an empty one. For as He is perfectly good, and in no one <lb/>
            virtue wanting, least of all in what concerns justice and <lb/>
            love (for these are the most beautiful of virtues and the <lb/>
            best befitting the Godhead), and as God has nothing in <lb/>
            vain, or not to be put to use, then consequently must exist <lb/>
            other Powers and worlds outside of this, to whom he <lb/>
            extends his communicative virtues. For it is not upon <lb/>
            Himself, nor upon a portion of Himself, that the exercise <lb/>
            of His justice, of his benevolence, or of his goodness, is <lb/>
            directed, but upon others; wherefore it is not probable <lb/>
            t hat He is without a friend, and without a neighbour, nor <lb/>
            that this world tosses about unsocially in a void infinity ; <lb/>
            since we observe that Nature also envelopes things one by <lb/>
            one, as it were in vessels, or in the shells of seeds. For <lb/>
            there is nothing in the number of things that be, neither <lb/>
            is there a Common Reason, (or what receives such designa­ <lb/>
            tion,) that is not of its own nature something acting in <lb/>
            common with something else. Now the world is not pre­ <lb/>
            dicated as ' common,' but it effects whatever it is capable <lb/>
            of, through difference between individual parts; having <lb/>
            itself been created such as it is, homogeneous and of one <lb/>
            species. And if in Nature a single man, or a single horse <lb/>
            has not been produced, nor yet a single star, god, or <lb/>
            daemon-what objection is there to Nature's containing <lb/>
            more worlds than One ? For he that says there is a single <lb/>
            earth overlooks what is self- evident-the circumstance of <lb/>
            similar parts ; for we divide the Earth into parts of the <lb/>
            same name, and the Sea in like manner, whereas a part of <lb/>
            the world is not a world, for the world is made up out of <lb/>
            different parts.</p>
          <p>XXV. " And again, the thing that some people especially <lb/>
            fear, and therefore use up the whole of Matter upon a single <lb/>
            world, in order that nothing may be left outside and either <lb/>
            by its impact or its concussions may disturb the constitu­ <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            tion of this-there is no good cause for such apprehension. <lb/>
            For if there be a, plurality of worlds, and each one has <lb/>
            individually had allotted to it an existence1 and materials <lb/>
            possessing both measure and limitation, there is nothing <lb/>
            left irregular or disorderly, like a superfluity, to dash <lb/>
            against it from external space. For the Reason presiding <lb/>
            over each world, being master of the accumulated Matter, <lb/>
            will allow nothing out of course or running wild, to im­ <lb/>
            pinge upon another; nor yet any such accident from <lb/>
            another world upon itself, by reason that Nature does not <lb/>
            admit of an unlimited and infinite plurality, nor yet an <lb/>
            irrational and irregular movement. And even if any <lb/>
            emanation is carried from one set down to another, it <lb/>
            must be congenial, agreeable, and mixing with them all in <lb/>
            amicable fashion, like the rays and union of the several <lb/>
            stars : whilst they must be delighted themselves in bene­ <lb/>
            volently contemplating each other; whilst to numerous <lb/>
            and good deities presiding over each, they afford the <lb/>
            means of intercourse and hospitality. Nothing of all this <lb/>
            is impossible, or romantic, or inconceivable, unless in truth <lb/>
            some people will regard it with suspicion, after Aristotle's <lb/>
            fashion, because it involves the idea of natural causes. <lb/>
            For as he says: ‘ In the case of bodies, when each one has <lb/>
            its own place, it is a necessary consequence that the Earth <lb/>
            tends from all parts towards the centre, and the Water in <lb/>
            the same way, because by its weight it sinks under the <lb/>
            lighter particles.' If, then, there be several worlds, it will <lb/>
            come to pass that the Earth will be placed frequently <lb/>
            above the Fire and the Air, and as frequently below them ; <lb/>
            and Water and Air will be similarly treated; in some <lb/>
            positions they will be in their natural places, in others in <lb/>
            unnatural, which supposition being impossible (as he <lb/>
            believes) there must be neither two nor several worlds, <note type="footnote"> I The dative of these words must be corrupt, read them in the accus­ <lb/>
            ative. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            but this single One, composed out of all existence, and <lb/>
            filled according to Nature, as is best suited to the varieties <lb/>
            of bodies going to its composition.</p>
          <p>XXVI. “ But this theory, too, is advanced more as a <lb/>
            matter of probability than of certainty. View the matter," <lb/>
            said I, “ my dear Demetrius, in this manner: of bodies, <lb/>
            some have a motion towards the centre, and downwards, <lb/>
            as Aristotle says, some from the centre and upwards, <lb/>
            others round the centre and in a circle; at what point <lb/>
            does he assume his centre ? Not certainly in the vacuum, <lb/>
            for there is no vacuum according to him; for where a va­ <lb/>
            cuum is, it admits of no middle point, neither does it of <lb/>
            first or last, for these are limits, but the infinite is also un­ <lb/>
            limited. And if anyone should endeavour to prove that it <lb/>
            is set in motion by Reason, although it be infinite, what is <lb/>
            the difference in the movements of solid bodies, as com­ <lb/>
            pared with this ? For neither does any force of the bodies <lb/>
            exist in the vacuum, nor do the bodies possess any predis­ <lb/>
            position or property that tends towards the centre, and <lb/>
            converges towards this point from every quarter. But yet <lb/>
            it is impossible to conceive [the tendency] of bodies inani­ <lb/>
            mate towards a place incorporeal, and unaffected by them; <lb/>
            nor how a forward motion by them is produced, or a pre­ <lb/>
            ponderating influence exerted by the other. The alterna­ <lb/>
            tive then remains, that' centre' is used not in the sense <lb/>
            of locality, but of body. For as this world possesses a <lb/>
            single unity and constitution, made up out of many and <lb/>
            dissimilar bodies, these differences necessarily produce <lb/>
            the motions of the several parts towards each other; <lb/>
            since it is evident that the several parts when rearranged <lb/>
            in their essences, will at the same time change their <lb/>
            places also; since their repulsion from the centre will dis­ <lb/>
            tribute in a circle the matter that raises itself upwards; <lb/>
            whereas their mixing together and condensations press the <lb/>
            same matter down, and impel it together towards the centre. <pb n="105"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXVII. " Upon which subjects it is not necessary to <lb/>
            expend more words; for if one should assume that the <lb/>
            Creator is the author of these liabilities and changes, this <lb/>
            cause will confine each world within itself; for each world <lb/>
            contains an earth and a sea; each, also, possesses a centre <lb/>
            and properties and changeabilities of component parts, <lb/>
            and a nature, and a power that keeps in place and pre­ <lb/>
            serves each one. For that which is external-whether it <lb/>
            be nothing at all, or whether it be an unlimited vacuum­ <lb/>
            does not afford a centre, as already stated. And if there <lb/>
            be several worlds, in each one there exists a centre of its <lb/>
            own; so that there is a movement of some bodies towards <lb/>
            it, of others from it, and of others around it, in what man­ <lb/>
            ner they themselves determine. But he who demands that <lb/>
            in the case of several centres, weights should tend down to <lb/>
            a single centre only, differs not at all from one that should <lb/>
            demand that in the case of several men their blood should <lb/>
            all flow together in a single vein from all parts; and that <lb/>
            the brains of all should be enveloped in one and the same <lb/>
            membrane, because he thinks it hard that of things cor­ <lb/>
            poreal and physical the solid parts should not occupy one <lb/>
            and the same place, and the liquid parts another! For <lb/>
            the latter would be absurd in his conception ; and equally <lb/>
            so the man who makes a fuss if things collectively employ <lb/>
            their own parts, which have their natural position and <lb/>
            order inherent in each of them; for it were utterly absurd <lb/>
            should any one assert that there is a world ... contain­ <lb/>
            ing in itself the moon, just as though a man should carry <lb/>
            his brain in his heels and his heart in his temples. But <lb/>
            that in supposing several worlds distinct from each other, <lb/>
            you define and divide their parts in conformity with <lb/>
            the whole, this is not an absurdity: for in each of <note type="footnote"> 1 Something is wanting here; but what follows shows it to have been <lb/>
            an hypothesis of the existence of several worlds depending upon some <lb/>
            common and superior body. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            them the earth, the sea, the sky, will remain, after its <lb/>
            nature, in its fitting place; also, each one of the worlds <lb/>
            has its above, its below, its roundabout centre, not with <lb/>
            reference to any other world, or to what is external, but <lb/>
            contained in itself, and with reference to itself.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. “ The case they put of the stone outside of <lb/>
            the world,' does not easily present an idea either of im­ <lb/>
            mobility or of motion ; for how will it remain motionless, <lb/>
            being possessed of weight, or how will it move towards <lb/>
            the world, like other weights, if it neither is a part <lb/>
            thereof, nor yet constitutionally subordinate to its nature ? <lb/>
            And as for that (nature) which is presented, and contained <lb/>
            within another world, there were no need to discuss, how <lb/>
            it is that it does not pass over netherwards, detaching it­ <lb/>
            self from the mass by reason of its weight,-when we con­ <lb/>
            sider the nature and tension of the bonds whereby each of <lb/>
            the parts is kept together. Since, if we admit the ideas of <lb/>
            above and below, not with reference to the world itself, but <lb/>
            as external to it, we fall into the same difficulties with <lb/>
            Epicurus, when he makes all his ‘ atoms' move towards <lb/>
            the place under his feet, just as though the vacuum had <lb/>
            any feet at all, or infinity allowed one to conceive the ideas <lb/>
            of above and below within itself. For which reason we <lb/>
            have cause to wonder at Chrysippus, or rather, indeed, to <lb/>
            be at a loss to know what possessed him when he supposed <lb/>
            that the world is fixed in the centre, and that its essence <lb/>
            having taken possession of this middle place from all eter­ <lb/>
            nity, has principally worked it up for the object of stability, <lb/>
            and as it were, for incorruptibility. 1 For this very thing <lb/>
            he asserts in his Fourth Book ‘ Upon Possibilities,' where <lb/>
            he is dreaming absurdly about a ‘ centre of infinity,' and <lb/>
            still more preposterously ascribing the efficient cause of <lb/>
            the perpetuity of the world to the ‘ centre that has no be- <note type="footnote"> I i. e. the chief end at which the Essence has been working from <lb/>
            all eternity is the stability and incorruptibility of the world. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            ginning’–and this, too, when he has declared in other <lb/>
            places, and frequently also, ‘ that existence is both regu­ <lb/>
            lated and kept together by motions either tending towards <lb/>
            the centre thereof, or away from the centre.'</p>
          <p>XXIX. " And again, who will be frightened by the objec­ <lb/>
            tions of the stoics, when they ask how will a single Fate <lb/>
            and a single Providence stand, or how will there not be <lb/>
            several Jupiters and several Joves if there be a plurality <lb/>
            of worlds ? 1 In the first place, then, if the notion of there <lb/>
            being several Jupiters and Joves be absurd, surely those <lb/>
            ideas of their own are much more absurd : for suns, and <lb/>
            moons, and Apollos, and Dianas, and Neptunes they sup­ <lb/>
            pose in infinite numbers in their infinite revolutions of <lb/>
            worlds. Secondly, what absolute necessity is there for <lb/>
            there being several Jupiters, if there be a ‘ plurality of <lb/>
            worlds ; and not 2 one Ruler and Director of the Whole <lb/>
            to each-a God possessing Reason and Intelligence, in the <lb/>
            same way as He that is with us, entitled Lord and Father <lb/>
            of all ?' Or what objection is there to all these worlds <lb/>
            being subject to the Fate and the Providence of Jupiter, <lb/>
            and that He should superintend and direct them in turn, <lb/>
            implanting in each and every one of them, final causes, and <lb/>
            germs, and reasons of all things that come to pass therein ? <lb/>
            For, is not one body here below often made up out of <lb/>
            several separate bodies-for example, a popular assembly, <lb/>
            an army, a chorus-to each individual of whom belongs <lb/>
            the faculty of living, of thinking, and of learning, as Chry sip­ <lb/>
            pus believes ; whilst that in the whole universe the worlds, <lb/>
            whether fifty or one hundred in number, should obey or <lb/>
            follow a single Reason, and be administered under one <note type="footnote"> 1 The same difficulty has perplexed modern divines, substituting the <lb/>

            government, is a thing impossible ! But yet such a consti­ <lb/>
            tution as this is exactly adapted to the Divine character. <lb/>
            For we ought not to imagine gods like queen-bees, never <lb/>
            stirring from home, nor yet imprison them by fencing <lb/>
            them round with matter, or rather fencing them in along <lb/>
            with matter, as people do when they make out the gods to be <lb/>
            influences of the atmosphere; and when they invent powers of <lb/>
            Water and of Fire mixed up in the substance, and beget <lb/>
            them along with the world; and, again, burn them up <lb/>
            along with it, as not being removable or free agents, like <lb/>
            charioteers, or pilots: but just as images are nailed up <lb/>
            and soldered down in spite of themselves, so do they make <lb/>
            them out locked up in the corporeal nature, and riveted <lb/>
            down thereto, partners with it even so far as its entire de­ <lb/>
            struction and transformation.</p>
          <p>XXX. “But that opinion, I think, is the more respectable <lb/>
            and dignified, namely, that the gods, being immortal and <lb/>
            independent, in the same way as the Tyndaridae come to <lb/>
            the aid of tempest-tossed mariners, and calm the sea in <lb/>
            spite of itself and the swift blasts of the winds, not that <lb/>
            they themselves go on board the ship, or are partakers in <lb/>
            the peril, but show themselves up aloft, and save it <lb/>
            from destruction-by like manner that the world is put <lb/>
            under gods, a different one to each, who are attracted by <lb/>
            the pleasure of the spectacle, and assist Nature in the <lb/>
            direction of them respectively. For Homer's Jove turns <lb/>
            his eyes, no very great distance, from Troy to the parts of <lb/>
            Thrace and the wandering tribes around the Danube; but <lb/>
            the True One enjoys beautiful and congenial changes of <lb/>
            sights1 in numerous worlds ; He does not behold an infi­ <lb/>

          <p>XXXI. Having spoken thus much I stopped; but Phi­ <lb/>
            lip, after a short interval, replied: “ Whether the truth <lb/>
            about these matters be so, or of a different sort, I will not <lb/>

            us on to assert that it is likely when five bodies with equal <lb/>
            angles, equal sides, and containing equal areas, are gene­ <lb/>
            rated in matter, as a thing of course just so many worlds <lb/>
            must result from them."</p>

             <pb n="110"/>
            seems to me to have followed out the subject in the right <lb/>
            way, when he is explaining the ‘ Mathematics' of Plato: <lb/>
            he argues in this way: ‘ The pyramid, eight-sided figure, <lb/>
            twenty-sided, and twelve-sided, which Plato proposes, are <lb/>
            indeed beautiful things for the symmetry of proportions <lb/>
            and equality ; neither is it left in the power of Nature to <lb/>
            produce, compose, or fit together any other figure better <lb/>
            than, or equal to them. At any rate, all of them have not <lb/>
            got one and the same constitution, neither have they <lb/>
            a similar origin, for the most slender and simplest figure <lb/>
            of all is the Pyramid; the greatest, and made up of the <lb/>
            most parts, is the twelve-sided; of the remaining two, the <lb/>
            twenty-sided is twice as great as the eight-sided figure in <lb/>
            the number of the triangles it contains. Consequently, it <lb/>
            is impossible they derive their origin from one and the <lb/>
            same matter; for the small and thin and more simple in <lb/>
            construction must necessarily be the first to obey whatever <lb/>
            puts in motion and moulds the matter, and be perfected, <lb/>
            and get the start of the more solid and more composite <lb/>
            bodies, amongst which, displaying also a more laborious <lb/>
            construction, is the eight-sided one. It follows from this, <lb/>
            that the only first form is the Pyramid, but none of the <lb/>
            rest, inasmuch as they are inferior to it in the nature of <lb/>
            their generation.' There is, therefore, a remedy for this <lb/>
            difficulty–that is, the division and separation of matter <lb/>
            into Five worlds–one where to place the Pyramid (for <lb/>
            that Plato assumes for the first), another for the Octo­ <lb/>
            hedron, a third for the Eicosihedron. The rest will derive <lb/>
            their generation from the pre-existent element in each, <lb/>
            according to the correspondence of their particles, there <lb/>
            being a transition of all into all, as Plato himself hints, <lb/>
            as he is going through nearly all the particulars: but we <lb/>
            prefer to prove the thing expeditiously. Since Air, when <lb/>
            Fire is extinguished, retires, and when rarefied again gives <lb/>
            out Fire from itself, we must look for the cause of these <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            properties and vicissitudes in each element. The element <lb/>
            of Fire is the Pyramid,1 made up out of the four-and- <lb/>
            twenty primitive triangles ; that of Air is the Octohedron, <lb/>
            made up out of eight-and-forty of the same. One element, <lb/>
            therefore, of Air results from two of Fire, mixed together <lb/>
            and united; that of Air being analysed is divided into two <lb/>
            components of Fire, but being condensed and compressed <lb/>
            into itself it goes off into the form of water. So that in <lb/>
            all cases, the pre-existent thing readily supplies an origin <lb/>
            from chance to the others; and not merely is there one <lb/>
            First element, but since a different one possesses in a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent system an initiative influence, provocative to ge­ <lb/>
            neration, the identity of name is maintained by the <lb/>
            whole."</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Then Ammonius: "This theory has indeed <lb/>
            been worked out by Theodorus with equal courage and <lb/>
            perseverance: yet I should not be surprised if he will be <lb/>
            discovered to employ assumptions that are subversive of <lb/>
            each other. For he assumes that the combination did <lb/>
            not take place with all the five at once, but that the most <lb/>
            subtile, and what was put together with the least amount <lb/>
            of labour, presented itself first for birth. Next, he lays <lb/>
            down as a necessary consequence of this, and not as con­ <lb/>
            tradicting it, that matter did not provide all things with <lb/>
            the more subtile and simple principle; but that, in some <lb/>
            cases, the weighty and composite elements were the first <lb/>
            to come forward in the birth out of matter. Besides this, <lb/>
            after five primitive substances have been assumed, and on <lb/>
            the strength of this assumption, the worlds being declared <lb/>
            to be of that same number; he employs the argument of <lb/>
            probability with reference to four only of them, and with­ <lb/>
            draws the Cube, as is done in the game of counters, <lb/>
            because it is not disposed by its nature to change into <note type="footnote"> I A Brahminical notion : Siva, god of Fire, being expressed by the <lb/>
            Pyramid ; Vishnu, of Water, by the same inverted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            them, nor yet to allow them to change into itself-because, <lb/>
            truly, all triangles are not of the same nature, for in the <lb/>
            former figures the half-triangle in all is supposed empty ; <lb/>
            whereas in the latter the isosceles triangle, being peculiar <lb/>
            to this figure alone, makes no inclination, or unifying <lb/>
            conjunction with that empty space. If, therefore, there <lb/>
            being five worlds and five bodies (elements), that part has <lb/>
            the precedence of birth in which the Cube was first <lb/>
            generated, there will be nothing left for the rest; because <lb/>
            there is nothing of theirs into which the Cube is naturally <lb/>
            disposed to change. And I say nothing about the circum­ <lb/>
            stance that they make the element of the so-called <lb/>
            Dodecahedron to be something else, and not the Scalene <lb/>
            triangle out of which Plato composes his Pyramid, Octo­ <lb/>
            hedron, and Eicosihedron. " For that very reason," added <lb/>
            Ammonius laughing, " you must either solve these ques­ <lb/>
            tions ; or else advance something of your own with respect <lb/>
            to the common difficulty."</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Then I: “ 1 have nothing to say that is more <lb/>
            plausible, at least at the moment, but still it is better to <lb/>
            submit to an examination of one's own opinion, than that <lb/>
            of another's. I therefore say again, as I said at starting, <lb/>
            that if we suppose the existence of two Natures,-the one <lb/>
            Sensible in birth and destruction, subject to change and <lb/>
            to be moved in different directions; the other Intelligible, <lb/>
            ever remaining the same in the same course-it is strange <lb/>
            that the Intelligible part should be divided and have <lb/>
            variety in itself, and that we should be angry and scold if <lb/>
            one does not leave the corporeal and passive part be one, <lb/>
            concordant with and converging towards its own self, <lb/>
            but divide and disperse the same. For things permanent <lb/>
            and divine must surely cling faster to themselves, and <lb/>
            shrink as far as possible from all severance and separation <lb/>
            of parts, but even with these the power of the one laying <lb/>
            hold of something greater than itself, produces in things <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            intelligible, the dissimilarities that exist as to cause and <lb/>
            form, of the divisions in locality ; whence Plato, in opposi­ <lb/>
            tion to such as make out the All to be One, declares that <lb/>
            which is to be both the Same and Different, and over all, <lb/>
            Motion and Rest. There being then these five figures, it <lb/>
            were to be wondered at, if of the five corporeal elements1 <lb/>
            each one had been produced as a copy and image of each <lb/>
            quality-not, indeed, pure and unmixed, but participating <lb/>
            as far as possible in each power each in its turn. For the <lb/>
            Cube is palpably the proper emblem of Rest; on account <lb/>
            of the security and firmness of the superficies: and of the <lb/>
            Pyramid everybody will recognize the fiery and movable <lb/>
            character in the slenderness of its sides, and the acuteness <lb/>
            of its angles ; the nature of the dodecahedron, being com­ <lb/>
            prehensive of the other figures, may be supposed an image <lb/>
            of ‘ That which is' with reference to the corporeal part: <lb/>
            whilst of the remaining two, the Elcosihedron has got for <lb/>
            its share the figure of the ‘ Different,' and the Octahedron <lb/>
            the figure of the ‘ Same.' On this account, he has repre­ <lb/>
            sented in one form Air, which holds together all existence ; <lb/>
            and on the other side, Water, which turns into the most <lb/>
            numerous kinds of qualities by reason of its intermixture. <lb/>
            If, therefore, Nature demands an equilibrium in all things, <lb/>
            it is probable that the worlds are neither more nor less <lb/>
            than their patterns, in order that each may have for each <lb/>
            a rule of government and of power, just as it has got in <lb/>
            the constitutions of bodies ?2</p>
          <p>XXXV. " Not but that these several divisions are a con­ <lb/>
            solation to him that wonders why we divide the Nature <lb/>
            existing in births and changes, into so great a number of <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e., the five geometrical bodies are respectively images of the five <lb/>

            species. Examine the case attentively in company with <lb/>
            me : and observe how that of the highest Powers (I mean <lb/>
            the One, and the undefined Two) that which is the element <lb/>
            of all deformity and disorder is denominated ‘ infinity,' <lb/>
            whereas the nature of the One that limits and checks 1 the <lb/>
            empty,2 undefined, irrational nature of infinity, renders <lb/>
            it capable of form, and will produce it in some way or <lb/>
            another obedient to, and susceptible of the consequent <lb/>
            division into categories as regards the objects of intellect, <lb/>
            and the Principles themselves make their first appearance <lb/>
            with reference to Number : or rather Number is by no <lb/>
            manner of means plurality, unless considered as a form of <lb/>
            Matter, that arises out of the unlimited nature of the <lb/>
            Infinite, and is subdivided in one place into more, in <lb/>
            another, into fewer parts : for then each of the pluralities <lb/>
            becomes Number, when it is defined by the One. But if <lb/>
            the One be removed: then again the unlimited Two will <lb/>
            confuse and make the All inharmonious, unlimited, and <lb/>
            immeasurable. For since " Species " is not a doing away <lb/>
            with Matter, but only aform and ordering of the subject- <lb/>
            matter, it is a necessary consequence that both the Prin­ <lb/>
            ciples also should exist in Number, out of which Principles <lb/>
            spring the greatest difference and inequality. For the un­ <lb/>
            defined Principle is creator of the even; the better Principle <lb/>
            of the odd numbers. The first of the even numbers is the <lb/>
            Two, the first of the odd the Three, from the addition of <lb/>
            which springs the Five-a number by composition com­ <lb/>
            mon to both, but by its power, odd. For it was a neces­ <lb/>
            sary consequence of the intelligible and the Corporeal <lb/>
            being measured out into several parts, by reason of the <note type="footnote"> 1 The checking and limitation of this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπειρία</foreign> plays the chief part in <lb/>

            necessity implanted in their nature for variance, that <lb/>
            neither the first should be even, nor the first odd but the <lb/>
            third, made up out of them, so that it springs from both <lb/>
            Principles-from that which creates the even, and that <lb/>
            which creates the odd; since it was not possible for the <lb/>
            one to be separated from the other, for either of them has <lb/>
            the nature and power of a Principle, and when both are <lb/>
            doubled, the Better One prevailed over the indefiniteness <lb/>
            that divided the Corporeal part, and stood still, and <lb/>
            because Matter was cut asunder between the two, this <lb/>
            Principle placed the unit in the middle, and did not allow the <lb/>
            Universe to be distributed into two parts, but the result <lb/>
            was a plurality of worlds by means of the variance and <lb/>
            the difference of the indefinite part. This plurality was <lb/>
            rendered an uneven number by the power of the latter <lb/>
            and of the Definite part, but such unevenness it was not <lb/>
            allowed to overpass because the Better principle possesses <lb/>
            a more extensive nature. For if the One were unmixed <lb/>
            and pure, Matter would not have admitted of any separa­ <lb/>
            tion at all; but since it is parted by the loosening pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the Two, it has admitted of dissection and <lb/>
            division into parts ; and stood still at this point, the even <lb/>
            number being overpowered by the uneven.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. " For this reason it was the custom with the <lb/>
            ancients to call reckoning ‘ counting by fives ;’ and I am <lb/>
            of opinion that all things' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα</foreign>) were so named from <lb/>
            ‘ five' (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πέντε</foreign>) by analogy; because, forsooth, the Five was <lb/>
            made up out of the first numbers: for the other numbers <lb/>
            when multiplied with others produce a number different <lb/>
            from themselves ; whereas the Five, if it be taken an even <lb/>
            number of times, makes the Ten perfect; and if taken an <lb/>
            uneven number of times, it reproduces itself. But if, for <lb/>
            the reason that the Five was composed out of the two <lb/>
            first squares, namely, Unity and Four, for it is the first <lb/>
            that being of equal value with the two preceding it com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            poses the most beautiful of right-angled triangles ; and it <lb/>
            first produces the sesquilateral proportion. All this, per­ <lb/>
            haps, has not much to do with the subject before us ; but <lb/>
            the other is more so, viz., what is by its own nature the <lb/>
            division of number; and the fact that Nature does divide <lb/>
            most things of the sort in this manner. Also in ourselves <lb/>
            are five senses, and members of the soul-the physical, the <lb/>
            sensitive, the appetitive, the irascible, and the rational; <lb/>
            and five fingers of each hand ; and the most fecundating <lb/>
            semen is divided into five parts; for no woman is recorded <lb/>
            to have brought forth more than five children at the same <lb/>
            birth. Also the Egyptians fable that Rhea brought forth <lb/>
            five gods, thus hinting at the creation of the five worlds <lb/>
            out of one matter; and in the universe the earth's circum­ <lb/>
            ference has five zones; and the sky is divided into five <lb/>
            cycles-two arctic, two tropic, and the equinoctial in the <lb/>
            middle; five also have been made the revolutions of the <lb/>
            planets, for the Sun, Mercury, and Jupiter, keep in the <lb/>
            same course. Harmonious also is the constitution of the <lb/>
            world, in exactly the same manner as all musical compo­ <lb/>
            sition amongst ourselves is divided into the arrangement <lb/>
            of the five tetrachords,–the highest, the middle, the <lb/>
            united, the separated, and the bass. Tunes also have five <lb/>
            intervals–diesis, semitone, tone, tone and a half, double <lb/>
            tone. Thus doth Nature appear to take more delight in <lb/>
            making all things run in fives, than she does in making <lb/>
            them spherical-as Aristotle used to say.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. " Why, then (somebody may ask), did Plato <lb/>
            refer the number of the Five Worlds to the five geometrical <lb/>
            figures, by saying ‘ that the Deity employed the fifth con­ <lb/>
            stitution upon the Universe, when he mapped out that uni­ <lb/>
            verse -and then by suggesting that question about the <lb/>
            number of worlds, as to whether it is in reality proper to <lb/>
            hold that they be one or five, he evidently thinks that the <lb/>
            notion arises from that circumstance. If, then, we must <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            bring forward probability as an argument against that no­ <lb/>
            tion of his-if you reflect that of the differences of those <lb/>
            bodies and figures the necessary consequence is a habit of <lb/>
            variation, as he himself teaches when he is proving that <lb/>
            whatever is subdivided, or composite, does, along with the <lb/>
            alteration of the essence, also change the form. For if <lb/>
            Fire be produced from Air, in consequence of the Octa­ <lb/>
            hedron being dissolved, and split up into pyramids ;1 or <lb/>
            on the contrary, Air out of Fire, when it is driven together <lb/>
            and compressed into the Octahedron-it is not possible <lb/>
            for it to remain where it was at first, but it flies and is <lb/>
            borne along into another place, forcing its way and <lb/>
            struggling with all that oppose and check its course. But <lb/>
            the case is better illustrated by a comparison : those using <lb/>
            the various instruments for the winnowing of wheat ob­ <lb/>
            serve that the elements shaking the material, and that are <lb/>
            shaken by the same, always approach like to like into an­ <lb/>
            other position ... until the whole is put in order.2 In <lb/>
            the same way, Matter being then in that condition in which <lb/>
            it is probable the universe would be, where the Deity is <lb/>
            absent, the first five Qualities, having tendencies of their <lb/>
            own, were carried asunder; not entirely so, however, nor <lb/>
            were they clearly separated, for the reason that when all <lb/>
            things were mixed up together, those that were over­ <lb/>
            powered followed the stronger, in spite of their natural <lb/>
            tendency. For which reason, in fact, they (these five <lb/>
            Qualities) produced portions and intervals in like number <lb/>
            for the different species of bodies that moved asunder in <note type="footnote"> I The pyramid being equivalent to Fire, when a figure composed of <lb/>

            different directions-one, not of pure Fire, but of fiery <lb/>

            another, not of Earth pure and simple, but earthy; and <lb/>
            above all, Air associated with Water, because, as already <lb/>
            mentioned, it had gone off impregnated with elements <lb/>
            of different sorts.1 For it was not the Deity who parted <lb/>
            and distributed the Essence, but after it had sepa­ <lb/>
            rated itself and was moving asunder in such varieties of <lb/>
            disorder, He took it in hand, arranged and fitted it <lb/>
            together, by the rule of analogy and the golden mean: in <lb/>
            the next place, He having set Reason, like a deputy and <lb/>
            guard in each province,2 He created as many worlds as are <lb/>
            the kinds of the primal substances. Let thus much be <lb/>
            conceded in Plato's favour, for Ammonius's sake ; but for <lb/>
            my part I will not affirm positively respecting the number <lb/>
            of worlds, that they are exactly so many as this; but <lb/>
            yet I consider the opinion that has been advanced of <lb/>
            their being more than one, not indeed infinite, but <lb/>
            limited in number, to be more agreeable to analogy than <lb/>
            any of the rest; when I consider the natural tendency to <lb/>
            dispersion and subdivision of Matter, whilst it is not suf­ <lb/>
            fered by Reason to move in one direction only, nor yet in <lb/>
            an infinite number of ways. But here, if anywhere, let us <lb/>
            remember the Academy, and divest ourselves of too much <lb/>
            confidence, and reserve certainty, as in a slippery place, for <lb/>
            the argument about their infinity." 3</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. On my saying this, Demetrius replied: <lb/>

            as Euripides says: but they trip us up in facts, when we <lb/>
            are so bold as to give our opinions on such great matters, <lb/>
            as though we knew all about them: but we must bring back <lb/>
            the discussion, as the same person says, to the original sub­ <lb/>
            ject. For the assertion that the Oracles are lying idle and <lb/>
            dumb, because the daemons have migrated or deceased, just <lb/>
            as workmen leave their tools, starts another yet more impor­ <lb/>
            tant inquiry into the cause and power, whereby they render <lb/>
            prophets and prophetesses possessed with inspiration, and <lb/>
            capable of seeing visions. For it is not possible to lay the <lb/>
            blame on their desertion as the cause why the Oracles are <lb/>
            dumb, without first explaining in what way the daemons, <lb/>
            when they do preside at them, and are present, render <lb/>
            these same Oracles active and able to speak." Ammonius, <lb/>
            taking up the word : "Do you think, then, that the daemons <lb/>
            are anything else but spirits that go up and down, as <lb/>
            Hesiod says, 'clothed in mist? ' For it seems to me that <lb/>
            whatever difference one man exhibits, as compared with <lb/>
            another who is acting either tragedy or comedy, just the <lb/>
            same difference will a spirit that has taken possession of <lb/>
            the body exhibit with respect to ordinary life.1 It is, <lb/>
            therefore, neither absurd nor strange if spirits encounter­ <lb/>
            ing spirits do create in them visions of the Future; just as <lb/>
            we ourselves signify to each other, not by voice alone, but <lb/>
            also by writing; nay, often also by a touch, or by a look, <lb/>
            many things of what has happened, and also tell before­ <lb/>
            hand many of what are about to happen by the same <lb/>
            means. And if you, my Ammonius,2 say nothing to the <lb/>
            contrary, for a rumour lately reached us of your having <lb/>
            talked at length on the subject with your hosts at Lebadia, <lb/>
            nothing of which did our informant exactly remember." <note type="footnote"> I There is the same difference between a man possessed by a Spirit <lb/>
            and ordinary men, as there is between a tragedian or comedian when <lb/>
            acting and other people. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A mistake for " Lamprias,” who replies in the next sentence. </note> <lb/>

            " Do not wonder at it," answered I; "for many doings and <lb/>
            occupations intervening, in consequence of there being an <lb/>
            oracle and a sacrifice going on, rendered our discourses <lb/>
            desultory, and full of interruptions." " But now," replied <lb/>
            Ammonius, " you have got hearers quite at liberty, and <lb/>
            anxious partly to inquire, partly to learn, all cavilling and <lb/>
            contradiction being put out of the way, and full indul­ <lb/>
            gence and freedom, as you see, granted to the discussion."</p>
          <p>XXXIX. When all the rest joined in this demand, I, <lb/>
            after a short pause, continued: “ In truth, Ammonius, by <lb/>
            an odd coincidence, 'twas yourself that supplied the start­ <lb/>
            ing-point and introduction to those discourses of mine. <lb/>
            For whether dæmons be spirits separated from the body, <lb/>
            or never united to one, according to you and the divine <lb/>
            Hesiod, being <lb/>
            “‘ Pure dwellers upon earth, keepers of mortals,' <lb/>
            why shall we deprive souls in the body of that power by <lb/>
            which the dæmons are naturally enabled to foreknow and <lb/>
            foretell future events ? For that any new power or faculty <lb/>
            is superadded to souls after they have left the body, which <lb/>
            they did not previously possess, is by no means probable: <lb/>
            but that they possess, indeed, those powers originally, but <lb/>
            have them in inferior degree, whilst united with the body, <lb/>
            some being imperceptible and latent, others feeble and <lb/>
            obscure, in a similar way to things seen through a mist, or <lb/>
            in moving water, inactive, and slow, and standing in need <lb/>
            of much curing, and recovery of what is their own,1 and <lb/>
            removal and clearing away of what obscures them—all this <lb/>
            is probable enough. For just as the Sun doth not become <lb/>
            bright, when he bursts through the clouds, but is so per­ <lb/>
            petually, yet he appears to us, when in a mist, dull and <lb/>
            obscure, in like manner the soul doth not acquire the pro­ <lb/>
            phetic power, when it passes out of the body, as out of a <note type="footnote"> 1 Their proper faculties </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            cloud, but possesses it even now, though it is dimmed by <lb/>
            its mixture and confusion with the body. We ought not <lb/>
            to wonder or disbelieve this, when we observe, if nothing <lb/>
            else, the faculty of the Soul which is the converse of Fore­ <lb/>
            knowledge, that is what we call the Memory: how great <lb/>
            an operation doth it perform in preserving and storing up <lb/>
            things gone by, or rather, things that are! For of things <lb/>
            past, none is or subsists, but all things are born and die <lb/>
            together-both actions, and words, and passions-whilst <lb/>
            Time, like a mighty river, sweeps them by, one by one; <lb/>
            but this faculty of the Soul, laying hold upon them, I <lb/>
            know not how, invests things not present with visible form <lb/>
            and existence ! For, truly, the oracle given to the Thes­ <lb/>
            salians respecting Anna, promises <lb/>
            “ ' To the deaf hearing, to the blind their sight.' <lb/>
            But the Memory is to us the hearing of deaf actions, and <lb/>
            the seeing of blind. No wonder, then, as I have said, if <lb/>
            that which holds tight the things that be no more, should <lb/>
            anticipate many of those that do not yet exist; for these <lb/>
            belong more peculiarly to it, and for these it has a natural <lb/>
            sympathy, inasmuch as it stretches itself out, and pushes <lb/>
            forward towards the Future, but disengages itself from <lb/>
            things that be past and come to an end, except so far as <lb/>
            the remembering of them goes.</p>
          <p>XL. " Souls therefore possessing this faculty inherent in <lb/>
            their nature, though obscured, and hardly showing itself, <lb/>
            do nevertheless put forth blossom, and recover this power <lb/>
            -in dreams often, on the point of death,' some few-either <lb/>
            that the body becomes purified, or assumes a new tem­ <lb/>
            perament on these occasions,2 or else that the reasoning <lb/>
            and thinking parts of the soul are unbound and released <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετὰς</foreign>, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελευτὰς</foreign>, beyond all doubt. </note><note type="footnote"> a “ The soul's poor cottage, battered and decayed, <lb/>
            Lets in new light thro’ chinks that Time bath made." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            from the irrational and visionary condition of the Present, <lb/>
            and turn towards the Future. For it is not so, as Euri­ <lb/>
            pides says: <lb/>
            “ ‘ He's the best prophet that can guess the best,' <lb/>
            but such a one is a man that has his wits about him, and <lb/>
            follows the intelligent part of his soul as it guides him on <lb/>
            his way, with a show of probability. For the prophetic <lb/>
            part, like a tablet unwritten on,1 senseless, and indefinite <lb/>
            of itself, but capable of receiving visionary impressions <lb/>
            and forebodings, grasps the Future without any considera­ <lb/>
            tion, at the moment when it is first departing out of the <lb/>
            Present. It makes the same escape from the Present by <lb/>
            means of the temperament and condition of the body when <lb/>
            in a state of change, which we call inspiration. Now the <lb/>
            body doth frequently of its own accord acquire this pre­ <lb/>
            disposition ; and the earth sends forth springs of water <lb/>
            productive of various effects upon mankind-some being <lb/>
            productive of delirium, and disease, and death; and others <lb/>
            that are good, benignant, and salubrious, as they prove by <lb/>
            experience to such as frequent them. But the prophetic <lb/>
            stream or blast is the most godlike and most holy, whether <lb/>
            it be taken in with the air or drawn from the liquid foun­ <lb/>
            tain ; for when it unites itself with the body it engenders <lb/>
            in the soul a temperament altogether unusual and strange, <lb/>
            the peculiar nature of which it is difficult to explain <lb/>
            clearly, although history in many places affords us means <lb/>
            for a conjecture. That by means of its heat and diffu­ <lb/>
            sion it opens certain passages suited to admit impres­ <lb/>
            sions of the Future is probable enough, just as when <lb/>
            wine gets up into the head it brings about other effects, <lb/>
            and unlocks words stored up in memory and forgotten. <lb/>
            Also the Bacchic frenzy and madness itself possesses <lb/>
            much of the prophetic spirit, when the soul, becoming <note type="footnote"> 1 “ A blank sheet of paper." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            heated and full of fire, shakes off the caution that human <lb/>
            prudence lays upon it, and thereby frequently turns aside <lb/>
            and puts out the fire of inspiration.</p>
          <p>XLI. "At the same time one may, not without reason, <lb/>
            suppose that dryness coming on together with heat, subti­ <lb/>
            lizes the spirit, and renders it more ethereal and pure : be­ <lb/>
            cause the soul itself is dry, according to Heraclitus. For <lb/>
            moisture not only dulls the sight and hearing, but when it <lb/>
            touches mirrors takes away from them reflection (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίχος</foreign>); and <lb/>
            the brightness and the light descend from the air. On the <lb/>
            other hand, again, that through a certain sudden cooling <lb/>
            and condensation of spirit, as is the case in the tempering <lb/>
            of iron, that the prophetic portion of the soul is both aug­ <lb/>
            mented and rendered keener, is a thing by no means <lb/>
            impossible. And again, just as tin being melted together <lb/>
            with it constringes and solidifies copper, naturally soft and <lb/>
            porous, and renders it brighter and cleaner, in like manner <lb/>
            the prophetic vapour, it is not improbable, having a certain <lb/>
            sympathy and affinity to the soul, fills up the soft parts <lb/>
            thereof, and cements and keeps them together. For dif­ <lb/>
            ferent substances are congenial and have affinity to others, <lb/>
            just as bean-flour is supposed to assist the dye of the mu­ <lb/>
            rex, and natron 1 that of the kermes, when mixed there­ <lb/>
            with : ‘ some of the blue crocus is mingled with flax,' and as <lb/>
            Empedocles hath said. But with respect to the Cydnus, <lb/>
            and the consecrated sword of Apollo at Tarsus, we have <lb/>
            heard you, Demetrius, telling how that only the Cydnus <lb/>
            cleanses that steel, and no other river cleanses that sword. <lb/>
            At Olympia also, the ashes for the Altar2 they knead up, <lb/>
            and bring to consistency, by pouring over them water out <lb/>
            of the Alpheus, but if they wet these same ashes with any <note type="footnote"> I Native carbonate of soda, got from the Natron Lakes, near Cairo s <lb/>
            the ancient substitute for soap. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This Altar was an immense heap of the ashes produced by the sacri <lb/>

             <pb n="124"/>
            other water they are not able to solidify and cement the <lb/>
            ashes.</p>
          <p>XLII. " It is therefore not to be wondered at if, although <lb/>
            Earth sends up numerous streams, these [at Delphi] alone <lb/>
            should dispose the soul to ecstasy, and to conceive visions <lb/>
            of future events. And the voice of Fame likewise indis­ <lb/>
            putably tallies with my argument, for the story goes that <lb/>
            the power residing in the place first became manifest after <lb/>
            a certain shepherd had accidentally tumbled into the well, <lb/>
            and afterwards began to utter words that were inspired, <lb/>
            which his neighbours at first laughed at, but when many <lb/>
            things the fellow had foretold actually came about, then <lb/>
            they were filled with wonder. And the best historians <lb/>
            of Delphi keep up the memory of his name, and call him <lb/>
            Coretas. But it seems to me that the soul acquires this <lb/>
            tendency and inclination to dissolve into the prophetic <lb/>
            spirit, for the same reason as the sight does with respect <lb/>
            to the light, because the latter has a natural sympathy <lb/>
            for it. For though the eye possesses the power of vision, <lb/>
            there is no employment of it without the light; similarly <lb/>
            the prophetic faculty of the soul, like the eye, stands in <lb/>
            need of something of its own nature to assist in grasping <lb/>
            objects, and to sharpen its force. For which cause, most <lb/>
            of the ancients supposed Apollo to be the same with the <lb/>
            Sun, and they that understood and admired the beautiful <lb/>
            and ingenious comparison, guessed that what body is to <lb/>
            soul, sight to mind, light to truth-the same is the Sun <lb/>
            to the nature of Apollo; his offspring, and his child, per­ <lb/>
            petually born of ' Him that is,' perpetually reflecting1 the <lb/>
            author of its being; for it kindles, promotes, and stimu­ <lb/>
            lates the power of vision of the sense, just as he does the <lb/>
            prophetic faculty of the soul.</p>
          <p>XLIII. "Those, however, that supposed him one and the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αποφαίνοντες</foreign> makes no sense ; it must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποφαίνοντα</foreign>, referring to <lb/>

            lieved that the Sun generated in the Earth the disposition <lb/>
            and temperament out of which she sends forth the pro­ <lb/>
            phetic vapour. Earth herself, ‘sure foundation of all <lb/>
            things,' as Hesiod with far more sagacity than our philo­ <lb/>
            sophers hath called her, we hold to be everlasting and <lb/>
            imperishable :1 but of the powers belonging to her, it is <lb/>
            probable that in one place deceases happen, in another <lb/>
            new births; elsewhere, migrations and influxes from dif­ <lb/>
            ferent quarters, and that such revolutions come round no <lb/>
            less frequently in the whole course of time, as we may con­ <lb/>
            jecture from natural phenomena. For in the case of lakes, <lb/>
            rivers, and yet more, of hot springs, there have occurred <lb/>
            in some places failures, and wastings away, and in others, <lb/>
            as it were, a flight and, self-interment: and on the other <lb/>
            hand, their re-appearance in the same places as before, or <lb/>
            their welling forth in the same neighbourhood. Also of <lb/>
            mines, entire failures have happened in recent times, as <lb/>
            for instance of the silver mines in Attica, and of the <lb/>
            copper ore in Eubœa, out of which the cold-hammered2 <lb/>
            sword-blades used to be wrought, as AEschylus says­ <lb/>
            “‘Taking his self-sharpened Eubean blade;' <lb/>
            and in the case of the quarry at Carystus, 'tis no long <lb/>
            time since it ceased to produce soft and thread-like veins <lb/>
            of stone: 3 for I believe some of you have seen towels and <note type="footnote"> I Julian, who evidently had studied this tract, uses the very same ex. <lb/>

            the earth. Simultaneously with which exhalation it is a <lb/>
            necessary consequence that effects of the kind must come <lb/>
            to an end, change their places, and on the other hand be <lb/>
            revivified once more. In fact, we must hold the same <lb/>
            opinion with respect to oracular inspirations, inasmuch as <lb/>
            they have not an everlasting, or undecaying power, but one <lb/>
            that is subject to vicissitudes. For it is probable that ex­ <lb/>
            cessive rains extinguish these exhalations; or that by the <lb/>
            falling of thunder-bolts they are destroyed; or, above all, <lb/>
            when the earth is affected by a trembling, and suffers <lb/>
            settlements and jumbling together of her parts, in her in­ <lb/>
            most depths, that the said exhalations shift their place, or <lb/>
            are put out entirely, just as in this place they say it [the <lb/>
            oracular power] did not continue after the great earth­ <lb/>

            people perished, and the Oracle of Tiresias came to an end <lb/>

            from home a very long time. But when I was there the <lb/>
            Oracle of Mopsus still flourished, as well as that of Amphi­ <lb/>
            lochus. But I have a very wonderful event to tell, which <lb/>
            happened during my visit to the Oracle of Mopsus. The <lb/>
            governor of Cilicia, being sceptical in religious matters, <lb/>
            disbelieving them, I fancy, out of wantonness,. for he was <lb/>
            an extremely insolent and wicked man, and had about him <lb/>
            a set of Epicureans who after their fine fashion and their <lb/>
            ‘ natural science* principles, made sport of all things of <lb/>
            the kind, as they themselves openly profess ; he sent his <lb/>
            freedman, furnishing him as a spy going into the enemy's <lb/>
            camp, with a sealed letter, in which the inquiry was written, <lb/>
            nobody knowing the contents. The fellow therefore <lb/>
            having passed the night, as is the rule, within the sanc­ <lb/>
            tuary, and having slept there, related to us next morning <lb/>
            the following dream. He dreamed that a man of handsome <lb/>
            appearance stood over him and shouted ‘ A black one!' <lb/>
            and nothing more, but immediately retired. This seemed <lb/>
            to us absurd, and occasioned great perplexity; the governor, <lb/>
            however, was astounded at it, and making a gesture of <lb/>
            adoration and opening the letter, showed written therein <lb/>
            the question: Whether shall I sacrifice to thee a white or <lb/>
            a black bull ? so that the Epicureans were put to the rout, <lb/>
            and he himself performed the sacrifice, and ever after held <lb/>

          <p>XLVI. Demetrius having spoken thus much, ceased : <lb/>
            but It wishing to place, as it were, a crowning stone on <lb/>
            the discussion, turned my eyes upon Philip and Ammonius, <lb/>
            who were sitting together: they seemed to me to be want­ <lb/>
            ing to say something, but they checked themselves again. <lb/>
            At last Ammonius: " Philip has got something to say about <lb/>
            the story just told, for he believes, as do many others, and <lb/>
            I myself, that Apollo is no other god, but the same with <lb/>
            the Sun: but my difficulty is a greater one, and concerning <lb/>
            greater matters. At first, we went aside, I know not how, <lb/>
            in the discussion, and transferred with all due respect the <lb/>
            oracular office from the gods to the daemons; but now we <lb/>
            seem to me to be pushing these latter gentlemen them­ <lb/>
            selves from thence, out of the oracle and off the Tripod; <lb/>
            when we resolve the final cause of prophecy, or rather its <lb/>
            very essence and power, into blasts and vapours and ex­ <lb/>
            halations. For the above mentioned 'temperatures' and <lb/>
            4 heatings' and ‘ temperings,’ the more they draw away <lb/>
            our belief from the interposition of the Deity, suggest such <lb/>
            an idea of the Final Cause as Euripides makes his Cyclops <lb/>
            entertain :­ <lb/>
            “‘ For will she, nill site, dame Necessity <lb/>
            Makes the grass grow, that feeds my sheep so fat.' <lb/>
            Except that he says he does not sacrifice to the gods but <lb/>
            to himself and ' his belly, that greatest of deities,' whereas <lb/>
            we both offer sacrifice and make prayers at the Oracles, <lb/>
            for what purpose, pray, if it is only winds that excite the <lb/>
            prophetic power in them; or else some kind of tempera­ <lb/>
            ture of the air or wind, that sets the same in motion ? and <lb/>
            what is the meaning of the presentation of the victims, and <lb/>
            the fact of them not being acceptable unless the beast be­ <lb/>
            come all of a tremble from the top of the brow downwards, <lb/>
            and stagger, when the libation is poured upon it. For it <lb/>
            is not sufficient that it shake its head, as in the case of all <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            other sacrifices, but the motion and quivering must spread <lb/>
            over all its limbs, accompanied with a tremulous sound; <lb/>
            for whenever this does not take place, they say the Oracle <lb/>
            is not at work, and do not bring in the Pythoness. And <lb/>
            yet, if they supposed the chief cause to have nothing to <lb/>
            do with either god or daemon, it would be reasonable for <lb/>
            them to act and to think in this way: but according to <lb/>
            your notions, it is not reasonable; for the exhalation, <lb/>
            whether the victim do tremble or not, being there perma­ <lb/>
            nently will produce the inspiration, and that not merely in <lb/>
            the Pythoness, but in any ordinary person. For which <lb/>
            reason it is absurd to employ one woman only for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of the Oracles, and to give her trouble by keeping her <lb/>
            all her life through, chaste and pure. For that Coretos, <lb/>
            who, the Delphians say, first gave notice of the pro­ <lb/>
            perty residing in the place by tumbling into it, did not, I <lb/>
            fancy, differ in any way from the other goatherds and <lb/>
            shepherds—that is, indeed, if this be not an allegory, or an <lb/>
            empty fiction, as I myself esteem it. But when I reflect <lb/>
            of what great service to the Greeks this Oracle hath been <lb/>
            the author, both in wars and in the founding of cities, also <lb/>
            on occasions of pestilence and seasons of barrenness, I <lb/>
            think it hard to assign both the discovery and the final <lb/>
            cause not to God and to Providence, but to accident and <lb/>
            natural means. On these points," added he," my dear Lam­ <lb/>
            prias, I wish to discourse-will you have patience with <lb/>
            me ? " 1 " Yes, certainly," replied Philip, " and so will all <lb/>
            of those present-for the subject interests the whole of <lb/>
            us.”</p>
          <p>XLVII. Then I in reply to him: “It has not only angered, <lb/>
            but filled me with confusion, that I should be thought by <lb/>
            you, and so numerous and respectable a company as you <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιμένοις</foreign> must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιμενε̃ις</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>

            are, to have (in spite of my years),1 made out a fine story by <lb/>
            plausible arguments, in order to destroy or upset any of <lb/>
            the sound and religious notions entertained with respect <lb/>
            to the Deity. I will therefore make my defence against <lb/>
            the charge, and bring forward Plato for a witness and advo­ <lb/>
            cate in my cause; since that philosopher has censured <lb/>
            Anaxagoras of old, seeing that he went too much into <lb/>
            natural causes, and was always tracing out and hunting <lb/>
            after what was necessarily accomplished by the properties <lb/>
            of bodies, so that he neglected the higher causes, final and <lb/>
            efficient, of the effect and of the agent. He (Plato) was <lb/>
            the first, or did the most, of the philosophers, to investi­ <lb/>
            gate both points, assigning to the Deity the origin of the <lb/>
            things that are constituted according to reason ; without, <lb/>
            however, depriving Matter of the efficient causes necessary <lb/>
            for that which is done; for he discerned that all the world <lb/>
            of sense was regularly arranged, but was not unmixed or <lb/>
            pure, but receives its origin from Matter impregnated by <lb/>
            Reason. And consider in the case of artifioers: for example <lb/>
            here at hand, the celebrated base and stand for the vase <lb/>
            which Herodotus calls the ‘Crater holder,'2 that has for <lb/>
            natural efficient causes fire and iron, and above all the <lb/>
            tempering of the metal by means of fire and water, without <lb/>
            which there was no means for the work to be done. But <lb/>
            the yet more valid cause that set these two in motion, and <lb/>
            kept them incessantly at work, did Art and Reason furnish <note type="footnote"> 1 One of the few indications of a date to be found in these Moralia, as <lb/>
            showing they were written in Plutarch's old age. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dedicated by Alyattes, father of Crœsus, and regarded as a miracle <lb/>

            before our era (Alyattes B.C. 560), wrought iron was hardly known in <lb/>
            Greece. Herodotus says the maker, Glaucus of Chios, first invented <lb/>
            the welding of iron. The stand supported a great crater of silver, but <lb/>
            this would not have escaped the melting-pot of Philomelua, or of Sylla <lb/>

            to the undertaking, and again the creator and artist of <lb/>
            these pictures and figures around us,1 has inscribed him­ <lb/>
            self ‘ Polygnotus of Thasos, son of Aglaophon, has painted <lb/>
            the sacking of the citadel of Ilium’—as he is seen to have <lb/>
            written.* But without the aid of paints ground up together <lb/>
            and dissolved into each other, there was no possibility for <lb/>
            this work to have got its arrangement and visible form. <lb/>
            Does then the person who wishes to trace out the material <lb/>
            cause, by inquiring and explaining what effects and changes <lb/>
            ochre produces when mixed with Sinope, or Melean white <lb/>
            with lamp-black 3—does he thereby detract from the fame <lb/>
            of Polygnotus ? And he that tells about the hardening <lb/>
            and the softening of iron, how that when deprived of <lb/>
            rigidity by means of fire it spreads itself and yields to <lb/>
            those who are beating it out, and bringing it into form, <lb/>
            and having been thrown into pure water, by reason of the <lb/>
            tenderness and liquidity produced on it by the fire, it <lb/>
            becomes impregnated with cold, and acquires the elasticity <lb/>
            and the density that Homer calls ‘ the strength of iron’— <lb/>
            does he the less on that score wholly reserve to the artificer <lb/>
            the cause of the production of the work ? I, truly, do not <lb/>
            think so. Again, there are some who investigate the pro­ <lb/>
            perties of remedial agents, and yet do not subvert the <lb/>
            science of medicine. In the same way, certainly, when <lb/>
            Plato makes out that we see by means of the light resident <lb/>
            in the eye being mingled with the light of the Sun, and <lb/>
            that we hear by means of the repercussion of the air, does <lb/>
            not disprove that we were born capable of seeing and of <lb/>
            hearing by design and by providence.</p>

            efficient causes, the very ancient theologians and poets <lb/>
            chose to pay attention only to the higher one of the two, <lb/>
            applying to all subjects in common that invocation :­ <lb/>
            “ ‘ Jove first, Jove last, all things spring out of Jove,' <lb/>
            for they had not yet got as far as ‘necessary’ and ‘physical <lb/>
            causes.' But the more modern, and those styling themselves <lb/>
            ‘ natural philosophers,' on the contrary, stray away from <lb/>
            the superior cause, and place the whole theory of sensation <lb/>
            in elements, conditions of elements, collisions, and inter­ <lb/>
            minglings of bodies. For which cause the reasoning on <lb/>
            both sides is deficient in an essential part, for the one set <lb/>
            ignore or omit the agent and the author; the others, the <lb/>
            means, and the materials. Now he who was the first to <lb/>
            handle both these points in a lucid manner, and who took <lb/>
            into the account besides Him that makes according to <lb/>
            Reason, and puts into motion, the necessarily subject and <lb/>
            passive element, will clear us also of all suspicion and <lb/>
            blame. For we do not make prophecy to be without God <lb/>
            and without Reason, by assigning to it the human soul for <lb/>
            the material, but the inspiring breath or exhalation, for the <lb/>
            instrument as it were, or the thing that makes it give out <lb/>
            a sound. For in the first place it is Earth that breeds <lb/>
            these exhalations, but He who imparts to Earth the faculty <lb/>
            for tempering and for changing, namely, the Sun, is, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the belief of our fathers, a god to us. In the <lb/>
            next place, as we have daemons, as it were, for presidents, <lb/>
            ministers, and guardians, of this said natural constitution, <lb/>
            who occasionally let it down, like a musical instrument, <lb/>
            and again tighten it up, by diminishing its over-great <lb/>
            ecstatic and maddening property, and tempering the excite­ <lb/>
            ment so as to be unproductive of pain or injury to such as <lb/>
            experience it—we must not be thought to be doing anything <lb/>
            unreasonable or impossible.</p>

            put garlands and pour libations upon the victim, we are <lb/>
            not doing anything opposed to this view of the matter. <lb/>
            For the priests and holy men say that they offer up <lb/>
            the victim, pour the libation, and observe its movement <lb/>
            and trembling for no other purpose than to discover <lb/>
            whether the god is then performing his functions,1 be­ <lb/>
            cause it is necessary that the thing to be sacrificed should <lb/>
            be perfect both in body and soul, unblemished, and uncor­ <lb/>
            rupted. Indications of this in the case of the body, it is not <lb/>
            very difficult to discover; but the soul they test by putting <lb/>
            upon the bulls barley-meal, and upon the he-goats vetches : <lb/>
            for the beast that eats not thereof they judge not to be <lb/>
            sound. For the she-goat cold water is the test-because <lb/>
            the animal is not of a nature insensible to such sprinkling, <lb/>
            and not disposed to tremble at it. But whether it be <lb/>
            certain that the quivering of the victim be a sign of its <lb/>
            being lawful to consult the Oracle, and its not quivering of <lb/>
            the reverse, I do not perceive what objection results there­ <lb/>
            from against my argument, because every power acts <lb/>
            better or worse according to the season ordained for it by <lb/>
            Nature; consequently when the season varies, it is but <lb/>
            reasonable the Deity should give us warning of the fact.</p>
          <p>L. As for the Exhalation2 itself, I do not think it is <lb/>
            constantly in the same condition, but that it is liable to <lb/>
            failings off, and on the other hand, to augmentations of <lb/>
            force: and for the fact which I adduce as proof, I have <lb/>
            the testimony of many visitors, and of all the people that <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεμιστεύειν</foreign>, Themis having been first owner of the Oracle. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An instance of a similar <foreign xml:lang="grc">πνευ̃μα</foreign> issuing from the earth is to be <lb/>

            tery court, there issues from a chasm in the rock a strong and icy <lb/>
            wind, coldest in the summer beats. This too produces inspiration, <lb/>
            though indirectly, for the monks make use of it to cool their wine <lb/>
            and beer. Nevertheless, the fact of its being enclosed within the sacred <lb/>

            make those who consult the god sit down, is filled, not <lb/>
            frequently nor regularly, but at uncertain intervals, with <lb/>
            a sweet smell, and a breath, like the most delicious and <lb/>
            costly perfumes, in consequence of the sanctuary sending <lb/>
            forth vapours as from a fountain:' for it is probable that <lb/>
            it is excited from time to time, either by heat, or some <lb/>
            accidental compression. But if this does not seem to you <lb/>
            credible, at least you will allow that the Pythoness herself <lb/>
            has the part of her soul which is affected by the ex­ <lb/>
            halation in different states and dispositions at different <lb/>
            times, and does not always preserve the same temperament <lb/>
            like an unchangeable harmony. For many infirmities <lb/>
            and disturbances, to her own knowledge, and many more <lb/>
            that be unperceived, seize upon her body, and pervade her <lb/>
            soul, filled with which it is better she should not enter there; <lb/>
            neither ought they (the priests) in that state to present <lb/>
            her to the god when she is not perfectly pure, just as <lb/>
            though she were some musical instrument, well finished <lb/>
            indeed, and well sounding, but yet liable to be affected, <lb/>
            and to get out of tune. For neither does wine always pro­ <lb/>
            duce intoxication in the same manner, nor the fife, ex­ <lb/>
            citement, but at one time the same persons rave and rage <lb/>
            more, at another time less, as the temperament in them <lb/>
            varies. But especially does the imaginative part of the <lb/>
            soul show itself to be mastered by the body, and to sym­ <lb/>
            pathize with its changes; as is apparent in the case of <lb/>
            dreams. For sometimeswe are involved in numerous and in­ <lb/>
            finitely varied visions, whilst at other times, on the contrary, <lb/>
            we have complete freedom and peace from anything of the <lb/>
            sort, and we know that Cleon here, one of the people from <note type="footnote"> 1 An important fact, as showing that the emission of some intoxi­ <lb/>

            he has never had a single dream. And of those of former <lb/>
            times the same thing is told respecting Thrasymedes the <lb/>
            Heræan. The cause is the temperament of the body: for <lb/>
            that of the atrabilious is very subject to dreams, and to <lb/>
            visions, even though dreaming true seems to be their <lb/>
            especial privilege: because turning themselves in their <lb/>
            fancies to many things at many times, like those shooting <lb/>
            often, they sometimes hit the mark.</p>
          <p>LI. " When, therefore, the prophetic and imaginative <lb/>
            faculty is in a state that harmonizes with the assimilation <lb/>
            of the vapour, like that of a medicine, inspiration must <lb/>
            necessarily follow; just as, that not being the case, it <lb/>
            must either not take place at all, or else be delirious, <lb/>
            not genuine, and full of confusion-as we know happened <lb/>
            in the case of the Pythoness lately deceased. For con­ <lb/>
            sulters of the Oracle having arrived from abroad,1 the <lb/>
            victim is said to have withstood the preliminary agita­ <lb/>
            tions without feeling, and without motion; and when the <lb/>
            priests in their zeal substituted others, and still persevered, <lb/>
            with difficulty did it become tremulous3 and staggering <lb/>
            about, to give the necessary sign. What, pray, happened <lb/>
            with respect to the Pythoness ? She descended into the place <lb/>
            of the Oracle against her will, and in a bad humour; and <lb/>
            directly upon the very first answers, she manifested by the <lb/>
            harsh sound of her voice that she was not repeating3 the <lb/>
            dictation of the god: like to a ship drifting before the gale, <lb/>
            she was filled with an incoherent and evil inspiration. At <lb/>

            ground; so that not only the consulters took to flight in <lb/>
            terror, but even the interpreter Nicander, and such of <lb/>
            the holy men as were present. After a little while, how­ <lb/>
            ever, they went in again, and picked her up—she was in­ <lb/>
            sane, and only survived for a few days.2 This is the <lb/>
            reason why they keep the body of the Pythoness pure from <lb/>
            all sexual intercourse, and her life clear from all mixture <lb/>
            and contact with and conversation of strangers: and also <lb/>
            before consultation, observe the above-mentioned signs: <lb/>
            for they believe that it is clearly understood by the god <lb/>
            whether she has the proper frame of body and disposition, <lb/>
            so as to receive the inspiration without injury. For the <lb/>
            power of the vapour does not affect all persons indis­ <lb/>
            criminately, nor yet the same persons always in the same <lb/>
            way, but as above said, it supplies an incentive and cause <lb/>
            to such as be suitably disposed to feel it, and undergo the <lb/>
            change. The power is in reality due to a god, and to a <lb/>
            dæmon, yet it is not exempt from cessation, imperishable, <lb/>
            undecaying, or capable of lasting to all eternity of time­ <lb/>
            by which all things between Earth and Moon are worn out, <lb/>
            according to our theory. Some there be who hold that <lb/>

            the inscriptions. The sight and artistic merit of the statues <lb/>
            did not so much attract the notice of the visitor, who had <lb/>
            in all likelihood seen many fine things of the sort elsewhere; <lb/>
            but he admired the colour of the bronze, which was not <lb/>
            like dirt or verdigris, but shone with a dark blue dye, so <lb/>
            as to contribute considerably to the effect of the statues of <lb/>
            the admirals (for he had begun his round with them), <lb/>
            standing as they did, sea-like as it were in colour, and truly <lb/>
            men of ocean-deep. Had there been then, he asked, some <lb/>
            mode of alloying and preparing the bronze, used by the <lb/>
            ancient artificers, like the traditional tempering2 of swords, <lb/>
            which process being lost, then bronze obtained exemption <lb/>
            from all warlike employments ? For it is known that the <lb/>
            Corinthian metal acquired the beauty of its colour not <lb/>
            through art, but through accident, when a fire consumed <lb/>
            a house containing a little gold and silver, but a great <lb/>
            quantity of bronze there stored up ; all which being mixed <lb/>
            and melted together, the preponderating part, by reason <note type="footnote"> 1 Curious, as showing the establishment of regular custodi for the <lb/>

            of its largeness, originated the name of the bronze." <lb/>
            Theon, taking him up, said: "We have heard another <lb/>
            story, more clever than yours-that a man at Corinth, a <lb/>
            brasier by trade, having found a hoard containing much <lb/>
            gold, and being afraid of detection, broke up little by little <lb/>
            and quietly mixed the gold with his bronze, which acquired <lb/>
            thereby a wonderful quality, and sold his metal at a high <lb/>
            price, as it was much sought after on account of its colour <lb/>
            and beauty. But both the one account and the other is a <lb/>
            fable. It was, in all probability, a peculiar alloying and <lb/>
            treatment of the metal-just as nowadays by alloying gold <lb/>
            with silver they produce a peculiar and extraordinary pale <lb/>
            colour, that looks to me sickly, and a mere spoiling of its <lb/>
            beauty."1</p>
          <p>III. " What then," asked Diogenianus, " do you say has <lb/>
            been the cause of the peculiar colour of the bronze in this <lb/>
            place ? " And Theon replied : " Inasmuch as of the greatest <lb/>
            and most natural things that are and shall be-namely, <lb/>
            Fire, Water, Earth, Air-there is not one that comes near <lb/>
            to, or has to do with the bronze except Air, it is clear that <lb/>
            the metal has been thus affected by this element, and has <lb/>
            acquired the peculiarity which it possesses by reason of <lb/>
            this being always about it, and pressing upon it: you <lb/>
            know, surely, that this once took place in the case2 of <lb/>
            Theognis, according to the comic poet ? But what property <lb/>
            the air has, and what influence it exerts in its contact with <lb/>
            the bronze-these are the two things, Diogenianus, that you <lb/>
            desire to learn ? " and upon Diogenianus assenting: " so <note type="footnote"> I Referring to the electrum, then much in vogue for table plate on <lb/>

            do I, my dear boy; therefore, if you please, let us investi. <lb/>
            gate the matter in concert: and as a beginning-for what <lb/>
            reason does oil, above all other liquids, coat bronze with <lb/>
            verdigris,1 for it does not generate the verdigris simply by <lb/>
            being rubbed over the metal, because it is pure and clear <lb/>
            when applied to the surface."2 " By no means," replied the <lb/>
            young man, " does this seem to me to be the reason : but <lb/>
            because the oil being thin, pure, and transparent, the <lb/>
            verdigris falling upon it, is very perceptible, whereas in <lb/>
            other liquids, it becomes invisible." " Well done," my dear <lb/>
            boy," said Theon, .... but examine, if you please, the <lb/>
            reason that is assigned by Aristotle." " I wish to do so," <lb/>
            replied he. " Aristotle, therefore, asserts that verdigris, <lb/>
            if put upon other liquids, runs through them and is dis­ <lb/>
            persed, because they are porous and fluid ; whereas it is <lb/>
            arrested by the solidity or density of the oil, and remains <lb/>
            collected in a mass. If, therefore, we can ourselves devise <lb/>
            some hypothesis of the kind, we shall not be entirely at a <lb/>
            loss for some charm or cure against the present difficulty."</p>
          <p>IV. "Thus then," said he, "did we pronounce and <lb/>
            agree, that the air at Delphi, being dense and compact, <lb/>
            and receiving tension from the repercussion and resistance <lb/>
            of the surrounding mountains, is at the same time biting <lb/>
            and penetrating, as the facts about the digestion of food <lb/>
            clearly evince: this air, then, by reason of its subtile <lb/>
            quality enters into and cuts the bronze and so scrapes off <lb/>
            verdigris in plenty, and that of an earthy nature, which <lb/>
            again it holds suspended and compresses, because its own <lb/>
            density does not allow of its unlimited diffusion ... <note type="footnote"> I The ancient receipt for " patinating * statues was by " oleo et sole," <lb/>

            [but, on the contrary] I permits it to settle down by reason <lb/>
            of its abundance, and to bloom, as it were, and get <lb/>
            brilliancy and polish over the surface." And upon our <lb/>
            admitting this, the visitor said that the one supposition <lb/>
            (of the density) was sufficient for the explanation. " The <lb/>
            subtile quality," said he, " would seem to contradict the <lb/>
            asserted density of the air: and it is assumed without any <lb/>
            necessity; for the bronze does of itself emit and dis­ <lb/>
            charge the verdigris, while the density of the air com­ <lb/>
            presses and thickens it, and makes it visible in consequence <lb/>
            of its abundance." Then Theon, interrupting him, said: <lb/>
            " What is there to prevent the same thing from being at <lb/>
            once both fine and dense, like silken and linen tissues, <lb/>
            touching which Homer hath said :— <lb/>
            “‘ From the bright linen dropped the liquid oil ? <lb/>
            indicating the accuracy and the fineness of the weaving <lb/>
            by the oil's not adhering to it, but slipping off by reason <lb/>
            of its closeness, does not penetrate the texture. And again <lb/>
            one may bring into play not only for the abrasion of surface <lb/>
            in the bronze, the subtility of the air, but the same cause <lb/>
            is likely to render the colour also more agreeable and <lb/>
            bluer, because it mingles lustre with the azure atmosphere."</p>
          <p>V. After this silence followed, and the guides again set <lb/>
            to work with their stories. And upon the recital of a <lb/>
            certain oracle in verse (concerning, I believe, the reign of <lb/>
            Ægon the Argive) Diogenianus observed that he had often <lb/>
            wondered at the badness and vulgarity of the verse in <lb/>
            which the responses were uttered: although the god is <lb/>
            the " Leader of the Muses," and the glory of the so-called <lb/>
            oracle-making no less interests him, than that of tunes, <lb/>
            songs, and auspicious words; and yet both Hesiod and <lb/>
            Homer far excel him in utterance,-and the most part of <note type="footnote"> I Some words have dropped out here, but their sense is easily sup­ <lb/>
            plied. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            his oracles we see are both as to the metre and as to <lb/>
            the expressions a tissue of blunders and badness. Sera­ <lb/>
            pion, therefore, the poet from Athens, who was present, <lb/>
            replied: AAs we consider these verses to be the gods' <lb/>
            own, we ‘ must sing this over again,' as the saying is; <lb/>
            and make no use of the beauties of Hesiod and Homer, <lb/>
            but correct our taste by means of bad habit." 1 To <lb/>
            this Boethus the mathematician (you know the man <lb/>
            who has lately gone over to the Epicureans), answered:</p>
          <p>" Did you ever hear the story about Pauson the painter ? " <lb/>
            “ Not I ever," replied Serapion. " This Pauson, having <lb/>
            been commissioned to paint a horse rolling about, drew it <lb/>
            as running. His customer being angry at this, Pauson, <lb/>
            with a laugh, turned the picture about, so that it was <lb/>
            upside down, when the horse was shown not galloping but <lb/>
            Tolling on its back. For the same reason some people will <lb/>
            say not that the Oracles are well-made because they are <lb/>
            the god's, but that they are not the god's, because they are <lb/>
            badly made ; because the first position is a matter of un­ <lb/>
            certainty, but the other, namely, that the verses containing <lb/>
            the Oracles are not well-made is, to a critic like you, friend <lb/>
            Serapion, a thing as clear as day. For you write poems <lb/>
            yourself in a philosophic and serious style, which in force, <lb/>
            elegance, and finish as to the diction, are inferior rather <lb/>
            to Hesiod and to Homer, than to those uttered by the <lb/>
            Pythian Virgin."</p>
          <p>VI. " Yes," replied Serapion, " because we are diseased <lb/>
            both in ears and eyes, through our luxury and effeminacy, <lb/>
            so that we think pleasant things fine things, and declare <lb/>
            them so. Perhaps we shall find fault with the Pythia for <lb/>
            not declaiming more musically than Glauce, the lyrist nor <lb/>
            using perfumes or clothing herself in purple robes when <lb/>
            she goes down into the cave; nor burning on the altar <note type="footnote"> I t. e. must accustom ourselves to think this bad poetry beautiful; <lb/>
            and not take Homer and Hesiod for the standard of excellence. </note> <lb/>

            cassia, or ladanum, or frankincense, but only bay-leaves <lb/>
            and barley-meal. Do you not see," replied he, " what <lb/>
            grace the songs of Sappho possess, that soothe and enchant <lb/>
            all hearers? But the Sibyl, according to Heraclitus, <lb/>
            ‘ uttering with raving mouth things without a smile, <lb/>
            without embellishment, and without perfume, reaches <lb/>
            down to a thousand years by means of the god.' And <lb/>
            Pindar says that Cadmus heard the god giving forth ‘a <lb/>
            music that was neither correct, nor sweet, nor luxurious, <lb/>
            nor yet broken and uneven in the tunes.' For the Passion­ <lb/>
            less and the Pure does not admit Pleasure, but she hath <lb/>
            been thrown down here below together with Pain, and the <lb/>
            far largest portion of her, as it seems, has flowed in a <lb/>
            stream into the ears of men." 1</p>
          <p>VII. And upon Serapion's saying this, Theon observed <lb/>
            with a smile : " Serapion has given his customary scope to <lb/>
            his feelings, by taking advantage of the conversations <lb/>
            having turned upon the subject of pleasure; but we, <lb/>
            Boethus, even though these verses may be very much <lb/>
            worse than those of Homer, let us not suppose that the <lb/>
            god himself made them, but that while he supplied the <lb/>
            origin with the inspiration, the verses are the productions <lb/>
            of each of the prophetesses in her turn. For if she were <lb/>
            obliged to write down, and not to utter, the responses, we <lb/>
            should not, I suppose, believe the handwriting to be the <lb/>
            god's, and to find fault with it, because it is inferior in point <lb/>
            of calligraphy to the imperial rescripts, for neither the old <lb/>
            woman is the god's, nor her voice, nor her diction, nor her <lb/>
            metre; but it is the god alone that presents the visions to <lb/>
            this woman, and kindles light in her soul as regards the <lb/>
            Future : for the inspiration is this. And to speak gene­ <lb/>
            rally, it is impossible to evade you disciples of Epicurus <lb/>
            (for you manifest yourself carried away by him), for you <note type="footnote"> 1 Men get more pleasure through their ears than through any other <lb/>
            sense. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            accuse of badness both the ancient prophetesses because <lb/>
            they made inferior verses, and also those of the present <lb/>
            day because they speak in prose and in every-day language, <lb/>
            in order that they may not be responsible for headless, <lb/>
            broken-backed, and deficient lines." Then Diogenianus : <lb/>
            " Do not joke, for heaven's sake, but solve the problem for <lb/>
            us, as it is a fine one; besides, there is no one but is seek­ <lb/>
            ing after the cause and reason why the Oracle has given <lb/>
            up employing the metre and expression of poetry." But <lb/>
            Theon in reply : " Nay, my dear boy, we already seem to <lb/>
            have defrauded the guides of their proper business, by <lb/>
            making experiments of our own: suffer them, therefore, <lb/>
            to finish what they have to do, and then let us discuss this <lb/>
            question at our leisure."</p>
          <p>VIII. And as we were now going forward and come <lb/>
            opposite the statue of Hiero the tyrant: the visitor, <lb/>
            although already knowing all about him, nevertheless out <lb/>
            of good nature showed himself a patient listener to the <lb/>
            guide's tale. But on hearing that a bronze column, the <lb/>
            gift of Hiero, standing further up, had fallen down of <lb/>
            itself upon the very day on which Hiero's death happened <lb/>
            at Syracuse, he expressed his surprise, and at the same <lb/>
            time reminded him (the guide) of other occurrences of <lb/>
            like nature, for instance of Hiero 1 the Spartan, how the <lb/>
            eyes fell out of his statue at the moment of his death <lb/>
            in the battle of Leuctra; and how the Twin Stars had <lb/>
            vanished at the same time, which Lysander had dedicated <lb/>
            after the sea-fight at Aigospotamoi ; and the marble statue <lb/>
            of Lysander himself shot forth wild briar and grass in <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably a false reading for Cleombrotus, King of Sparta, who fell <lb/>
            at Leuctra. The story shows that paste eyes were not a Roman inven <lb/>

            half life-size, with carbuncle-garnets for eyes. It was discovered in the <lb/>
            sand on the coast of Rhodes. From the posture it seems to have been a <lb/>
            Paleemon seated on a dolphin. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            such great quantity as to conceal his face; and how, on the <lb/>
            other hand, in the Sicilian disasters of the Athenians, the <lb/>
            golden dates dropped off the Palm-tree, and the shield of <lb/>
            the little image of Pallas, ravens pecked all around. And <lb/>
            the Crown of the Cnidians, which Philomelus, tyrant of <lb/>
            the Phocians, had given to Pharsalia the ballet-girl, was <lb/>
            the cause of her death after she had migrated from Greece <lb/>
            into Italy, and was at Metapontum, disporting herself <lb/>
            around the temple of Apollo. For the young men rushing <lb/>
            to seize her crown, and quarrelling with each other for the <lb/>
            gold, tore the poor creature into pieces.1</p>
          <p>Now Aristotle used to say that Homer alone made <lb/>
            " words that walked," on account of their vividness; but I <lb/>
            say that of the statues standing here, very many walk and <lb/>
            aid in foreshowing the fore-knowledge of the god ; and of <lb/>
            these no one part is void, or senseless, but all filled with <lb/>
            the godhead. Then Boethus: " Nay, truly, is it not <lb/>
            enough for us that the god is shut up once a month in a <lb/>
            mortal body, but we must knead him up with every stone <lb/>
            and piece of metal, just as though we had not a satis­ <lb/>
            factory explanation of all accidents of the sort you have <lb/>
            mentioned, in Chance or in Nature ? " " Then," replied I, <lb/>
            " does each one of such events seem to you to resemble mere <lb/>
            accident and self-movement: and is it credible that your <lb/>
            ‘ atoms ' should slip off, be separated, and move obliquely, <lb/>
            neither before nor after, but exactly at the moment when <lb/>
            each one of the dedicators was about to come to a bad or <lb/>
            good end ? And Epicurus benefits you by what he said <lb/>
            or wrote three hundred years ago,2 but the god, unless he <note type="footnote"> I This crown, therefore, was of little weight, doubtless, from its <lb/>
            distension, in the shape of a wreath of bay leaves, for the girl to have <lb/>

            and Italy, as numerous recorded instances attest. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Epicurus died B.C. 270; whence we get an approximate date for this <lb/>

            exists, either with the final cause of motion, or the efficient <lb/>
            cause of passion ? "</p>
          <p>IX. In this way did I reply to Boethus, and much else <lb/>
            to the same effect respecting the Sibylline oracles. For <lb/>
            when we were arrived, and stopped opposite to the Rock, <lb/>
            over against the Council-house, upon which they tell that <lb/>
            the first Sibyl used to sit, having travelled thither from <lb/>
            Helicon, where she had been brought up by the Muses <lb/>
            (some say she came to Maleon, and was child of Lamia, <lb/>
            daughter of Neptune), Boethus mentioned the Sibylline <lb/>
            verses wherein she says, " That not even after death shall <lb/>
            she cease from prophesying, but shall travel around in the <lb/>
            Moon, and become what is called the Face in the Moon: <lb/>
            her breath mingling with the Air is ever borne alone in <lb/>
            rumours and airy tongues; out of her body, metamor­ <lb/>
            phosed in Earth's bosom, shall spring shrubs and grass <lb/>
            on which shall browse sacred herds that carry on their <lb/>
            entrails all kinds of colours, forms, and qualities, whence <lb/>
            omens of the future come to men." But Boethus laughed <lb/>
            at these Oracles yet more openly than at the others. On <lb/>
            which the visitor observed that even if these tales are <lb/>
            much like fables, yet to the reality of these Oracles bear <lb/>
            witness the uprootings and removals of many Greek cities, <lb/>
            the sudden appearances of barbarian invasions, and the <lb/>
            takings off of great personages. Again, these quite recent1 <lb/>
            and new calamities at Cumæ and Dicæarchia, hymned <lb/>
            forth long ago and sung in the Sibylline verses, hath not <lb/>
            Time made them good as though he were in debt for the <lb/>
            same ? " Burstings forth of mountain fire, boilings up of <lb/>
            the sea, castings up by wind of rocks and fiery masses, <lb/>
            destructions of so many and such great towns, so that <note type="footnote"> I This allusion shows this piece to have been written under Domitian, <lb/>
            soon after the great eruption of Vesuvius, A.D. 79. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            with returning day all memory and trace was lost as to <lb/>
            whereabouts they bad stood, from the country being <lb/>
            turned upside down." That such things have happened <lb/>
            it is hard even to believe now—far more to foretell, with­ <lb/>
            out divine assistance so many centuries ago.</p>
          <p>X. Then Boethus: " What kind of calamity, my good <lb/>
            sir, is not Time in debt to Nature for ? What is there <lb/>
            amongst things strange and improbable with respect to <lb/>
            sea or land, cities or persons, that one can prophesy, and <lb/>
            it not come true at last ? And yet this is almost the same <lb/>
            as not foretelling but telling, or rather casting out and <lb/>
            scattering words that have no final cause into infinite <lb/>
            space ; which words as they wander about Chance encoun­ <lb/>
            ters, and coincides with them of her own accord. For <lb/>
            there is a great difference, I think, between a thing that <lb/>
            has been said coming to pass, and a thing that is to come <lb/>
            to pass being said; because the saying that foretells things <lb/>
            that are not, keeps the failure1 in its own hands unfairly, <lb/>
            and waits for its confirmation from accident; and does not <lb/>
            adduce a real proof of its foretelling, when it knows the <lb/>
            event that has happened after the prediction; because in­ <lb/>
            finity of time offers all sorts of events (to fit the pro­ <lb/>
            phecy) : ‘ He that guesses well,' whom the proverb has <lb/>
            proclaimed ‘ the best diviner,' is like unto one that hunts <lb/>
            for the footprints, and follows the track of the Future, <lb/>
            through probabilities. The Sibyls and the Bacides flung <lb/>
            aimlessly into all Time, as it were into an ocean, just as it <lb/>
            chanced, the names and epithets of all sorts of calamities <lb/>
            and accidents ; amongst which number, though some few <lb/>
            do come to pass through chance, nevertheless what is told <lb/>
            by them to-day is a lie all the same, even though here­ <lb/>
            after, by some chance or other, it may come to happen." <note type="footnote"> I Never confesses to a failure of a prediction, but waits for some <lb/>
            lucky accident in the course of time to turn up corresponding to the <lb/>
            prediction. </note> <pb n="149"/>
            </p>
          <p>XI. When Boethus had finished, Serapion said: “ Boe­ <lb/>
            thus has well expressed his opinion with respect to predic­ <lb/>
            tions, made indefinitely and without foundation, like such <lb/>
            as this, ‘ If victory hath been foretold to a general, he hath <lb/>
            conquered; if ruin to a city, it hath fallen;’ but in cases <lb/>
            where the thing that is to happen is not only told, but <lb/>
            where and when, and after what event, and through whose <lb/>
            means, then it becomes not a guess at what may perhaps <lb/>
            happen, but a foreshowing of things that certainly shall <lb/>
            be. Take for instance this upon the lameness of Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus:— <lb/>
            “‘ Beware, 0 Sparta tho' thou be so vain, <lb/>
            Lest thy sound goings hurt a limping reign, <lb/>
            Unloosed for troubles are in store for thee, <lb/>
            When rolls the war upon the murderous sea.' <lb/>
            And that again upon the island which the sea threw up <lb/>
            off Thera and Therasia, and this upon the war between <lb/>
            Philip and the Romans :— <lb/>
            “‘ When Trojan race hath beat Phœnicians bold, <lb/>
            Then things beyond belief shalt thou behold: <lb/>
            With fire the sea shall shine, in upper air <lb/>
            Whirlwinds from lightnings thro' the waves shall tear ; <lb/>
            Mingled with rock: but it shall stand for aye, <lb/>
            Unnamed by man, an island on that day. <lb/>
            And weaker men shall on the battle field <lb/>
            By force of arms, the stronger make to yield; ’ <lb/>
            That is, that in a short time the Romans should overcome <lb/>
            the Carthaginians by entirely defeating Hannibal, and <lb/>
            that Philip, having engaged in war with the Ætolians and <lb/>
            Romans, should be worsted in battle; and, lastly, that an <lb/>
            island should rise up out of the deep, along with much <lb/>
            fire and boiling waves. No one will say that all these <lb/>
            things hit and coincided together by mere chance and <lb/>
            spontaneously; but their succession proves manifestly the <lb/>
            fore-knowledge of the prediction, and the fact that she (the <lb/>
            Pythia) foretold to the Romans, about five hundred years <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            beforehand, the time in which all the nations of the world <lb/>
            together should war with them (that is they should war <lb/>
            with the revolted slaves); in all this there is nought said <lb/>
            at random, or blindfold, or where the explanation must be <lb/>
            sought after in perplexity, and depend upon accident; but <lb/>
            it presents many sureties derived from experience, and <lb/>
            points out the path along which destiny walks. For I do <lb/>
            not imagine anyone will say in this case that events turned <lb/>
            out in the way they were predicted, by mere chance; else <lb/>
            what hinders us, my dear Boethus, from saying that <lb/>
            Epicurus did not write his established doctrines, but that <lb/>
            from the letters impinging upon one another by chance <lb/>
            and spontaneously the book was brought about ? "</p>
          <p>XII. Whilst this talk was going on, we continued to <lb/>
            advance. And in the Hall of the Corinthians, when gazing <lb/>
            at the Palm-tree in bronze, which is still remaining there <lb/>
            of the offerings, the snakes and frogs in relief around the <lb/>
            root of the tree occasioned surprise to Diogeneanus, and <lb/>
            certainly to ourselves as well; because the palm is not <lb/>
            like other trees, a native of marshes, nor is it a water­ <lb/>
            loving plant; neither have frogs anything to do with the <lb/>
            Corinthians, so as to become a symbol or a badge of the <lb/>
            city, in the same way that the people of Selinus are said <lb/>
            to have once dedicated a parsley-plant in gold, and those <lb/>
            of Tenedos an axe, from the crabs that are only found <lb/>
            amongst them around the place called Asterion, because <lb/>
            they are the only sort, it seems, that have the figure of an <lb/>
            axe painted upon their upper shell. And, indeed, one <lb/>
            would think ravens, and swans, and wolves, and hawks, <lb/>
            and anything else than these reptiles would be agreeable <lb/>
            to the god. And upon Serapion's saying that the artist <lb/>
            had intimated thus the nutrition of the Sun from mois­ <lb/>
            ture, and his origin and exhalation, whether that he had <lb/>
            heard Homer’s— <lb/>
            “ Hasten the Sun to quit the beauteous pond,” <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            or whether he had seen the Egyptians representing the <lb/>
            beginning of sunrise as a new-born babe seated upon a <lb/>
            lotus. Then I, laughingly, " Where, my good friend, <lb/>
            are you pushing on the Porch, and still slipping into the <lb/>
            story your ‘ lightings up ’ and your‘ exhalations you cer­ <lb/>
            tainly are not drawing down the moon and sun, like the <lb/>
            Thessalian witches, because, according to you, they grow <lb/>
            up and originate here below, out of earth and the waters. <lb/>
            For Plato hath called Man ‘ a celestial plant,' because he <lb/>
            is carried up from the head as from a root; but you laugh <lb/>
            Empedocles to scorn for saying ‘ that the sun when going <lb/>
            round the earth breaks off fragments of heavenly light, <lb/>
            but again shines against Olympus with undismayed coun­ <lb/>
            tenance whilst you yourselves make him out to be some <lb/>
            earth-born animal or plant-lacustrine, and register him in <lb/>
            the family of frogs or water serpents. But this sort of <lb/>
            thing let us give up to stoical bombast; and the accessories <lb/>
            of artists let us examine in a matter-of-fact sort of way ; for <lb/>
            in many cases they are ingenious enough, though they have <lb/>
            not everywhere avoided the pedantic and over-refined. For <lb/>
            example, he that placed the Cock upon the hand of Apollo, <lb/>
            intimated thereby the morning tide and the hour of ap­ <lb/>
            proaching sunrise ; in the same way one may say the frogs <lb/>
            here were made the symbol of the spring season, when the <lb/>
            sun begins to get power over the air, and to loosen the <lb/>
            bonds of winter; that is, if we must, like you, consider <lb/>
            Apollo and the Sun, not as two different deities, but as <lb/>
            one and the same." " What!" asked Serapion, "do not you <lb/>
            think it so ? and do you hold that the Sun is different <lb/>
            from Apollo ? " " Yes," replied I, " as much as the Moon <lb/>
            differs from the Sun, but she hides the Sun not fre­ <lb/>
            quently nor from all men at once ; whereas the Sun hath <lb/>
            caused all people to forget Apollo, by diverting their atten­ <lb/>
            tion, by the means of the sense, from the Real to the <lb/>
            Apparent."</p><pb n="152"/>
            
          <p>XIII. After this, Serapion asked the guides, " Why do <lb/>
            you name this Hall, not from Cypselus who first dedicated <lb/>
            it, but from the Corinthians ? " From their silence, there <lb/>
            seems to me, at least, to be some uncertainty about the <lb/>
            cause. " How, pray," said I, laughing, “do you expect <lb/>
            them either to know or to remember anything at all, <lb/>
            scared out of their wits as they be by your subtle disquisi­ <lb/>
            tions ? We have already heard them telling how the <lb/>
            Corinthians, when the tyranny was put down, were wish­ <lb/>
            ing to inscribe both the gods' statue that was at Pisa and <lb/>
            the Treasury here with the name of the City: the Del­ <lb/>
            phians granted the thing, as being just, and consented to <lb/>
            it; but the Eleans refused it out of envy, whereupon the <lb/>
            Corinthians passed a law that excluded them from the <lb/>
            Isthmian Games; and from thenceforth no man of Elis <lb/>
            has ever been a competitor at the Isthmian Games; but <lb/>
            the slaughter of the Molionidæ by Hercules, near Cleonæ, <lb/>
            is not the cause, as some think, why the Eleans are so ex. <lb/>
            eluded ; for, on the contrary, it would have been natural <lb/>
            to exclude them, had they quarrelled with the Corinthians <lb/>
            on account of that slaughter, which they did not." Thus <lb/>
            farther spoke I.</p>
          <p>XIV. And when the guide showed us the Hall of the <lb/>
            Acanthians and Brasidas, the place where the iron spits1 <lb/>
            of Rhodope the courtesan formerly lay, Diogenianus, <lb/>
            being indignant, exclaimed, " 'Twas surely right and proper <lb/>
            for the same city to grant Rhodope a place wherein to <lb/>
            deposit the tithes of her prostitution, and to put to death <lb/>
            Æsop, her fellow in slavery." Then Serapion: " Why are <lb/>
            you angry, my fine fellow, at this ? look up there above, <lb/>
            and behold amongst captains and kings the Mnesarete 2 in <note type="footnote"> 1 This offering, besides its appropriate symbolism (which alone was <lb/>
            remembered in Plutarch's days), had considerable pecuniary value at <lb/>
            the time of its dedication, considering the then scarcity of the metaL </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Another celebrity of the same profession. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            gold, which Crates said was dedicated as a trophy over the <lb/>
            incontinence of Greece." "But," said the youth, "was <lb/>
            not this said of Phryne by Crates ? " " Yes, truly," an­ <lb/>
            swered Serapion, " her real name was Mnesarete, but she <lb/>
            got the nickname of Phryne1 by reason of her paleness ; <lb/>
            for the nicknames often obliterate the true names: for <lb/>
            example, Alexander's mother, Polyxena, they say, was <lb/>
            afterwards called Myrtale, then Olympias and Stratonice ; <lb/>
            and the Corinthian Eumelis most people to the present <lb/>
            day call Cleobule by her family name; also Herophile of <lb/>
            Erythræ, a woman with the gift of prophesy, they entitle <lb/>
            Sibylla; and you will hear the grammarians pretending <lb/>
            that Leda was named Mnesinæa, and Orestes Achæus. <lb/>
            But how," said he, looking towards Theon, " do you in­ <lb/>
            tend to refute this charge with respect to Phryne ? "</p>
          <p>XV. And he, with a smile: " In such a way that I in <lb/>
            my turn accuse you of censuring the very smallest of all <lb/>
            Grecian faults. For like as Socrates, in the case of Callias, <lb/>
            quarrels only with his perfuming himself, and puts up with <lb/>
            the sight of dances of boys, and tumblers, and kisses, and <lb/>
            buffoons, in the same way you seem to me to be shutting <lb/>
            out of the sacred ground a poor wench for making use of <lb/>
            her personal beauty in no very respectable manner; but <lb/>
            though you see the god here surrounded on all sides with <lb/>
            the first-fruits and tithes of slaughter, wars, and plunder­ <lb/>
            ings, and his temple filled with Grecian spoils and trophies, <lb/>
            you do not get angry, nor call the Greeks most disgraced <lb/>
            on the score of their fine offerings of the sort, when you <lb/>
            read such inscriptions as ‘ Brasidas and the Acanthians, <lb/>
            from the Athenians;' and The Athenians from the Corin­ <lb/>
            thians;’ and ‘ The Phocians from the Thessalians;’ and <lb/>
            ‘ The Orneatæ from the Sicyonians ;’ and ' The Amphic­ <lb/>
            tyons from the Phocians.' But Praxiteles offended Crates <note type="footnote"> 1 A toad; paleness being yellowness in the south: “ pallidior buxo, <lb/>
            semianimisque fui." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            only with his mistress, and met with his reward of her in <lb/>
            such a place;' whereas Crates ought rather to have com­ <lb/>
            mended him because he set up amongst these golden kings <lb/>
            a courtesan in gold, thereby casting reproach on gold, as <lb/>
            possessing nought that is to be admired or venerated; <lb/>
            seeing that it is becoming to lay before the god the offer­ <lb/>
            ings of virtue, or temperance, and of magnanimity, both <lb/>
            for kings and rulers, not those of golden luxurious wealth <lb/>
            wherein even the men of most infamous lives have their <lb/>
            part.</p>
          <p>XVI. " You do not mention the fact said the other of <lb/>
            the two guides, " that Crcesus caused to be made and de­ <lb/>
            dicated here the golden statue of the woman, his baker <lb/>
            .... not out of wanton insult to the holy place, but <lb/>
            because he had an honourable and just cause for so doing. <lb/>
            For the story goes that Algattes, father of Crœsus, had <lb/>
            taken a second wife, and had children by the same; this <lb/>
            woman plotted against the life of Crcesus, and gave poison <lb/>
            to the baker, ordering her to knead it up in a loaf for <lb/>
            Crcesus; but the bakeress privately told Crcesus, and set <lb/>
            the bread before the children of his step-mother; in return <lb/>
            for which Crcesus, when he came to the throne, requited <lb/>
            the woman's kindness, taking, as it were, the god for wit­ <lb/>
            ness of his gratitude, in which, truly, he did well. For <lb/>
            which reason," added he, out of many cities, " such an <lb/>
            offering as this, one of the Opuntians is deserving to be <lb/>
            admired and honoured; for after the tyrants of the <lb/>
            Phocians had melted down many of the gold and silver <lb/>
            offerings and coined money therewith, and distributed it <lb/>
            around different States, the Opuntians collected all that <note type="footnote"> I A far-fetched argument-Orates ought to have been more offended <lb/>
            by an offering in gold being made to the god, than by the character of <lb/>
            the person represented. “ Golden " merely signifies gilt, or rather over­ <lb/>
            laid with a thick leaf of gold. And this multitude of statues was in <lb/>
            existence after Nero had carried offfive hundred at one swoop! </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            silver coin, and sent back a water-vessel1 to the god, which <lb/>
            they dedicated to him. I commend the people of Myrina and <lb/>
            of Apollonia for sending hither wheat-sheaves in gold, but <lb/>
            yet more those of Eretria and of Magnesia who presented <lb/>
            the god with the first-fruits of human beings, as the giver of <lb/>
            fruits paternal, presiding over generation, and the friend of <lb/>
            man. But I blame those of Megara, because they, almost alone <lb/>
            of those in this place, set up the god with a spear in his <lb/>
            hand, in memory of the fight in which, after the Persian <lb/>
            War, they drove out the Athenians who had already got pos­ <lb/>
            session of their town ; afterwards, however, they dedicated <lb/>
            to the god a plectrum of gold, taking the hint, probably, <lb/>
            from Scythinus 2 saying of the lyre :— <lb/>
            " ‘ Which Apollo takes, <lb/>
            Jove's beauteous offspring, he that comprehends <lb/>
            Of all things the beginning and the end; <lb/>
            And has the sun-light for his shining plectrum.'"</p>
          <p>XVII. And when Serapion was attempting to make some <lb/>
            remarks upon the subject, the visitor interrupted him with: <lb/>
            " It is indeed pleasant, listening to tales of this kind; but <lb/>
            I am under the necessity to demand the fulfilment of your <lb/>
            promise about the cause that has made the Pythia desist <lb/>
            from delivering oracles in epic verse, or in other metres. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if you please, let us suspend the rest of the sight- <lb/>
            seeing ; let us hear something upon that point, sitting down <lb/>
            here, since that subject is the one that most nearly concerns <lb/>
            the credit of the Oracle, because one of two things must <lb/>
            be the case—either that the Pythia no longer approaches <lb/>
            the place where the divine thing resides, or else that the <lb/>
            exhalation is extinguished, and its power come to an end." <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐδρία</foreign>, the largest size of vase, made out of the sacrilegious coin, thus <lb/>
            restored to its old destination. The fact shows that the coinage of the <lb/>

             <pb n="156"/>
            We therefore went round, and sat down upon the southern <lb/>
            steps of the shrine, looking towards the Temple of the <lb/>
            Earth and the Water; so that Boethus immediately ob­ <lb/>
            served that the place itself assisted the visitor in his in­ <lb/>
            quiry, for there was a temple of the Muses by the pool1 <lb/>
            of the Spring, which too they used for making libation as <lb/>
            Stesichorus sings :— <lb/>
            " There, from above is drawn the pure water for the <lb/>
            basins of the Muses with their beautiful locks."</p>
          <p>And again, somewhat more elaborately, Simonides ad­ <lb/>
            dresses Clio as,­ <lb/>
            “ Chaste guardian of lustral basins, draw the far-famed <lb/>
            water from the deep recesses-not cloaked in gold, but <lb/>
            perfumed, undying, and much to be desired."</p>
          <p>Eudoxus, therefore, was wrong in believing those who <lb/>
            make out that this was called the " Water of Styx." They <lb/>
            therefore set up the Muses for companions of Prophecy, <lb/>
            and for guardians round about the stream itself, and also <lb/>
            built the Temple of the Earth, to whom the Oracle is said <lb/>
            to have first belonged 2 The delivering of oracles in <lb/>
            epic verse and poetry. But others assert that the heroic <lb/>
            measure was heard here for the first time :— <lb/>
            “ Collect your feathers, birds ; your wax, ye bees ”— <lb/>
            .... [ On its] becoming necessary to the god to <lb/>
            cast away his gravity.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Then Serapion: "This language is more gentle <lb/>
            and more civil than what you used before; for we must <lb/>
            not quarrel with Theon, and abolish along with the <lb/>
            prophetic Power, Providence, and the Divinity as well; <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπνοὴ</foreign>, i. e. where the stream tumbling from the rock finds a <lb/>

            words to complete it, probably [and who invented]. Then Plutarch <lb/>
            cites another tradition, ascribing the same thing to the latest owner, <lb/>
            Apollo. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            but rather seek for explanations of the facts that ap­ <lb/>
            pear to run counter to these ideas; and not to cast <lb/>
            away the pious faith of our fathers." " You say rightly, <lb/>
            my excellent Serapion," replied I, “ for neither do we de­ <lb/>
            spair of Philosophy as entirely destroyed and ruined, <lb/>
            because in old times philosophers used to publish their <lb/>
            dogmas and their arguments in the shape of poems, as for <lb/>
            instance, Orpheus, Hesiod, Parmenides, Xenophanes, and <lb/>
            Empedocles, and Thales—but afterwards they gave it up, <lb/>
            and ceased making use of verses-all but yourself; for by <lb/>
            your means Poetry doth once more descend into Philosophy, <lb/>

            Timocharis, Aristyllus, and Hipparchus writing in prose, <lb/>
            whereas Eudoxus, Hesiod, and Thales formerly wrote in <lb/>
            verse; if, indeed, Thales really did compose the ‘ Astro­ <lb/>
            nomy ' attributed to him. And Pindar confesses that he <lb/>
            himself is quite at a loss about the neglect of the use of <lb/>
            verse, and is astonished . . . . 1 It is neither wicked nor <lb/>
            absurd for people to inquire into the causes of changes of <lb/>
            the sort; but to do away with the sciences themselves if <lb/>
            anything belonging to them be meddled with or changed, <lb/>
            is very unfair."</p>
          <p>XIX. Then Theon taking up the conversation : “ These <lb/>
            sciences have indeed undergone many changes and innova­ <lb/>
            tions : but as for things here, we know that many predic­ <lb/>
            tions in those old times were uttered in plain prose, and <lb/>

            the Lacedæmonians consulted the Oracle concerning their <lb/>
            war with the Athenians it predicted to them victory and suc­ <lb/>
            cess, and also that it would help them, asked or unasked; <lb/>
            and that if they did not restore Pausanias, they would <note type="footnote"> 1 The quotation has been omitted by the copyist, who (like other <lb/>

            have to plough with a silver ploughshare. To the Athe­ <lb/>
            neans also, when consulting the Oracle about their expe­ <lb/>
            dition into Sicily, it advised them to bring up from <lb/>
            Erythree the priestess of Minerva. Now the wench was <lb/>
            called ‘ Quiet' by name. And when Dinomenes the Sicilian <lb/>
            consulted the Oracle about his sons, it responded that all <lb/>
            three should be tyrants. That is, with a mischief to them <lb/>
            —' is it not so, my Lord Apollo ?' asked Dinomenes. ‘ This, <lb/>
            too, I make you a present of, and give into the bargain as <lb/>
            response,' it was the reply. You all know that Gelon <lb/>
            reigned with the dropsy, Hieron with the stone, and Thra­ <lb/>
            sybulus after passing a short time in the midst of war and <lb/>
            seditions was driven out of his power. Procus, tyrant of <lb/>
            Epidaurus, had destroyed many people cruelly and un­ <lb/>
            justly, and when Timarchus had come to him from Athens <lb/>
            with money in his possession, after receiving him with <lb/>
            great show of friendship, he murdered him secretly, put <lb/>
            the body into a hamper, and sank it in the sea. This he did <lb/>
            by the hand of Oleander of Ægina, unknown to all the <lb/>
            rest. But afterwards, when his affairs were growing <lb/>
            troubled, he despatched hither his brother Cleotimus, to <lb/>
            consult in private the best means for escape and emigra­ <lb/>
            tion. But the god responded ' that he granted Procus <lb/>
            escape and emigration to where he had bidden his Ægi­ <lb/>
            netan friend to deposit the hamper; or else where the <lb/>
            stag puts down his horn.' The tyrant, therefore, under­ <lb/>
            standing that the god bade him either drown or bury him­ <lb/>
            self (because stags bury and hide in the earth their antlers <lb/>
            when shed),1 waited a little while, and then his affairs <lb/>
            being utterly ruined, was driven into exile. But the friends <lb/>
            of Timarchus got hold of him, and having put him to death, <lb/>
            flung his dead body into the sea. And, what is the greatest <lb/>

            Lacedæmonian constitution were given to him word for <lb/>
            word at this placed Now, though Alyrius, Herodotus, Philo­ <lb/>
            chorus, and Istrus, the persons most zealous in collecting <lb/>
            oracles in verse, have also recorded responses not in metre, <lb/>
            Theopompus, who has been as careful as any man in the <lb/>
            matter of the Oracle, has sharply rebuked such as believed <lb/>
            at that time that the Pythia no longer delivered metrical <lb/>
            responses; and then, wishing to give proof of his asser­ <lb/>
            tion, found he had but a very scanty supply, inasmuch as <lb/>
            even then the responses were usually delivered in prose.2</p>
          <p>XX. " Even at the present day some Oracles run out in <lb/>
            metre, of which I cite an example that has made a great <lb/>
            noise in the world. There is in Phocis a temple of Hercules <lb/>
            the Misogynist, where it is the law that the appointed <lb/>
            priest shall not have to do with women during his year of <lb/>
            office; for which reason they elect for priests men tole­ <lb/>
            rably advanced in years. Not long ago, a young man, not <lb/>
            a bad one, but ambitious, having an amour with a servant­ <lb/>
            girl, obtained the appointment, and at first was continent, <lb/>
            and kept out of the way of the wench; but as he lay <lb/>
            asleep after drinking and dancing, she fell upon him and <lb/>
            he did her business for her.3 Being terrified and troubled <lb/>
            in mind at what he had done he had recourse to the <lb/>
            Oracle and inquired of the god about his sin, if there were <lb/>
            any remedy or expiation for it; and he received this <lb/>
            response­ <lb/>
            “‘ God pardons everything that can't be helped.’ 4 <lb/>
            " Not but that even if you grant that no response is de­ <lb/>

            more perplexed with respect to the ancient Oracles deliver­ <lb/>
            ing their answers sometimes in metre, sometimes without <lb/>
            it. For neither the one nor the other, my dear boy, is <lb/>
            contrary to reason, if only we entertain correct and un­ <lb/>
            prejudiced notions about the deity, and do not suppose it <lb/>
            was himself that composed the verses in former times, or <lb/>
            that now prompts the Pythia and speaks through her as <lb/>
            though through a mask.</p>
          <p>XXI. " But it is worth while to say something more <lb/>
            at length, and to inquire about these points, and as we <lb/>
            have taken a brief view of the present one, let us bear in <lb/>
            mind that the body employs many organs, the soul em­ <lb/>
            ploys the body and the members of the body, the soul <lb/>
            itself is the organ of the god. Now, the goodness of an <lb/>
            instrument lies in imitating that which employs its natural <lb/>
            power, and in its producing the object of the design involved <lb/>
            in its construction ; though it is not competent to exhibit <lb/>
            what that design was in its Maker, unmixed, impassive, <lb/>
            and without error, but produces it mingled with much <lb/>
            that is extraneous; for by itself it is senseless to us, <lb/>
            but when made to appear another thing, and worked by <lb/>
            the agency of another, it is then filled with its proper <lb/>
            nature. And I pass over wax, and gold, and silver, and <lb/>
            bronze, and whatever other sorts of plastic materials <lb/>
            receive one form of resemblance modelled out of them, but <lb/>
            yet each adds from itself a different variation to the copy.1 <lb/>
            And the innumerable distortions of the appearances and <lb/>
            images from one object in mirrors flat, or convex, or con­ <lb/>
            cave : for they are .... But there is nothing so like in <lb/>
            form, or organ created for the use of Nature, that can <lb/>
            afford us a more convincing proof, than does the Moon. <lb/>
            For, though she receives from the Sun both that which is <lb/>
            shining and that which is fiery, she does not send it back <note type="footnote"> 1 The same object modelled in different materials, has a different ap­ <lb/>
            pearance. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            to us the same as it was, but when mingled with herself <lb/>
            it both changes its colour, and acquires a different quality: <lb/>
            its heat is entirely gone, and its light is also deficient by <lb/>
            reason of its weakness. And I fancy you know the say­ <lb/>
            ing in Heraclitus, ‘ that the sovereign, whose Oracle is at <lb/>
            Delphi, neither hides nor reveals the future, but hints at <lb/>
            it.' Make an addition, therefore, to this, so well said, <lb/>
            and conceive the god here as employing the Pythia for <lb/>
            hearing [being heard] in the same way as the Sun employs <lb/>
            the Moon for seeing [being seen], she shows his thoughts <lb/>
            aloud, but she exhibits them mixed with something else, <lb/>
            by the agency of a mortal body, and a soul that is not <lb/>
            able to keep quiet.1 Unable to present herself, standing <lb/>
            by herself, unmoved to the moving power, but as it were <lb/>
            in a state of agitation, feeling about and entangled with <lb/>
            the emotions in herself, and the passions that trouble her. <lb/>
            For just as the whirlpools do not entirely master the <lb/>
            bodies that are carried around with them, but as partly <lb/>
            they be carried round in spite of themselves, partly tend <lb/>
            to the bottom by their own nature, of both which forces <lb/>
            the result is a confused and irregular circumvolution-in <lb/>
            like manner the so-called inspiration is probably the mix­ <lb/>
            ture of two impulses, the one of the soul moved by exter­ <lb/>
            nal impressions; the other, as it is moved by its own <lb/>
            nature. For since it is not easy to use inanimate and <lb/>
            motionless objects for a purpose to which they are [not]2 <lb/>
            naturally adapted, by using force to them, as for instance, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ δυναμένη</foreign> cannot begin a sentence, and therefore must receive a <lb/>
            final s and finish the preceding one. The first word of the next is lost, <lb/>
            being probably of similar sound. It is curious to observe how, through­ <lb/>
            out all these treatises, the copyist has transcribed anecdotes and in­ <lb/>
            teresting matter correctly enough, but when he comes to dry philosophy <lb/>
            he scribbles away without caring for or understanding what he in <lb/>
            about, omitting words, and inserting them again in wrong places, as <lb/>

            the manner of a flute, or a trumpet in the way of a guitar. <lb/>
            But if, at is reasonable, the using each object according to <lb/>
            the rules of art is no other than the using it for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose for which it is made: surely, then, it is impossible <lb/>
            to say how anyone can handle that which is animated and <lb/>
            self-impelled, and endowed with appetite and reason, other­ <lb/>
            wise than consistently with its constitution ; .... lone one <lb/>

            of logic.</p>
          <p>XXII. “ Homer himself bears me out, by representing <lb/>
            nothing at all, so to speak, as coming to pass without the <lb/>
            intervention of a god: not, indeed, that he makes the god <lb/>
            use all means indiscriminately to all purposes, but each <lb/>
            one according to its respective talent or force. Do you not <lb/>
            see (said I), my dear Diogenianus, Minerva when she wants <lb/>
            to persuade the Greeks to anything, incites Ulysses to <lb/>
            speak; when she wishes to break the treaty she looks out <lb/>
            for Pandarus; when the Trojans are to be routed she has <lb/>
            recourse to Diomede: because one is robust and valiant; <lb/>
            another an archer and thoughtless; another eloquent <lb/>
            and wise. For Homer did not hold the same belief with <lb/>
            Pindar, if indeed it were Pindar that wrote, 'If God <lb/>
            pleases, you may go to sea upon a hurdle.' But he knew <lb/>
            that different faculties and natures are made for different <lb/>
            ends; each one of which is moved in a different manner, <lb/>
            and [by that cause] in which resides that which moves all <lb/>
            collectively : as, for instance, that which moves the pedes­ <lb/>
            trian has no power in the way of flying, or that moving <lb/>
            the stammerer in the way of distinct utterance, or the man <lb/>
            with squeaking voice in that of a fine voice; although <note type="footnote"> I Some words lost here to the effect; To act otherwise would be <lb/>

            Battus, I ween, for this very cause, when he came to his <lb/>
            full stature, did his friends send out as colonist to Libya, <lb/>
            because he was a stammerer and had a squeaking voice, <lb/>
            but possessed the qualities of a king, a statesman, and a <lb/>
            philosopher-in the same way he is incompetent to dis­ <lb/>
            course poetically who is unlettered, and has never listened <lb/>
            to verses. For just as she who at present is servant to the <lb/>
            god at this place was born legitimately and honourably, <lb/>
            and has spent her life in a virtuous manner; but having <lb/>
            been bred up in the house of poor country folks has ac­ <lb/>
            quired nothing from education or from practice or help of <lb/>
            other sort, when she goes down into the oracular cave; but <lb/>
            just as Xenophon recommends that the bride should come <lb/>
            to her husband, having seen as little as possible, having <lb/>
            heard as little as possible, so doth she hold converse with <lb/>
            the god, without experience, all but without hearing of <lb/>
            anything, and truly a virgin in her soul. But we believe <lb/>
            that the god, to signify his will, makes use of crying <lb/>
            herons, wrens, and ravens; and we do not demand, in <lb/>
            case they be the messengers and envoys of the gods, <lb/>
            that they shall speak everything plainly and rationally. <lb/>
            But the voice and language of the Pythia we demand to <lb/>
            be presented to us as though from off the stage, not un­ <lb/>
            adorned and plain, but in verse, bombast, and affectation, <lb/>
            with metaphors of names, and declaimed to the accom­ <lb/>
            paniment of the flute.</p>
          <p>XXIII. " What then shall we say about the Oracles of <lb/>
            old? Not one thing, I fancy, but many. In the first <lb/>
            place, they also generally declared themselves in prose. <lb/>
            Secondly, those old times produced temperaments and <lb/>
            constitutions of body that had quite a different tendency <lb/>
            to poetry than ours, upon which immediately grew up <lb/>
            desires, inclinations, and proclivities of soul, that required <lb/>
            but a small hint or impulse from without, and made them <lb/>
            very ready to be drawn along to what was congenial to <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            their nature. As Philinus observes, we have known, not <lb/>
            merely astrologers and philosophers, but persons under <lb/>
            the influence of wine, or some powerful passion, either of <lb/>
            overwhelming sorrow, or of sudden joy, sliding involun­ <lb/>
            tarily into poetical language .... have filled feasts with <lb/>
            amatory verses and songs, and books with compositions <lb/>
            of the same kind. For Euripides hath said,­ <lb/>
            “‘ Love makes a poet of a clown before”— <lb/>
            not that Love puts in him the poetical and musical faculty, <lb/>
            but only stirs up, and excites what before was concealed <lb/>
            and dormant. Or must we say, Mr. Stranger, that nobody <lb/>
            falls in love nowadays, and that Cupid is gone and <lb/>
            vanished, because no one now, as Pindar hath it, ‘ In <lb/>
            verses or songs swiftly shoots at youths his sweet-voiced <lb/>
            strains?' Absurd this-for hosts of Loves drive man <lb/>
            about, and consort with souls not indeed disposed by <lb/>
            nature, or fitted for poetry-Loves, truly, that be unpro­ <lb/>
            vided with flute, unarmed with lyre, yet no less loquacious <lb/>
            and fervent than those of old. For it is not allowable so <lb/>
            much as to say that the Academy was loveless, nor Socrates <lb/>
            and the school of Plato ; since you may meet with their <lb/>
            amatory treatises, and their amatory poems 1 are not yet <lb/>
            obsolete. For what difference is there in saying that <lb/>
            Sappho was the only woman that ever was in love, and <lb/>
            in asserting that the only prophetess was the Sibyl, or <lb/>
            Aristonica, or all such as delivered oracles in verse. For <lb/>
            wine, as Chæremon says, mixes itself up with the tempers <lb/>
            of such as drink it; whilst the prophetic inspiration, like <lb/>
            the amatory, acts upon the subject faculty, and moves each <lb/>
            one of those who take it in according to the way in which <lb/>
            each is constituted by nature. <note type="footnote"> 1 Such as Plato's lines to Agatho : </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>XXIV. " Not but that if we consider the question of the <lb/>
            god and his foreknowledge, we shall find the change made <lb/>
            for the better. For the use of language is like the <lb/>
            exchange of coin that acquires a different value at different <lb/>
            times [and of it what is familiar and well-known passes <lb/>
            current]1. There was a time when people used for the <lb/>
            currency of speech, verses and tunes and songs, converting <lb/>
            into music and poetry, all history, all philosophy, every <lb/>
            passion, and to speak generally, every circumstance that <lb/>
            required more dignified utterance. For things that nowa­ <lb/>
            days few people listen to, everybody then used to hear, <lb/>
            and took pleasure in their being sung ; ‘ ploughmen and <lb/>
            fowlers too,' as Pindar bath it. Nay, through this apti­ <lb/>
            tude for poetry most persons admonished others by means <lb/>
            of the lyre and song: they spoke their minds, they <lb/>
            comforted others, they did their business with fables and <lb/>
            with songs; furthermore they caused to be made in verse <lb/>
            and songs the hymns of the gods, prayers, and thanks­ <lb/>
            givings ; partly from natural aptitude that way, partly <lb/>
            from old custom. For which reason, the god did not <lb/>
            begrudge decoration and grace to the oracular power <lb/>
            either, nor did he drive away from hence the honoured <lb/>
            Muse from the Tripod; on the contrary, he invited her <lb/>
            hither, by stirring up and welcoming poetic temperaments <lb/>
            and himself inspiring their imaginations, whilst he helped <lb/>
            to promote the high-flown and verbose style in the re­ <lb/>
            sponses, as appropriate and admired. But when, from <lb/>
            the world's suffering change along with its vicissitudes <lb/>
            and its tempers, Custom cast off everything superfluous, <lb/>
            and removed the golden top-knots [of the god] and <lb/>
            divested him of his soft gown, and perhaps cropped his <lb/>
            too luxuriant locks, and unstrung his lyre; at which time <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δόκιμον μὲν αὐτου̃ ἐστὶ τὸ ξύνηθες καὶ γνώριμον</foreign>, which seems both <lb/>

            we accustomed ourselves, not wrongly, to oppose the <lb/>
            charms of economy to extravagant expense, and to hold in <lb/>
            honour that which is simple and neat rather than what is <lb/>
            ostentatious and over-refined. In the same way, from <lb/>
            language changing together with the times, and similarly <lb/>
            stripping itself bare, History descended out of verse, as it <lb/>
            were out of a chariot,1 and the true was distinguished from <lb/>
            the fabulous chiefly by the use of prose. Philosophy also, <lb/>
            having embraced the clear and instructive in preference to <lb/>
            the sensational style, pursued her investigations in ordi­ <lb/>
            nary language. The god too made the Pythia cease from <lb/>
            calling her fellow-citizens " firebrands," the Spartans, <lb/>
            "serpent-eaters," men "seers," and rivers mountain­ <lb/>
            drinkers." He took away from his responses their heroic <lb/>
            verses, glosses, circumlocutions, and obscurity; he presented <lb/>
            them, so to speak, to such as consult him in the same <lb/>
            form as laws speak to citizens, kings reply to their sub­ <lb/>
            jects, and scholars hear their teachers speak, and adapted <lb/>
            himself to what is intelligible and persuasive.</p>
          <p>XXV. " For you ought to know that the god is, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Sophocles, <lb/>
            I' To wise men, an oracular riddle-maker, <lb/>
            To fools a bad instructor even in trifles.' <lb/>
            And together with intelligibility thus introduced, Faith <lb/>
            also took a turn, sharing in the change of all the rest; for <lb/>
            whereas of old time, whatever was unusual and not public, <lb/>
            but obscure and regularly veiled, the vulgar construed into <lb/>
            something hallowed, and were astounded thereby and <lb/>
            revered the same ; but afterwards being content with the <lb/>
            learning things plainly and easily, and without bombast or <lb/>
            fiction, they found fault with the poetry that enveloped <lb/>
            the responses, as being an obstacle to understanding them <note type="footnote"> 1 As we should say, “ from off the stage;" referring to the old expres­ <lb/>
            sion <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξ ἁμάξης λέγεν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            in their true sense, because it mixed up obscurity and shade <lb/>
            with the thing revealed. Nay, already had they viewed <lb/>
            with suspicion all circumlocutions, enigmas, and double- <lb/>
            senses, as contrived for loopholes and refuges for the <lb/>
            blunders of prophecy. And one might hear many assert­ <lb/>
            ing that certain men of poetical faculty were ever sitting <lb/>
            round about the Oracle, receiving and catching up all <lb/>
            sounds, and weaving heroic verses, metres, and rhythms, <lb/>
            like so many envelopes wrapped all about the responses, <lb/>
            out of their own heads. And persons like Onomacritus and <lb/>
            Prodotes and Cinesion—what blame did they not get on <lb/>
            the score of their Oracles, for having added tragic phrases <lb/>
            and bombast to what was in no need thereof—I omit to <lb/>
            mention, or to join in the cry against them.1 The greatest <lb/>
            discredit, however, of all, was brought upon poetry by the <lb/>
            set of mountebanks, and market-haunters that roam <lb/>
            about, and play off their buffoonery round the temples <lb/>
            of the Great Mother, and those of Serapis : and who <lb/>
            manufacture Oracles, some out of their own head, some <lb/>
            according to lot from certain books, for the benefit of <lb/>
            servants and poor wenches, who are led away more by the <lb/>
            metre than by the poetical merit of the words. For which <lb/>
            reason most of all, Poetry being seen to prostitute herself <lb/>
            to cheats, jugglers, and false prophets, hath been expelled <lb/>
            from the domains of Truth, and the oracular tripod.</p>
          <p>XXVI. " I shall not, therefore, be surprised if some of <lb/>
            the ancient responses required a double, involved language, <lb/>
            and obscurity. For in those times such and such a one <lb/>
            did not go to consult the Oracle about the purchase of a <lb/>
            slave, or another about the success of his speculations <lb/>
            in trade, but mighty republics, and kings, and tyrants <lb/>
            extravagantly proud, conferred with the god about their <lb/>
            own affairs, whom to vex, and excite to hostility by their <lb/>
            hearing before-hand many things contrary to their wishes, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταβόλαις</foreign> in text must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαβόλαις</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            was by no meams to the advantage of the keepers of the <lb/>
            Oracle. For the god doth not obey Euripides when he, as <lb/>
            it were, lays down the law and says : <lb/>
            " ‘ Phœbus alone must prophesy to men;’ <lb/>
            but inasmuch as he employs mortal servants and mouth- <lb/>
            pieces, whom he is bound to care for and protect, that <lb/>
            they be not annoyed by bad men when ministering to the <lb/>
            god—he chooses not to obliterate the truth, but he deflects <lb/>
            the manifestation thereof, like a sunbeam, in poetry, where <lb/>
            it suffers many refractions, and is dispersed and scattered <lb/>
            about in many directions, and thereby got rid of its <lb/>
            offensiveness and harshness. The point was that tyrants <lb/>
            should not be ignorant of what was coming, and that their <lb/>
            enemies should not perceive the same beforehand. Where­ <lb/>
            fore he [Apollo] wrapped up all this in hints and double <lb/>
            meanings, that concealed from the rest of the world what <lb/>
            was meant, yet did not escape nor disappoint the persons <lb/>
            themselves who requested his counsel and gave their minds <lb/>
            to understand it. Hence the man is a great simpleton <lb/>
            who now that the state of things is entirely changed, finds <lb/>
            fault and cavils because the god thinks proper to help us <lb/>
            in a different way from before.</p>
          <p>XXVII. " Besides, there is nothing in poetry more useful <lb/>
            than in prose, beyond the fact that things told when <lb/>
            bound in the fetters of metre and strung together, are <lb/>
            better remembered and retained. Men of those times <lb/>
            were far from possessing good memory, ‘ for of old the <lb/>
            descriptions of places, the proper seasons for divers <lb/>
            occupations, the festivals of the gods, the secret sepulchres <lb/>
            of heroes, so hard to be discovered beyond seas, were all <lb/>
            told in verse2 in the far-distant parts of Greece.' For <note type="footnote"> 1 In text <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> has certainly dropped out—else we get a contradiction to <lb/>
            the argument. </note><note type="footnote"> a “ Verse" is required by the context; the passage is incomplete, but <lb/>

            you know the Chian, and the Cretan history-about <lb/>
            Nesichus and Phalanthus, and all the other founders <lb/>
            of colonies, how they by the aid of all necessary indications <lb/>
            (from the Oracle) discovered the seat assigned and best <lb/>
            suited for each of them. Of whom, some made a mistake, <lb/>
            as did Battus ; for he thought he had missed the sense of <lb/>
            the Oracle, because he had not got possession of the place <lb/>
            to which he had been despatched: he, therefore, came a <lb/>
            second time to consult; the god replying, said : ‘ To Libya, <lb/>
            nurse of sheep, udder of earth, thou hast not gone. I greatly <lb/>
            admire thy wisdom in coming here,’1 and so sent him out <lb/>
            again, and Lysander being entirely ignorant that a hill was <lb/>
            called Archelades, and also Allopæus, and a river Hoplites, <lb/>
            and ‘ Earth's crafty son, the dragon, from behind approach­ <lb/>
            ing ’2—being beaten in a fight, he fell in the places so <lb/>
            named by the people by whom the district [was so called, <lb/>
            and by the hand of],8 a man of Haliartus, carrying a shield <lb/>
            which had for device a serpent. But to enumerate more <lb/>
            of these ancient examples, hard of interpretation, hard to <lb/>
            recollect as they are, to you who know them already, is <lb/>
            superfluous for me.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " The now established state of things as con­ <lb/>
            cerns inquiries of the god, I for my part am content with <lb/>
            and embrace. Profound peace and tranquillity prevail, <lb/>
            war has ceased, so have migrations and factions, no more <lb/>
            tyrannies or other distempers and evils of Greece, that <lb/>
            stood in need, as it were, of variously remedial and extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary powers. For where there is nothing complicated, <note type="footnote"> I Battus, sent by Apollo to Libya, at first colonized the island Platea <lb/>
            off the coast: the colony not prospering he again consulted the god, <lb/>
            whose answer was : " If thou who hast never gone to Libya, knowest <lb/>
            Libya better than I who have been there, I greatly admire thy clever­ <lb/>
            ness," and so sent him off once more. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or “ darting," according to the breathing of the initial. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This has fallen out of the text, but can be supplied from the Life of <lb/>

            nor to be kept secret, nor dangerous, but all inquiries turn <lb/>
            upon small and domestic affairs, like themes in a school, <lb/>
            such as: Should one marry ? should one make a voyage ? <lb/>
            should one lend money ? and the most important matters <lb/>
            belonging to States that are referred to the Oracle are the <lb/>
            yield of corn, the produce of grapes, or the health of the <lb/>
            public-in such cases to put forward verses, to invent <lb/>
            metaphors, to stick epithets upon questions that require <lb/>
            only a simple and brief answer, is the part of an ostenta­ <lb/>
            tious pedant, decorating the response for the sake of show; <lb/>
            and the Pythia is by disposition high-minded, and when <lb/>
            she descends into the cave, and is in company with the god, <lb/>
            more .... cares not for fame, or whether men praise, or <lb/>
            find fault with her words.</p>
          <p>XXIX. " We, perhaps, should behave in the same way. <lb/>
            But as it is, as though we were struggling and fearful lest <lb/>
            the place should lose its three thousand years' old repu­ <lb/>
            tation, and some should despise and go away from it, <lb/>
            like a Sophist's school, we make excuses and invent causes <lb/>
            and reasons for things that we neither know, nor is it <lb/>
            fitting for us to know; whereby we encourage the fault- <lb/>
            finder, and argue with him, instead of bidding him go <lb/>
            his way :­ <lb/>
            “ ‘ For he will be the first to feel the smart,’ <lb/>
            for entertaining such an opinion of the god as to accept <lb/>
            and admire those maxims of the Wise Men, the ‘ Know <lb/>
            thyself,' and the ‘ Nothing in excess,' no less on account of <lb/>
            their brevity, as containing in itself condensed and close- <lb/>
            hammered sense, in small compass-and yet finding fault <lb/>
            with Oracles because they tell most things briefly, plainly, <lb/>
            and in a straightforward manner; and these maxims of the <lb/>
            Wise Men are in the same condition as streams pent up in <lb/>
            narrow space, for they have no transparency or lucidity of <lb/>
            meaning, yet if you examine what has been written and <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            talked about them by such as wish to discover their full <lb/>
            sense you will not easily find other treatises more lengthy <lb/>
            than theirs. And the language of the Pythia, just as <lb/>
            mathematicians define a straight line as ‘ the least one of <lb/>
            those having the same extremities,' so it makes neither <lb/>
            curve, circle, double, or zig-zag, but goes straight to the <lb/>
            truth, and though liable to be overthrown by facts, and sub­ <lb/>
            ject to the test of experience, it has never, to the present <lb/>
            day, suffered any impeachment of its veracity, but has <lb/>
            crowded the Oracle with the offerings and presents of both <lb/>
            barbarians and Greeks, and with all the beauties and deco­ <lb/>
            rations of buildings erected by the Amphictyons. For you <lb/>
            see, I suppose, many additions of buildings not previously <lb/>
            existing, and many restorations of such as were dilapi­ <lb/>
            dated and tumbled down. For as with thriving trees, <lb/>
            others spring up by their side; so doth the Pylæa 1 renew <lb/>
            its youth together with Delphi, and fattens in her com­ <lb/>
            pany by reason of the opulence flowing from this source ; <lb/>
            and receives a beauty, shape, and decoration of temples, <lb/>
            public offices, and fountains, such as it never had for the <lb/>
            thousand years preceding. Now they that dwell round <lb/>
            about the " dairy " of Bœotia were made sensible of the <lb/>
            manifestation of the god in the flesh, by the abundance <lb/>
            and excess of the milk : ‘ From all the flocks flowed down, <lb/>
            as the best water from the rocks, nourishing milk, and <lb/>
            they hastened to fill their pitchers; not one wine-skin or <lb/>
            pitcher remained idle in the houses, pails and wooden <lb/>
            casks were all filled to the brim.' But to us, better, more <lb/>
            brilliant, and clearer signs than these, promise to restore <lb/>
            to us, as it were after the drought of our former desolation <lb/>
            and poverty, both opulence, honour, and splendour,2 and <lb/>
            yet I congratulate myself on having been zealous and <lb/>
            useful in these affairs, in concert with Polycrates and <note type="footnote"> A The little town itself, dependent upon Delphi, the sacred ground. </note><note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεποιηκὼς</foreign> here belongs evidently to the next sentence. </note> <lb/>

            the State 1 at the time, and who planned and provided for <lb/>
            most of these works But it is not possible that <lb/>
            such and so great a change should take place in a short <lb/>
            time, but for the god being present here, and inspiring the <lb/>
            Oracle to that purpose.</p>
          <p>XXX. " But just as in those old times there were people <lb/>
            that found fault with the obliquity and obscurity of the <lb/>
            responses, so nowadays some censure their too great plain­ <lb/>
            ness-whose conduct is equally unfair and silly. For <lb/>
            little children take greater pleasure and delight in looking <lb/>
            at rainbows, halos, and comets, than at the sun and moon ; <lb/>
            so do they these cavillers regret the riddles, allegories, <lb/>
            and metaphors, that are the reflections3 of the prophetic <lb/>
            power upon the mortal and imaginative subject: and if <lb/>
            they cannot find out the cause of the change to their own <lb/>
            satisfaction, they immediately blame the gods; and not <lb/>
            us, or themselves, as being unable to arrive by reasoning <lb/>
            at the gods' intention." <note type="footnote"> I The Roman governor of the province. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Referring to the foregoing simile of rainbows, halos, &amp;c. </note> <pb n="173"/>

          <p>"I <lb/>
            LATELY, my dear Serapion, met with some little <lb/>
            verses, that are not bad; which Dicæarchus sup­ <lb/>
            poses Euripides to address to Archelaus:— <lb/>
            “‘ I do not choose to offer thee a gift, <lb/>
            For I am poor, whilst thou art passing rich$ <lb/>
            Else thou will either take me for a fool, <lb/>
            Or think that in my giving I am begging <lb/>
            For he does no favour who gives a little out of a little <lb/>
            to those possessing much, and being suspected of not <lb/>
            giving for no return, he incurs to boot the character of <lb/>
            servility and meanness. In the same degree, therefore, <lb/>
            that substantial presents fall short both in respectability <lb/>
            and in beauty of those proceeding from reason and learn­ <lb/>
            ing, is it a fine thing for the latter to be given, and for the <lb/>
            giver to demand a return in kind from the receivers. For <lb/>
            I, in sending off to you, and through you to our friends <lb/>
            at the same place some of our Pythian conversation, in <lb/>
            the way of first fruits, boldly confess that I expect from <lb/>
            you in return others both longer and better done ; seeing <lb/>
            that you have the advantage of a very great city, and <lb/>
            plenty of leisure in the midst of books and lectures of <lb/>
            every kind.1 Now, our friend Apollo appears to cure and to <lb/>
            settle all difficulties connected with life, by giving re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Serapion lived at Athens, as appears from the last treatise. </note> <lb/>

            sponses to such as consult him ; but of himself to inspire <lb/>
            and suggest doubts concerning what is speculative, by <lb/>
            implanting in the knowledge-seeking part of the human <lb/>
            soul an appetite that draws towards the truth ; as is mani­ <lb/>
            fest from many other things, and from the dedication of the <lb/>
            E. For this is not likely to have been done by chance, nor <lb/>
            yet by lot only, in settling the precedence of all the letters of <lb/>
            the alphabet before the god, did it obtain the rank of a <lb/>
            sacred offering and object of admiration: but either those <lb/>
            that first speculated about the god saw in it some peculiar <lb/>
            and extraordinary virtue of its own, or else they used it as <lb/>
            a symbol of some important mystery, and admitted1 it on <lb/>
            those grounds. This question, though often propounded <lb/>
            in the school, I had always quietly evaded and put off, <lb/>
            until lately I was taught by my sons, uniting in entreaty 2 <lb/>
            with some others, visitors whom, as they were about to de­ <lb/>
            part from Delphi, I could not politely divert from the point, <lb/>
            nor excuse myself to them, anxious as they were to get <lb/>
            some information upon the subj ect. Having, therefore, made <lb/>
            them sit down about the Shrine, I began partly to invest!. <lb/>
            gate the matter myself, partly to put questions to them <lb/>
            [being reminded],' both by the place and by their words <lb/>
            of what I had heard long ago (when Nero was visiting the <lb/>
            spot), from Ammonius and others, when the same questions <lb/>
            had bean similarly started.</p>
          <p>II. “ That the god is no less a philosopher than a prophet, <lb/>
            Ammonius proved to the satisfaction of all by adducing <lb/>
            his titles one by one, and showing that he is ‘ Pythian' <lb/>
            to such as begin to learn and to inquire; ‘ Helius' and <lb/>
            ‘Phanæus,’ when part of the truth is already disclosed, <lb/>
            and a glimpse thereof given; ‘ Ismenius,' when people <lb/>
            have got the knowledge; and ‘Leschenoieos’ when they <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσέϑαι</foreign> must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσίεσϑαι</foreign>, " be pleased with." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμφιλομούμενος</foreign> must be ... <foreign xml:lang="grc">ων</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Not in text, but clearly fallen out in the copy. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            are active and enjoy that knowledge, and begin to con­ <lb/>
            verse and philosophize with one another. Now, since to <lb/>
            philosophizing belongs to inquire, to wonder, and to doubt, <lb/>
            it was natural, said he, that most parts of what related to <lb/>
            the god should be hidden in enigmas, because they elicit <lb/>
            discussion as to the wherefore, and information about the <lb/>
            cause. For instance, in the case of the everlasting fire, <lb/>
            that pine should be the only wood burned there, and bay- <lb/>
            leaves used for incense; and the fact that two Fates are <lb/>
            set up here, whereas everywhere else three are the regular <lb/>
            number: also the rule that no woman is allowed to ap­ <lb/>
            proach the Oracle; and the existence of the Tripod-and <lb/>
            all such instances, which, when brought before people that <lb/>
            be not entirely brutish and soulless, act as baits, and draw <lb/>
            them on to inquire, to listen, and to argue with one <lb/>
            another. Look, too, at the maxims written up here, the <lb/>
            ‘ Know thyself,' and the ‘ Nothing in extremes’—how <lb/>
            many philosophical inquiries have they not excited; and <lb/>
            what a crop of discussions has there not sprung up from <lb/>
            them, as though from one sowing seed; and no less pro. <lb/>
            lific do I think is the question now raised."</p>
          <p>in. And when Ammonius had said this, my brother <lb/>
            Lamprias replied: "And yet the explanation I have <lb/>
            heard is a simple one, and very short; for they say that <lb/>
            those Wise Men, by some denominated ‘Sophists,' were <lb/>
            really but five—namely, Chilon, Thales, Solon, Bias, Pitta­ <lb/>
            cus—for the Cleobulua Tyrant of the Lindians, and Peri­ <lb/>
            ander the Corinthian, though they had no share either of <lb/>
            virtue or wisdom, yet through their power, their friends, <lb/>
            and their interest, forcibly took possession of the character, <lb/>
            and usurped the name of the Wise Men, and sent forth <lb/>
            and spread abroad all over Greece certain maxims and <lb/>
            words similar to those uttered by the former, at which <lb/>
            these being indignant, did not choose to expose their arro­ <lb/>
            gance, nor to quarrel publicly for fame, and incur the hos. <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            tility of persons of great power ; having, therefore, held a <lb/>
            meeting here, and conferred together, they dedicated that <lb/>
            letter of the alphabet, which both holds the fifth place <lb/>
            there, and also signifies the number Five,1 testifying to <lb/>
            the god that they were but Five, and discarding and cast­ <lb/>
            ing off the seventh and the sixth as not belonging to their <lb/>
            number. That all this is not said at random, any one <lb/>
            may know, from hearing those belonging to the Temple, <lb/>
            calling the golden E that of Livia,2 wife of Cæsar; the <lb/>
            bronze one, that of the Athenians; whereas the original <lb/>
            and most ancient one, wooden in material, they call the E <lb/>
            of the Wise Men, not of one, but the joint offering of <lb/>
            them all."</p>
          <p>IV. Now Ammonius, quietly smiling, and suspecting <lb/>
            that Lamprias was asserting an idea of his own, while he <lb/>
            pretended it a legend and a report heard from others, <lb/>
            upon a matter admitting of no disproval [made no reply].3 <lb/>
            But someone else of those present observed: " All this is <lb/>
            like the nonsense which the Chaldean visitor lately talked : <lb/>
            that there are seven of the letters that utter a sound of <lb/>
            their own; seven stars that move in the heavens with an <lb/>
            independent and unconnected motion of their own. For <lb/>
            at the time spoken of, the E was from the beginning, the <lb/>
            second in place of the vowels, and the Sun, after the Moon, <lb/>
            of the planets-now, all the Greeks, "so to speak, regard <lb/>
            Apollo as the same with the Sun. But this sort of stuff is <note type="footnote"> 1 This explanation, as all the rest, is founded on nothing but fancy, <lb/>
            as a single consideration proves. The symbol, which is preserved to us <lb/>
            by amulets, was indeed similar in shape to the lunar E, but then that <lb/>
            character was unknown before Imperial times. In all probability it was <lb/>
            an Indian cast mark; and imported like the Swastika or Fylfot, and <lb/>
            many other Indian symbols, in prehistoric times. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In compliment to her husband, who wished to be thought IOn of the <lb/>
            god: <lb/>

             <pb n="177"/>
            mere idle talk.1 And indeed Lamprias has unwittingly <lb/>
            stirred up the people belonging to the Temple against his <lb/>
            argument, for what he has told us nobody at Delphi <lb/>
            knows anything about; but all assert the common opinion <lb/>
            and that of the guides, pretending that it is not the <lb/>
            appearance nor the sound of the letter, but only the name <lb/>
            of it that has any significance."</p>
          <p>V. " Furthermore, as the Delphians themselves suppose, <lb/>
            and as Nicander the priest said in his address, the letter <lb/>
            is the vehicle and the form of the demand made to the <lb/>
            god, and it holds the place of honour 2 in the queries of <lb/>
            those consulting the Oracle and asking, If they shall <lb/>
            be victorious ? If they shall marry ? If it is advisable <lb/>
            to make a voyage ? If to turn farmer ? If to go abroad ? <lb/>
            The god, wise as he is, sends the logicians about their <lb/>
            business, who believe that nothing comes out of the particle <lb/>
            If, and the demand that goes along with it; for the Word <lb/>
            both conceives the questions subordinate to this particle <lb/>
            as real things, and accepts them as such. And since <lb/>
            inquiry is his peculiar right, in his character of prophet; <lb/>
            and prayer to him, is a joint right in his character of god, <lb/>
            they think that this letter represents the precatory3 no less <lb/>
            than the inquiring element. For each one of such as <lb/>
            pray begins with ‘ Oh, if,' and Archilochus says, <lb/>
            " ‘ If I only were permitted Neobule's hand to touch !’ <lb/>
            "And in <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴθε</foreign> someone says the second syllable is an <lb/>
            expletive, as in that verse of Sophron's, “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμα τεκνων <lb/>
            θὴν δυσμένεα</foreign>, and that of Homer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥς θὴν καὶ ἔγω σὸν λύσωμένος</foreign>, <lb/>
            for that the precatory meaning is more than sufficiently <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>VI. When Nicander had finished this—you know my <lb/>
            companion Theon ? well, he asked Ammonius if Logic was <lb/>
            allowed free speech, after being so insulted ? And when <lb/>
            Ammonius encouraged him to speak and defend her, he <lb/>
            began: " That the god is a very great logician, his own <lb/>
            responses show, for it, forsooth, is the business of a <lb/>
            logician both to invent and to solve double-senses. For <lb/>
            as Plato said when an oracle was given commanding the <lb/>
            doubling (squaring) the cubical dimensions of the altar, <lb/>
            not the linear, which latter any mason could have done by <lb/>
            simple measurement. An oracle bad been given com­ <lb/>
            manding the doubling the size of the altar at Delos, <lb/>
            which is a problem requiring the utmost skill in geometry, <lb/>
            that it was not this the god required, but that he <lb/>
            encouraged the Greeks should study geometry. In the <lb/>
            same way, the god by giving forth responses with double <lb/>
            meanings promotes and establishes Logic, as being <lb/>
            indispensable for all such as intend to understand him <lb/>
            rightly. And if truly this bodily constitution of ours has <lb/>
            its greatest force through Logic (Reasoning), inasmuch as <lb/>
            it gives form to the most rational distinction, then <lb/>
            assuredly such a conclusion as this is bound up with it, <lb/>
            because even brute animals have a knowledge of the being <lb/>
            of things, but to man alone bath Nature given the power <lb/>
            of seeing and of judging consequences. For instance, that <lb/>
            it is day, and is light, wolves, dogs, and birds understand ; <lb/>
            but that if it is day, it is light, no other creature under­ <lb/>
            stands save man alone; because he alone has the concep­ <lb/>
            tion of prior and posterior, of appearance, and of connec­ <lb/>
            tion, and of the relations of these things to one another; <lb/>
            from which considerations proofs derive their most <lb/>
            important principle. If, therefore, philosophy is busied <lb/>
            about truth, and the light of truth is proof, and the <lb/>
            foundation of proof is connection-with good reason has <lb/>
            the faculty that embraces and causes this, been con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            secrated by wise men to the god that most of all loves <lb/>
            truth: and the god himself is a diviner, but divination is <lb/>
            an art busied about the Future, derived from things present <lb/>
            or past. For of no one thing is the birth without a cause, <lb/>
            or the signification without a sense; but all things that <lb/>
            be, follow after and are connected with those that have <lb/>
            been, and those that will be with those that are, in a <lb/>
            succession bringing them to pass from the beginning to <lb/>
            the end; so he, that by a natural gift understands how <lb/>
            to connect together, and interweave with each other their <lb/>
            causes, the same person knows how to foretell­ <lb/>
            "' What is, what shall be, and what was before.'</p>
          <p>“ And rightly hath Homer mentioned the Present first, <lb/>
            and then the Future and the Past: because the reasoning <lb/>
            comes from the things that are, according to the force of <lb/>
            the connection ; as for example, if this thing is, that thing <lb/>
            precedes it; and conversely, if this thing is, that thing shall <lb/>
            be, for what belongs to art and reasoning is the knowledge <lb/>
            of consequences ; but it is perception that gives the pre­ <lb/>
            conception to reason: whence, though it be indecent to <lb/>
            say it, I will not shrink from saying this is the tripod of <lb/>
            Truth, namely, Reason, which laying down as foundation <lb/>
            the sequence of the ending to the preceding event, and <lb/>
            then taking into account the existence, crowns all with <lb/>
            the conclusion of the proof. And the Pythian god, if he <lb/>
            really takes delight in music, and in the voices of swans <lb/>
            and the twangings of the lyre-what wonder is it if he <lb/>
            embraces and loves, out of fondness for logic, this part of <lb/>
            the Reason of which he sees philosophers making chief <lb/>
            and most frequent use ? And Hercules, though he had <lb/>
            not yet set Prometheus free, nor conversed with sophists <lb/>
            like Chiron and Atlas, but being yet a youth, and a <lb/>
            thorough Boeotiam, though at first he knocked down logic,l <note type="footnote"> I In his fight with the Centaurs, regarded as sophists. Here is the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            and laughed the E to scorn; yet, taken at a later time, <lb/>
            he was seen forcibly dragging away the Tripod, and fight­ <lb/>
            ing with the god for the possession of the art, since as he <lb/>
            advanced in age he too became, it is likely, an excellent <lb/>
            diviner, and at the same time, logician."</p>
          <p>VII. And when Theon had done, Eustrophos, the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, I think it was, who said to us: " You see how <lb/>
            courageously Theon has defended Logic, all but putting <lb/>
            on the lion's-skin for the purpose. In the same way we <lb/>
            must count for nothing the whole lot put together, all <lb/>
            things whatsoever, the natures and principles of men or <lb/>
            gods, and consider this one as the leader and master of all <lb/>
            things beautiful and precious-but we must1 hold our <lb/>
            tongues, and sacrifice to this god the first fruits of his <lb/>
            darling mathematics, because we believe that the E excels <lb/>
            not the other vowels either in virtue, shape, or expression, <lb/>
            but that it has been put in the post of honour as the <lb/>
            symbol of a number which is great with reference to the <lb/>
            whole and a capital one, that is the Five, from which the <lb/>
            wise used to call reckoning 'counting by fives.’ "2 This, said <lb/>
            Eustrophos, not in joke, but because I, at that very time, <lb/>
            was zealously applying myself to mathematics, for as he <lb/>
            lived in the Academy, he was perhaps disposed to pay <lb/>
            particular respect to the maxim: <lb/>
            " Nothing in extremes."</p>
          <p>VIII. I therefore replied that Eustrophos solved the diffi­ <lb/>
            culty well by means of the Numeral. " For," I continued, <lb/>
            "as all numeration is divided into even and odd, and as <note type="footnote"> common play upon the various senses of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, impossible to be trans­ <lb/>
            lated. </note><note type="footnote"> I The text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδως</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκὸς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεμπάζειν</foreign>, literally "to five fold" or "to quintuple." In early <lb/>
            Greek numeration, the numbers up to 5 were denoted by as many ver­ <lb/>
            tical strokes ; 5 by <foreign xml:lang="grc">π</foreign>; to which again were subjoined the proper amount <lb/>
            of verticals up to 10, expressed by A. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            unity is common to both, in power: it being added makes <lb/>
            the even number odd, and the odd number even: for <lb/>
            people hold the two for the beginning of the even, and the <lb/>
            three for that of the odd: and the five is produced when <lb/>
            these numbers are mixed with each other; so with good <lb/>
            cause has it obtained honour, as being the first product of <lb/>
            the first; and has been named ‘Marriage,’ from the com­ <lb/>
            parison of the even to the feminine, and again of the odd <lb/>
            to the masculine. For in case of divisions into equal <lb/>
            parts, the even number being every way parted asunder, <lb/>
            leaves behind a receptive principle,1 as it were, in itself, <lb/>
            and a space; but when the odd is treated in the same way, <lb/>
            a middle part still survives that is productive of division ; <lb/>
            in which way it is more generative than the other, and when <lb/>
            united thereto it prevails, but it never overcomes ; for the <lb/>
            even comes from both in no conjunction of the two, whereas <lb/>
            the odd does in all.2 Furthermore, when added and j oined to <lb/>
            itself, each of the two exhibits its own distinctive property; <lb/>
            for no even number united to an even number produces <lb/>
            an odd one, nor goes beyond its proper allotment; because <lb/>
            through weakness it is unproductive of offspring diffe­ <lb/>
            rent from itself, and imperfect; whereas uneven numbers <lb/>
            united with uneven numbers generate many even numbers <lb/>
            by reason of their universally prolific nature. The other <lb/>
            differences and properties of numbers one cannot go through <lb/>
            with on the present occasion. The Five, therefore, the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans denominate as ‘Marriage,' as being gene­ <lb/>
            rated through the resemblance of the odd number to the <lb/>
            male and the even to the female, and, somewhere or other, <lb/>
            it has been called ‘Nature,’ because by multiplication into <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

            itself, it finally ends in itself again ; like as Nature having <lb/>
            received what is the seed, and buried the same, produces <lb/>
            in the meanwhile divers forms and figures, through which <lb/>
            she moves her work on towards her end, and at last she <lb/>
            exhibits the wheat again, and restores the beginning at the <lb/>
            end of all; in like manner the other numbers, when they <lb/>
            are multiplied1 result in different numbers through the <lb/>
            augmentation, whereas the numbers five and six alone, <lb/>
            taken as many times, reproduce and resuscitate themselves: <lb/>
            for six times six becomes thirty-six, and five times five <lb/>
            becomes five-and-twenty : and again, this is the case with <lb/>
            the six but once, and singly; that is, when squared into <lb/>
            itself; but the same thing happens to the number five <lb/>
            [frequently] 2 in the multiplication, and also, in a way <lb/>
            peculiar to itself, in addition: for it makes either itself or <lb/>
            the number ten, when alternately added to itself, and this <lb/>
            is the case throughout, for the number copies the Final <lb/>
            Cause. For as that Principle watches over and produces <lb/>
            the world out of itself, and in return produces itself out <lb/>
            of the world, as Heraclitus says .­ <lb/>
            " ‘ Exchanging all for fire, and fire for all, <lb/>
            Like goods for gold, or gold in place of goods; * <lb/>
            similarly the conjunction of the five with itself by its own <lb/>
            nature generates nothing incomplete nor different in kind, <lb/>
            but undergoes strictly defined changes ; for it produces <lb/>
            either itself or the number ten-that is, either its own <lb/>
            property, or that which is perfect."</p>

            do with Apollo? We reply: It has to do not only with <lb/>
            him, but with Bacchus, who has no less property in Delphi <lb/>
            than Apollo himself. We therefore hear theologians, <lb/>

            ing how that the god, though by nature incorruptible and <lb/>
            eternal, yet, as they tell, through some decree of fate, sub­ <lb/>
            mitted to changes of condition, at one time set all Nature <lb/>
            on fire, making all things like to all; at another time he <lb/>
            was metamorphosed and turned into various shapes, states, <lb/>
            and powers, in the same way as the universe now exists­ <lb/>
            but is called by the best-known of all his names.1 The <lb/>
            wiser sort, cloaking their meaning from the vulgar, call the <lb/>
            change into Fire ‘Apollo,' on account of the reduction to <lb/>
            one state,2 and also ‘Phoebus ' on account of its freedom <lb/>
            from defilement and purity : but the condition and change <lb/>
            of his turning and subdivision into airs and water and <lb/>
            earth, and the production of animals and plants, they enig­ <lb/>
            matically term ‘Exile' and ‘Dismemberment.’ They <lb/>
            name him ‘Dionysos' and ‘Zagreus' and ‘Nycteleos ' <lb/>
            and ‘Isodi'; they also tell of certain destructions and <lb/>
            disappearances and diseases and new births, which are <lb/>
            riddles and fables pertaining to the aforesaid transforma­ <lb/>
            tions: and they sing the dithyrambic song, filled with <lb/>
            sufferings, and allusions to some change of state that <lb/>
            brought with it wandering about and dispersion. For <lb/>
            Æschylus says: ‘It is fitting the dithyrambus, with its <lb/>
            confused roar, should accompany Dionysos : but Apollo, <lb/>
            the orderly and sober pæan.’ The latter god they repre­ <lb/>
            sent in pictures and images as exempt from age and <lb/>
            youthful; but the other, under many guises and forms; <lb/>
            and, generally, to the one they assign in variableness, order, <lb/>
            and unmixed seriousness ; whilst ascribing to the other a <lb/>
            mingled playfulness and mischief, gravity and madness, <lb/>
            they proclaim him ‘Evius inciter of women, flourishing <lb/>
            with frenzied honours, Dionysos !’—not wrongly taking <note type="footnote"> I i. e. retains his usual name under all his changes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As if derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀ</foreign> privative, and 7roXXot, and signifying “ Destroyer <lb/>

            what is the characteristic of either change. For, since the <lb/>
            duration of the periods of such changes is not equal, but <lb/>
            that of the one which they call' Satiety' is the longer of <lb/>

            observe the due proportion here, and during the rest of <lb/>
            the year they employ the paean at the sacrifices; at the <lb/>
            beginning of winter they revive the dithyramb and put a <lb/>
            stop to the paean, and invoke the god with the former <lb/>
            instead of the latter chant for the space of three months : <lb/>
            which makes three to one the space of time they believe <lb/>
            that the creation1 lasted compared to that of the con­ <lb/>

          <p>X. "But this discussion has been prolonged beyond <lb/>
            the fitting limits-it is, however, clear that they appropriate <lb/>
            the number five to him 2 (Apollo), sometimes taking it by <lb/>
            itself as Five, sometimes as generating the number Ten <lb/>
            out of itself, as [he does] the World. But with the art <lb/>
            most acceptable to the god, namely Music, we do not <lb/>
            think this number has anything to do: seeing that the <lb/>
            chief business of harmony is, as one may say, connected <lb/>
            with the notes. That these are five and no more, reason <lb/>
            disproves if anyone unreasonably attempts to hunt out <lb/>
            such a number upon the harp-strings, and in the holes of <lb/>
            the flute. For all notes receive their birth in the propor­ <lb/>

            Baron is one and a third, that of the diapente one and a <lb/>
            half, that of the diapason double; that of the diapente <lb/>

            calling it the diatessaron and diapason, that goes out of <lb/>

            with the irrational sense of hearing in a matter of reason, <lb/>
            as in the case of a law. That, therefore, I may dismiss <lb/>
            the five ‘threes' of tetrachords, and the first five whether <lb/>

          <p>XI. " Passing over many other instances of the same kind ” <lb/>
            (I continued), " I will adduce Plato, who says the world <lb/>
            is one, but that if there be other worlds around this, and <lb/>
            this be not the only one, they are five in number, and no <lb/>
            more. Not but that, even if the world be one and only­ <lb/>
            created (as Aristotle supposes) it may in a certain sense <lb/>
            be considered as composed and compacted out of five <lb/>
            other worlds; for example, the one is of earth, the other <lb/>
            of water, the third of fire, the fourth of air; the fifth ele­ <lb/>

            that not out of compulsion, or extraneous cause. For <lb/>
            which reason truly having observed the five most beautiful <lb/>
            and most perfect figures of things in nature, namely, the <lb/>
            pyramid, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, <note type="footnote"> 1 Any more than it would be obeyed in the case of a law, t. e. these <lb/>

            the eikosihedron, and the duodecahedron, I have appro­ <lb/>
            priately assigned each of them to a different element.”1</p>
          <p>XII. " There are some philosophers who identify with <lb/>
            those primitive elements the powers of the senses which are <lb/>
            the same in number : 2 they see the touch repulsive and <lb/>
            earth-like ; the taste, by means of moisture, appreciating <lb/>
            the properties of the things tasted ; whilst air being struck <lb/>
            becomes in the hearing, voice and sound; and of the two <lb/>
            remaining, smell, which the olfactory sense has obtained <lb/>
            for its share, being an exhalation and generated by heat, <lb/>
            is a fiery substance. And of sight, that is transparent <lb/>
            with æther and light by reason of its affinity thereto, the <lb/>
            constitution and the action are of like condition with <lb/>
            those elements. Other sense has neither living thing, nor <lb/>
            other nature does the world possess, that is simple and un­ <lb/>
            mixed ; but there has been made, to all appearance, a cer­ <lb/>
            tain wonderful distribution and acceptance of the one five <lb/>
            between 3 the other five."</p>
          <p>XITI. At the same moment, as it were checking myself, <lb/>
            and leaving off, I exclaimed: " What have we been think­ <lb/>
            ing of, Eustrophos, to have all but passed over Homer, <lb/>
            as though not the first to divide the world into five por­ <lb/>
            tions ? The three intermediate he has assigned to the three <lb/>
            gods, the two extremes, Olympus and Earth, whereof the <lb/>
            one is the boundary of things below, the other of things <lb/>
            above, he has left common to all and unallotted to any. <lb/>
            But ‘ the argument must be carried back,' as Euripides <lb/>
            saith, for they that venerate 4 the number Four do not ill <lb/>
            to teach that by reason of this number every body has its <note type="footnote"> I The Chinese have a similar theory, making the Cube represent <lb/>

             <pb n="187"/>
            origin. For since every thing that is solid consists in <lb/>
            length and breadth admitting of depth; and before length <lb/>
            exists a point set down in the way of unity; and as length <lb/>
            is called a line without breadth, and is length : and the <lb/>
            motion of a line in the direction of width gives origin to <lb/>
            surface in the number three ; and when depth is added to <lb/>
            all these in four ways, the aggregate advances into a solid <lb/>
            body-it is clear to everyone that the number four, after <lb/>
            having carried Nature forward up to completing a body <lb/>
            and producing [double] 1 bulk and resistance, has yet left <lb/>
            it deficient in the most important article. For the thing <lb/>
            inanimate, to speak generally, is helpless, imperfect, and <lb/>
            serviceable for nothing at all, without a soul to direct it ; <lb/>
            but the motion or disposition, being a change produced in <lb/>
            five different ways, generates therein a soul, imparts per­ <lb/>
            fection to its nature, and possesses a value superior to the <lb/>
            number four, in the same degree that the living thing <lb/>
            surpasses the thing without life. Furthermore, the pro­ <lb/>
            portion and force of the number five, being the more <lb/>
            powerful, hath not suffered animate nature to run off into <lb/>
            infinite varieties, but hath produced five species only of <lb/>
            things animate: for there are gods (I suppose), and dæ­ <lb/>
            mons, and heroes, and the fourth kind of men; and then <lb/>
            the irrational and brute creation. Again, if you divide <lb/>
            the soul itself according to its constitution, the first and <lb/>
            darkest part of it is the nutritive, the second the sensitive, <lb/>
            the third the appetitive, the next to this the irascible, and <lb/>
            having arrived at the faculty of reason, and completed its <lb/>
            nature, it takes its rest in the fifth principle as upon the <lb/>
            highest point."</p>
          <p>XIV. " And whilst the number possesses so many and <lb/>
            such great virtues, its origin is likewise beautiful; not <lb/>
            being that which we have lately discussed, springing out <note type="footnote"> I This word makes nonsense ; and has slipped into the text from <lb/>
            elsewhere. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            of the two; but what the beginning of the odd, coupling <lb/>
            itself with the square, produces. For the beginning of <lb/>
            all numbers is unity; and the first square is the four; <lb/>
            and out of these as from a pattern or material having a <lb/>
            limit, comes the five. But if, indeed, some are right in <lb/>
            supposing the unit the first square number, being a power <lb/>
            in itself and producing the same out of itself-in that case <lb/>
            also the five, as generated out of the first two squares, has <lb/>
            not lost its highest place of nobility."</p>
          <p>XV. "But the main point," I continued, "I fear if <lb/>
            enounced will press hard upon our friend Plato, in the <lb/>
            same way as he himself used to say that Anaxagoras was <lb/>
            pressed hard by the name of the Moon, when he appro­ <lb/>
            priated some very ancient notion amongst those current <lb/>
            respecting her illuminations (phases); has he not said this <lb/>
            in the Cratylus?" "Yes, certainly," replied Eustrophos, <lb/>
            “ but what similarity there is in the present case I do not per­ <lb/>
            ceive." " And yet," said I, " you surely know that in the <lb/>
            ' Sophist' he makes out the most important principles <lb/>
            to be five in number, namely, Being, Sameness, Diversity, <lb/>
            and fourthly and fifthly, after these, Motion and Rest. <lb/>
            But in the' Philebus' he uses a different mode of division, <lb/>
            and says that One is infinite and Other definite, and that <lb/>
            all generation is composed from these two mixed together: <lb/>
            and the Cause by which they are so mixed together he <lb/>
            supposes the fourth kind; 1 whilst the fifth he leaves us <lb/>
            to conceive as that through which the two mixed prin­ <lb/>
            ciples again obtain separation and division. But I con­ <lb/>
            jecture that these things are predicated as being images <lb/>
            of those ideas just mentioned, that which is born being the <lb/>
            image of that which is, the infinite that of Motion, the <lb/>
            finite that of Best; Sameness being the mixing principle, <lb/>
            Diversity that which separates. And if these are other­ <lb/>
            wise, even on that supposition, they will similarly be <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, Motion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            classed in five kinds and differences. Some one, forsooth, <lb/>
            previous to Plato had put the question [to the Oracle] <lb/>
            and had learned this fact, and therefore dedicated two E's <lb/>
            to the god, as an indication and symbol of the number of <lb/>
            the all. But again, the same person may have done so <lb/>
            because he had discovered that the Good is imagined [as <lb/>
            being manifested] five kinds-whereof the first is what <lb/>
            is moderate, the second what is consistent, the third <lb/>
            Mind, the fourth the sciences, arts, and true conceptions <lb/>
            dwelling in the soul; the fifth kind, whatever pleasure is <lb/>
            pure and unalloyed with pain." Here he ceased, quoting <lb/>
            the line of Orpheus:— <lb/>
            " ' In the sixth period still the rage of song.'"</p>
          <p>XVI. After the discourse aforesaid, he continued to us: <lb/>
            “ One thing more, briefly, I will sing to the intelligent, <lb/>
            like Nicander and his friends. On the sixth day of the <lb/>
            new moon, when you conduct the Pythia to the Townhall, <lb/>
            the first casting of the three lots takes place ... you throw <lb/>
            neither three nor two 2—is it not so ? " " It is so," re­ <lb/>
            plied Nicander ; “ but the reason must not be divulged to <lb/>
            others." " Consequently," I said, smiling, " so far as the <lb/>
            god allows us that be [not] sanctified to know the truth, <lb/>
            this rule also has something to do with what has been <lb/>
            said on the subject of the number five. So the list of the <lb/>
            arithmetical and mathematical praises of the letter E, as <lb/>
            far as I recollect then, is now concluded."</p>
          <p>XVII. Ammonius, inasmuch as he was one who held that <lb/>
            by no means the least important part of philosophy lay in <lb/>
            mathematics, was delighted with what had been said, and <lb/>
            remarked, " To argue very critically against all this is not <note type="footnote"> I Already mentioned as the High Priest of Delphi, and therefore <lb/>

            fitting for us beginners: yet each one of the numbers <lb/>
            taken by itself will furnish much scope for such as wish <lb/>
            to praise it. And what need is there to talk about the <lb/>
            others, when the Seven, sacred to Apollo, will alone ex­ <lb/>
            haust the whole day, should one attempt to enumerate all <lb/>
            its properties ? In the next place, we shall prove that <lb/>
            the Wise Men quarrelled with common custom as well as <lb/>
            with long tradition, when they pushed down the Seven <lb/>
            from its place of honour and dedicated the Five unto the <lb/>
            god as the more properly pertaining to him. Neither <lb/>
            number, therefore, nor rank, nor conjunction, nor any <lb/>
            other of the remaining parts of speech, I think, does the <lb/>
            letter signify, but that it is an address to the god, or an <lb/>
            invocation, complete in itself, that together with the utte­ <lb/>
            rance thereof puts the speaker in mind of the power of the <lb/>
            deity. For the god addresses each one of us here, when ap­ <lb/>
            proaching him, as if with a salutation, in the words, ‘ Know <lb/>
            thyself,' which is neither more nor less than ‘ Hail,' whilst <lb/>
            we, in requital to the god, say, ‘ Thou art,’1 as though <lb/>
            paying to him the true, undying, and sole property of him­ <lb/>
            self, the predicate of existence.”</p>
          <p>XVIII. " For we ourselves have in reality no part in <lb/>
            existence ; for all mortal nature being in a state between <lb/>
            birth and dissolution, presents no more than an illusion, <lb/>
            and a semblance, shapeless and unstable of itself, and if <lb/>
            you will closely apply your thought, out of the wish to <lb/>
            seize hold of the idea, just as the too strong grasping at <lb/>
            water when it is pressed together and condensed, loses it, <lb/>
            for it slips through your fingers, in the same way Reason, <lb/>
            in pursuing after the appearances, so extremely clear as <lb/>
            they look, of each one of the conditions of life as they pass <lb/>
            along, misses its aim; impinging on the one side against <lb/>
            its coming into existence, on the other, against its going <note type="footnote"> 1 Equivalent in sense to the Hebrew “ Jehovah," and the <unclear>ὁ</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζω̃ν θεὸς</foreign> <lb/>

            out; without ever laying hold upon it as a permanent <lb/>
            thing, or as being in reality a power. It is not possible, <lb/>
            according to Heraclitus, to step into the same river twice; <lb/>
            neither is it to lay hold of mortal life twice, in the same <lb/>
            condition; but by reason of the suddenness and speed of <lb/>
            its mutation, it disperses and again brings together, or <lb/>
            rather, neither again nor afterwards, but at one and the <lb/>
            same time it subsists and it comes to an end; it ap­ <lb/>
            preaches and it departs, wherefore it never ripens that of <lb/>
            it which is born into actual being, by reason that Birth <lb/>
            doth never cease nor stand still, but transforms; and out <lb/>
            of the seed makes the embryo, then the child, then the <lb/>
            youth, young man, full-grown man, elderly man, old man <lb/>
            -obliterating the former growths and ages by those grow­ <lb/>
            ing up over them. But we ridiculously fear one death, <lb/>
            although we have already died, and are still dying, so <lb/>
            many; for not only, as Heraclitus says, ' When fire dies <lb/>
            is the birth of air, and when air dies is the birth of water,' <lb/>
            but still more plainly may you see it from ourselves: the <lb/>
            full-grown man perishes when the old man is produced, <lb/>
            the youth had before perished into the full-grown man, <lb/>
            and the child into the youth, and the infant into the child; <lb/>
            and the ‘ yesterday' has died into the ‘ to-day,' and the <lb/>
            ' to-day' is dying into the ‘ to-morrow,' and no one re­ <lb/>
            mains, nor is one, but we grow up many around one appear­ <lb/>
            ance and common model, whilst matter revolves around <lb/>
            and slips away. Else how is it, if we remain the same, <lb/>
            that we take pleasure in some things now, in different <lb/>
            things before; we love contrary objects, we admire and <lb/>
            find fault with them, we use others words, feel other pas­ <lb/>
            sions ; not having either appearance, figure, nor disposi­ <lb/>
            tion the same as before ? To be in different states, with­ <lb/>
            out a change, is not a possible thing, and he that is changed <lb/>
            is not the same person; but if he is not the same, he <lb/>
            does not exist . . . this very thing (the change) he <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            changes1—growing one different person out of another; <lb/>
            but Sense, through ignorance of reality, falsely pronounces <lb/>
            that what appears exists</p>
          <p>XIX. “ What then is really existing ? The answer is, <lb/>
            the eternal, unborn, undecaying, to which no length of <lb/>
            time brings about a change: for Time is a thing movable <lb/>
            and making move, making its appearance conjointly with <lb/>
            matter ; leaking and not holding water, as it were, a vessel <lb/>
            full of decay and growth; for is not the predicate ‘ After' <lb/>
            and ‘ Before,' ‘ Future,' and ‘ Past,' of itself an acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment of non-existence ? For to say that what has not <lb/>
            yet been, or what has ceased from being, is in being, how <lb/>
            silly and absurd ! For in this way especially do we apply <lb/>
            the notion of Time, and predicate the terms ‘ Instant' and <lb/>
            ' Present' and ‘ Now' ...2 this, in turn, Reason distri­ <lb/>
            butes too much, dissolves and destroys. For it (Time) is <lb/>
            diverted, like a ray of light, into the Future and the Past, <lb/>
            necessarily separated, when we attempt to see it. And if <lb/>
            the Nature that is measured is in the same condition as <lb/>
            that which measures it, nothing is either stable or exists <lb/>
            ing, but all things are either being born or perishing, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to their distribution with respect to time. Consequently <lb/>
            it is not allowable so much as to say of Being 3 that' it was' <lb/>
            or that ‘ it will be;' for all these modes are tenses, transi­ <lb/>
            tions, and interchanges of the thing formed by nature, <lb/>
            never to stand still in existence.</p>
          <p>XX. " But the god is, we must declare; and is with <lb/>
            reference to no time, but with reference to the eternal, the <lb/>
            immovable, timeless, and indeclinable ; that which there <lb/>
            is nothing before nor after, nor more, nor past, nor older <note type="footnote"> 1 Some words lost here: but probably to the effect that man's con. <lb/>

            nor younger, but He being One with the one ‘ Now,' hath <lb/>
            filled up the ‘ Ever;’1 and that which really is, alone is <lb/>
            with reference to Him; neither born, nor about to be, nor <lb/>
            growing, nor to have an end. In this way, therefore, ought <lb/>
            we, when worshipping, to salute Him, and to address Him, <lb/>
            or even, truly, as some of the ancients did, ‘ Thou art One!' <lb/>
            For the Deity is not several, as each one of us is, made up <lb/>
            out of an infinite number of different things in conditions <lb/>
            of existence-a motley assemblage of articles of all sorts <lb/>
            and gleanings. But that which is must necessarily be One, <lb/>
            just as One must be that which is ; for2 difference of that <lb/>
            which is, springs out of that which is not, in form of births, <lb/>
            consequently the first of the names (by which he is called) <lb/>
            well suits the god, as also the second and the third. For <lb/>
            ‘ Apollo,' inasmuch as it means ‘ denying many,’ signifies <lb/>
            also ‘ rejecting plurality.’3 He is also ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιητος</foreign>, because <lb/>
            one and alone. ‘ Phoebus ' the ancients called everything <lb/>
            clean and chaste, and even now the Thessalians say that <lb/>
            their priests, when living by themselves outside the city on <lb/>
            the fast-days,' are living Phœbus.’ But the One is single <lb/>
            and pure, for the mixing of one thing with another consti­ <lb/>
            tutes pollution; as Homer somewhere calls ivory turned <lb/>
            purple by a dye ‘ polluted,' and dyers call the running to­ <lb/>
            gether of colours ‘ being spoilt,' and such mixture they term <lb/>
            ‘ corruption.' Hence, to be one and always unmixed be­ <lb/>
            longs to the Immortal and the Pure.</p>
          <p>XXI. “ But those who hold Apollo and the Sun for one <lb/>
            and the same, we ought to welcome and love for the omen's <lb/>

            which they most honour of all the objects that they know <lb/>
            and long for. As though, therefore, they were dreaming <lb/>
            about the god in the most beautiful of dreams, let us wake <lb/>
            them up, and exhort them to carry their thoughts yet <lb/>
            higher, and contemplate what is above them, and the <lb/>
            essence; to honour indeed the Type, and venerate the <lb/>
            creative force residing therein, as that which converts the <lb/>
            Intelligible into the Sensible, and the Permanent into the <lb/>
            Transitory-the type that shows forth in some way or <lb/>
            other glimpses and images of the benevolence and felicity <lb/>
            that dwell around that god. But as for his migrations and <lb/>
            changes which bind him together when he emits fire, as <lb/>
            they tell, and again quenches it, and directs it upon earth, <lb/>
            sea, the winds, animals; and the dreadful sufferings of <lb/>
            plants and living things, all such it is impiety even to hear <lb/>
            mentioned. Otherwise the Deity would be worse than the <lb/>
            child in the poem, as to the game it plays with a heap of <lb/>
            sand, first built up and then thrown over: He would be <lb/>
            playing the same game with the universe and the world; <lb/>
            first making things that are not, then destroying what is <lb/>
            made. For, on the contrary, whatever has been generated, <lb/>
            in whatever way, in the world, this binds all existence to­ <lb/>
            gether, and checks the infirmity inherent in the medley 1 <lb/>
            that tends to destruction. And to me what seems most <lb/>
            opposed to, and testifying against the aforesaid legend is <lb/>
            this very word, the addressing ‘ Thou art' to the god, as <lb/>
            though neither change of place or transformation were <lb/>
            possible with respect to him, but are applied to some other <lb/>
            god (or better say dæmon) appointed to preside over Nature <lb/>

            tamed to do and suffer such things, as is evident at first <lb/>
            sight from our god's titles, so contrary and contradictory <lb/>
            to such a conception of his character. For the one is called <lb/>
            Apollo, the other Pluto; the one is styled Delius (apparent), <lb/>
            the other Aidoneus (invisible); the one Phœleus (bright), <lb/>
            the other Scotios (full of darkness) ; and by the side of the <lb/>
            one stand the Muses and Memory, beside the other Oblivion <lb/>
            and Silence ; the one is entitled from completion and giving <lb/>
            light, the other is the ‘ lord of unseeing Night and unwork­ <lb/>
            ing Sleep;' the one is ‘ of all the gods most hateful to <lb/>
            mankind,' touching whom Pindar hath said, not un­ <lb/>
            pleasantly, ‘He hath been condemned to be the most un­ <lb/>
            delightful unto mortals.' With good cause, then, Euri­ <lb/>
            pides says, <lb/>
            “ 1 Drink offerings to the dead and gone, <lb/>
            Chants that the god with golden hair, <lb/>
            Phoebus, receiveth not.' <lb/>
            and, before him, Sophocles, ' Above all things, sports and <lb/>
            songs doth Apollo love; but mourning and groans Pluto <lb/>
            hath gotten for his share.' Sophocles also has distinctly <lb/>
            assigned to each of them his proper instruments in these <lb/>
            words, <lb/>
            “‘ Neither the mournful flute, nor merry lyre.' <lb/>
            For it was late and only yesterday that the flute gave forth <lb/>
            its sound at scenes of merriment; in old times it drawled <lb/>
            out in lamentations, at funerals, and held this office (not a <lb/>
            very respectable or cheerful one) at scenes of the kind. <lb/>
            Afterwards, however, it was admitted to everything. But, <lb/>
            to say the truth, those who have mixed up things relating <lb/>
            to gods with those relating to daemons, have brought them­ <lb/>
            selves chiefly into trouble. But indeed the maxim, ‘ Know <note type="footnote"> Death and destruction, which is in reality but a separation of collected <lb/>

            thyself' appears to run counter to the ‘Thou art,' and <lb/>
            again, in one way, to harmonize with it; for the one is <lb/>
            addressed through awe and veneration to the god, the <lb/>
            other is a reminder to mortality of the nature and frailty <lb/>
            that envelopes it."</p><pb n="197"/>

            HEN said Sylla, " These things belong to my story, <lb/>
            and form part of it: but if you come at all into col­ <lb/>
            lision with these popular notions, that are in everybody's <lb/>
            mouth, about the Face in the Moon, I think I should be <lb/>
            glad to learn it." “ Why should we not," I replied, " driven <lb/>
            back as we are by the difficulty in the first case, to the <lb/>
            latter subject-just as people in lingering diseases, when <lb/>
            they have lost all hope in the common remedies, and <lb/>
            usual courses of diet, fly for refuge to purifications, spells, <lb/>
            and dreams: in the same way it is a matter of compul­ <lb/>
            sion in obscure and insoluble problems, when common, <lb/>
            accredited, and customary arguments fail to convince, to <lb/>
            make trial of others more out of the way, and not despise <lb/>

            fashioned charm, and hunt out the truth in all quarters.</p>
          <p>II. " For you see at once how absurd is the explanation <lb/>
            that the apparent figure in the moon is merely an affec­ <lb/>
            tion of the sight, which is dazzled by the brightness, by <lb/>
            reason of its own weakness ; a thing we call... it 1 takes <lb/>

            gard to the Sun, which strikes upon the eye both sharp <lb/>
            and forcibly; whence Empedocles hath described the dif­ <lb/>
            ference between the two, not inelegantly, <lb/>
            “ ‘ The shrill-voiced sun, the softly whispering moon,’ <lb/>
            designating in this way the attractive, cheerful, and in­ <lb/>
            offensive character of the latter luminary. Afterwards, <lb/>
            giving the reason why dim and weak eyes discern no diffe­ <lb/>
            rence of form in the moon, but her orb strikes upon them <lb/>
            as smooth and completely filled up, whilst those that have <lb/>
            sharp and strong sight make out better, and distinguish <lb/>
            the lineaments of the Face, and seize upon the difference <lb/>
            more clearly. For the contrary ought to be the case, if <lb/>
            that appearance were produced from the eye's being over­ <lb/>
            come ; because where the sense affected was weaker, the <lb/>
            stronger 1 would be the impression produced. But the <lb/>
            inequality [of the surface] refutes this explanation, for the <lb/>
            sight does not rest upon a continuous and confused shadow. <lb/>
            And Hegesianax in describing it hath not ill said, <lb/>
            “‘ With fire she shines all round, but in the midst <lb/>
            More blue than black appears a maiden's face <lb/>
            And moistened 2 cheeks, that blush to meet the gaze.' <lb/>
            For in reality the shaded parts, as they go round, creep <lb/>
            under the bright ones, and are in turn cut away and com­ <lb/>

            and asking what was the opinion of Clearchus: "It better <lb/>
            suits," replied I, " any other person than yourself to be <lb/>
            ignorant of the story, inasmuch as it proceeds from the <lb/>
            very focus of geometry: for the fellow says that the so- <lb/>
            called face is only reflected images and appearances of the <lb/>
            great sea (the ocean) that are shown upon the moon ; for <lb/>
            that her external circumference when concave1 is naturally <lb/>
            adapted to catch the reflections rising up from various <lb/>
            quarters, whilst the full moon is of all mirrors, in point of <lb/>
            polish and of brilliancy the most beautiful and the most <lb/>
            clear. For just as you suppose that the rainbow, when <lb/>
            the light is reflected against the sun, is impressed upon <lb/>
            the clouds that have received gradually a watery smooth­ <lb/>
            ness and surface, in the same way, that writer says, the <lb/>
            external sea (our ocean) is reflected on the moon, not in­ <lb/>
            deed from the place it occupies, but from where the re­ <lb/>

            its surface and reflection. And Agesianax, in another <lb/>
            place, has said:­ <lb/>
            " ‘ Or some great wave of ocean, rising steep, <lb/>
            Shows like an image on the blazing mirror.'"</p>
          <p>IV. Apollonius then was amused, and exclaimed: <lb/>
            " How original and entirely new is the construction of this <lb/>
            theory-it bespeaks a man possessed of audacity as well as <lb/>
            wit! But in what way is it open to objection ? " "In the <lb/>
            first place," I replied, “ because the nature of the outer <lb/>
            sea is one and the same, a uniform and unbroken expanse <lb/>
            of water; whereas the appearance of the dark parts in the <lb/>
            moon is not one and the same, but shows as it were pro­ <lb/>
            jecting tongues of land, because the bright part diversifies <note type="footnote"> 1 When the moon takes the form of a crescent. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            and defines the dark; so that from each of these being <lb/>
            separated, and having a boundary of its own, the projec­ <lb/>
            tions of the bright parts upon the darkened, assuming the <lb/>
            form of elevations and depressions, arrange in a most <lb/>
            natural manner the features that appear around the eyes <lb/>
            and lips; so that we must either suppose there are several <lb/>
            outer seas intersected by tongues of land and continents, <lb/>
            which supposition is both absurd and false, or else there <lb/>
            being but one it is not reasonable that the image of it <lb/>
            should be reflected diversified in this way. It is, however, <lb/>
            safer to ask the question than to demonstrate, when you <lb/>
            are present, whether the habitable world, being equal in <lb/>
            length and width, it is possible for all the view at once <lb/>
            from the moon to be reflected and reach the sea.... nay, <lb/>
            more, to such as are sailing on the great ocean, and live in <lb/>
            the middle of it, like the Britons-and this too, whilst the <lb/>
            earth, as you have told us, does not occupy the place of a, <lb/>
            centre with regard to the sphere of the moon." 1 " It is <lb/>
            your business," I replied, " to investigate this problem; <lb/>
            the reflection of the prospect, however, against the moon, is <lb/>
            neither your business to investigate, nor that of Hippar- <lb/>
            ChUB, although it is an interesting question. But many <lb/>
            amongst natural philosophers are not satisfied to hold this <lb/>
            doctrine of similar effects with respect to the sight; but <lb/>
            it is more probable that the thing is a collision, or as it <lb/>
            were impact and rebound of particles, in the same way as <lb/>
            the atoms invented by Epicurus. Your Clearchus will not, <lb/>
            I fancy, suppose the moon a ponderous and solid body, <lb/>
            but a star composed of sether, and luminous, to use your <lb/>
            language, ... it is natural she should reflect the view or <lb/>
            the impact to the same extent that the reflection has gone <lb/>
            away from her. And if he requires anything more, we <lb/>
            will ask how it comes that the face in the moon alone is <note type="footnote"> I All this is in confusion, and some part quite lost, for the end of the <lb/>

            the reflection of the ocean, and not in any other of the <lb/>
            stars, numerous as they be: and yet probability demands <lb/>
            that the sight should be thus affected with respect to all <lb/>
            alike, or no one at all. Look at Lucius, and remind him <lb/>
            of what was said at first starting."</p>
          <p>V. Then Lucius: " But for fear we should seem to <lb/>
            be insulting Pharnaces, by passing over the Stoical doc­ <lb/>
            trine on the subject, without a word said for it, pray <lb/>
            make some reply, by all means, to the man that supposes <lb/>
            the moon a mixture of air and liquid fire, and asserts that <lb/>
            as when a ripple runs over the sea in a calm, so when this <lb/>
            air blackens, an appearance like definite shapes is produced <lb/>
            ... [on the moon's face]." "You act kindly," replied <lb/>
            it "my dear Lucius, in thus cloaking their absurdity <lb/>
            under decent names ; but not so did our friend, who used <lb/>
            to say, ‘they gave the moon a black eye,' by thus covering <lb/>
            her face with spots and dark patches, at one and the same <lb/>
            time proclaiming her Artemis and Athene, and then making <lb/>
            her out a composition and mass of dusky air and coaly fire, <lb/>
            not possessing any kindling spark or light of her own, <lb/>
            but to be a body hard of separation, and scorched by fire : <lb/>
            just like those pieces of earthenware styled by the poets 1 <lb/>
            ‘ lustreless and ashy.' Because, however, a charcoal fire, <lb/>
            such as they make out the moon's to be, has neither per­ <lb/>
            manence nor consistence, unless it gets hold of a material <lb/>
            that retains and at the same time feeds it, I fancy those <lb/>
            philosophers have seen farthest into the matter who say in <lb/>
            joke, that Vulcan is said to be lame, because fire cannot go <lb/>
            on without wood any more than a lame man without a <lb/>
            stick. If, then, the moon is fire, from whence is so large <lb/>

            element, that has the natural property of sublimating and <lb/>
            setting on fire everything in its reach. And if this air has <lb/>
            been generated, how comes it that it continues so long a <lb/>
            time, and does not fly off and change its form, being set <lb/>
            at liberty by the fire, but maintains itself and co-exists such <lb/>

            being subtile and diffused, not to remain stationary, but <lb/>
            to fly abroad ; for that it should be condensed is not pos­ <lb/>

            naturally disposed to be solidified. And velocity of flight <lb/>

            ing along too with such immense swiftness. For they <lb/>
            (the Stoics) quarrel with Empedocles for making the moon <lb/>
            ‘ a congelation of air, of the nature of hail, embraced by a <lb/>
            sphere of fire;' whilst they themselves pretend that the <lb/>
            moon, a ball of fire, contains air dispersed in different <lb/>
            directions, and this, too, though she has neither fissures <lb/>
            in her surface, nor deep places, nor cavities (things which <lb/>
            those that make her out an earthly substance concede to <lb/>
            her), but this same air is lying, forsooth, superficially upon <lb/>
            her convexity. This arrangement is preposterous with re­ <lb/>
            spect to permanence,2 and impossible with respect to sight <lb/>
            in the times of full moon ; for, in that case, it ought not <lb/>
            to define anything black and shaded, but either be hidden <lb/>
            and darkened [completely], or else to be lighted up at the <lb/>

            and hollows of the earth, whither the light doth not enter, <lb/>
            continues obscure and unilluminated; whilst that from <lb/>
            without diffused around the earth acquires brightness and <lb/>
            a lustrous colour, for it readily mixes itself with every <lb/>
            kind of property, or force, by reason of its liquid nature, <lb/>
            and especially if it but ‘ lay hold of the light,' as you call <lb/>
            it, and touch the same, then is it entirely converted and <lb/>
            lighted up. This selfsame fact, therefore, though it may <lb/>
            seem to do good service to such as are for thrusting the <lb/>
            air in the moon into her deep places and ravines, yet re­ <lb/>
            futes those of you who knead up and compose her sphere, <lb/>

            for shade to be left upon her surface, when the sun <lb/>
            illuminates with his light the whole extent of the moon <lb/>

          <p>VI. Then Pharnaces, whilst I was still speaking, broke <lb/>
            in with: " Just what I expected comes against us, borrowed <lb/>
            from the Academy, when we are engaged in arguing with <lb/>
            other people: never to furnish proof of what they assert <lb/>
            themselves, but they needs must treat as defendants such <lb/>
            as do not attack them, whatever the case maybe. But me, <lb/>
            at any rate, you will not draw into making a defence of the <lb/>
            theory you impute to the Stoics, before I get satisfaction out <lb/>
            of you for turning the affairs of the universe upside down." <lb/>
            " Only," replied Lucius laughing, " do not bring an action <lb/>
            for impiety against us, just as Cleanthes thought it right <lb/>
            that the Greeks collectively should impeach Aristagoras 1 <lb/>
            the Stoic, of impiety, for overthrowing the altar of earth, <lb/>
            because the fellow attempted to account for visible pheno­ <lb/>

            the earth rolls round down an oblique circlet turning at <note type="footnote"> 1 Aliter, Aristarchus. </note><note type="footnote"> a The Zodiac. Modem savants pass this theory slightingly by, as “ a <lb/>

            the same time upon its own axis. We, however, say no­ <lb/>
            thing out of our own heads; whilst they who suppose the <lb/>
            moon an earth, how do they turn things upside down, any <lb/>
            more than you do who place the earth here in the air, al­ <lb/>
            though it be, by far, bigger than the moon, as mathema­ <lb/>
            ticians calculate her magnitude during her eclipses, and by <lb/>
            the length of time1 consumed in her passage through the <lb/>
            shadow ? For the shadow of the earth is projected of lesser <lb/>
            size by the illuminating body being the larger; and that <lb/>
            the upper part of the shadow itself is fine and narrow, was <lb/>
            not unknown, as he says, to Homer also, for he entitles <lb/>
            night' swift,’2 by reason of the pointed form of the shadow. <lb/>
            But by this philosopher the moon is convicted on the <lb/>
            strength of her eclipses, and gets off with hardly three of <lb/>
            her own (apparent) magnitudes, for consider to how many <lb/>
            moons the earth is equal, if it projects a shadow, which, at <lb/>
            the shortest, is thrice the diameter of the moon. But yet <lb/>
            you are afraid for the moon, lest she should tumble down; <lb/>
            but as for the earth, Eschylus perhaps has reassured you, <lb/>
            like Atlas, <lb/>
            “‘ He stands, the pillar of the sky and earth, <lb/>
            Propping a load not easy for the arms;’ <lb/>
            that is, if there flows under the moon only thin air, not <lb/>
            competent to support a solid body; whilst the earth, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Pindar, ‘ adamantine-shod columns keep in on <lb/>
            every side.' And for this reason Pharnaces himself is <lb/>
            under no apprehension of the earth's falling, whereas he <note type="footnote">who can use his common sense that Aristarchus had his own arguments, <lb/>
            derived from observation of the phenomena, that satisfied himself and <lb/>
            his disciples of the soundness of his hypothesis. How unfortunate that <lb/>
            Plutarch did not take the trouble to give some brief notice of them, as <lb/>
            he has done here of so many others of less value. </note><note type="footnote"> I <unclear>τἤς</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποχη̃ς</foreign> should be in the dative, else I cannot see how the pas­ <lb/>

            compassionates such as lie under the roadway of the moon, <lb/>
            namely, the Ethiopians and people of Taprobane, lest so <lb/>
            vast a weight should drop upon them; and yet, a safeguard <lb/>
            to the moon against falling down is her motion, and the <lb/>
            rapidity1 of her gyration, just as objects placed in slings <lb/>
            have a hindrance from falling out in the circular whirling. <lb/>
            For the natural tendency acts upon each object, unless it <lb/>
            be diverted by some extraneous force. Consequently, her <lb/>
            own weight does not act upon the moon, because by means <lb/>
            of her rapid rotation its downward tendency is neutralized; <lb/>
            there were rather cause to wonder at her not remaining <lb/>
            stationary, like the earth, and not rolling out of her <lb/>
            place. As it is, the moon has the greatest reason for not <lb/>
            being carried in our direction; but the earth, as being <lb/>
            destitute of other motion, it was natural should remain <lb/>
            fixed through the force of gravity alone, because it is <lb/>
            heavier than the moon, not by the same proportion as it is <lb/>
            the larger of the two, but in still greater degree inasmuch <lb/>
            as the latter is all the lighter through heat and burning up <lb/>
            of her substance. And, in fine, the moon, from what you <lb/>
            say, if she be fire, naturally stands in need of earth and <lb/>
            matter, in which she walks, and clings to, and keeps to­ <lb/>
            gether, and fans the flame of her force. Now fire cannot <lb/>
            be imagined as being maintained without fuel, but earth, <lb/>
            you assert, remains fixed without either foundation or root." <lb/>
            " Certainly so," replied Pharnaces, " because it occupies <lb/>
            its proper and natural place, as being itself the centre, for <lb/>
            this is the place around which all weights gravitate and <lb/>
            rest, and are carried and tend together from all parts; <lb/>
            whereas the whole upper region, even though it should re­ <lb/>

            the same point, and presses with all its particles upon its <lb/>
            own centre--earth will claim for herself all ponderous <lb/>
            things, not so much because earth is the centre of the <lb/>
            universe, as because they are particles of herself; and <lb/>
            the fact of things gravitating downwards will be a proof, <lb/>
            not of the centripetal force towards earth, but of affi­ <lb/>
            nity and sympathy, as it were, with earth, in particles <lb/>
            once separated from her, and now flying back to her again. <lb/>
            For in the same way that the sun attracts to himself the <note type="footnote"> 1 His head would be upwards with respect to the other surface of the <lb/>

            particles out of which he is composed, so doth earth re­ <lb/>
            ceive the falling stone, and carries it to the place where in <lb/>
            course of time each one of such bodies is made one with <lb/>
            and assimilated to herself. But if it happens to be some <lb/>
            other body, not assigned to earth from the beginning, nor <lb/>
            a fragment separated from herself, but having a composi­ <lb/>
            tion and nature of its own (as those men will say of the <lb/>
            moon)—what prevents it from existing by itself, sepa­ <lb/>
            rately, following its own tendency, and fettered by its own <lb/>
            particles ? By no means is earth proved to be the centre of <lb/>
            the universe, and the connection and relation of the latter <lb/>
            here with earth, guide us to the manner in which it is <lb/>
            probable the phenomena relating to the moon take their <lb/>
            course. I do not see why the philosopher who forces all <lb/>
            earthy and ponderous particles into one and the same <lb/>
            place, and makes them out portions of one and the same <lb/>
            body, does not concede the same natural tendency to such <lb/>
            as are without weight, but allows so many composite <lb/>
            bodies of fire to exist separately, and does not impera­ <lb/>
            tively collect into one lump all the stars that be, and de­ <lb/>
            mand that there should be one common body of all upward <lb/>
            tending and fiery particles."</p>
          <p>IX. " But," said I, " you assert that the sun, my dear <lb/>
            Apollonides, is distant infinite myriads of miles from <lb/>

            thrust away so many myriads of miles from the superior <lb/>
            circumference, and crept as it were into some hole and <lb/>
            corner of creation: at least she is so much below the other <lb/>
            stars that one cannot express the measure of the distance, <lb/>
            but arithmetic fails you mathematicians in calculating the <lb/>
            same; whereas, in a manner, she touches Earth, and re <lb/>
            volving near, <lb/>

            says Empedocles. ‘ She around the point .... <unclear/></p>
          <p>For neither does she often overpass the shadow [of <lb/>
            Earth], and elevate herself a little, by reason that the illu­ <lb/>

            volve so close to, and as it were in the embrace of Earth, as <lb/>
            to be screened against the Sun by it, without ever soaring <lb/>
            above this shady terrestrial and darksome region which is <lb/>
            the allotment of Earth. Wherefore I think we must conn­ <lb/>
            dently declare the moon to be within the limits of Earth, <lb/>
            and to be overcast by the point of Earth's shadow.1</p>

            stars and planets, what Aristarchus points out in his trea­ <lb/>
            tise ' Upon Magnitudes and Distances,' that the distance <lb/>
            of the sun is more than eighteen times, but less than <lb/>
            twenty times the distance of the moon, by which she is <lb/>
            separated from us: and yet the computation that gives <lb/>
            the greatest elevation to the moon says she is distant from <lb/>
            us fifty-six times the space from the centre of the earth <lb/>

              stadia, according to those who make a moderate calcula­ <lb/>
              tion of it. And, calculated from this basis, the sun's <lb/>
              distance from the moon amounts to over four thousand <lb/>
              and thirty myriads of stadia. So far, then, is she sepa­ <lb/>
              rated from the sun by reason of her weight, and approxi­ <lb/>
              mated to earth, that if one must define substances by <lb/>
              localities, the constitution and beauty of Earth attracts the <lb/>
              moon, and she is of influence in matters and over persons <lb/>
              upon Earth, by reason of her relationship and proximity. <lb/>
              And we do not go wrong, I think, when we assign to those <lb/>
              bodies above denominated such immense depth and dis­ <lb/>
              tance, and leave to that which is below a certain circular <lb/>
              course and broadway as much as lies between earth and <lb/>
              the moon: for neither the man who pretends the summit <lb/>
              of heaven to be the sole 'above,' and denominates all the <lb/>
              rest as ‘below,’ is reasonable in his definition; nor yet is <lb/>
              he who circumscribes ‘ below' by the limits of Earth, or <lb/>
              rather by the Centre, to be listened to: but even move­ <lb/>
              able .... inasmuch as the universe allows of the interval <lb/>
              required by reason of its own extensiveness. But in reply <lb/>
              to such as demand that all which is separate from earth <lb/>
              shall be consequently ‘ above' and ‘ on high,' another <lb/>
              directly responds with the contrary axiom, that all which is <lb/>
              reckoned from the fixed circumference is to be considered <lb/>
              as ‘ below.'</p>
          <p>XI. " And, finally, in what sense, and in reference to <lb/>
            what thing is Earth said to be ‘ intermediate ?' For the <lb/>
            universe is infinite; now that which is infinite hath neither <lb/>
            beginning nor limit, so it does not belong to it to possess <lb/>
            a middle: for infinity is the deprivation of limits. But he <lb/>
            who makes out Earth to be the middle not of the universe, <lb/>
            but of the world, is ridiculous for his simplicity if he does <lb/>
            not reflect that the ‘world’ itself is liable to the very <lb/>
            same objections: for the universe hath not left a middle <lb/>
            place for it also, but it is borne along without house or <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            home in the boundless vacuum, towards nothing cognate <lb/>
            to itself; perhaps it has found out for itself some other <lb/>
            cause for remaining fixed, and so has stood still, but cer­ <lb/>
            tainly not owing to the nature of its position. And it is <lb/>
            allowable for one to conjecture alike with respect to Earth <lb/>
            and with respect to the moon, that by some contrary soul <lb/>
            and nature they are 1 .... differences, the former re­ <lb/>
            maining stationary here, the latter moving along. But <lb/>
            apart from these considerations, see whether a certain im­ <lb/>
            portant fact has not escaped their notice. For if what­ <lb/>
            soever space, and whatever thing exists away from the <lb/>
            centre of Earth, is the ‘ above,' then no part of Earth is <lb/>
            ‘ below,' but Earth herself and the things upon Earth ; <lb/>
            and, in a word, everybody standing around or investing <lb/>
            the centre, become the ‘ above;' whilst ‘ below' is one <lb/>
            sole thing, that incorporeal point, which has the duty of <lb/>
            counterbalancing the whole constitution of the world; <lb/>
            if, indeed, the ‘below’ is by its nature opposed to the <lb/>
            ‘ above.' And this is not the only absurdity in the argu­ <lb/>
            ment, but it also does away with the cause through which <lb/>
            all ponderous bodies gravitate in this direction, and tend <lb/>
            downwards: for there is no mark below towards which <lb/>
            they move: for the incorporeal point is not likely (nor do <lb/>
            they pretend it is) to exert so much force as to draw down <lb/>
            all objects to itself, and keep them together around itself. <lb/>
            But yet, it is proved unreasonable, and repugnant to facts, <lb/>
            to suppose the ‘ above' of the world to be a whole, but <lb/>
            the ‘below’ an incorporeal and indefinite limit: whereas <lb/>
            that course is consistent with reason, to say, as we do, that <lb/>
            the space is large and possessed of width, and is defined <lb/>
            by the ‘ above ' and the ‘ below' of locality.</p>
          <p>XII. “ Not but that we may, if you please, suppose that <lb/>
            motions in the heavens are contrary to the nature of those <lb/>
            of terrestrial bodies; and let us examine the matter quietly, <note type="footnote"> I [Actuated, the consequence of the diversity being.] </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            not in the tragic style, but in a good-humoured way, how <lb/>
            such an assumption as this does not make out the moon <lb/>
            not to be an earth, but only an earth in a, position for <lb/>
            which it is not naturally adapted. For the phenomena at <lb/>
            Etna underground are against the order of Nature; but <lb/>
            ‘ fire is there, and the blast imprisoned in the bellows is <lb/>
            the upward force ;’1 whereas that which by nature is im­ <lb/>
            ponderous, comes, in spite of itself, into places for which it <lb/>
            was not made. And the Soul itself," I continued," is it not <lb/>
            locked up by God in the body against its own nature: the <lb/>
            one swift, the other slow; the one fiery, the other frigid <lb/>
            (as you assert); the one invisible, the other an object of <lb/>
            sense ? For this reason, therefore, let us not say that the <lb/>
            soul is nothing to the body; but that it is a thing divine, <lb/>
            which by reason of its gravity and density, travels round <lb/>
            all heaven, earth, and sea, at one and the same moment, <lb/>
            and being parcelled out pervades the flesh, the sinews, the <lb/>
            marrow of our bodies, the cause of feelings in infinite <lb/>
            variety, when coupled with moisture. But this Jupiter of <lb/>
            ours doth not follow his own nature, nor is one great con­ <lb/>
            tinuous fire; but occasionally he withdraws himself, bends <lb/>
            downwards, and changes his form, having turned and still <lb/>
            turning himself into every object in the course of his <lb/>
            changes. But take heed, my good sir, and consider, lest <lb/>
            by transposing and drawing away each thing in turn from <lb/>
            the place where it is naturally meant to be, you philo­ <lb/>
            sophically bring about the dissolution of the world, and <lb/>
            introduce the ‘ Discord' of Empedocles into its affairs; <lb/>
            or, rather, lest you stir up to war upon Nature, the Titans <lb/>
            and Giants of old, and should desire to see again the <lb/>
            fabled terrific disorder and lawlessness of their times; <lb/>
            apart everything ponderous, and apart everything light: <lb/>
            “‘ Where no one views with awe Sol's glorious face, <lb/>
            Nor Earth's own shaggy breed, nor Ocean's kind,' <note type="footnote"> I A quotation from some poet. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            as Empedocles says; nor did Earth participate in heat, <lb/>
            nor Water in air, neither was there anything of the pon­ <lb/>
            derous up above, or of the imponderous down below, but <lb/>
            unmixed, unsocial, solitary were the principles of the <lb/>
            universe—not admitting the union of one with another, <lb/>
            nor communication, but fleeing and shrinking away from <lb/>
            each other, carried along by individual and independent <lb/>
            impulses, they were so circumstanced as is everything from <lb/>
            which God is absent, according to Plato (that is, just as <lb/>
            our bodies are circumstanced, when mind and soul have <lb/>
            left them); until what time Desire came upon Nature by <lb/>
            the sending of Providence, when Amity was engendered, <lb/>
            and Venus and Love, as Empedocles declares, as also say <lb/>
            Parmenides and Hesiod, in order that they, by exchanging <lb/>
            places and borrowing forces from one another, and the one <lb/>
            set being bound by the necessity of motion, the other by <lb/>
            that of rest, compelled to emerge and change place from <lb/>
            the position where Nature placed them, towards a better <lb/>
            one, they might bring about the union and fellowship of <lb/>
            the Whole.</p>
          <p>XIII. "For if no other part of the divisions of the <lb/>
            world were placed contrary to its nature, but each lay <lb/>
            where it was naturally fit, standing in need of no change <lb/>
            of place nor re-arrangement, and without having needed <lb/>
            anything of the sort at the beginning, I am puzzled to <lb/>
            see what is the business of a Providence, or of what Jupi­ <lb/>
            ter has been creator and father, ‘ that most skilful arti­ <lb/>
            ficer.' For there is no use of marshallers in a camp, if <lb/>
            each one of the officers knows out of his own head the <lb/>
            rank, station, and moment, that he is bound to occupy <lb/>
            and to observe; nor of gardeners or builders, if the water <lb/>
            of itself is disposed to move upon the things that require <lb/>
            it, and to flow over and irrigate the same; and in the <lb/>
            other case, the bricks, timbers, and stones following their <lb/>
            natural tendencies and inclinations, should of themselves <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            take up the requisite arrangement and position. And if <lb/>
            this argument does not downright subvert the doctrine of <lb/>
            a Providence, but leaves to God the government and dis­ <lb/>
            tribution of things that be-why should we be surprised <lb/>
            that Nature has been so ordered and divided, that here is <lb/>
            fixed Fire, there Stars; and again, the Earth here, and <lb/>
            overhead the Moon; all of them bound by a stronger chain <lb/>
            than the natural one, that is, by the one in accordance with <lb/>
            Reason ?1 Wherefore, if all things must needs follow their <lb/>
            natural tendencies, and move on in the manner for which <lb/>
            they were created, then let not the Sun revolve in a circle, <lb/>
            nor yet Venus, nor any other of the planets, do the same <lb/>
            -for it is upward, and not in a circle, that imponderous and <lb/>
            fiery bodies were created to move. But if Nature possesses <lb/>
            such a power of exchange, in spite of the locality,2 that here <lb/>
            Fire as it moves, moves upwards, but after it has arrived at <lb/>
            heaven, it is carried around in company with the celestial <lb/>
            revolution. What is there to be surprised at if it comes <lb/>
            to pass with ponderous and earthy bodies, when transferred <lb/>
            into another form of motion, that they be overpowered by <lb/>
            the influence of the element that encompasses them? For <lb/>
            in fact, it is not consistent with Nature that the upward <lb/>
            tendency of imponderous bodies should be neutralized by <lb/>
            the motion of the heavens ; but rather that it should not <lb/>
            be able to master such as be ponderous and gravitate down­ <lb/>
            wards ; nay rather, on occasion, when it has transposed <lb/>
            the latter also by its own power, it should employ their <lb/>
            nature to a better end than for what it was created.</p>
          <p>XIV. " Not but that if one must dismiss the notion of <lb/>
            habits violently overcome, and speak one's opinion without <lb/>
            disguise, it is probable no part of the universe possesses <lb/>
            either place, order, or motion, of its own, which we can. <lb/>
            universally style its natural one; but that when each <note type="footnote"> I The Platonic term for the Divine Will, or the “Logos.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Natural position of each element. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            thing shows itself usefully and properly moving to that <lb/>
            end on account of which, and for which, it was born or has <lb/>
            been manufactured, and submitting to, or doing that which <lb/>
            is conducive to its own preservation, perfection, or effi­ <lb/>
            ciency, it then appears to possess its natural place, motion, <lb/>
            and disposition. Man himself, at any rate, who as much <lb/>
            as anything that exists is naturally made, holds upward <lb/>
            the ponderous and earthy portions of himself, especially <lb/>
            about the head, and in his centre the hot and fiery particles. <lb/>
            And of the teeth, part are planted above, part below, and <lb/>
            yet neither set are placed contrary to Nature; nor of Fire, <lb/>
            is the part that shines in the eyes placed according to <lb/>
            nature, and that detached in the belly and the heart placed <lb/>
            contrary to nature ; but each respectively is stationed pro­ <lb/>
            perly and serviceably: <lb/>
            “‘ Truly the snail and thick-skinned tortoise,' <lb/>
            and the nature of every shell-fish, as Empedocles says <lb/>
            from his own observation: <lb/>
            " ‘ Where earth thou shalt behold above their flesh, <lb/>
            and the stony substance does not oppress their constitu. <lb/>
            tion, nor crush it by its incumbent weight; neither, on the <lb/>
            other hand, doth the heat, by reason of its lightness, fly <lb/>
            off and escape upwards; but they are mingled with each <lb/>
            other and ranged together, in accordance with the nature <lb/>

            ing earth in many places, in many others water and fire, <lb/>

            into the place it now fills in the body, in consequence of <lb/>
            its levity, nor did the heart slip down and fall into the <lb/>
            breast by reason of its weight, but because it was better <lb/>
            each of the two should be so placed. Therefore, let us not <lb/>
            think, of the parts of the world, either that Earth is lying <lb/>
            here because she hath tumbled down through her own <lb/>
            weight, or the Sun (as Metrodorus the Chian supposed) <lb/>
            was shot up into the upper region, through his levity, after <lb/>
            the manner of a bubble, or that the other stars got into <lb/>
            the places where they now are, because they gravitated <lb/>
            thither as though according to the discrimination of a pair <lb/>
            of scales.' But, inasmuch as He that rules by reason <lb/>
            is the master, they, like light-giving eyes, are fixed in the <lb/>
            brow of the universe, and stray about: whilst the sun fills <lb/>
            the place of a heart, and, like blood and breath, distributes <lb/>
            and disperses from out of himself both heat and light. <lb/>
            Earth and sea the world uses according to Nature for what­ <lb/>
            ever purposes an animal uses its belly and bladder: whilst <lb/>
            the moon placed between Heaven and Earth, like the liver <lb/>
            between the belly and the heart, or some other soft intes­ <lb/>
            tine, diffuses here the warmth from above, and the exhala­ <lb/>
            tions rising hence she subtilizes by a certain process of <lb/>
            digestion and purification, around herself, and emits them <lb/>
            again. But whether her earthy and solid part contains <lb/>
            any region adapted for the reception of other things, is a <lb/>
            matter we cannot ascertain. And in every case, the better <lb/>
            part masters the subordinate part. And what can we gain, <lb/>
            so consistent with probability as this, out of what those philo­ <lb/>
            sophers assert ? They assert that the luminous and subtile <lb/>
            part of the æther, was converted into sky by reason of its <lb/>
            liquidity; and the condensed and conglomerated part into <lb/>
            air, and that the moon is the most sluggish part of these <lb/>
            two, and also the most turbid. But in spite of this, it is <lb/>
            in anybody's power to see that the moon is not cut off from <note type="footnote"> 1 In proportion to the weight of each. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            the æther, but rather floats on much of it in the space <lb/>
            around herself, and having under her the wind in abun. <lb/>
            dance .... revolve the comets. Thus, each one is put <lb/>
            ' in its fold,' not in accordance with their tendencies de­ <lb/>
            pending on the gravity or levity of substance, but as having <lb/>
            been arranged by another cause, namely Reason”</p>
          <p>XVI. After these things had been said, and I handed <lb/>
            over the subject to Lucius, as I was advancing to the proofs <lb/>
            of the theory, Aristotle said with a smile: “ I testify that <lb/>
            you have been directing your whole argument against such <lb/>
            as suppose the moon to be half made of fire, and who pre­ <lb/>
            tend that universally some bodies tend upwards, others <lb/>
            downwards, of their own accord. For if there is anyone <lb/>
            that says the stars revolve in a circle by their own nature, <lb/>
            and are made of an element entirely different from the four <lb/>
            we know-something has just occurred to my recollection <lb/>
            very opportunely to get them out of the difficulty." " But," <lb/>
            said Lucius," if we make all the other stars, and the whole <lb/>
            of heaven, into one pure and unmixed nature, freed also <lb/>
            from all necessity of change consequent upon passiveness, <lb/>
            and if we trace out an orbit along which they all [shall <lb/>
            move] with never-ceasing revolution-no one, perhaps, will <lb/>
            quarrel with us on the present occasion ; although a thou­ <lb/>
            sand difficulties are left still unsolved. And when the <lb/>
            argument shall comprehend and touch upon the moon, she <lb/>
            no longer keeps her impassiveness, and that vaunted <lb/>
            beauty of her substance. But to pass over the other in­ <lb/>
            equalities and differences [she exhibits], this very Face that <lb/>
            appears in her, is produced either by some affection of her <lb/>
            own substance, or by the admixture of some different one. <lb/>
            Now that which is mixed with another suffers something, <lb/>
            for it loses its own purity, being infected by the quality of <lb/>
            the inferior element. But her own spurious nature, the <lb/>
            weakness of her pace, her heat so inefficient and dull, <lb/>
            whereby, according to Ion, ‘ no grape is ripened black’—to <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            what shall we attribute all this except to her feeble nature <lb/>
            and passiveness; that is, if passiveness belongs to an <lb/>
            eternal and celestial body ? and, to sum up, my dear Aria­ <lb/>
            totle, considered as an Earth the moon shows herself to be <lb/>
            a perfectly beautiful, awful, and well-ordered thing; but <lb/>
            viewed as a star or a luminary, or some divine and celestial <lb/>
            body, I fear she will prove shapeless and uncomely, and <lb/>
            bring shame upon that glorious appellation, if of all the <lb/>
            so numerous bodies existing in the heavens, she alone <lb/>
            goes about begging light from another, according to Par­ <lb/>
            menides, “‘ With eyes aye fixed upon the solar beams.’”</p>
          <p>Now my opponent in the dispute, quoting the saying <lb/>
            of Anaxagoras, " The sun grafts brightness in the moon," <lb/>
            was applauded by the company; but I will not repeat what <lb/>
            I learnt either from you, or conjointly with you ; but will <lb/>
            gladly go on to what is left.1 " That the moon, then, is <lb/>
            illuminated, not like glass or crystal, by the direct or trans­ <lb/>
            mitted light of the sun, is a probable supposition; nor <lb/>
            again, by reason of collected illumination or collected re­ <lb/>
            flection, in the same way as torches do,2 when the light is <lb/>
            augmented; for in that case it will be full moon to us none <lb/>
            the less at the times of new moon, or first and third quar­ <lb/>
            ters, if she neither covers nor blocks out the sun ; but the <lb/>
            light rather passes through her by reason of her fluidity, <lb/>
            or else it shines into her by way of intermixture, and lights <lb/>
            up all around her. For it is not possible to lay the blame <lb/>
            in the case of her dark quarters upon her deviations, or <lb/>
            retreatings, as in the cases when she shows half her orb, <lb/>
            or the same gibbous or crescent-shaped; but, according to <lb/>
            Democritus, she stands in a vertical line to the illuminat- <note type="footnote"> 1 This Treatise being in the form of a reported conversation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The moon does not collect a stock of light within her body-other­ <lb/>
            wise her light would not be intermittent. “ When the light of torches is <lb/>

             <pb n="219"/>
            ing body, and receives and takes in the sun: so that it were <lb/>
            probable that she at the same time is illuminated and <lb/>
            illuminates that body. But she is very far from doing <lb/>
            this; for at that moment she is invisible, and she fre­ <lb/>
            quently hides, and causes him to disappear, ‘ she strips <lb/>
            him of his beams,' as Empedocles says, <lb/>
            " ‘ Till up aloft, she veils so much his face <lb/>
            As the width measures of the blue-cyed1 moon:’ <lb/>
            as though the [sun's] light fell upon night and darkness, <lb/>
            and not upon another star. And as to what Posidonius <lb/>
            says, that ‘ the light of the sun does not pass through her, <lb/>
            on account of the depth of the moon,' is plainly confuted <lb/>
            by the fact; for the air, though unlimited and having a <lb/>
            depth many times greater than the moon's, is entirely <lb/>
            illuminated and shone upon by his rays. There is left, <lb/>
            therefore, the doctrine of Empedocles, that it is by means <lb/>
            of a certain reflection of the sun upon the moon that <lb/>
            the illumination which proceeds from her here below is <lb/>
            brought about. Consequently it [her light] comes to us <lb/>
            neither warm, nor brilliant, naturally enough, as there has <lb/>
            been a kindling and a mingling of different lights in that <lb/>
            case ; but just as voices in the case of reflections send back <lb/>
            the echo of the sound more dull, and the blows of shots <lb/>
            that rebound from an object fall with greatly diminished <lb/>
            force, <lb/>
            “ ‘ So the ray striking on the moon's broad disk,' <lb/>
            makes a feeble and dull rebound upon us, being deprived <lb/>
            of its strength by reflection."</p>
          <p>XVII. Then Sylla taking up the conversation said: <lb/>
            “ Certainly, this notion possesses some degree of proba­ <lb/>
            bility, but the thing that is the strongest of those that <note type="footnote"> 1 Or “ owl-faced," a far-fetched sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλαυϰώπις</foreign> quite in Empe­ <lb/>
            docles' style. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            make against it, pray, does it admit of any softening down, <lb/>
            or has it escaped my companion's observation ? " " What <lb/>
            is this ? " replied Lucius, " do you mean the question about <lb/>
            the half-moon ? ” “Yes, certainly," answered Sylla; “ for <lb/>
            the assertion has some reason on its side, that, since all re­ <lb/>
            flection takes place at equal angles, when the moon, show­ <lb/>
            ing but half her disk, rides in mid-heaven, the light from <lb/>
            her does not travel towards us, but glides off to the part <lb/>
            opposite to earth; for the sun, being upon the horizon, <lb/>
            touches the moon with his rays; consequently, being re­ <lb/>
            fracted at an equal angle, it [the light from the sun] will <lb/>
            rebound to the other extremity, and not throw the light so <lb/>
            far as us; or else there will be a great distortion and <lb/>
            parallax of the angle, which thing is not possible." “ Nay, <lb/>
            but indeed," replied Lucius, "this thing has been as­ <lb/>
            serted and looking, as he was talking, towards Mene­ <lb/>
            laus the mathematician, " I am ashamed, my dear Mene­ <lb/>
            laus, to take up a mathematical question in your presence, <lb/>
            which serves as the very foundation for the whole science <lb/>
            of Opticks, but there is no help for it," he continued, " for <lb/>
            the fact that all reflection extends itself at equal angles, is <lb/>
            neither self-evident nor universally admitted, but is con­ <lb/>
            tradicted in the case of convex mirrors, when they make <lb/>
            images larger than the objects themselves to one point of <lb/>
            vision. It is also contradicted in the case of double mir­ <lb/>
            rors, which being inclined to each other, and an angle <lb/>
            formed between them, each of the surfaces presents the <lb/>
            appearance of a double one, and gives four images from <lb/>
            one face, two of them looking towards the left parts from <lb/>
            outside, and two others, indistinct, looking to the right, in <lb/>
            the depth of the mirror. Of the production of which images, <lb/>
            Plato explains the cause; for he has said that in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the mirror's having got height,1 on this side and <note type="footnote"> 1 There is sufficient head room in the mirror-face for the images to <lb/>
            be repeated as the eyes involuntarily change their position. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            on that, the eyes transfer the reflection, as they change <lb/>
            their place from one side to the other. If, therefore, of the <lb/>
            images some run back directly to us, whilst some slipping <lb/>
            to the other side of the mirror are thrown back again from <lb/>
            thence to us, it is not possible that all reflections take <lb/>
            place in equal angles, as many as .... joining battle, they <lb/>
            demand to do away with the equality of angles by means <lb/>
            of the emanations flowing from the moon upon the earth, <lb/>
            because they suppose this theory more plausible than the <lb/>
            former. Not but that if we must needs gratify your great <lb/>
            darling, Geometry, and concede the point,—in the first place <lb/>
            it is likely enough that such happens 1 in the case of re- <lb/>
            Hectors made very exact as to their polished surfaces; <lb/>
            whereas the moon offers many inequalities and asperities <lb/>
            of surface, so that rays from a great body [like the sun] <lb/>
            going astray at considerable elevations, that allow of their <lb/>
            reflecting and exchanging with one another, are reflected <lb/>
            in all sorts of ways, and entangled with each other, and <lb/>
            kindle up the lustre in itself,2 because it is thrown upon <lb/>
            us from several reflectors at once. In the next place, even <lb/>
            though we allow the reflections upon the moon herself to <lb/>
            be at equal angles, it is not impossible that the rays, <lb/>
            travelling through so vast a distance, may get reflections <lb/>
            and circular slips of their own, so that the light is brought <lb/>
            into one, and made to shine. Some, too, write to show <lb/>
            that she casts many of her beams upon earth in the line <lb/>
            . . . . under the inclined, subtended. To construct a dia­ <lb/>
            gram in illustration of this theory, and that, too, for many <lb/>
            spectators, would be quite impracticable.</p>
          <p>XVIII. " To sum up, I wonder how they manage about the <lb/>
            half-moon's reaching us, together with the full round, and <note type="footnote"> I The doctrine of the equality of the angles of incidence and reflection <lb/>
            may hold good for truly polished surfaces, but not for irregular surfaces. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Independently of the moon, but somewhere in the heavens on the <lb/>

            the crescent. For if the mass of the moon, illuminated by <lb/>
            the sun, were made of æther, or of fire, he would not have <lb/>
            left her hemisphere shaded, and without lustre to the <lb/>
            sense [perceptible], but had he touched her in ever so <lb/>
            small a degree, in going round her, it would have been a <lb/>
            natural consequence that the sun should fill her substance, <lb/>
            and penetrate through the whole of it with his all-per­ <lb/>
            vading light, from the want of any resistance.1 For where <lb/>
            wine touches water at the edge, or a drop of blood falls <lb/>
            into any liquid, the whole quantity turns red, and changes <lb/>
            to the colour of blood; in like manner, they pretend that <lb/>
            the air itself is illuminated, not by emanations of any sort, <lb/>
            or rays mingling themselves in it, but by a conversion <lb/>
            and transformation due to impact and contagion: how do <lb/>
            they imagine that star touches star, and light light, with­ <lb/>
            out mixing together or making any confusion or change at <lb/>
            all, but to illume those objects only which they touch upon <lb/>
            their surface? For the circle which the sun, as he goes <lb/>
            round, traces and turns about with reference to the <lb/>
            moon, at one time falls upon the line which divides the <lb/>
            visible from the invisible portion of her body, at another <lb/>
            time rises up vertically so as to cut them, and to be cut by <lb/>
            the moon, producing various inclinations and relations of <lb/>
            the lighted to the darkened part, the complete circle and <lb/>
            the crescent forms in her appearance, all which proves <lb/>
            more than anything else that her illumination is not the <lb/>
            result of mixture but of contact, not ignition but irradia­ <lb/>
            tion. And since not only she is lighted up, but transmits <lb/>
            hither the image of her light, she supplies yet further <lb/>
            reason for our insisting upon our own explanation of her <lb/>
            nature; for reflections are produced by no object that is <lb/>
            porous or of loose texture. There is no such thing as light <note type="footnote"> I Supposing the moon made of æther, the sun on the least contact <lb/>
            would illuminate the whole orb, so there could be no half-moons or <lb/>
            crescents. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            rebounding back out of light, or fire out of fire, easily con­ <lb/>
            ceivable ; but the object that will produce opposition and <lb/>
            fracture must necessarily be something ponderous and solid <lb/>
            in order there may be impact against it, and resilience from <lb/>
            it. At any rate the sun himself penetrates the air because <lb/>
            it neither furnishes obstacles, nor offers resistance; whereas <lb/>
            from sticks and stones and clothes exposed to the light the <lb/>
            same sun gives back many reflections and irradiations. Thus, <lb/>
            in fact, we see the entire earth illuminated by her, for she <lb/>
            does not admit the light to a depth like water, nor through <lb/>
            the whole substance like air, but whatever kind of orbit <lb/>
            of the sun moves round the moon, and for as large a por­ <lb/>
            tion of her as is cut off thereby, just such another circle <lb/>
            goes round the earth, and just so large a portion is there <lb/>
            illuminating, and leaving the other not lighted up ; for the <lb/>
            hemisphere that is illuminated seems to be little larger in <lb/>
            either case. Allow me to speak geometrically according <lb/>
            to analogy, that if, there being three things which the <lb/>
            light from the sun touches, namely, the earth, the moon, <lb/>
            and the air, we see the moon illuminated, not in the <lb/>
            same way as the air, but rather in the same way as the <lb/>
            earth; it necessarily follows the two have the same nature, <lb/>
            being made to be affected in the same way by the same <lb/>
            agent."</p>
          <p>XIX. And when all had applauded Lucius,“ Well <lb/>
            done," I exclaimed, “you have added a good defence to <lb/>
            a good subject; for I must not defraud you of your <lb/>
            due." And he replied with a smile, "In the second <lb/>
            place then, we must further make use of analogy in order <lb/>
            that we may demonstrate the moon's affinity to Earth, not <lb/>
            only from both being similarly acted upon by the same <lb/>

            the phenomena connected with the sun, as the sun's being <lb/>
            eclipsed is to his actual setting, 1 you must allow to me if <lb/>
            you call to mind the eclipse which took place the year 3 <lb/>
            before this meeting, when many stars became visible in <lb/>
            different parts of the sky directly at the beginning of mid­ <lb/>
            day, and a mixture [of light and darkness] resembling <lb/>
            daybreak pervaded the atmosphere, otherwise this Theon <lb/>
            here will bring down upon us Mimnermus, and Cydias, <lb/>
            and Archilochus, and Stesichorus, and Pindar to boot, all <lb/>
            lamenting for ‘ the brightest one stolen away, and night <lb/>
            coming on at midday, and the sun's ray [travelling] the <lb/>
            path of darkness' .... as they say. And above all, <lb/>
            Homer, telling how' men's countenances were covered over <lb/>
            with night and darkness, and the sun was lost out of <lb/>
            heaven and vanished around the moon,' .... this happens <lb/>
            when one lunar month is ending and the next commencing. <lb/>
            The rest, with the accurate calculations of mathematicians, <lb/>
            has been worked out and brought to a certainty ; namely, <lb/>
            that night is the shadow of the earth, and the eclipse of the <lb/>
            sun is the shadow of the moon, when the light comes to <lb/>
            be in it. For3 the sun when setting, is blocked up by the <lb/>
            earth against the sight; but when eclipsed he is blocked <lb/>
            up by the moon, and both phenomena are occultations, but <lb/>
            that of setting is due to the earth, that of eclipse to the <lb/>
            moon, because she intercepts the view of him with her <lb/>
            shadow. What takes place is easily understood from the <lb/>
            following considerations. If the effect is the same, the <lb/>
            agents are the same; for it is a matter of necessity that <note type="footnote"> I The phenomena attending an eclipse of the sun closely resemble <lb/>
            those attending a regular sunset. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 April 30, A.D. 59 : a notice fixing the date of this Treatise. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 When the sun is setting, the view of his orb is obstructed by the <lb/>

            eclipsed, our sight of him is intercepted by the moon coming between <lb/>
            us and him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            the same things should happen in the same case from the <lb/>
            same causes. But that the darkness attending eclipses is not <lb/>
            complete darkness, and does not condense the atmosphere in <lb/>
            the same degree that night does, is a circumstance we ought <lb/>
            not to be surprised at; for the substance is the same of the <lb/>
            object that causes night and that causes the eclipse, but the <lb/>
            magnitude of each is not equal: for the Egyptians, I think, <lb/>
            say the moon is the seventy-second part of earth in size; <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, that she is as big as the Peloponnesus. But <lb/>
            Aristarchus proves that the moon's diameter bears a propor­ <lb/>
            tion [to that of earth] which is less than sixty to nineteen, <lb/>
            but somewhat greater than one hundred and eight to forty. <lb/>
            Consequently earth entirely takes away the sun from sight, <lb/>
            by reason of her magnitude; for the obstruction she pre­ <lb/>
            sents is extensive, and endures the space of a night, whereas <lb/>
            the moon, even though she may occasionally hide the <lb/>
            sun, the occultation has no time to last, and no extensive­ <lb/>
            ness, but some light shows itself round his circumference <lb/>
            that does not allow the darkness to become deep and un­ <lb/>
            mixed. Aristotle (the ancient one, I mean 1) gives as one <lb/>
            cause, besides some others, of the moon's being seen eclipsed <lb/>
            more frequently than the sun, ‘ that the sun is eclipsed by <lb/>
            the obstruction of the moon, whereas the moon is ....1 <lb/>
            But Posidonius thus describes the phenomenon: ‘The <lb/>
            eclipse is the conjunction of the sun and the shadow of <lb/>
            the moon, of which the eclipse .... for to those people <lb/>
            alone is the eclipse visible from whom the moon's shadow <lb/>
            shall occupy and block out the sight of the sun.' And <lb/>
            when he agrees that the shadow of the moon is projected <lb/>
            as far as us, I do not know what more he has left himself <lb/>
            to say, for of a star there can be no shadow, because that <lb/>
            thing which is unillumined is designated shadow—now light <lb/>
            does naturally not produce shadow, but destroy it." <note type="footnote"> I Not the gentleman present. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>

          <p>XX. " But after this, OF said he,' " what further evidence <lb/>
            was adduced ? " " The moon," I replied," received the same <lb/>
            explanation as to her eclipse." " You have done well to re­ <lb/>
            mind me," said he, " but beforehand, on the supposition <lb/>
            that you are all convinced and hold that the moon is <lb/>
            eclipsed because she is overtaken by the shadow, I now <lb/>
            direct myself to the reason-or would you prefer that I <lb/>
            should make a lecture and a display of eloquence before­ <lb/>
            hand, by enumerating the various attempts at the explana­ <lb/>
            tion, one after the other ? " " Yes, truly, Theon," I replied, <lb/>
            " lecture on these points; for I too require some persuasion, <lb/>
            having only heard the question stated in this way-that <lb/>
            the three bodies being come upon one straight line, namely, <lb/>
            the earth, the sun, and the moon, the eclipses then happen, <lb/>
            because the earth takes away the sun from the moon; on <lb/>
            the contrary, the moon takes away the sun from the earth, <lb/>
            for the sun is eclipsed when the moon, and the moon when <lb/>
            the earth stands in the middle of the three; of which cases <lb/>
            the one happens in the conjunction,2 the other in the time <lb/>
            of full-moon.” 3 Then Lucius remarked: " These are <lb/>
            about the most important of the theories current; but <lb/>
            first of all, take in hand, if you please, the explanation de­ <lb/>
            rived from the figure of the shadow ; for it is a cone, as <lb/>
            though a great fire or light projected a mass, less indeed <lb/>
            than a sphere, but still spherical in form, for which reason <lb/>
            in eclipses of the moon the outlines of the darkened parts <lb/>
            against the bright ones have their edges circular; for <lb/>
            whatever sections a round thing coming in contact with <lb/>
            another round thing, may either receive or produce, as they <lb/>
            go off in all directions, they are made circular by reason of <lb/>
            their resemblance [to what produced them]. In the second <lb/>
            place, I fancy you know that the moon is first eclipsed on <note type="footnote"> 1 The person to whom Plutarch is relating the discussion. </note><note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνοδος</foreign> for moon's conjunction with sun = dark quarter. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διχόμηνος</foreign> when the moon is in opposition to the sun = full-moon. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            the parts towards the east; whereas the sun is on those <lb/>
            towards the west, because the earth's shadow moves to­ <lb/>
            wards the west from the east. The sun and the moon, on <lb/>
            the contrary, move towards the east. All this, visible facts <lb/>
            enable us to discover, and may be understood without very <lb/>
            lengthy explanations, and from them the shadow as the <lb/>
            cause of the eclipse is established. For when the sun is <lb/>
            eclipsed by being overtaken by, and the moon by meeting that <lb/>
            which causes the eclipse, probably, or rather, necessarily, <lb/>
            the sun' is first overtaken from behind, the moon from the <lb/>
            front, for the occultation begins from that side where the <lb/>
            object in front first casts the shadow, and the moon first <lb/>
            casts it upon the sun from the west, as she is racing <lb/>
            against him, but upon her he casts it from the east, be­ <lb/>
            cause she is moving below in a contrary direction, from the <lb/>
            east. Thirdly, then, consider the question of the duration, <lb/>
            and of the extent of her eclipses. When she is eclipsed <lb/>
            high in heaven and at her apogee she is obscured for only <lb/>
            a short time, but being in her perigee and low when thus <lb/>
            affected, she is greatly oppressed, and emerges with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty from the shadow. And yet, when she is low, she is <lb/>
            making the greatest movements, but when high the smallest <lb/>
            of all. But the cause of the difference lies in the shadow, <lb/>
            for it is broadest at the base, as all cones are, and contract­ <lb/>
            ing gradually, at the top it ends in a sharp and fine point. <lb/>
            Consequently, the moon entering into this shadow when <lb/>
            she is low down, is caught by it in its largest circumference <lb/>
            and passes through its deepest and darkest part, but when <lb/>
            up high, just grazing the shadow, as though in shallow <lb/>
            water, she quickly makes her escape. I shall pass over all <lb/>
            that has been said with special reference to bases 2 and <lb/>
            transits; because they admit the cause so far as possibility <note type="footnote"> 1 rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν</foreign> in text for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ</foreign> piv, which is necessitated by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή δἑ</foreign> following. </note><note type="footnote"> a Doubtless “phases”—<foreign xml:lang="grc">β</foreign> being written for <foreign xml:lang="grc">φ</foreign> in the text, in con­ <lb/>

             <pb n="228"/>
            goes. But I return to the argument before me, that has <lb/>
            ocular demonstration for its starting point. For we see <lb/>
            that fire out of a shady place shows itself and shines <lb/>
            abroad all the more; whether through the density of the <lb/>
            obscured air not allowing of divergences and dispersions, <lb/>
            but keeping together and compressing the element in one <lb/>
            place; or else this is an affection of the sense [vision], just <lb/>
            as hot things compared with cold seem hotter, and plea­ <lb/>
            sures compared with pains seem more intense, even so <lb/>
            bright things contrasted with dark become conspicuous, <lb/>
            because they exaggerate their appearance through the op­ <lb/>
            posite affections of the sense: the former supposition of the <lb/>
            two is likely to be the more probable, for in the sunshine <lb/>
            every sort of fire doth not only lose its brightness, but through <lb/>
            yielding thereto becomes inoperative and duller; because <lb/>
            the heat disperses and diffuses its proper force. If then <lb/>
            the moon possesses an infantine and ineffective fire, being <lb/>
            ‘a feminine star,' as these philosophers pretend, it befits <lb/>
            her to be affected in none of the ways in which she is <lb/>
            affected at present, but altogether the contrary of them <lb/>
            all; she ought to appear where now she is hidden, and be <lb/>
            hidden exactly where she now appears: that is to say, be <lb/>
            hidden for the rest of the time as being obscured by the cir­ <lb/>
            cumambient tether, but emerge and become visible every <lb/>
            six months, and again every five, when she enters into the <lb/>
            shadow of the earth. For the 365 revolutions of the <lb/>
            ecliptic full moons contain 404 periods of six months, and <lb/>
            the rest of five months each. It would therefore be neces­ <lb/>
            sary that the moon should be visible at intervals of so <lb/>
            many months, because she became conspicuous in the <lb/>
            shadow; 1 but she .... becomes eclipsed and loses her <lb/>
            light, but recovers it again, when she emerges from the <note type="footnote"> 1 If the moon were of the nature of a star, self-lighted, she would be <lb/>
            conspicuous when passing through earth's shadow; whereas she now <lb/>

            shadow, and often shows herself by day, as being anything <lb/>
            rather than a fiery or star-like substance."</p>
          <p>XXI. Lucius having said this, Pharnaces and Apollonides <lb/>
            in a way came into collision with each other [in their eager­ <lb/>
            ness to answer him], but when Apollonides gave up the turn, <lb/>
            Pharnaces continued, " This fact does most of all prove the <lb/>
            moon to be a fire or a star, for she is not entirely invisible <lb/>
            during eclipses, but displays the hot-coal 1 and grim colour <lb/>
            which is her own proper hue." But Apollonides stood firm <lb/>
            with respect to the shadow, "for [he said] the mathema­ <lb/>
            ticians always so denominated the unillumined place, and <lb/>
            that the heavens did not admit of ' shadow.’ " " This [said <lb/>
            I] is rather the disputing captiously with a name than deal­ <lb/>
            ing philosophically and mathematically with the fact, for <lb/>
            the place obstructed by the earth, if one chooses not to call <lb/>
            it ‘ shadow,' but ‘ unillumined region,' it is all the same <lb/>
            unavoidable that the moon, on coming into it .... and <lb/>
            altogether,” added I, " it is silly to say the shadow of the <lb/>
            earth does not reach so far .... the shadow of the moon <lb/>
            impinging upon the sight, and .... towards the earth, <lb/>
            causes an eclipse of the sun. I will now turn to you, Phar­ <lb/>
            naces, for that coal-like and glowing 2 colour, which you <lb/>
            pretend is the natural complexion of the moon, is really <lb/>
            that of a body that possesses density and depth; for in. <lb/>
            things unsubstantial no remnant or vestige of flame is <lb/>
            accustomed to remain; nor is there any food for fire ex­ <lb/>
            cept in a solid body that will receive and nourish the spark <lb/>
            kindling it; as Homer also hath sung, <lb/>
            “‘ When the fire-flower was spent and quenched the blaze, <lb/>
            Spreading the ashes wide.' <lb/>
            For the ‘ charcoal' is probably not fire, but an ignited sub­ <lb/>
            stance, and affected by fire dwelling upon, and wearing <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁνθρακώδης</foreign>, "smouldering," like that of a hot piece of charcoal, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁνϑραξ</foreign> being always taken in an active sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διακαὴς</foreign>, not smouldering, but, like charcoal, fully alight. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            itself out upon a mass which is both solid and possessed <lb/>
            of durability; whereas the flames are but the lighting up <lb/>
            and jets of an unsubstantial nutriment and material, <lb/>
            speedily consumed by reason of its weakness. Conse­ <lb/>
            quently, nothing could have been so convincing a proof <lb/>
            that the moon is an earthy and dense substance, than if <lb/>
            ' smouldering coal' were proper to her as her colour. But <lb/>
            is it not the case, my dear Pharnaces, that moons in eclipse <lb/>
            assume various colours; and mathematicians (astrologers) <lb/>
            define these colours, and distinguish them according to the <lb/>
            time and the season ? For instance, if the moon be eclipsed <lb/>
            in the evening, she appears dreadfully black up to the third 1 <lb/>
            and one-half hour, but if at midnight she emits this [just <lb/>
            mentioned] purplish light, and fire, and flame-colour, whilst <lb/>
            from the hour of morning2 and half an hour later, the blush <lb/>
            rises on her face; and finally at daybreak she puts on a dark <lb/>
            blue and cheerful complexion, from which in reality the <lb/>
            poets and Empedocles style her the ‘Blue-eyed.'3 When, <lb/>
            therefore, we see the moon putting on so many different <lb/>
            colours when in the shadow, they do not deal fairly in <lb/>
            dwelling upon a single one of them, namely, the smoulder­ <lb/>
            ing coal, which we really may say is the most uncongenial <lb/>
            to her of them all; and is rather a mixture and remnant <lb/>
            of the fire shining through the shadow round about her; <lb/>
            but her natural colour [we define] to be dark-blue and <lb/>
            earthy. For whereas here below shady places in the vicinity <lb/>
            of lakes and rivers that catch the sun are similarly dyed <lb/>
            and made brilliant in robes of purple, yea, even of scarlet 4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Counting from sunset, as the Romans still do. </note><note type="footnote"> a At what time “morning," as distinct from " day-break," commenced, <lb/>

             <lb/>
            and give forth many various images of colour, through the <lb/>
            reflections of the light, what wonder is it if the vast flood <lb/>
            of shadow, falling as it were into a celestial ocean of light, <lb/>
            not steady nor at rest, but agitated by stars infinite in <lb/>
            number, and receiving mixtures and changes of all kinds, <lb/>
            should extract different colours at different times, and give <lb/>
            them out from the moon ? A star, or a fire, would not in <lb/>
            the shadow show itself black, or glaucous, or dark blue ; <lb/>
            but over mountains, or plains, or sea, many variations of <lb/>
            colour from the sun go and come ; and he casts the lustre <lb/>
            of the dye,1 tempered with shadows and with mists, as <lb/>
            with the hues of the painter's palette ; whereof that of the <lb/>
            sea, widely diffused, Homer hath given a name to, calling <lb/>
            it ‘violet-coloured,’ 2 and wine-faced ocean,' and else­ <lb/>
            where the ‘purple wave ;' and, again, ‘ blue-green sea,' <lb/>
            and the ‘ white calm ;' whereas the variations about earth <lb/>
            of colours showing themselves differently at different times <lb/>
            he has passed over in silence as being endless in quantity. <lb/>
            The moon is not likely to possess only a single visible ap­ <lb/>
            pearance like the sea; but much more so to resemble the <lb/>
            earth in her nature, concerning which Socrates of old told <lb/>
            a fable, whether that he was hinting at this, or describing, <lb/>
            it may be, some other creation.3 For it is neither in­ <lb/>
            credible nor astonishing if she, having nothing in herself <lb/>
            that is corrupting or turbid, but extracting the pure light <lb/>

            eminences.1 And if the sight (vision) of these things <lb/>
            penetrates through the shadow differently at different <lb/>
            times, as far as us, by reason of some difference and varia­ <lb/>
            tion of the surrounding medium (atmosphere), the moon <lb/>
            doth not thereby lose the preciousness nor the holiness of <lb/>
            her glory, which .... being held sacred by mankind, she <lb/>
            is something more than ‘a turbid and dreggy fire,' as the <lb/>
            Stoics pretend. Fire, however, with the Medes and Assy­ <lb/>
            rians enjoys honours well suited to barbarians, who worship <lb/>
            things hurtful before things worthy of reverence, by way <lb/>
            of deprecating their anger; but the name of Earth is, I <lb/>
            ween, dear to all, and to the Greek even venerable, and <lb/>
            with us2 it is the hereditary rule to worship her in the same <lb/>
            way as any other deity. We men are far from thinking <lb/>
            the moon, which is a celestial earth, to be a body without <lb/>
            life, and without mind, and destitute of those things which <lb/>
            the gods have a right to enjoy, when we, by law, pay the <lb/>
            requital for her blessings, and naturally respect that which <lb/>
            is superior in virtue and in power, and therefore to be re­ <lb/>
            spected. Wherefore let us believe that we do not offend <lb/>
            in supposing her an earth ; and as for this her face visible <lb/>
            to us, just as our own earth contains deep recesses [let us <lb/>
            believe that] in the same way she too is opened out into <lb/>
            vast gulfs, containing either water or darkened air, into <lb/>
            which the sun's light doth not descend, or even touch, but <lb/>
            falls short of them entirely, and produces a reflection that <lb/>
            is dispersed and lost in those places."</p>
          <p>XXII. Then Apollonides, scornfully interrupting, ex­ <lb/>
            claimed: " What, then, in the Moon's own name, does it <note type="footnote"> 1 Quoting Socrates' description of the True World. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Citizens of Delphi; where the Oracle at first belonged to " Mother <lb/>

            seem to you possible that this appearance is nothing but <lb/>
            shadows of streams or of deep ravines, and comes all the <lb/>
            way from the moon to us here to our sight ? Perhaps you <lb/>
            do not consider the consequences, must I tell them ? Listen, <lb/>
            then, even though you be not ignorant of them already. <lb/>
            The diameter of the moon measures twelve fingers' breadth,l <lb/>
            as it appears to the eye, at her mean distances; whilst of <lb/>
            the black and shaded parts each one appears larger than a <lb/>
            half digit, so as to be larger than the twenty-fourth part <lb/>
            of the diameter; and, again, if we should estimate the cir­ <lb/>
            cumference of the moon at thirty thousand stadia only, <lb/>
            and the diameter at ten thousand, according to the rule, <lb/>
            then each one of the shaded parts in her, will not be less <lb/>
            than five hundred stadia.3 Consider, pray, in the first <lb/>
            place, whether it be possible that such cavities and such <lb/>
            great inequalities of surface should exist in the moon as to <lb/>
            produce an obscuration of this extent. In the next place, <lb/>
            being so large, why are they not perceptible 4 to us ? " And <lb/>
            I, smiling at him, replied," Well done, Apollonides, to have <lb/>
            invented such a demonstration, on the strength of which <lb/>
            you will make out both yourself and me to be bigger than <lb/>
            those Aloads5 of old ; not, however, at all times of day, but <lb/>
            chiefly at sunrise and sunset; you think that because the <lb/>
            sun makes our shadows enormous, the fact furnishes this <lb/>
            fine argument to the sense, that if the shadow cast be big <lb/>
            the thing casting the shadow must be exceeding great. In <lb/>
            Lemnos neither of us, I well know, has ever been; both of <lb/>
            us, however, have often heard that popular iambic line­ <lb/>
            “‘Athos has hid the flank of Lemnian Cow.' <note type="footnote"> 1Nine inches English. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 3,750 miles English. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Fifty-two miles. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Perceptible as actual cavities in the moon's surface, not as more <lb/>

            For the shadow of the mountain, as it seems, strikes upon <lb/>
            a little cow of bronze, extending a length of no less than <lb/>
            seven hundred1 stadia across the sea sea.... 2 to be the height <lb/>
            that casts the shadow ; for the reason that the divergences <lb/>
            of the light make the shadows many times greater than the <lb/>
            bodies themselves. Come, pray, and consider that the sun <lb/>
            is at his greatest distance from the moon at what time she <lb/>
            is full, and produces the most distinct figure of the face by <lb/>
            reason of the deepness of the shading; for it is the reced­ <lb/>
            ing of the illumining light that makes the shade deep, not <lb/>
            the greatness of the inequalities on the surface of the moon. <lb/>
            And, again, neither do the rays of the sun allow the pro­ <lb/>
            jecting parts of mountains to be discerned by day, whereas <lb/>
            their deep places, valleys, and shaded parts are visible from <lb/>
            a great distance ; it therefore is nothing strange if it is not <lb/>
            possible to discern distinctly the reception (of solar light) <lb/>
            and the illumination of the moon, whilst the strong con­ <lb/>
            trasts of the shaded against the bright parts do not escape <lb/>
            our sight and observation.</p>
          <p>XXIII. " But the fact," continued. I, " which seems <lb/>
            still more to upset the alleged reflection of light from the <lb/>
            moon, is that when people are standing in reflected lights, <lb/>
            it comes to pass they see not only the thing illuminated <lb/>
            but the thing that illuminates. For when a bright light <lb/>
            cast from water is dancing up and down against a wall, <lb/>
            the sight of it takes place in the point that is illuminated <lb/>
            in consequence of the reflection; it (the sight) distinguishes <lb/>
            three different things, namely, the reflected light, the <lb/>
            water producing the reflection, and the Sun himself from <lb/>
            whom the ray, falling upon the water, has been reflected. <lb/>
            These points being confessed and evident, (the Stoics) re­ <lb/>
            commend such as assert the earth to be illuminated by <note type="footnote"> 1 Eighty-five miles across the sea. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 [You do not imagine this is the actual height of the mountain ] </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            the moon,1 to demonstrate that the Sun shows himself (is <lb/>
            reflected) in the moon in the same manner2 by night, <lb/>
            when the reflection from him is produced. But as he does <lb/>
            not appear then, they believe that the illumination takes <lb/>
            place in some other way than by reflection: but if this be <lb/>
            not so, then neither is the moon an earth." " What answer, <lb/>
            then, must be made to them? " replied Apollonides, “for the <lb/>
            phenomena of reflection are in all probability universal, <lb/>
            and like our own." " Certainly," said I, " in one way they <lb/>
            ere universal, but in another way they are not universal. <lb/>
            In the first place, observe how these people take the phe. <lb/>
            nomena of the spectrum, upside down and inside out: for <lb/>
            upon earth and below it is the water, but above earth, and <lb/>
            on high, it is the moon. 3 Consequently the reflected rays <lb/>
            make the form of the angle corresponding-the one having <lb/>
            its apex' above upon the moon, the other having it below <lb/>
            upon the earth. Let them, therefore, not demand that it <lb/>
            shall produce every image proper to mirrors, or an equal <lb/>
            reflection from every distance-for in so doing they are <lb/>
            fighting against demonstration. But those who make out <lb/>
            the moon to be a body, neither polished nor fluid like <lb/>
            water, but ponderous and earthy, I understand how they <lb/>
            borrow from the sun what the appearance is in her that <lb/>
            meets the sight: for neither does milk produce the same <lb/>
            kind of mirrors, 5 nor render back reflections (as the water), <lb/>
            owing to the inequality and density of its particles: by <lb/>
            what means, therefore, is it possible that the moon should <lb/>
            send out from herself an image in the same way as the <lb/>
            more brilliant surfaces of mirrors? And yet, even in <lb/>
            these, if a cobweb, or rust, 6 or roughness should cover the <note type="footnote"> 1 With her reflected light. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 As in the experiment just cited. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 That throws back the solar ray. </note> <note type="footnote"> 4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορυφή</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> * “Reflecting medium," as water does: referring to what was said <lb/>

            focus from which the image is generated it is [not] 1 re­ <lb/>
            flected and imaged; and the mirrors themselves are seen, <lb/>
            but give back no reflection. And whoso pretends that <lb/>
            either our sight should reflect upon the sun, or else that <lb/>
            the moon should not reflect the sun from herself upon us, <lb/>
            is ridiculous 2 by his requiring the eye to be a sun, the sight <lb/>
            the solar beam, and the moon the heavens. For that the <lb/>
            Sun's reflection, impinging with a blow upon the moon by <lb/>
            reason of its intensity and brightness, should be carried <lb/>
            as far as us, is reasonable enough; whereas the sight being <lb/>
            feeble, unsubstantial, and ever so small a fraction [of the <lb/>
            solar light], what wonder is it if it neither produces an <lb/>
            impressive stroke, nor in rebounding preserves its con. <lb/>
            tinuity, but is broken up and comes to an end; not pos­ <lb/>
            sessing a large stock of light, so as not to be dissipated <lb/>
            around the inequalities and roughnesses of the (moon's) <lb/>
            surface ? From mirrors, indeed, and other reflecting sur­ <lb/>
            faces, it is not impossible for the proceeding reflection to <lb/>
            strike upon the eye, as it is near to its origin; but from <lb/>
            the moon, even though there should be some slippery <lb/>
            glances of herself, they will be feeble and indistinct, and <lb/>
            come prematurely to an end by reason of the length of the <lb/>
            distance they have to travel. And, besides, concave mir. <lb/>
            rors make the reflected light more intense than that sur­ <lb/>
            rounding them, so as frequently to emit a flame; whilst <lb/>
            the convex and spherical kinds, by reason of the light <lb/>
            striking on them from all sides, produce a feeble and in­ <lb/>
            distinctFor you observer indeed, when two rain­ <lb/>
            bows appear, from a cloud enveloping another cloud, that <lb/>
            the one enclosing the other shows its hues weak and con­ <lb/>
            fused : because the exterior cloud, lying further off from <note type="footnote"> 1 The negative here is certainly demanded by the sense of the whole <lb/>

             <pb n="237"/>
            the sight, produces a reflection neither intense nor power­ <lb/>
            ful. And what need is there to say more, when the sun's <lb/>
            light reflected from the moon doth lose all its heat, and of <lb/>
            its brightness there comes to us merely an unsubstantial <lb/>
            and ineffectual remnant ? Surely, when the sight travels <lb/>
            along the same course, is it conceivable that a single <lb/>
            particle of a remnant shall reach the sun from the moon ? <lb/>
            I do not think it. Consider, too," added I, " that if the <lb/>
            sight is similarly affected in the case of water and of the <lb/>
            moon, the full moon would be obliged to render back the <lb/>
            images of earth, plants, men, and stars, in the same way <lb/>
            as the other reflecting surfaces return them. But if re­ <lb/>
            flections (repercussion) of the view do not take place <lb/>
            against the latter object, through its own weakness, or <lb/>
            through the unevenness of the moon's surface, we must <lb/>
            not demand that they shall be produced upon the sun."</p>
          <p>XXIV. “We therefore," I continued, " have now re­ <lb/>
            lated to you all the different theories that have not slipped <lb/>
            our memory. But it is now high time to call upon Sylla, <lb/>
            nay, rather to exact from him his story, as having been <lb/>
            our hearer upon certain conditions. Wherefore, if you <lb/>
            please, let us end our walk, and, sitting down upon the <lb/>
            steps, 1 furnish him with a stationary audience." This was <lb/>
            agreed to; and when we had sat down: " I," said Theon, <lb/>
            “desire as much as any one of you to hear what is about <lb/>
            to be said, Lamprias ; 2 but previously I would be glad to <lb/>
            hear about those said to live in the moon-not who they <lb/>
            are that dwell there, but whether it is possible to inhabit <lb/>
            there: for if that is not possible, it is absurd to say the <lb/>
            moon is an earth, for she will appear to have been made <lb/>
            for no purpose, but all in vain, if she neither bears crops, <lb/>
            nor furnishes men of some sort with habitation, birth, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The grand flight of steps leading up to the Temple of Apollo, in <lb/>

            living: for the which ends we say this earth was made, <lb/>
            according to Plato, ‘ for our nurse, and unwearied keeper <lb/>
            both by day and night, and our artificer.' For you see <lb/>
            that many tales are told, both in jest and earnest, about <lb/>
            these matters. For to those dwelling under the moon, as <lb/>
            they say, she is suspended overhead, as though they were <lb/>
            so many Tantali; those, again, living upon her surface, <lb/>
            fast bound like so many Ixions, with such incredible <lb/>
            velocity of revolution .... and yet she does not move <lb/>
            with a single motion; but, as is said somewhere, she is a <lb/>
            ‘ traveller on three roads,' at one and the same time <lb/>
            carried onwards lengthways towards the Zodiac, and <lb/>
            broadways, 1 and deepways. Of which motions, the first <lb/>
            the mathematicians call the ‘ circuit,' the second the <lb/>
            'spiral,' and the third, I know not why, the inequality: ' <lb/>
            although they have observed nothing equal or regular in <lb/>
            her recessions. Consequently, if a lion2 once fell down <lb/>
            into the Peloponnesus from her rapid gyration, it is [not] <lb/>
            surprising-it is, on the contrary, a wonder we do not <lb/>
            continually see showers of men, and heaps of cattle, 3 <lb/>
            diving down from thence, and turning round and round in <lb/>
            the air. For it is ridiculous to argue about a residence <lb/>
            there, if she is not capable of containing generation or <lb/>
            stability. For whilst the Egyptians and Troglodytes, <lb/>
            over whose heads the sun stands vertically for a single day <lb/>
            at the solstice, and then departing, hardly escape being <lb/>
            burnt up through the dryness of the atmosphere, pray is <lb/>
            it likely people in the moon can stand twelve summer days <lb/>
            in each year, when month by month the sun stands <lb/>
            plumb-line over them, and remains stationary, when it is <lb/>

            nectar and ambrosia over Achilles, when he refused all <lb/>
            food, so the moon that is both named and is Minerva, <lb/>
            feeds her inhabitants, by issuing out unto them daily am­ <lb/>
            brosia, in the same way as Pherecydes of old supposes the <lb/>
            gods are fed. As for the Indian root, which Megasthenes <lb/>
            says they neither eat nor drink, but, as they are without <lb/>
            mouths, they burn and use like incense, and are nourished <lb/>
            by the fume 1—how is it to be found growing there if the <lb/>

            I replied; "by the sportiveness of your discourse [you have <lb/>
            relieved] the seriousness of the subject: which inspires us <lb/>

            and probable. In the first place, then, it does not neces­ <lb/>
            sarily follow that because the moon is not inhabited by <lb/>
            men, she was made for no purpose, and in vain. For <lb/>
            neither do we see this earth of ours universally utilized <lb/>
            and inhabited, but only a small portion thereof, like so <lb/>
            many capes or peninsulas jutting out into the vasty deep, <note type="footnote"> 1 This looks like some tradition of the use of tobacco, brought by <lb/>

            lies partly desert and barren by reason of winters or of <lb/>
            drought, whilst the greater portion of her surface is sub­ <lb/>
            merged under the spreading ocean. But you who love and <lb/>
            admire Aristarchus do not attend to Crates when he <lb/>
            acknowledges, <lb/>
            It 4 Ocean, to all, the origin ordained <lb/>
            Both men and gods, spreads over most of earth! <lb/>
            But these things are far from being created to no purpose, <lb/>
            for the sea sends up mild exhalations, and the most re­ <lb/>
            freshing airs in the height of summer; whilst from the <lb/>
            uninhabited and frozen quarter, the snows quietly melting <lb/>

            night, an unwearied guardian in the midst, " according to <lb/>
            Plato," and creator. There is no objection then to the <lb/>
            moon's being really devoid of all living things, but affording <lb/>
            reflection to the light diffused around her, and a rallying­ <lb/>
            point for the rays of the stars, and meeting-place within <lb/>
            herself, in which she digests the exhalations rising up from <lb/>
            earth, and in concert with the sun extracts the over fiery <lb/>
            and harsh part of the same, and discharges it. And if we <lb/>
            concede so much to ancient tradition, that she is named <lb/>
            ' Artemis,‘ 1 we shall say, as before, that she is unfruitful <lb/>
            (like that virgin goddess), yet in other respects full of help <lb/>
            and beneficial. For her revolution being accomplished with <lb/>
            great evenness and tranquillity, smooths down and distends <lb/>
            the atmosphere that moves against (encounters) her, so that <lb/>
            there is no danger of those dwelling upon her falling off, <lb/>
            or slipping down. For this [revolution] and the varied <lb/>
            and erratic nature of her motion is not a sign of irregu­ <lb/>
            larity and confusion, but, as astronomers make out, of a <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠφελε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ φίλε</foreign>, which makes the passage intelligible : <lb/>

            wonderful order in these phenomena, and of a course in cycles <lb/>
            revolving around other cycles, in which they confine her; <lb/>
            some of them making her immovable, others travelling for­ <lb/>
            wards with the same velocity [as the cycles] in the oppo­ <lb/>
            site direction. For these progressions of the cycles, their <lb/>
            revolutions and their relations towards each other and to <lb/>
            us, bring about in the most regular manner all the pheno­ <lb/>
            mena of the lunar motion, such as her elevations and de­ <lb/>
            pressions, her deviations in the direction of her breadth, <lb/>
            and revolutions in that of her length. As for the intense <lb/>
            heat and perpetual roasting [of her inhabitants] by the <lb/>
            sun, you need not be too much afraid of all that, if you <lb/>
            oppose to the eleven summer conjunctions all the full <lb/>
            moons; and secondly, the continuity of the change, as a <lb/>
            set off against the excessive heats, that indeed do not last <lb/>
            for a long time, which circumstance produces a peculiar <lb/>
            temperature, and softens down either extreme, and the <lb/>
            mean between them, in all likelihood, produces a tempera­ <lb/>
            ture resembling that of spring. In the next place, the <lb/>
            [sun] sends down on us his heat through turbid air, 1 and <lb/>
            with much effort, which heat is nourished by the exhalations <lb/>
            [of earth] ; but there above, the air is rarefied and trans­ <lb/>
            parent, and disperses and diffuses the sun's rays, that have <lb/>
            no excessive heat or substance. Wood and corn the rains <lb/>
            themselves nourish, but in a different way: as up the <lb/>
            country about Thebes, with you and at Syene, it is not the <lb/>
            rain water [that nourishes], but the earth herself that <lb/>
            drinks the earth-born water and employs the wind and <lb/>
            dews, yet will not, I fancy, submit to a comparison, 2 in <lb/>
            point of fertility, with the best rain-watered soil, by reason <lb/>
            of its goodness and natural constitution. Plants the same <lb/>

            Gedrosea and the Troglodyte country, which reaches down <lb/>
            to the ocean, is barren through want of rain, and entirely <lb/>
            destitute of water, yet in the seas lying adjacent, and spread­ <lb/>

            spring up from the bottom; some of which they call olive <lb/>

            not even bear the dews, like most of the Arabian plants, <lb/>
            which fade away when moistened and are destroyed-what <lb/>
            wonder is it if there should grow in the moon roots, seeds, <lb/>
            and woods that require neither rain nor winter, but are <lb/>
            naturally adapted for a summer-like and rarefied atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere ? Why is it improbable that the moon herself emits <lb/>
            genial airs, and that currents (of air) are produced by the <lb/>
            very rapidity of her gyration, that quietly supply dews and <lb/>

            dryness comes down to us from her, but on the contrary <lb/>
            many proofs of moisture and a feminine nature; the growth <lb/>
            of plants, the putrefaction of meat, the conversion [fer­ <lb/>
            mentation] and settling of wine, the softening of timber, <lb/>
            the easy delivery of women. 1 I am afraid of again pro­ <lb/>
            voking and stirring up Phamaces, now that he is quiet, by <lb/>
            talking of the tides of the ocean (as his own sect pretend), <lb/>
            and the flooding of straits that are overspread and swollen <lb/>
            by the action of the moon, through the renewal of their <lb/>
            fluidity. 2 Consequently, I will rather turn myself to you, <lb/>
            my dear Theon; for you say, quoting to us those lines of <lb/>
            Alcman's: <lb/>
            “‘Daughter of Jove, nourishing Dew I and <lb/>
            Nurse of the sacred moon.' <lb/>
            Because here he calls the air Jupiter, and says that he, <lb/>
            being moistened by the moon, dissolves8 into the dew. She <lb/>
            appears, my friend, to possess a nature the opposite to the <lb/>
            sun's, that is, if not only whatever he is naturally disposed <lb/>
            to condense and to dry up, she by her nature softens and <lb/>
            dissolves, but also she moistens and cools down the heat <lb/>
            proceeding from him, when it impinges upon and is mingled <lb/>
            with herself. 4 Those who think the moon to be a fiery <note type="footnote"> 1 This curious effect of moonlight, whether actually observed, or only <lb/>

            differences and disparities of the living things between <lb/>

            which Ammonius told us about, and Hesiod has hinted <lb/>

            "' Or how much enjoyment lies in the mallow and asphodel.' <lb/>
            But Euripides really hath made it plain, by teaching that <lb/>
            Nature with quite a small spark warms up and keeps to­ <lb/>

            And that those living upon the moon must be slender in <lb/>
            person, and are content to be fed upon what comes to <lb/>
            hand, is probable enough ; for that the moon herself is, like <lb/>
            the sun (which is a fiery living thing and many times bigger <lb/>
            than the earth), said to be nourished by the moist vapours <lb/>
            rising from the earth, as are also the other stars innumer­ <lb/>

            template it, and learning by inquiry that the water is bitter, <lb/>
            undrinkable, and briny, someone should tell us that living <lb/>
            creatures, numberless, huge, and varied in shape, are nou­ <lb/>
            rished in its depths, and that it swarms with wild creatures <lb/>
            that use the water just as we do the air, you would think <lb/>
            he was imposing upon you with fiction and prodigies. We <lb/>
            appear to be similarly situated and to experience the same <lb/>
            thing with respect to the moon in disbelieving that men of <lb/>
            some sort inhabit her. They on their part part will, I <lb/>

            them a lightless, low, immovable spot, they must wonder <lb/>
            whether it breeds and maintains living creatures endowed <lb/>
            with motion, breath, and warmth. And if perchance they <lb/>
            may have heard Homer's lines, <lb/>

            no objection, who begins after Homer's fashion with, <lb/>
            “‘ An isle Ogygian lies far out at sea,' <lb/>
            distant five days' sail from Britain, 1 going westwards, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ireland, probably, which lies at this distance from Rutupiae, the </note> <lb/>

            of which the barbarians fable that Saturn is imprisoned <lb/>
            by 1 Jupiter, whilst his son lies by his side, as though keep­ <lb/>
            ing guard over those islands and the sea, which they call <lb/>
            ‘the Sea of Saturn.’ 2 The great continent by which the <lb/>
            great sea is surrounded on all sides, they say, lies less dis­ <lb/>
            tant from the others, but about five thousand stadia from <lb/>
            Ogygia,3 for one sailing in a rowing-galley; for the sea is <lb/>
            difficult of passage and muddy through the great number <lb/>
            of currents, and these currents issue out of the great land, <lb/>
            and shoals are formed by them, and the sea becomes clogged <lb/>
            and full of earth, by which it has the appearance of being <lb/>
            solid! That sea-coast of the mainland Greeks are settled <lb/>

            of which lies almost in a straight line opposite the entrance <lb/>
            to the Caspian Sea. 5 Those Greeks call and consider them­ <lb/>

            the other in the moon, and of the things pertaining to the <lb/>

            we call maid (pupil) that part of the eye in which the <lb/>

            not ask questions about it," replied he, " for I am going to <lb/>
            relate it all. Man most people rightly think a composite <lb/>
            being, but wrongly think a composite of two parts only, <lb/>
            for they reckon the mind as only a part of the soul, being <lb/>
            no less in error than they who think the soul to be only <lb/>
            part of the body ; for the mind is as much better and more <lb/>
            divine than the soul, as the soul is superior to the body. <lb/>
            For the conjunction of body and soul produces1 .... <lb/>
            Reason, whereof the one is the origin of pleasure and pain, <lb/>
            the other, of vice and virtue. Of these three combined <lb/>
            things, the earth furnished for the birth the body, the <lb/>
            moon the soul, the sun the mind, just as he supplies light <lb/>
            to the moon. The death which we die makes the man <lb/>
            two instead of three, the second (death) makes him one out <lb/>
            of two. The first takes place in the region of Demeter <lb/>
            [because the earth] and also the dead are subject to her, <lb/>
            whence the Athenians of old used to call the [dead] " De­ <lb/>
            metrians." The second [death] takes place in the moon, <lb/>
            the dominion of Persephone ; and of the former the con­ <lb/>
            sort is the Earthly Hermes, of the latter, the Heavenly. <lb/>
            The former separates the soul from the body, hastily and <lb/>
            with violence ; but Persephone gently and slowly loosens <lb/>
            the mind from the soul, and for this reason she has been <lb/>
            named the " Only-begotten," 2 because the best part of <lb/>
            the man becomes single when separated from the rest by <lb/>
            her means. Each of these changes happens, according to <lb/>
            nature, as follows : every soul, whether without mind, or <lb/>
            joined to mind, on departing from the body, is ordained <lb/>
            to wander in the region lying 3 between the moon and <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Sensation ” must be the word lost here ; as plainly appears from <lb/>

          <p>XXIX. " They contemplate, in the first place, the magni­ <lb/>
            tude and beauty of the moon; also her nature, which is not <lb/>
            simple and unmixed, but as it were a combination of star <lb/>
            and earth; for just as earth mixed with air and moisture <lb/>
            becomes soft, and the blood mingling itself with the flesh <lb/>
            produces sensibility, in like manner they say the moon <lb/>
            being mixed up 1 from her inmost depth, becomes both <lb/>
            animated and generative, and at the same time has the <lb/>
            symmetrical arrangement of its levity around the centre of <lb/>
            the mass for a counteracting force to its own gravity. For <lb/>
            it is in this way that our world, being composed out of <lb/>
            elements that by their own nature tend some upwards, <lb/>
            some downwards, is free from all motion in its place. <lb/>
            These facts Xenocrates appears to have discovered through <lb/>
            a certain admirable process of reasoning, having taken his <lb/>
            starting-point out of Plato. For it is Plato who proved <lb/>
            that also each one of the stars is composed of earth and <lb/>
            fire, by means of the ascertained analogy of the interven­ <lb/>
            ing substances; because nothing comes within the reach <lb/>
            of sense that has not some portion of earth and of fire <lb/>
            mingled with it. Now Xenocrates says the sun is com­ <lb/>
            posed of fire and the First Solid; but the moon of the <lb/>
            Second Solid and her own air; and the earth out of water, <lb/>
            fire, and the Third of the Solids; and, generally, that <lb/>
            neither the solid, taken by itself, nor the fluid, is capable <lb/>
            of a soul. Thus much, then, for the physical constitution a <lb/>
            of the moon. The breadth, and the magnitude of her is <lb/>
            not what the geometricians assert, but much larger; for <note type="footnote"> 1 Being a mixture of starry and earthy natures. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Druidical story is here taken up again. </note> <lb/>

            she measures the shadow of the earth only a few times1 <lb/>
            with her own magnitude, not in consequence of her small­ <lb/>
            ness, but because she puts out all her speed, that she may <lb/>
            pass through the darkened spot, and carry out with her <lb/>
            the souls of the good, that are eager for it and cry aloud <lb/>
            to her; because they hear no longer, whilst they are in <lb/>
            the shadow, the harmony of the heavens, and at the same <lb/>
            time, the souls of those suffering punishment rush up to­ <lb/>
            wards her from below through the shadow, wailing and <lb/>
            shouting (for which reason, during eclipses, most people <lb/>
            clatter their brass pots and clap their hands, and make a <lb/>
            noise to scare away the ghosts), for the so-called Face <lb/>
            frightens them when they come nigh, looking grim and <lb/>
            horrible. Such it is not really, but like 2 as our earth has <lb/>
            deep and great gulfs-one of them flowing inwards towards <lb/>
            us through the Pillars of Hercules; others flowing out­ <lb/>
            wards as the Caspian, and those in the Red Sea—in like <lb/>
            manner there are deep places and gulf-like in the moon, <lb/>
            whereof the largest is called ‘ Hecate's dungeon,' in which <lb/>
            the souls either suffer or inflict punishment, for the things <lb/>
            which they have either done or endured, when they have <lb/>
            already been made genii: as for the two smaller depths, <lb/>
            because the souls pass through them on the way towards <lb/>
            heaven and towards earth back again, the one is denomi­ <lb/>

            act, and shine as saviours in battle and at sea; 1 and what­ <lb/>
            soever thing in these capacities they do amiss, either out <lb/>
            of spite, unfair partiality, or envy, they are punished for <lb/>
            it, for they are driven down again to earth and coupled with <lb/>
            human bodies. Of the best of these genii they told him <lb/>
            were those who2 wait upon Saturn now, and the same in <lb/>
            old times were the Idæi Dactyli in Crete, the Curetes in <lb/>
            Phrygia, the Trophonii in Bceotia Lebadea, and others <lb/>
            without number in various parts of the world, of whom the <lb/>
            holy places, honours, and titles still remain; though of <lb/>
            some the powers have ceased since they have experienced <lb/>
            a removal of their virtue to another locality. This change <lb/>
            they suffer, some sooner, some later, when the mind has <lb/>
            been separated from the soul. The mind separates itself <lb/>
            out of a desire of reaching the Image in the sun,8 through <lb/>
            which shines forth the Desirable, and Beautiful, and Di­ <lb/>
            vine, and Blissful, to which every unmixed nature aspires <lb/>
            in different ways. For the moon herself, out of desire for <lb/>
            the sun, revolves round and comes in contact with him, <lb/>
            because she longs to derive from him the generative prin­ <lb/>
            ciple. The nature of the soul is left behind in the moon, <lb/>
            retaining vestiges as it were and dreams of life; and on <lb/>
            this account you must suppose it rightly said: <lb/>
            " ‘ Like to a dream, the soul took wing and fled.' <lb/>

            And Homer (said he) appears to have spoken especially <lb/>
            through divine inspiration about the whole question; <lb/>
            " ‘There midst the rest strong Hercules I marked, <lb/>
            His spectre-for himself dwells with the gods.' <lb/>
            For each individual of us is not anger, nor fear, nor de. <lb/>
            sire, just as he is neither pieces of flesh nor humours; but <lb/>
            that wherewith we think and understand is the soul, im. <lb/>
            pressed by the mind, and in its turn impressing the body, <lb/>
            and impinging upon it from all parts it models the <lb/>
            form;1 so that, though it may continue a long time sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from both (the mind and the body), yet as it retains <lb/>
            the likeness and imprint, it is properly denominated the <lb/>
            “Image ” (or Spectre).2 Of these images the moon is the <lb/>
            element: for they are resolved into her substance, like as <lb/>
            bodies into earth, of the dead. Quickly resolved are the <lb/>
            temperate, such as have led a tranquil, philosophic, and <lb/>
            leisurely life on earth; for being let go from the mind, <lb/>
            and no longer subject to the passions, they wither away. <lb/>
            Of those ambitious, busy, amorous, and irascible when in <lb/>
            the body, the souls are visited, like dreams, with recollec­ <lb/>
            tions of their past life, and are troubled with them; like <lb/>
            that of Endymion of old. For their restless and pas­ <lb/>
            sionate character stirs them up, and draws them away from <lb/>
            the moon towards a second birth ; she suffers them not, <lb/>
            however [to escape], but recalls them to herself, and <lb/>
            soothes them to remain. For it is far from quiet or <lb/>
            orderly work, when souls, separated from mind, get pos­ <lb/>
            session of a body subject to passions.3 Of such souls came <lb/>
            perchance the Tityi and the Typhons, and that Typhon 4 <note type="footnote"> 1 Moulds the soul into a shape of its own. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵδωλον</foreign>; the portrait of the intelligence which has flown away from <lb/>

            who used to hinder and trouble the oracular power at <lb/>
            Delphi: for they are destitute of reason, and actuated by <lb/>
            the passionate part, puffed up with pride and self-conceit. <lb/>
            But, in time, even these the moon absorbs into herself, <lb/>
            and reduces to order. In the next place, the sun having <lb/>
            impregnated1 the mind with vital force, produces new <lb/>
            souls. And, thirdly, earth furnishes a body: for earth <lb/>
            takes back after death that which she gave at birth; <lb/>
            whereas the sun takes nothing, only takes back the mind, <lb/>
            which he gave: but the moon both takes and gives, <lb/>
            and puts together, and separates; in virtue of two diffe­ <lb/>
            rent powers, of which the combining power is named <lb/>
            ‘Elithyia,' the separative one ‘Artemis.' And of the <lb/>
            Three Fates, Atropos, seated in the sun, supplies the <lb/>
            origin of birth; Clotho, moving about the moon, unites <lb/>
            together and mingles the various parts; lastly, Lachesis, <lb/>
            on earth, who has most to do with Fortune, puts her hand <lb/>
            to the work. For the inanimate part is powerless, and <lb/>
            liable to be acted upon by others ; but the mind is im­ <lb/>
            passive and independent; and the soul is of mixed nature, <lb/>
            and intermediate between the two : just as the moon hath <lb/>
            been made by the Deity a mixture of things above and of <lb/>
            things below, ' a great, full horn,' bearing the same rela­ <lb/>
            tion to the sun that the earth bears to the moon.</p>

            HE want of learning and the want of knowledge con. <lb/>
            cerning the gods, splitting into two separate streams <lb/>
            immediately at the source-the one, as if flowing in hard <lb/>
            ground, has in unyielding dispositions generated Atheism; <lb/>
            the other, as if in moist soil, produces in tender minds its <lb/>
            opposite, Superstition. Now all false belief, especially if <lb/>
            it be so on this subject, is a distressing thing; but that <lb/>
            which is accompanied with passion is most troublesome of <lb/>
            all: for every passion is like a stroke productive of in­ <lb/>
            flammation; and just as dislocations of the joints attended <lb/>
            with laceration, so perversions of the soul attended with <lb/>
            passion,l are the more difficult to cure. One man believes <lb/>
            Atoms and the Vacuum to be the final causes of the uni­ <lb/>
            verse-a, false supposition this-but one that does not <lb/>
            produce a wound, nor a bruise, nor distracting pain. <lb/>
            Another man thinks Wealth to be the highest good—this <lb/>
            is a fallacy that contains a corrosive poison: it eats into the <lb/>
            soul, it excites, it suffers him not to sleep, it brings a <lb/>
            swarm of gad flies about him, it drives him down preci­ <lb/>
            pices, it chokes him, it takes away all cheerfulness. On <lb/>
            the other hand, one man fancies that Virtue and Vice are <lb/>
            a body [element] : a disgraceful blunder, perhaps, but not <note type="footnote"> 1 “Excited feelings " in modern phrase. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            worth crying for or lamenting over: but whatever are <lb/>
            such maxims and opinions as this, <lb/>
            " Poor Virtue! Thou wert then a name, but I <lb/>
            Pursued thee as a truth," <lb/>
            and cast aside injustice, the cause of wealth, and intem­ <lb/>
            perance, the real source of all happiness; 1—these senti­ <lb/>
            ments, indeed, we ought both to pity and be angry with !</p>
          <p>Consequently, as regards the subjects of our inquiry, <lb/>
            Atheism being an ungrounded opinion that there is <lb/>
            nothing essentially happy and incorruptible, appears to <lb/>
            bring round the soul into a state of insensibility through a <lb/>
            disbelief of the Deity ; and its object in not believing in <lb/>
            gods is the not being afraid of them: whereas for <lb/>
            Superstition (Godfearing), its very name shows it to be an <lb/>
            opinion involving passion (feeling), and a conception that <lb/>
            engenders fear which humiliates and crushes a man, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he believes there are gods, but that they are <lb/>
            spiteful and mischievous gods. For the Atheist appears <lb/>
            to be one that is insensible to what is Divine; the Super­ <lb/>
            stitious man to be sensible in the wrong way, and thereby <lb/>
            perverted. For want of knowledge has produced in the <lb/>
            one a disbelief in the Benefactor ; whilst in the other case <lb/>
            it has superadded the fear that the same Power is a malig­ <lb/>
            nant one. Consequently, Atheism is Reason deceived, <lb/>
            - Superstition a passion arising out of false reasoning.</p>
          <p>Ugly indeed are all passions and maladies of the soul, <lb/>
            yet there is in some of them, a showiness, a loftiness, and <lb/>
            a singularity by reason of their airiness, and they are not <lb/>
            by any means, so to speak, destitute of practical energy. <lb/>
            For it is the general fault of all the passions, that being <lb/>
            impelled by practical tendencies they hang on to, and <lb/>
            stimulate the reason: but Fear, being as deficient in <note type="footnote"> 1 These words are clearly the continuation of the same quotation, but <lb/>
            abbreviated into prose. Brutus quoted them when reduced to despair. </note> <lb/>

            courage as it is in reason, has its stupidity accompanied <lb/>
            with indolence, perplexity, and helplessness: on which, <lb/>
            account its faculty of fettering at once and disturbing the <lb/>
            soul has been called " terror” and “awe." 1 Now, of all <lb/>
            fears the most incapacitating from action, and the most <lb/>
            helpless, is that springing from Superstition. He that <lb/>
            goes not on voyages, fears not the sea; nor he that goes <lb/>
            not for soldier, war; nor highwaymen, he that stays at <lb/>
            home : nor the informer, he who has no money ; nor envy, <lb/>
            the man in private life; nor earthquakes, he who lives in <lb/>
            Gaul; nor lightning, the dweller in Æthiopia. But he <lb/>
            who is afraid of the gods, is in fear of everything-the <lb/>
            sea, the air, the sky, darkness, light, a call,2 silence, a <lb/>
            dream. Slaves forget their tyrants when they are asleep, <lb/>
            slumber lightens the weight of their chains to those in <lb/>
            fetters, even inflammations accompanying wounds, and <lb/>
            fierce and agonizing ulcers that eat into the flesh quit <lb/>
            for a while the sleeping man:— <lb/>
            “Sweet balm of sleep, true medicine for disease, <lb/>
            How dear thy coming, truly at my need."</p>
          <p>This, Superstition does not allow one to exclaim, for it <lb/>
            is the only thing that makes no truce with sleep, nor <lb/>
            grants to the soul then, at least, to repose, and gain a <lb/>
            little courage by driving off its burdensome and painful <lb/>
            notions about the Deity, but as it were in the realms of <lb/>
            the damned, it raises up in the sleep of the superstitious, <lb/>
            terrific phantoms, monsters, apparitions, and tortures of <lb/>
            all kinds; scaring the miserable soul, it chases it out of the <lb/>
            refuge of sleep with spectres: while it is scourged and <lb/>
            tormented by its own self, as though by the hand of <lb/>
            another; and receives troubles both dreadful and of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃, τάρβος</foreign>, as if derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃ν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταράττειν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> • 2 The omen derived from words casually heard upon commencing any <lb/>

            strange sort; and then, when they wake up, they do not <lb/>
            come to their senses, nor laugh at their visionary fears, <lb/>
            nor feel glad that nothing of what had so disturbed <lb/>
            them was a reality ; but after having escaped the visionary <lb/>
            illusion that had no harm in it, they cheat themselves over <lb/>
            again, waste their money, and vex themselves, by rushing <lb/>
            to fortune-tellers and such like impostors, and saying­ <lb/>
            “Hath a dream and vision troubled thy brain <lb/>
            Or hast thou encountered the Night-hag's train ? <lb/>
            Send for the crone that well can break the spell," <lb/>
            and dip thyself in the sea, and pass a day seated on the <lb/>

            dinary gestures of adoration.2 " To sing with a just <lb/>
            mouth " was the advice to lyrists of those who professed <lb/>
            to keep up the established rules of music—we, on our <lb/>
            part, demand that men pray to the gods with mouths erect <lb/>
            and as it should be, and not merely to examine whether <lb/>
            the tongue or top of the entrails of the victim be clean and <lb/>
            fitting, whilst they distort and pollute their own tongues <lb/>
            with absurd titles and foreign3 invocations, to do shame to, <lb/>
            and sin against, the divine and national dignity of religion. <lb/>
            But the comic poet has said somewhere with respect to those <lb/>

            is the only thing the gods have given us gratis, "Why, <lb/>
            then, dost thou make it too an expensive article to thy­ <lb/>
            self ? " It is equally right to say to the superstitious man : <lb/>
            " Sleep the gods have bestowed upon us as the balm of <lb/>
            troubles, and for refreshment; wherefore dost thou make <lb/>
            it a torture-chamber for thyself, hateful and painful, thy <lb/>
            wretched soul not being able to make its escape, and take <lb/>
            refuge in a second slumber ? Heraclitus observes that for <lb/>
            men awake there is one and a common world; but of men <lb/>
            asleep each one wanders away into a world of his own. But <lb/>
            for the superstitious there is no world in common with the <lb/>
            rest; for neither when awake does he enjoy the rational <lb/>
            world, nor when asleep does he escape from the terrifying <lb/>
            one; but his reason is always a-dreaming, he fears even <lb/>
            when awake-escape is impossible, so is change of place. <lb/>
            Poly crates was a terrible tyrant at Samos, Periander another <lb/>
            at Corinth ; yet nobody was afraid of them after he had <lb/>
            migrated into a free city, democratically governed; but he <lb/>
            that dreads the government of the gods as a gloomy and <lb/>
            implacable tyranny-whither shall he migrate, where shall <lb/>
            he flee, what land shall he find free from gods, what sea ? <lb/>
            into what part of the earth canst thou creep and hide thy­ <lb/>
            self, poor wretch! and be sure that thou hast escaped <lb/>
            from God? Even slaves without hope of manumission <lb/>
            are allowed by law to demand to be sold, and to change <lb/>
            their master for a milder one;1 but Superstition allows <lb/>
            not of a change of gods, nor is it possible to find a god <lb/>
            whom that man shall not fear who is afraid of those of <lb/>
            his own country and own family-he that shudders at the <lb/>
            Preservers and the Benevolent; he that trembles at and <lb/>
            dreads the beings from whom we ask in prayer riches, <lb/>
            plenty, peace, concord, the prospering of our works and <note type="footnote"> I A curious but effectual provision for securing their humane treat­ <lb/>

            best actions. And then these very people consider servi­ <lb/>
            tude a misfortune, and exclaim: <lb/>
            “A sad misfortune 'tis to man or maid <lb/>
            To be a slave, and get an unlucky master!"</p>
          <p>But how much more grievous do you hold their case <lb/>
            who get masters whom they cannot flee from, cannot get <lb/>
            out of their way, cannot pacify! Even slaves have an <lb/>
            altar of refuge ; even robbers hold many temples to be in. <lb/>
            violable ; and people fleeing from enemies take courage if <lb/>
            they can embrace some idol or shrine-but these are the <lb/>
            very things the superstitious man most shudders at, is <lb/>
            frightened with, and fears-the very things in which such <lb/>
            as dread dangers place their trust! Tear not away the <lb/>
            superstitious man from the altar-it is there that he is <lb/>
            tortured, and receives the punishment of his offence !</p>
          <p>What need is there to speak at length ? The appointed <lb/>
            limit of Life for all mankind is Death; but to Superstition <lb/>
            not even death is the limit—she leaps over the boundaries <lb/>
            of Life into the other side, making Fear longer-lived than <lb/>
            life, and tacking on to Death the imagination of never- <lb/>
            ending woes. And when she comes to the end of her <lb/>
            troubles, she fancies that she is entering upon others that <lb/>
            have no end. Deep below are opened the gates of Hell, <lb/>
            rivers of fire, and fountains of Styx are at once disclosed; <lb/>
            a fantastic darkness envelopes all, where certain spectral <lb/>
            forms flit about, offering frightful sights to the eye, piteous <lb/>
            sounds to the ear; also judges seated, and executioners <lb/>
            at hand; yawning gulfs and deep places, crammed with <lb/>
            all manner of evil things. Thus unhappy Superstition <lb/>
            has obtained through death an end of suffering, but has, <lb/>
            through its folly, created an expectation of future misery <lb/>
            for itself. Atheism is exposed to none of these evils; yet <lb/>
            its ignorance is painful, and to be in error and blindness <lb/>
            concerning things of such moment is a great misfortune <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            to the soul—just as though it had had put out the brightest <lb/>
            and most important of its many eyes, namely, the idea of <lb/>
            the Deity; but still (as above remarked) passion, wounds, <lb/>
            disturbance, and abjectness do not, as a matter of course, <lb/>
            regularly accompany this state of belief. " Music," says <lb/>
            Plato, " the creator of harmony and order, was not given <lb/>
            by heaven to man for the purpose of amusement and <lb/>
            tickling of the ears, but to disentangle gently, bring <lb/>
            round, and restore again to its proper place the turbulence <lb/>
            of the soul that has gone astray in the body as regards its <lb/>
            revolutions and connections, and has often committed ex­ <lb/>
            cesses through a deficiency in education and gracefulness, <lb/>
            by intemperance and neglect of duty." “Whomsoever <lb/>
            Jove loveth not, it says Pindar, " are disgusted at hear­ <lb/>
            ing the voice of the Muses," for they are exasperated and <lb/>
            vexed thereby. In fact, they say that tigers, if a tam­ <lb/>
            bourine be sounded over them, become furious, grow mad, <lb/>
            and finally tear themselves to pieces. But it is a less evil 1 <lb/>
            for them upon whom is come a want of taste for, and in­ <lb/>
            sensibility to, the charms of music, by reason of deaf­ <lb/>
            ness and loss of hearing. Tiresias suffered a misfortune <lb/>
            in not seeing his children or his acquaintances; but <lb/>
            Athamas suffered a greater one, as did Agave, in seeing <lb/>
            them in the shape of lions or stags. And surely it had <lb/>
            been better for Hercules in his madness, neither to have <lb/>
            seen, or been sensible of their presence, rather than to <lb/>
            have treated those most dear to him like so many foes. <lb/>
            What then? Does it not seem to you that the state of the <lb/>
            Atheists, as compared with that of the superstitious, pre­ <lb/>
            sents exactly the same sort of difference ? The former do <lb/>
            not see the gods at all, the latter believe that they exist; <lb/>
            the former overlook them ; the latter fancy terrible what <lb/>
            is benign, tyrannical what is paternal, mischievous what is <lb/>
            preservative, savage and bestial that which is pure. And <note type="footnote"> 1 The not hearing the voice of the Muses. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            then they believe metal-workers, and sculptors, and wax­ <lb/>
            modellers, that the gods are of human form; and in such <lb/>
            form do they model, and procure, and worship them: and <lb/>
            despise philosophers and statesmen when they teach that <lb/>
            the majesty of God is coupled with goodness and magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence, with strength and with protective care for man. <lb/>
            The one party, therefore, are possessed with an insensi­ <lb/>
            bility to, and a disbelief in, the good things that benefit <lb/>
            them; the other party are filled with alarm at, and fear of, <lb/>
            the things that benefit them. And to sum up—Atheism <lb/>
            is insensibility to what is divine, which shows itself in not <lb/>
            understanding what is good; Superstition an over-sensi­ <lb/>
            bility, in suspecting the good to be bad. People are afraid <lb/>
            of the gods, and fly for refuge to the gods; they flatter <lb/>
            them, and they revile them; they make vows to them, and <lb/>
            they upbraid them. It is the common lot of mankind not <lb/>
            to prosper to the end in all things. " For they are ever <lb/>
            young, and free from sickness, unacquainted with all <lb/>
            troubles, having escaped the loud-roaring fury of the <lb/>
            Acheron," says Pindar of the gods; but human sufferings <lb/>
            and doings are mixed up with chances flowing in different <lb/>
            channels for different people. Come, now, and contem­ <lb/>
            plate the Atheist in misfortune, and observe the way in <lb/>
            which he behaves (that is, if he be one who practises self­ <lb/>
            control on other occasions)—how he makes the best of the <lb/>
            matter, and supplies himself with consolations and reme­ <lb/>
            dies : and if he be impatient and annoyed by his troubles, <lb/>
            how he lays all his complaints against Fortune and Chance, <lb/>
            and exclaims that nothing goes according to right, and by <lb/>
            the dispensation of Providence; but all are borne along <lb/>
            confusedly and irrationally, and human affairs are all <lb/>
            caprice. Such is not the behaviour of the superstitious <lb/>
            man: but if the mishap that has befallen him is of the <lb/>
            most trifling kind, he sits down building up upon his <lb/>
            trouble yet further calamities, grievous, great, and not to <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            be averted; and heaping besides upon himself apprehen­ <lb/>
            sions, fears, and suspicions, making the mischief burn I <lb/>
            with all sorts of weeping and groaning. For it is not <lb/>
            man, nor chance, nor occasion, nor himself, but God on <lb/>
            whom he lays the blame of all, and from Him he says the <lb/>
            heaven-sent stream of calamity comes rushing down upon <lb/>
            himself, and that he, not because he is unfortunate, but <lb/>
            as being hateful to God, is therefore tormented and <lb/>
            punished by the Powers above, and suffers everything ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his deserts, on account of his own misconduct.' <lb/>
            Now the Atheist, when sick, counts up to himself, and <lb/>
            calls to mind his errors, and excesses, and irregularities as <lb/>
            to diet, or his over great fatigue, or unaccustomed changes <lb/>
            of climate and of place. Again, if he have met with dis­ <lb/>
            appointments in political matters, having got into bad <lb/>
            odour with the populace, or into ill repute with the upper <lb/>
            powers, he examines the mischance as though proceeding <lb/>
            from himself, or those about him : <lb/>
            " In what point have I erred; what fault committed j <lb/>
            What duty have I, careless, left undone ? "</p>
          <p>But to the superstitious man, every infirmity of body, <lb/>
            every loss of money, or loss of children, every unpleasant­ <lb/>
            ness or failure in political matters, are called " plagues <lb/>
            from God," and " assaults of the demon ;" consequently, <lb/>
            he ventures not to help himself under what has happened, <lb/>
            nor to remedy it, nor resist it, lest he should appear to <lb/>
            fight against God, and to resist when he is chastised; but, <lb/>
            if sick, the physician is pushed away; if in sorrow, the <lb/>
            philosopher who comes to advise and comfort him has the <lb/>
            door slammed in his face. " Let me alone (says he), my <lb/>
            good fellow, to suffer my punishment-impious, accursed <note type="footnote"> I Fanning the flame of the evil. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ avrov <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν νυ̃ν</foreign> which looks like a corruption, perhaps <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν νυ̃ν</foreign> " of <lb/>

             <pb n="267"/>
            as I am, hateful to gods and daemons !" And then, in the <lb/>
            case of a man that does not believe there is a God, but who <lb/>
            is sick or suffering greatly in some other way, one can wipe <lb/>
            away his tears, cut off his hair, remove his bed-clothes; but <lb/>
            as for the superstitious man, how can you possibly address <lb/>
            him, or in what way can you bring him help ? He sits out <lb/>
            of doors, wearing sackcloth, or else girded with filthy rags. <lb/>
            Oftentimes wallowing quite naked in the mire, he makes <lb/>
            confession aloud of his sins of omission and commission, <lb/>
            of having eaten or drank this or that,1 or walked along a <lb/>
            way that the genius had forbidden him. And if he come best <lb/>
            off, and suffers from a mild form of superstition, he sits at <lb/>
            home surrounded with burning incense, besmeared with <lb/>
            unguents, " whilst the old women (says Bion) tie round <lb/>
            him, and tie to him, like a peg, whatever they please."</p>
          <p>Tiribazus, they tell us, when arrested by the Persians, <lb/>
            being a strong man, drew his sword and made a desperate <lb/>
            resistance, until those who were seizing him protested and <lb/>
            called out that they did so by the king's order, and then <lb/>
            he threw down his weapon and allowed them to tie his <lb/>
            hands. Is not this a parallel case ? Other men struggle <lb/>
            with their misfortunes, and push away their troubles, de­ <lb/>
            vising ways of escape for themselves, and means of avert­ <lb/>
            ing their difficulties. But the superstitious man, by lis­ <lb/>
            tening to nobody, by saying to himself: " Wretch! all <lb/>
            these things dost thou suffer from Providence, and by <lb/>
            God's command," has cast away all hope, has abandoned <lb/>
            himself, fled from and baffled the efforts of those coming <lb/>
            to his relief. Many trifling evils Superstition makes into <lb/>
            fatal ones. Midas of old, as it appears, being dispirited <lb/>
            and panic-struck by certain dreams he had had, was so <note type="footnote"> I Many kinds of food were forbidden in different religions, as pork to <lb/>
            the Egyptians and their colonies, fish to the Syrians, all roots to the <lb/>
            devotees of Cybele, &amp;c., the mystic motives for which Julian has ex­ <lb/>
            plained at length in his “Hymn to the Mother of the Gods.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            affected in mind that he sought a voluntary death by <lb/>
            drinking bull's blood. Aristodemus, King of the Messe­ <lb/>
            nians, in the war around Ithome, because his dogs howled <lb/>
            in a way like the wolves, and furze grew up around his <lb/>
            paternal hearthstone, and the diviners were alarmed at the <lb/>
            omens, lost all courage and hope through utter terror, and <lb/>
            slew himself with his own hand. And perhaps it had been <lb/>
            better for Nicias, general of the Athenians, to have got <lb/>
            rid of his superstition in the same way as did Midas and <lb/>
            Aristodemus rather than to have sat still and allowed him­ <lb/>
            self to be walled up by the enemy, because he was frigh­ <lb/>
            tened at the shadow of the moon's eclipse; and finally, <lb/>
            together with forty thousand of his men, either butchered <lb/>
            or taken alive, to fall into their hands, and perish inglo­ <lb/>
            riously. For the opposing barrier of earth that lay in his <lb/>
            way, at a time for making the best use of his legs, was <lb/>
            nothing formidable nor frightful, merely because a shadow <lb/>
            crept over the moon, but what really was terrible was the <lb/>
            darkness of superstition that fell upon him, to confuse and <lb/>
            blind the man's judgment in a state of things the most <lb/>
            requiring sound judgment. <lb/>
            “Mark, my Glaucus, how the billows out at sea are heaving high; <lb/>
            On the hills a cloud big-bellied rises wall-like to the sky : <lb/>
            Omen of a coming tempest." <lb/>
            The pilot seeing this, offers, it is true, vows to heaven for <lb/>
            deliverance, and invokes the Saviour Gods, but at the same <lb/>
            time he manages the rudder, lowers the yard, and striking <lb/>
            his mainsail makes his flight from the loud billowing sea. <lb/>
            Hesiod bids the husbandman, before ploughing and sow­ <lb/>
            ing, to offer vows to Terrestrial Jove and to chaste Ceres, <lb/>
            with " his hand upon the plough tail." Homer says that <lb/>
            Ajax, when about to fight in single combat with Hector, <lb/>
            bade the Greeks offer vows to the gods in his behalf, <lb/>
            and when they were offering their vows, put on his ar­ <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            incur. Agamemnon, too, after he had commanded the <lb/>
            Greeks, <lb/>
            " To sharpen well the spear, and brace the shield,* <lb/>
            then begs from Jove: <lb/>
            “Grant me this day to cast down Priam's city," <lb/>
            for God is the hope of valour, not the cover for cowardice. <lb/>
            But the Jews, it being the Sabbath, seated in their phylac­ <lb/>
            teries,1 remained still whilst the enemy was laying scaling <lb/>
            ladders and occupying the walls, being tied up together, <lb/>
            as it were, in one and the same net by Superstition. Such <lb/>
            then is Superstition in the circumstances and occasions <lb/>
            called unlucky and changeful—but even in agreeable con­ <lb/>
            ditions of things it has nowise the advantage over Atheism. <lb/>
            Now the pleasantest things of all to men are festivals and <lb/>
            banquets at the temples, also ceremonies of initiation, <lb/>
            bacchic rites, vows to gods, and adorations of their images. <lb/>
            Contemplate well the Atheist on such occasions, as he smiles <lb/>
            with an unfeeling and sardonic grin on his face at what is <lb/>
            going on; and perhaps scoffs at them in a whisper to his <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἀγνάμπτοις</foreign>, which Reiske renders “vestibus non pexis," i. e. " sor­ <lb/>
            didis," as if the reading were <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγνάπτοις</foreign>: an absurd explanation every <lb/>
            way, for the Jews always wear their best on the Sabbath. That pro­ <lb/>
            found Hebraist, Mr. Sinker, has solved the enigma for me; he points out <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">άσάλευτα</foreign>, " immovable," is the regular Greek name for "phylac­ <lb/>
            teries," because of the immobility the devout were bound to maintain <lb/>
            whilst wearing them, and of which the Rabbinical writers give many <lb/>
            instances. The Greek words for " immovable" and “inflexible" might <lb/>
            very well be used as equivalent for the same article. These phylac­ <lb/>
            teries, strips of leather with Scripture texts written on them, are <lb/>
            always worn by Jews when saying their prayers. After all, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν <lb/>
            άγνάπτοις</foreign> may be nothing more than adverbially used for “in­ <lb/>
            flexibly." In the wet August of 1881 the Sundays alone were fine; the <lb/>
            farmers allowed the cut wheat to rot on the ground rather than labour <lb/>
            to house it. Common sense has not advanced in nearly two thousand <lb/>
            years. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            friends, " that the people must be possessed and out of <lb/>
            their senses to think that they did such things in honour <lb/>
            of gods," but still he gets no further harm from his <lb/>
            opinion. But the superstitious man wishes indeed but is <lb/>
            unable to enjoy himself and receive pleasure from these <lb/>
            doings: <lb/>
            “With smoking incense is the city filled; <lb/>
            With hymns and cries of woe together mingled !” <lb/>
            The soul of the superstitious man turns pale under his <lb/>
            crown of flowers, is affrighted whilst he sacrifices, offers <lb/>
            the vows with a faltering voice, puts incense upon the <lb/>
            flame with a trembling hand ; and in fine proves futile the <lb/>
            maxim of Pythagoras “that we are at our best when walk­ <lb/>
            ing towards the gods;" for then the superstitious are in <lb/>
            their most miserable and worst condition, approaching, as <lb/>
            they do, the shrines of gods or chapels as though they <lb/>
            were the dens of bears, the holes of dragons, the lurking- <lb/>
            places of the monsters of the deep, and on this account I am <lb/>
            seized with astonishment at people's saying that Atheism <lb/>
            is impiety, and not saying that Superstition is so, and yet <lb/>
            Anaxagoras stood his trial for blasphemy because he said <lb/>
            that the sun was a stone; but no one ever called the Cim­ <lb/>
            merians impious because they think there is no sun at all. <lb/>
            What do you say to it ? Is the man a criminal that holds <lb/>
            there are no gods; and is not he that holds them to be <lb/>
            such as the superstitious believe them, is he not possessed <lb/>
            with notions infinitely more atrocious? I for my part <lb/>
            would much rather have men say of me that there never <lb/>
            was a Plutarch at all, nor is now, than to say that Plutarch <lb/>
            is a man inconstant, fickle, easily moved to anger, revenge­ <lb/>
            ful for trifling provocations, vexed at small things. If <lb/>
            when you invite others to dinner, you should omit him, if, <lb/>
            in consequence of pressing business, you did not approach <lb/>
            his vestibule, or salute him, he will cling to you and eat <lb/>
            up your body, or he will seize thy baby and beat it to <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            death; or he will get a wild beast and turn it loose into <lb/>
            thy garden, and spoil thy crops for thee. When Timanthes <lb/>
            at Athens was singing a hymn to Artemis and calling her <lb/>
            " Wild-runner, frantic, mad, infuriated ”—Cinesias the <lb/>
            song-maker, got up from among the audience and cried, <lb/>
            “Mayest thou have a daughter like her!" And truly, <lb/>
            similar things, and yet worse, do the superstitious believe <lb/>
            about Artemis. " Whether thou art hurrying away from <lb/>
            the strangling, whether thou hast rent in pieces the suck­ <lb/>
            ling, whether thou hast been midwife to the monster, <lb/>
            whether thou art come upon us all stained with gore, <lb/>
            whether thou hast been dragged hither from the cross-road <lb/>
            for the purpose of fortune-telling, clasping thine arms <lb/>
            around the murderer.”1 Not one2 whit more decent no­ <lb/>
            tions than these will they conceive respecting Apollo, and <lb/>
            Juno, and Mars, and Venus—for all these deities do they <lb/>
            tremble at and awfully fear. And yet, what abuse like <lb/>
            this did Niobe utter about Latona, like to what supersti­ <lb/>
            tion has made senseless folks say about the goddess, that <lb/>
            because she had been insulted, she killed with her arrows <lb/>
            for the wretched woman: <lb/>
            " Six daughters, and six sons in blooming youth," <lb/>
            so insatiable was she with the sufferings of others, and <lb/>
            hard to be appeased. But if in reality the goddess were <lb/>
            capable of anger, a hater of vice, and annoyed at being ill­ <lb/>
            spoken of, and did not laugh at human ignorance and stu­ <lb/>
            pidity, but were exasperated thereby; in that case she <lb/>
            ought to have shot those that invented such lies against <lb/>
            her about her cruelty and spitefulness, and who wrote and <note type="footnote"> 1 Evidently part of a chorus, addressed to Artemis in the character <lb/>
            of Hecate, Queen of Hell; hopelessly corrupt, but a few words have <lb/>

            told such stories. For we condemn the rage of Hecuba <lb/>
            as barbarous and bestial, where she says: <lb/>
            " ——his inmost heart I will devour, <lb/>
            And cling to him to eat it," <lb/>
            but the Syrian goddess the superstitious believe, if anyone <lb/>
            eats sprats or anchovies, cankers their shin-bones, fills <lb/>
            their bodies with ulcers, and withers up their liver. Is it <lb/>
            therefore wicked to speak evil things of the gods, but not <lb/>
            wicked to think them ? Or is it the thought that renders <lb/>
            the voice of the blasphemer so offensive? And yet we cen­ <lb/>
            sure abusive language as an indication of hostility, and <lb/>
            those that speak evil of us we regard as enemies, as being <lb/>
            treacherous and ill-disposed towards us. But you see <lb/>
            what sort of things the superstitious think about the gods <lb/>
            -imagining them to be furious, faithless, fickle, revenge­ <lb/>
            ful, cruel, covetous ; from all which it necessarily follows <lb/>
            that the superstitious man both hates and fears the gods: <lb/>
            for how can he do. otherwise, when he believes that the <lb/>
            greatest evils have happened to him through their doing, <lb/>
            and will happen to him again ? Hating the gods and fear­ <lb/>
            ing them, he is their enemy; and though he may reverence <lb/>
            and do obeisance, and sacrifice, and keep vigils in their <lb/>
            temples, it is not to be wondered at, for people bow down <lb/>
            before tyrants and pay court to them, and erect their sta­ <lb/>
            tues in gold, but hate in silence all the time they are offer­ <lb/>
            ing sacrifice to them. Hermolaus was physician to Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, Pausanias was a guardsman to Philip, Chsereas to <lb/>
            Caligula, yet each one of these said to himself, as he fol­ <lb/>
            lowed his lord :­ <lb/>
            “Revenge I will, if e'er I get the chance."</p>
          <p>The atheist thinks there are no gods, the superstitious <lb/>
            man wishes there were none; but he believes in them in <lb/>
            spite of himself, because he is afraid to die, and like as <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            Tantalus seeks to evade the rock suspended over him, so <lb/>
            does the latter evade his fear, by the weight of which he <lb/>
            is no less oppressed, and would be content with, nay gladly <lb/>
            accept the Atheist's state of mind, as a state of liberty. <lb/>
            But as it is, Atheism has nothing in common with Super­ <lb/>
            stition : for the superstitious man, though by inclination <lb/>
            Atheist, is yet far too weak-minded to think about the gods <lb/>
            what he wishes to think. And again Atheism is in no <lb/>
            way responsible for Superstition-whereas Superstition has <lb/>
            both supplied the cause for Atheism to come into being, <lb/>
            and after it is come, furnished it with an excuse--not, in­ <lb/>
            deed, a just nor a sound one, but yet one not destitute <lb/>
            of a certain plausibility; for it was not because they <lb/>
            had discovered anything to be found fault with in the <lb/>
            heavens, or in the stars, or in the seasons, or in the <lb/>
            revolutions of the sun about the earth, the producers of day <lb/>
            and night, or anything erroneous or disorderly in the <lb/>
            mode of nutrition of living things, or in the growth of <lb/>
            plants, that they passed sentence of Atheism upon the Uni­ <lb/>
            verse ; but it was the ridiculous doings and sufferings of <lb/>
            Superstition, its impostures, witchcrafts, races in a circle, <lb/>
            and beating of timbrels; its impure purifications, and un­ <lb/>
            cleanly cleansings, its barbaric and illegal penances and <lb/>
            self-defilement at the holy places, all these things have <lb/>
            given occasion to some to say that it were better there <lb/>
            should be no gods at all than that there should be any that <lb/>
            accepted such worship, that took pleasure in such rites; <lb/>
            gods so insolent, so covetous, so irritable. Were it not <lb/>
            better for those Gauls and Scythians of old, to have no <lb/>
            conception or notion of deities at all, nor acquired know­ <lb/>
            ledge of them, than to believe there were gods that de­ <lb/>
            lighted in the blood of slaughtered men, and regarded such <lb/>
            as the most perfect sacrifice, and religious ceremony? <lb/>
            What an advantage had not it been to the Carthaginians <lb/>
            to have taken Criteas or Diagoras for lawgiver from the <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            first, rather than to have offered such victims as they used <lb/>
            to offer to Saturn-not, as Empedocles says, when attack­ <lb/>
            ing such as sacrificed living things, <lb/>
            " His metamorphosed child the sire himself <lb/>
            Slaughters and offers vows—fool that he is," <lb/>
            but with their eyes open, and knowingly did they sacrifice <lb/>
            their own children. Childless persons used to buy infants <lb/>
            of the poor, and slaughter1 them like so many lambs or <lb/>
            chickens ; the mother stood by, without a tear, without a <lb/>
            groan, for should she weep, should she utter a groan, she <lb/>
            was deprived of her price, and the child was sacrificed all <lb/>
            the same: and the whole place was filled with noise in <lb/>
            front of the image, by people sounding pipes and beating <lb/>
            timbrels, in order that the sound of any lamentations <lb/>
            might not be audible. Did the Typhons reign over us, or <lb/>
            the Giants, after driving the gods from their thrones-what <lb/>
            other sacrifices than these would they delight in, what other <lb/>
            rites would they demand? Amastris, queen of Xerxes, <lb/>
            being alarmed at something or other, buried men alive as <lb/>
            offerings in her own stead to Hades-that god whom Plato <lb/>
            calls " humane, wise and rich, controlling the ghosts by <lb/>
            persuasion and by argument, and thence having got the <lb/>
            name of Hades (the Pleaser)." Xenophanes, the naturalist, <lb/>
            seeing the Egyptians beating their breasts and making <lb/>
            lamentations at the festivals, advised them sensibly enough, <lb/>
            saying, " If these people are gods, do not lament for them <lb/>
            -if mortals do not sacrifice unto them." But no disease is <lb/>
            so full of variations, so changeable in symptoms, so made <lb/>
            up out of ideas opposed to, nay, rather, at war with one <note type="footnote"> 1 The word here is used in its strict sense of "cutting the throats :” <lb/>
            the children were not burnt alive, but their quivering bodies were placed <lb/>
            on the extended palms of the great Moloch, whence they tumbled into <lb/>
            the fiery pit below, as Davies has shown in his “Carthage," chapter <lb/>
            “Moloch and his Victims." </note> <lb/>

            another, as is the disease called Superstition. We must, <lb/>
            therefore, fly from it, but in a safe way, and to our own <lb/>
            good-not like those who, running away from the attack <lb/>
            of highwaymen, or wild beasts, or a fire, have entangled <lb/>
            themselves in mazes that contain pitfalls as well as preci­ <lb/>
            pices: for thus, some people, when running away from <lb/>
            Superstition, fall headlong into Atheism, both rugged and <lb/>
            obstinate, and leap over that which lies between the two, <lb/>
            namely, true Religion. <pb n="276"/>

          <p>E <lb/>
            for " Thou Art.”—The Zohar uses " Atha,” " Thou," <lb/>
            as a synonym for God, in exactly the same sense that <lb/>
            the E is here interpreted—a declaration of His self-exis­ <lb/>
            tence. A well-known gem (Paris), bearing the portrait of <lb/>
            Pescennius Niger, with a serpent placed across a burning <lb/>
            altar in front, has also a long inscription, chiefly in initials; <lb/>
            but which give, in full, the title 0 ON, "He that is," to <lb/>
            the " Holy King Apollo," who had restored that virtuous <lb/>
            emperor to health. This fact is expressed by the offering <lb/>
            of the Serpent, that regular attribute of the god of <lb/>
            medicine.</p>
          <p>P. 174. The Delphic E.—Schliemann's little gold model <lb/>
            of a shrine (" Mycense," No. 423) presents, upon each of its <lb/>
            three panels, this letter, of the same form as when engraved <lb/>
            on Roman talismans; but laid upon its back, like the caste­ <lb/>
            mark still in use. But the finder takes the central bar for <lb/>
            a column, and ignores the remainder of the figure, com­ <lb/>
            paring this part to the central pillar of the famous sculp­ <lb/>
            ture over the "Gate of the Lions." The sigil, thus <lb/>

          <p>P. 269. Phylacteries.—This solution of the difficulty <lb/>
            must be abandoned. I am informed, upon the highest <lb/>
            authority, that the phylacteries are not worn on the Sabbath, <lb/>
            which typifying the same idea renders the use of the <lb/>
            minor type unnecessary. In favour of the alternative ex­ <lb/>
            planation " without bending a limb," I may adduce the <lb/>
            fact that the Karaite Jews (who pique themselves upon the <lb/>
            strictest observance of the Law of Moses, rejecting all <lb/>
            tradition) used, till our own times, to observe the Sabbath <lb/>
            by sitting motionless on the same seat from its commence­ <lb/>
            ment to its close. Plutarch evidently is alluding to the <lb/>
            massacre of unresisting congregations in the Maccabæan <lb/>
            War; after which event the Rabbis discovered a sense in <lb/>
            the words of Moses that permitted resistance against attack <lb/>
            even on the Sabbath day.</p><pb n="279"/>
