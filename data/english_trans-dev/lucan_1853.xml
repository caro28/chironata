          </head>
          <p>IN the following Translation, the text of Weise has been <lb/>
            adopted, except in a few instances, where the readings of <lb/>
            Cortius, Weber, or the older Commentators, appeared pre­ <lb/>
            ferable. It is much to be regretted that, notwithstanding <lb/>
            their labours, the text still remains in a corrupt state.</p>
          <p>The Pharsalia has not been previously translated into <lb/>
            English prose; but there have been two poetical versions, <lb/>
            one by Thomas May, in 1627, the other by Nicholas Rowe. <lb/>
            The latter is too well known to require comment; the <lb/>
            former, though replete with the quaint expressions pe­ <lb/>
            culiar to the early part of the seventeenth century, has the <lb/>
            merit of adhering closely to the original, and is remark­ <lb/>
            able for its accuracy.</p>
          <p>The present translation has been made on the same <lb/>
            principle as those of Ovid and Plautus in the CLASSICAL <lb/>
            LIBRARY; it is strictly literal, and is intended to be a faith­ <lb/>
            ful reflex, not only of the author's meaning, but, as nearly <lb/>
            as possible, of his actual modes of expression.</p>
          <p>To enhance the value of the work in an historical point <lb/>
            of view, the narrative has been illustrated by a compari­ <lb/>
            son with parallel passages in the Commentaries of Cæsar, <lb/>
            and the works of other ancient historians who have <lb/>
            treated of the wars between Pompey and Cæsar.</p>

            Pompey on the shores of the Adriatic, and his troops are suffering <lb/>
            from famine, 402-414. He then attempts to escape by sea, 415-432. <lb/>
            Loose chains are placed by the enemy beneath the waves, which <lb/>
            intercept the flight of one of Antony's rafts, 433-464. Vulteius, <lb/>

            commands, 521-581. Curio sails for Africa, and landing at the river <lb/>

          <p>In the early part of the year the Consuls convene the Senate in Epirus, <lb/>
            1-14. Lentulus addresses the Senators, and advises them to appoint <lb/>
            Pompey Commander-in-chief, which is accordingly done, 15-49. The <lb/>
            Poet praises the monarchs and nations who lent their aid, 50-64. <lb/>
            Appius goes to consult the oracle at Delphi, which has now long been <lb/>
            silent, as to the result of the war, 65-70. The oracle is described, <lb/>
            71-120. The Temple is opened, and Phemonoë, the Priestess, tries <lb/>
            to dissuade Appius from his enquiries, 121-140. She is forced, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to ascend the oracular tripod, 141-162. And is inspired by <lb/>
            the prophetic frenzy. The oracle foretells, in ambiguous terms, the <lb/>
            death of Appius himself before the battle of Pharsalia, in the Island <lb/>
            of Eubœa, 163-197. The oracle is apostrophized by the Poet, 198- <lb/>
            236. The soldiers of Caesar's party become mutinous, 237-261. <lb/>
            Their threats and clamours for peace, 262-296. Caesar presents <lb/>
            himself before them thus complaining, 297-318. He addresses them, <lb/>
            319-364. The tumult is appeased, 365-373. Cæsar sends his army <lb/>
            to Brundisium, and orders a fleet to be collected there, 374-380. <lb/>
            He then repairs to Rome, where he is made Dictator and Consul, <lb/>
            380-384. Evil omens give portentous signs, 384-402. He goes <lb/>
            thence to Brundisium; where collecting a fleet, he orders part of his <lb/>
            troops to embark, although the skies betoken an approaching tempest, <lb/>
            403-411. He harangues his soldiers, 412-423. The sea is suddenly <lb/>
            becalmed, and passing over he lands at Palæste, in Epirus, 424-460. <lb/>
            He encamps at Dyrrhachium, 461-475. Caesar entreats Antony to <lb/>
            send over the remaining forces, 476-497.. Impatient at his delay, <lb/>
            he determines to go across, 498 503. He does so in a small boat, <lb/>
            504-570. Caesar encourages the mariners in a tempest, 571-593. <lb/>
            Which is described, 594-653. He arrives in Italy, 654-677. He <lb/>
            returns to Epirus, and his soldiers expostulate with him for leaving <lb/>
            them, 678-700. Antony passes over with the rest of his troops, <lb/>
            701-721. Pompey determines to send his wife Cornelia to Lesbos, <lb/>
            722-739. He apprises her of his intentions, 740-759. Cornelia's <lb/>
            answer, 760-790. She embarks; 790-801. And sails for Lesbos, <lb/>

            The situation of the city is described, 19-28. Caesar surrounds the <lb/>
            city and the forces of Pompey with vast outworks, 29-63. Pompey <lb/>
            tallies forth to interrupt the works, 64-79. A famine and pestilence <lb/>
            arise in his army, 80-105. The army of Caesar also suffers from <lb/>
            famine, 106-117. Pompey attempts to break through the outworks, <lb/>
            118-124. He is at first successful in his attempts, 125-139. But is <lb/>
            driven back by Scæva, 140-144. Whose praises are sung by the <lb/>
            Poet, 145-148. Scæva exhorts his comrades, 149-165. While <lb/>
            bravely fighting, he is pierced by an arrow, 166-227. He requests <lb/>
            to be carried to the camp of Pompey, 228-235. Deceived by his <lb/>

            whom Cato rebukes; on which another one replies that they followed <lb/>
            Pompey for his own sake, and not for the love of civil war, and that <lb/>
            they are now desirous to return home, 215-254. Cato is indignant, <lb/>
            and by his eloquence prevails upon them to stay, 255-293. The <lb/>

            fortitude, 564-586. They proceed on their march, and arrive at a <lb/>
            spring filled with serpents, at which, however, encouraged by Cato, <lb/>
            they drink, 587-618. The Poet enters on an enquiry how Africa <lb/>
            came to be thus infested with serpents, and relates the story of <lb/>
            Medusa, 619-658. And how Perseus cut off her head, 659-684. <lb/>

            the chief priest, on the subject of the Egyptian Gods and the sources <lb/>

            the citizens of Rome ; while another opinion is, that he alludes to the fact of <lb/>

            Macedonia which lay between the rivers Haliacmon and Axins. The poets, <lb/>

            of the sword, while nations are your hate, for you to shed the <lb/>

            of the Ausonian trophies, and the shade of Crassus was wan­ <lb/>
            dering unavenged, has it pleased you that wars, doomed to <lb/>
            produce no triumphs, should be waged ? Alas! how much <lb/>

            quillity2 forgotten the general; and, an aspirant for fame, <lb/>
            had been wont to confer upon the public many a largess 3; <lb/>
            solely to be wafted on by the popular gales, and to exult <lb/>
            in the applause of a theatre his own 4; not to recruit his <lb/>
            strength afresh, and principally to rely upon his former suc­ <lb/>
            cesses. There stood the shadow of a glorious name-: just <lb/>
            as the lofty oak, in a fertile field, which bears the spoils6 of <lb/>
            an ancient people and the consecrated gifts of chieftains, now <lb/>

            in the Campus Martins, on the model of one at Mytilene, in the isle of <lb/>

            whither hope and whither vengeance should summon, and <lb/>

            down whatever opposed himself as he sought the summit, <lb/>
            and rejoicing amid ruin to have made his way.</p>
          <p>Just as the lightning forced by the winds through the <lb/>
            clouds flashes forth with the echoes of the riven æther and <lb/>
            with a crash throughout the universe, and overwhelms the <lb/>
            light of day, and terrifies the alarmed nations, dazzling the <lb/>

            the manners gave way before prosperity, and booty and <lb/>
            the spoils of the enemy induced luxurious habits; no mo­ <lb/>
            deration was there in gold or in houses; hunger, too, dis­ <lb/>

            been able to do more than one's own country; might, <lb/>

            of the people1 constrained, and Tribunes confounding their <lb/>
            rights with Consuls. Hence the Fasces 2 snatched up at <lb/>
            a price, and the populace itself the vendor of its own <lb/>
            applause, and canvassing fatal to the city, bringing round <lb/>
            the annual contests on the venal Plain of Mars3; hence <lb/>

            It is said to have received its name from the red (rubri) stones with which <lb/>

            Ascanius or Iulus, his son, was said to have been the ancestor of the Jnlian <lb/>
            family, of which Julius Caesar was a member. Jupiter had a temple, which <lb/>
            was built on the mountain of Alba by Ascanius, and was there worshipped <lb/>
            under the name of Jupiter Latialis. The holy fire sacred to Vesta was <lb/>

            Romulus, derived, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, from the Sabine <lb/>
            language. Some suppose it to have originated in the Sabine word " curis," a <lb/>
            spear. Lucan here alludes to the mysterious manner in which Romulus dis­ <lb/>
            appeared. It is not improbable that he was slain by his nobles, and that <lb/>
            through their agent Julius Proculus they spread the report that be had been <lb/>
            taken up to heaven. In the Fasti of Ovid, B. ii. 1. 505, he is represented <lb/>
            as saying, " Forbid the Quirites to lament, and let them not offend my <lb/>
            Godhead with their tears. Let them offer me frankincense, and let the <lb/>

          <p>Then did he end the respite from the warfare, and swiftly <lb/>
            bore the standards through the swollen stream. Just as when <lb/>
            in the parched plains, of sultry Libya a lion, his enemy <lb/>
            perceived at hand, crouches undecided until he collects all <lb/>
            his fury; soon as he has, aroused himself by the lashings <lb/>
            of his infuriate tail, and has raised his mane erect, and <lb/>
            from his vast throat the loud roar re-echoes; then, if the <lb/>
            light lance of the Moor, hurled, pierces him, or the hunt­ <lb/>

          <p>From a small spring rises the ruddy Rubicon, and, <lb/>

            boundary, separates from the Ausonian husbandmen the <lb/>
            Gallic fields. At that time winter1 gave it strength, and <lb/>
            now the showery Cynthia with her blunted horn for the <lb/>

            it was skirted by loose burning sands. The lesser Syrtis lay considerably to <lb/>

            I will do all this; if to despoil the Gods, and to set fire to <lb/>

            habited the district now called Bourges, having A varicum for their capital; <lb/>
            and the Bituriges Vivisci, or Ubisci, on the Garonne, whose capital was <lb/>

            a warlike nation of Gallia Belgica. Their king, Divitiacus, in the time of <lb/>
            Cæsar, was reckoned the most powerful chief in Gaul. They inhabited a <lb/>
            fertile country to the west of the Rhine, and possessed twelve towns, of <lb/>
            which the capital was Noviodunum, afterwards Augusta Suessonum, or <lb/>
            Suessones, now Soissons. They were noted for the height of their stature, <lb/>
            and the length of their spears and shields. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The Leucan) ver. 424. The Lenci were a people in the south-east of <lb/>

            Bellovaci. They formed an alliance with Cæsar, when the rest of the <lb/>
            Belgae made war against him, B.C. 57. Their chief town was Durocortorum, <lb/>
            afterwards called Remi, now Rheims. From the expression “ optimus <lb/>
            excusso lacerto," it appears that the Rhemi were especially famed for their <lb/>
            skill in the use of the javelin. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 The Belgian, too) ver. 426. The Belgæ formed one of the three great <lb/>

            by the Sequana or Seine and the Matrona or Marne, and on the east by <lb/>
            the territory of the Treviri. They were of German origin, and had settled <lb/>
            in the country, on dispossessing the former inhabitants. Though mentioned <lb/>

            sometimes called Herophile, Daphne, Deiphobe, Manto, &amp;c. Apollo granted <lb/>

            Their wild and boisterous rites are here referred to, and, like the priests of <lb/>
            Bellona, they were in the habit of mutilating their own bodies. The origin <lb/>
            of their name is uncertain, but it was most probably derived from the river <lb/>
            Gallus in Phrygia, which flowed near the temple of Cybele. One of the <lb/>
            Scholiasts says, that to insult the Galli, after the conquest of Gaul, Cæsar <lb/>

            with the Romans to wash the statue of the Goddess Cybele and her chariot <lb/>

            practice in the Fasti, B. iv. 1. 338, et seq. " There is a spot where the rapid <lb/>
            Almo flows into the Tiber, and the lesser stream loses its name in that of <lb/>
            the greater. There does the hoary priest, in his purple vestments, lave the <lb/>

            of the Scholiasts says that there was a river of the same name in Phrygia, <lb/>
            whence the worship of Cybele was brought. This line is by some thought to <lb/>
            be spurious. In the previous line the Poet alludes to the " Quindecimviri," <lb/>
            or “Fifteen,” whose duty it was to preserve the Sibylline books, which <lb/>
            were supposed to reveal the destinies of Rome. Their number was originally <lb/>

            was first instituted in the year B.C. 196. Their duty was, to attend to the <lb/>
            “Epulum Jovis," or“Feast of Jove," and the banquets, or “lectisternia," <lb/>
            given in honor of the other Gods; a duty which had originally belonged to <lb/>
            the Pontifices. Julius Cæsar added three to their number, but they were <lb/>
            afterwards reduced to seven. They formed a Collegium, and were one of <lb/>
            the four religious corporations of Rome, the other three being those of the <lb/>
            Pontifices, Augures, and Quindecimviri. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Fellowship of the Titii) ver. 602. The " Titii Sodales " formed a College <lb/>
            of priests at Rome, who represented the Titii or second tribe of the Romans, <lb/>
            which was descended from the Sabines, and continued to perform their <lb/>
            ancient rites. This body is said to have been instituted by Titus Tatius, the <lb/>
            iring of the Sabines, who reigned jointly with Romulus. According to <lb/>
            Tacitus, it would seem that Romulus made the worship of Tatius after his <lb/>
            death a part of the Sabine sacred rites. Varro derives the name from <lb/>
            “Titiæ aves," the “Titian birds," which were observed by these priests in <lb/>
            certain auguries, and it is not improbable that they kept the auguries peculiar <lb/>
            to the Sabines distinct from those used by the other tribes. It is very <lb/>
            doubtful whether the office of the “Titii Sodales," as the preservers of the <lb/>
            Sabine ritual, was in existence in the time of Lucan. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The Salian, likewise) ver. 603. The Salii were priests of Mars, who <lb/>

            necks. Some writers say that they received their name from Salius, an Ar­ <lb/>

            .armour. After the processions had lasted some days, the shields were <lb/>
            replaced in the Temple of Mars. The dress of the Salii was an embroidered <lb/>

            of the Roman priesthood, though his political influence was less than that of <lb/>
            the “Pontifex Maximus." Among other privileges, that of having a lictor <lb/>

            name, however, properly belonged to a pointed piece of olive wood, the <lb/>
            base of which was surrounded with wool. This was held on the head by <lb/>
            fillets or by a cap, which was fastened by two bands called “apicula," or <lb/>
            “offendices." The cap was of a conical form, and was generally made of <lb/>
            sheep-skin with the wool on; and from the "apex" on its summit it at <lb/>
            length acquired that name. The Flamens were chosen from the higher <lb/>
            classes; hence the present epithet It generoso." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 A name upon the consecrated spots) ver. 608. He alludes to the conse­ <lb/>
            cration of the "bidental." This was a name given to a place struck by <lb/>
            lightning, which was held sacred ever afterwards. Similar veneration was <lb/>
            also paid to a place where a person who had been killed by lightning was <lb/>
            buried. Priests collected the earth that had been torn up, the branches <lb/>
            broken off by the lightning, and everything that bad been scorched, and <lb/>
            buried them in the ground with lamentations. The spot was then consecrated <lb/>
            by sacrificing a two-year old sheep, which being called "bidens," gave its <lb/>
            name to the place. An altar was also erected there, and it was not allowable <lb/>
            to tread on the spot, or to touch it, or even to look at it. When the altar <lb/>
            had fallen to decay, it might be repaired, but to enlarge its boundaries was <lb/>
            deemed sacrilege, and madness was supposed to ensue on committing such <lb/>
            an offence ; Seneca mentions a belief that wine which bad been struck by <lb/>

            poured forth instead of ruddy gore. Astounded at the ill- <lb/>
            omened rites Aruns turned pale, and sought the wrath <lb/>
            of the Gods of heaven in the torn-out entrails. The very <lb/>
            colour alarmed the prophet; for a pervading lividness <lb/>
            streaked with spots of blood the pallid vitals, tinted with <lb/>
            foul spots and gorged with congealed blood. He perceives <lb/>
            the liver reeking with corruption, and beholds the veins <lb/>
            threatening on the enemy's side3. The fibres of the pant­ <lb/>
            ing lungs lie concealed, and a narrow line separates the <lb/>
            vital parts. The heart lies still; and through gaping clefts <lb/>
            the vitals emit corrupt matter; the cauls, too, disclose <lb/>
            their retreats; and, shocking sign! that which has appeared <lb/>
            with impunity in no entrails, lo ! he sees growing upon <lb/>
            the head of the entrails the mass of another head4—a part <lb/>
            hangs weak and flabby, a part throbs and with a rapid <lb/>

            kind of ruin, 0 Gods of heaven, with what plagues do you <lb/>
            furnish your vengeance ? At the same instant the closing <lb/>
            days of many have met. If the cold star of Saturn, with its <lb/>
            evil influence in the lofty heaven, had lighted up its dusky <lb/>
            fires, Aquarius would have poured forth showers worthy of <lb/>
            Deucalion 1, and the whole earth would have been concealed <lb/>
            in the ocean spread over it. If, Phœbus, thou wast now <lb/>
            urging the fierce Nemean lion2 with thy rays, flames would <lb/>
            be making their way over the whole world, and, set on fire by <lb/>
            thy chariot, the sky would be in a blaze. Those fires pause: <lb/>
            thou, Gradivus, who dost inflame the threatening Scorpion <lb/>
            with his burning tail, and dost scorch his claws, why dost <lb/>
            thou make preparations thus mighty? For with his remote <lb/>
            setting propitious Jupiter3 is going down, and the healthful <lb/>
            star of Venus is dim, and the Cyllenian Deity4, rapid in his <lb/>

            was probably styled "Ogygian" from the circumstance of his having been <lb/>

            Deity who was the physician of the Gods. In that sense it came from the <lb/>
            Greek <unclear>αιὼν</unclear>, " healing." Similarly it afterwards became a surname of Æscu­ <lb/>
            lapius, a God who had the power of healing. It was also given to Apollo <lb/>
            and Thanatos, or Death, perhaps as being liberators of mankind from suffering <lb/>
            and sorrow. It may, however, have been applied to the two last as coming <lb/>
            from <unclear>αίειν</unclear>, " to strike," Death being supposed to strike with his dart, and <lb/>
            Apollo, as the Deity of the Sun, striking with his rays. Apollo was frequently <lb/>
            appealed to under this name, as all-powerful to avert evil. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 I see Pangœum) ver. 679. Pangæum, or Pangaeus, was a range of <lb/>

          <p>Reflections on the Prodigies, 1-15. The alarm at Rome described. The <lb/>
            complaints of the matrons, 16-42. The complaints of the men, 43-66. A. <lb/>
            long speech is spoken by an aged man in reference to the Civil Wars carried <lb/>
            on between Sulla and Marius, 67-233. Brutus repairs to Cato at night, <lb/>
            and asks his advice, 234-285. Cato answers that he shall follow Pompey, <lb/>
            and advises Brutus to do the same, 286-325. While they are conversing, <lb/>
            Marcia appears, whom, formerly his own wife, Cato had given to his friend <lb/>
            Hortensins, since whose death she has sought him again as her husband, 326 <lb/>
            -349. In the presence of Brutus they renew the nuptial vow, 350- <lb/>
            391. Pompey has in the meantime retired to Campania. The Apen­ <lb/>
            nines, with their streams, are described, 392-438. Caesar takes posses­ <lb/>
            sion of the whole of Italy. The flight of Libo, Thermus, Sulla, Varus, <lb/>
            Lentulus, and Scipio, from the cities which they hold, 439-477. Domitius <lb/>
            Ahenobarbus, by breaking down the bridge, endeavours to impede the course <lb/>
            of Cæsar at Corfinium. Cæsar crosses the river, and while he is preparing <lb/>
            to lay siege to Corfinium, the citizens deliver Domitius to him. Caesar <lb/>
            gives him his liberty against his wish; 478-525. Pompey addresses his <lb/>
            troops, and promises to lead them to battle, 526-595. He retreats to <lb/>
            Brundisium, 596-609. The situation of that place is described, 610-627. <lb/>
            Pompey sends his on to Asia to request the assistance of the eastern Kings. <lb/>
            He himself prepares to cross over to Epirus, 628-649. Cæsar follows <lb/>
            Pompey, and endeavours to cut him off from the sea, 650-679. Pompey <lb/>
            leaves Italy, 680-703. Caesar enters Brundisium, 704-736.</p>
          <p>AND now was the wrath of the Deities displayed, and the <lb/>
            universe gave manifest signs of war; foreknowing nature <lb/>
            by her monster-bearing confusion overthrew the laws and <lb/>
            the compacts of things, and proclaimed the fatality. Why, <lb/>
            ruler of Olympus, has it seemed good to thee to add this <lb/>
            care to anxious mortals, that by means of direful omens <lb/>
            they should know of misfortunes about to come ? Whether <lb/>
            it is that, when first the parent of the world, the flame re <lb/>
            ceding, set apart the shapeless realms and unformed matter, <lb/>
            he established causes to endless time, by which he rules all <lb/>
            things, binding himself as well by a law, and, with the im­ <lb/>
            movable boundaries of fate, allotted the world to endure its <lb/>
            « destined ages ; or whether it is that nothing is preordained, <lb/>
            but Chance wanders in uncertainty, and brings and brings <lb/>
            round again events, and accident rules the affairs of mortals: <lb/>
            may that be instantaneous, whatever thou dost intend; <pb n="47"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 15-34.]"/> <lb/>
            may the mind of man be blind to his future fate; to him <lb/>
            who dreads may it be allowed to hope.</p>
          <p>Therefore when they perceived at the price of how vast <lb/>
            calamity to the world the truthfulness of the Gods of heaven <lb/>
            was about to be realized, there was a general mourning1 in <lb/>
            token of woe throughout the City; clad in the plebeian garb 2 <lb/>
            all honors lay concealed; the purple accompanied no fasces. <lb/>
            Then did they withhold expression of their griefs, and great <lb/>
            anguish without a voice pervaded all. Thus at the moment <lb/>
            of death the astounded house is silent while the body is <lb/>
            lying not yet called upon by name 3, nor as yet does the mother <lb/>
            with her dishevelled locks prompt the arms of the female <lb/>
            domestics to the cruel beatings on their breasts ; but when, <lb/>
            life fled, she presses the stiffened limbs and the lifeless <lb/>
            features, and the eyes swimming in death, no longer is it <lb/>
            anguish, but now it is dread; distractedly she throws herself <lb/>
            down, and is astounded at her woes. The matron has laid <lb/>
            aside her former habit, and sorrowing throngs occupy the <lb/>
            shrines. These sprinkle the Gods with tears; these dash <lb/>
            their breasts against the hard ground, and, awe-stricken, <lb/>
            throw their torn-out hair upon the sacred threshold, and <lb/>
            with repeated bowlings strike upon the ears accustomed <lb/>
            to be addressed in prayer.</p>
          <p>And not all lay in the Temple of the Supreme Thunderer; <note type="footnote"> 1 There was a general mourning) ver. 18. " Justitium." This term <lb/>
            doubtless originally signified a cessation of judicial business, but came after­ <lb/>

            At this period the courts of law and the treasury were closed, and no am­ <lb/>

            claimed by the Senate and the magistrates in times of public alarm and <lb/>
            danger. In the lapse of time, a justitium was usually ordered as a mark <lb/>

            rities this was repeated daily for seven days, and was done for the last <lb/>
            time when the body was placed on the funeral pile, on which occasion <lb/>
            it was finally said " conclamatum est," signifying that no hope of life now <lb/>

            wanting a parent to create discontent1; one of whom, <lb/>
            tearing her bedewed cheeks, and blackened with blows, <lb/>
            upon her livid arms, exclaimed, " Now, 0 wretched matrons, <lb/>

            transaction. In Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, we <lb/>
            find the following remarks on this transaction. "Heineccius infers, from <lb/>
            the words of Plutarch, that Cato did not, according to the common belief, <lb/>
            lend his wife, but that she was divorced from him by the ceremony of sale, <lb/>
            and married to Hortensius. Heineccius quotes the case as an instance of a <lb/>
            marriage contracted by 'coemptio,' and dissolved by ' remancipatio.' But <lb/>
            it does not seem that Cato formally married her again after the death of Hor. <lb/>

            tomb, not destined to please her husband in other guise, <lb/>
            thus in sadness did she speak :­ <lb/>
            " While I had in me the strengthening blood, while strength <lb/>

          <p>These words influenced the hero, and though the times <lb/>
            were unsuited for wedlock, Fate now summoning him to <lb/>
            the war, still a solitary union pleased him, and nuptials <lb/>

            "Cæsar, most anxious for civil war, is not pleased at making his way with­ <lb/>

            the fields in hostile form." This is the translation suggested by Sulpitius, <lb/>
            Ascensius, and Farnabius, and approved of by Weise, Grotius, See. Cortius, <lb/>
            however, would render it,—" Cæsar, most anxious for civil war, is pleased at <lb/>
            not making his way, except with effusion of blood, and at not marching </note> <pb n="71"/>

            otherwise than by the shedding of blood, and that he cannot <lb/>
            lay waste the limits of Hesperia now free from an enemy, <lb/>
            and rush down upon the deserted fields, and he would not <lb/>
            lose the advantage of his march1, and would be leading on <lb/>
            force hand to hand with force. It delights him not so <lb/>
            much to enter the opening gates, as to have broken them <lb/>
            down; nor so much for the fields to be ploughed by the <lb/>

            ings, although about to yield at the first alarm of the <lb/>
            approaching warfare, still with stout ramparts strengthen <lb/>
            their walls, and surround them on every side with the deep <lb/>
            trench. Round masses of stone, too, and darts which may <lb/>
            be hurled from above against the foe, they provide upon the <lb/>

            loosened by the stroke of the Æolian trident, sends forth <lb/>
            the eastern gales over the swelling waves, although swept <lb/>
            by this fresh one, the billows still retain the effects of the <lb/>

            translation, for Weise very justly asks, where were the persons to defend the <lb/>
            fields ? It is notorious, on the other band, that the only partizans of Pompey <lb/>
            and the Senate were shut up in the fortified towns of Italy. Besides, the <lb/>
            first mode of translation would tend to blacken the character of Caesar, as <lb/>
            making him(though contrary to the real fact), gratuitously a lover of bloodshed, <lb/>
            which is quite consistent with the design of Lucan throughout the work. <lb/>
            This is the more clear, as we find that the march of Cæsar through the <lb/>
            boundaries of Italy was unimpeded, for Pompey bad withdrawn his forces <lb/>
            to the south, and awaited him in Campania. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Would not lose the advantage of his march) ver. 442. "Non perdat iter." <lb/>

            he was obliged by his soldiers to surrender Corfinium; on which, offended at <lb/>

            sent five cohorts to break down the bridge of the river, which was three <lb/>

            hurled from the walls of the besieged town on the assailants. The roof <lb/>
            and sides were formed of wicker-work, while planks, covered with wet cloth <lb/>
            or raw hides, also supported the sides. They were on light frames, and were <lb/>
            either carried or wheeled by the soldiers to the walls. They received their <lb/>

            received an answer that Pompey would not encounter the risk of relieving <lb/>
            him, as he had retreated to Corfinium without his own advice or consent, and <lb/>
            that if any opportunity should offer, he, Domitius, was to come to Pompey <lb/>
            with his whole force. On this; Domitius determined on escaping from the <lb/>
            town, imparting his design to a few of his friends. His intentions becoming <lb/>
            suspected, his troops mutinied, and, seizing him, sent dispatches to Cæsar, to <lb/>

          <p>He thus speaks, and orders the chains to be loosened on <lb/>

            how much more becomingly might Fortune have spared a <lb/>
            Roman's shame; to whom it is the very greatest of punish­ <lb/>

            his country and Magnus for his leader, and the whole of the <lb/>
            Senate. He, undismayed, checks his heavy wrath, and to <lb/>
            himself he says, “ And wilt thou repair, degenerate man, to <lb/>

          <p>To no purpose is this labour bestowed on the immense <lb/>
            undertaking; the voracious sea sucks in all the rocks, and <lb/>
            mingles the mountains with its sands; just as, if the lofty <lb/>
            Eryx 2 were thrown down into the midst of the waves of <lb/>
            the Ægean Sea, still no rocky heights would tower above <lb/>
            the main; or if Gaurus3, his pinnacles rooted up, were to <lb/>
            fall down to the very depths of stagnant Avernus. There­ <lb/>
            fore, when in the shoals no mass retained its weight, then <lb/>
            it pleased him, the woods cut down, to connect rafts, and <lb/>

            immense chains.</p>
          <p>Fame relates that exulting Xerxes constructed4 such a <note type="footnote"> 1 Dams out the waves) ver. 662. This passage is best explained by a por­ <lb/>
            tion of what Cæsar himself has written on the subject. He states that he <lb/>
            was afraid that if Pompey remained at Brundisium he might command <lb/>
            the whole Adriatic Sea, with the extremity of Italy and the coast of Greece, <lb/>
            and be able to conduct the war on either side of it, and, fearing that he would <lb/>
            not relinquish Italy, he determined to deprive him of his means of communi­ <lb/>
            cation. For that purpose (Civil War, B. i. c. 25), “ where the month of <lb/>
            the port was narrowest, he threw up a mole of earth on either side, because <lb/>
            in these places the sea was shallow. Having gone out so far that the mole <lb/>
            could not be continued into deep water, he fixed double floats, thirty feet on <lb/>
            either side, before the mole.. These he fastened with four anchors at the four <lb/>
            corners, that they might not be carried away by the waves. Having com­ <lb/>
            pleted and secured them, he then joined to them other floats of equal size. <lb/>
            These he covered over with earth and mould, that he might not be prevented <lb/>
            from access to them to defend them, and on the front and both sides he pro­ <lb/>
            tected them with a parapet of wicker-work: and on every fourth one he <lb/>
            raised a turret two stories high, to secure them the better from being attacked <lb/>
            by shipping and set on fire." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As, if the lofty Eryx) ver. 666. Eryx was a lofty mountain of Sicily, <lb/>

            not fearing Eurus and Zephyrus; at the time when he would <lb/>

            fall of the woods; then with many a mound the work <lb/>
            rises apace, and the tall towers vibrate over the seas.</p>
          <p>Pompey, seeing the inlets of the deep choked up with land <lb/>
            newly-formed, vexed his mind with carking cares how to open <lb/>
            the sea, and to spread the warfare over the main. Full oft, <lb/>
            filled by the southern gales, and dragged by extended cables 3 <lb/>
            through the obstructions of the sea themselves, ships dashed <lb/>
            down into the salt tide the summits of the mass, and <lb/>
            made room for the barks4 to enter; the balista, too, hurled <lb/>
            by stalwart arms amid the shades of night, hurled torches <lb/>
            cleft into many parts. When at length the occasion <lb/>
            suited for a stolen flight, he first ordered his followers that <lb/>

            commanded the Straits to be scourged, and a set of fetters to be cast therein. <lb/>

            Pompey fitted out large merchant ships, which he found in the harbour of <lb/>
            Brundisium ; on them he erected turrets three stories high, and, having far­ <lb/>
            nished them with several engines and all sorts of weapons, drove them <lb/>
            amongst Caesar's works, to break through the floats and interrupt the works; <lb/>
            thus there occurred skirmishes every day with slings, arrows, and other <lb/>
            weapons. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Or clarion divide) ver. 689. The “buccina” was properly a trumpet <lb/>

          <p>Now had the Virgin, towards her close1, begun to precede <lb/>
            the claws of the Scorpion that were to bring on Phœbus, when <lb/>
            in silence the ships wereunmoored. No anchor arouses <lb/>
            their voices2 while from the dense sands its hook is being <lb/>
            dragged. While the sailyards are being set to the wind, and <lb/>
            while the lofty pine-tree mast is being raised, the anxious <lb/>
            masters of the fleet are silent; and the sailors, hanging <lb/>
            by the ropes, unfurl the tightened sails, nor shake the <lb/>
            stout shrouds, lest the air should breathe a whisper. <lb/>
            The chieftain, too, in his aspirations, Fortune, entreats <lb/>
            thee, that Italy, which thou dost forbid him to re­ <lb/>
            tain, it may be at least allowed him to quit. Hardly <lb/>
            do the Fates permit it; for with a loud noise, impelled <lb/>
            by beaks of ships, the sea re-echoes, the waters dash, <lb/>
            and the billows with the tracks of so many ships there <lb/>

            the more effectually to retard Cæsar's attack, lest his soldiers should force <lb/>
            their way into the town at the moment of his departure, he stopped up the <lb/>
            gates, built walls across the streets and avenues, sunk trenches across the <lb/>
            ways, and fixed on them palisadoes and sharp stakes which he made level <lb/>
            with the ground by means of hurdles and clay. But he barricaded with <lb/>
            large beams, fastened in the ground and sharpened at the ends, two passages <lb/>
            and roads without the walls, which led to the port. After making these <lb/>

          <p>A narrow pass let the ships out to sea, more limited <lb/>
            than the Eubœan tide where it beats upon Chalcis'. Here <lb/>
            stuck fast two ships, and received the grappling-irons pre­ <lb/>
            pared for the fleet; and the warfare being thus dragged to <lb/>
            the shore2, here, for the first time, did Nereus grow red with <lb/>
            the blood of citizens. The rest of the fleet departs, de­ <lb/>
            spoiled of the two last ships; just as, when the bark from <lb/>
            Pagasæ3 sought the waves of Phasis, the earth shot forth <lb/>
            the Cyanean rocks4 into the deep; less by its stern torn off <note type="footnote"> posed here and there, on the walls and turrets, some light-armed veterans, <lb/>
            archers, and slingers. These he designed to call off by a certain signal, when <lb/>
            all the soldiers were embarked, and left galleys for them in a secure place. <lb/>
            The people of Brundisium, irritated by the insolence of Pompey's soldiers, <lb/>
            and the insults received from Pompey himself, were in favour of Cæsar's <lb/>
            party. Therefore, as soon as they were aware of Pompey'a departure, whilst <lb/>
            his men were running up and down, and busied about their voyage, they <lb/>
            made signs from the tops of the houses; Cæsar, being apprised of the design <lb/>
            by them, ordered scaling-ladders to be got ready and his men to take arms, <lb/>
            that he might not lose any opportunity of coming to an action. Pompey <lb/>
            weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers who had been posted on the wall <lb/>

          <p>While Pompey is crossing to Greece, the ghost of Julia appears to him in a <lb/>
            dream, and predicts the devastating nature of the war, 1-35. Pompey <lb/>
            arrives in Epirus, 36-45. Caesar instructs Curio to procure corn in Sicily, <lb/>
            46-70. He then marches to Rome, 76-97. The alarm at Rome de­ <lb/>

            resists the spoilers of the public treasury, 98-133. Cæsar threatens <lb/>
            him, 134-140. Cotta advises Metellus to yield, 141-152. The Temple <lb/>
            is opened, and the treasure is carried off, 153-168. In the meantime <lb/>
            Pompey collects forces in Greece and Asia, which are enumerated, 169- <lb/>
            297. Caesar, on his way to Spain, repairs to Massilia, which has remained <lb/>
            faithful to Pompey, 298-303. The people of Massilia send deputies to <lb/>
            him, deprecating civil war, 304-357. Cæsar besieges Massilia, 358-374. <lb/>
            The works are described, 374-398. Caesar commands a sacred grove to <lb/>
            be cut down, and forces the soldiers, though reluctant, to do so, 399-452. <lb/>
            Departing for Spain, he entrusts the siege to Trebonius, by whom <lb/>
            it is continued, 453-496. The Massilians sally -forth by night and <lb/>
            repulse the enemy, 497-508. The attack is now carried on by sea. <lb/>
            Brutus arrives with his fleet, 509-537. The sea-fight is described, 538- <lb/>
            751. The Massilians are vanquished, and Brutus is victorious, 752-762.</p>

            recovered Sicily, immediately to transport his army to Africa." The object of <lb/>
            Caesar was, as Lucan states, to procure supplies of corn from Sardinia and <lb/>
            Sicily, two of the great granaries of Rome. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Made the midland) ver. 61. Has made that which was the middle of a </note> <pb n="92"/>

            There, is a vast conflict of the main, and the waves are <lb/>
            ever struggling, that the mountains, burst asunder, may <lb/>
            not reunite their utmost verges. The war, too1, is extended <lb/>
            even to the Sardinian coasts. Each island is famous for its <lb/>
            corn-bearing fields ; nor more do any lands fill Hesperia with <lb/>
            harvests brought from afar, nor to a greater extent supply <lb/>
            the Roman granaries. Hardly in fertility of soil does it <lb/>

          <p>When these tilings had been provided for by the chief­ <lb/>
            tain, then, victorious, he repaired to the abodes of his <lb/>
            country, not bringing with him bands of armed men, <lb/>
            but having the aspect of peace. Oh! if he had re­ <lb/>

            North only subdued, what a long line of exploits might <lb/>
            be have paraded before him in the lengthened procession <lb/>
            of triumph a, what representations of the warfare! How <lb/>
            might he have placed chains upon the Rhine and upon <lb/>
            the ocean! How high-spirited Gaul would have followed <lb/>
            his lofty chariot, and mingled with the yellow-haired <lb/>
            Britons! Alas! by conquering still more what a triumph <lb/>
            was it4 that he lost! Not with joyous crowds did the <lb/>
            cities see him as he went along, but silent they beheld <lb/>
            him with alarm. Nowhere was there the multitude coming <lb/>
            forth to meet the chieftain. Still, he rejoiced that he was <lb/>

            said on this occasion. He excused the war which he had undertaken as <lb/>
            he was compelled in his own defence to protect himself against the malice <lb/>
            and envy of a few, and at the same time requested that they would send <lb/>
            messengers to Pompey and the Consuls to propose a treaty for adjusting <lb/>
            the present differences. This proposition of Caesar is suppressed by Lucan, <lb/>
            who throughout endeavours to place Cæsar's conduct in the most invidious <lb/>
            light. Cæsar tells us, c. 33, " The Senate approved of sending deputies, but <lb/>
            none could be found fit to execute the commission; for every person by reason <lb/>
            of his own private fears declined the office. For Pompey, on leaving the <lb/>
            city, had declared in the open Senate, that he would hold in the same degree <lb/>
            of estimation those who stayed in Rome and those in Cæsar's camp. Thus <lb/>
            three days were wasted in disputes and excuses. Besides, Lucius Metellus, <lb/>
            one of the Tribunes, was suborned by Cæsar's enemies, to prevent this, and <lb/>

            money especially deposited as a fund to defray the expenses of any war that <lb/>
            might arise from the Gauls invading the Roman territory. Cæsar laid hands <lb/>
            on this, alleging that as he had conquered the Gaul! there was no longer any <lb/>
            use for it. Metellus attempted to prevent him, but he drew his sword in an <lb/>

            common with your people, whatever age is comprehended <lb/>
            in the Latian annals, that same bears witness. And now, if <lb/>
            in an unknown world thou art seeking any triumphs, receive <lb/>
            the right hands that are pledged to foreign warfare. But if, <lb/>
            discordant, you are preparing a deadly strife, if direful battles, <lb/>
            to civil arms we give our tears and our dissent. By our <lb/>
            hands let no accursed wounds be meddled with. If to the <lb/>
            inhabitants of heaven fury had given arms, or if the earth- <lb/>

            Thunderer reigns in heaven. Besides, nations innumerable <lb/>
            are meeting together on every side, nor does the slothful <lb/>
            world so shudder at the contact of wickedness that the civil <lb/>
            war stands in need of coerced swords.</p>

            Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom he bad lately released, had been ordered to <lb/>
            seize Massilia, he hastened thither from Rome. “ Caesar sent for fifteen of <lb/>

            mencing there, he remonstrated to the effect that they ought to follow the <lb/>
            precedent set by all Italy, rather than submit to the will of any one man; <lb/>
            and made use of such other arguments as he thought would tend to bring <lb/>
            them back to reason. The deputies reported this speech to their countrymen, <lb/>

          <p>Thus does the Grecian youth make an end; when, now <lb/>
            betrayed by his agitated features, the anger of the chieftain <lb/>
            at length in a loud voice testifies his sorrow:—</p>
          <p>" Vainly does assurance of my haste encourage you Greeks. <lb/>
            Even though we should be speeding onward to the furthest <lb/>
            regions of the west, still there is time to raze Massilia. Rejoice, <lb/>
            ye cohorts; by the favour of the Fates a war is presented <lb/>
            before you. As the wind loses its strength unless the dense <lb/>
            woods meet it with their oaks, being dissipated in empty <lb/>
            space ; so it is harmful to me that foes should be wanting; <lb/>
            and we think it an injury to our arms, unless those who <lb/>
            could be conquered rebel. But if I go alone, degenerate, <lb/>
            with arms laid aside, then are their dwellings open to me. <lb/>
            Now, not so much to shut me out, but to inclose me, do they <lb/>
            wish. But yet they would keep afar the direful contagion <lb/>

          <p>After he has thus spoken, he turns his march towards2 <lb/>

            assigned them a part of his conquests in Gaul, and had augmented their <lb/>

            going forward, Domitius arrived at Massilia with his fleet, and was received <lb/>
            into the city, and made governor of it. The chief management of the war <lb/>
            was entrusted to him. At his command they sent the fleet to all parts; <lb/>
            they seized all the merchantmen they could meet with, and carried them <lb/>
            into the harbour. They applied the sails, timber, and rigging with which <lb/>

            B. i. c. 37, " Provoked at such ill treatment, Cæsar led three legions against <lb/>

            and to build twelve ships at Arelas, which, being completed and rigged in <lb/>

            mound of earth rising aloft, its top widening, spreads out <lb/>
            a little plain; this rock seems to the chieftain fitted to be <lb/>
            surrounded with a long fortification, and very well suited for <lb/>
            a safe encampment. The nearest part of the city rises with <lb/>
            a high citadel, equal in height to the mound, and fields <lb/>
            are situate in the valley between. Then did a thing please <lb/>
            him, to be brought about with immense labour, to join the <lb/>
            separated elevations by a vast mound. But first, that he <lb/>
            might inclose the entire city, where it is surrounded by the <lb/>
            earth, Cæsar drew a long work from the camp to the sea, <lb/>
            and, encircling the springs and the pastures of the plain <lb/>
            with a fosse, with turf and unmixed earth he raised out­ <lb/>
            works that elevated their numerous towers.</p>
          <p>Well worthy now to be remembered did this befall the <lb/>
            Grecian city, and an eternal honor, that, not provoked at <lb/>
            first 1, nor yet prostrated by very fear, it stayed the headlong <lb/>
            course of a war that raged on every side, and all others being <lb/>
            seized instantaneously by Cæsar, it alone was conquered with <lb/>
            delay. How much is it that his destinies are stayed, and <lb/>

          <p>Then far and wide do all the forests fall, and the woods <lb/>

            it stood most dense in growth amid the bared mountains. <lb/>
            But the valiant bands trembled, and, moved by the venerable <lb/>
            sanctity of the place, they believed that if they should touch <lb/>

            with the iron to cut down the towering oak, the iron being <lb/>

            weighed. Down fall the ashes, the knotty holm-oak is hurled <lb/>
            down; the wood of Dodona, too, and the alder more suited <lb/>

            Looking on, the nations of the Gauls lament, but the youth <lb/>
            shut up within the walls exult. For who can suppose that <lb/>
            the Gods are insulted with impunity? Fortune spares many <lb/>
            that are guilty; and only with the wretched can the Deities <lb/>
            be angered. And when enough of the grove is cut down, <lb/>

            much more likely that it signifies cross beams studded with iron, which were <lb/>
            used in constructing the agger which they were building round the city. <lb/>
            This operation is described by Caesar in the Civil War, B. ii. c. 15, and in <lb/>

            these are fastened with no wood to the earth, but moved <lb/>
            along a lengthened space, the cause lying concealed. When <lb/>
            so great a mass was tottering, the youth supposed that the <lb/>
            wind seeking to burst forth had shaken the empty recesses <lb/>
            of the earth, and wondered that their walls were standing <lb/>
            Thence did the darts fall upon the lofty citadel of the city. <lb/>
            But a greater power was there in the Grecian weapons <lb/>
            against the Roman bodies. For the lance, not hurled by <lb/>
            arms alone, but discharged by the tightened whirlwind force <lb/>
            of the balista, did not, content to pass through but one <lb/>
            side, cease in its course; but, opening a way through both <lb/>
            arms and through bones, death left behind, it flies on: after <lb/>
            the wound a career still remains for the weapon.</p>
          <p>But as often as a stone is hurled by the vast impulse of <lb/>
            the blow, just as a rock, which old age, aided by the power <lb/>
            of the winds, has separated from the height of the mountain, <lb/>
            rushing onwards it bears down everything; and not only <lb/>
            deprives of life the bodies it has dashed against, but scatters <lb/>
            in every direction whole limbs together with the blood. But <lb/>
            when, sheltered beneath the stout tortoise1, valour approaches <lb/>
            the hostile walls, and the foremost bear arms connected with <lb/>
            the arms of those behind, and the uplifted shield protects the <lb/>
            helmet, those which, before hurled from the distant retreats, <lb/>
            proved destructive, now fall behind their backs; nor is it <lb/>
            now an easy task to the Greeks to direct their charges, or to <lb/>
            change the level of their engines of war adapted for hurling <lb/>
            weapons to a distance; but, content with heavy masses alone, <lb/>

            endeavours to loosen the texture of the solid wall, and to <lb/>
            strike away one from the stones placed above. But struck <lb/>
            by flames from above and fragments of vast masses, and <lb/>
            many a stake, and the blows of oaks hardened by fire, the <lb/>

          <p>It was at first the greatest wish of the Greeks that their <lb/>
            walls might stand. Now, still further, they prepare to make <lb/>
            a charge with their troops; and, attacking by night, they <lb/>
            conceal under their arms blazing torches, and the bold <lb/>

            black smoke; it consumes not only the wood but huge <lb/>

            . move on, and those which dip in the seas still more pine­ <lb/>

            centre, in form of a crescent, the Libumian barks 1, content <lb/>
            to increase with two ranks of oars, fall back. But the Præ­ <lb/>
            tori an ship of Brutus more lofty than all is impelled by six <lb/>
            tiers of oars, and carries a tower along the deep, and seeks <lb/>

          <p>Where there is just so much sea intervening that either <lb/>
            fleet could cross over to the other with the oars once pulled. <lb/>
            innumerable voices are mingled in the vast expanse; and <lb/>
            the sound of the oars is drowned in the clamour, nor can <lb/>
            any trumpets be heard. Then they skim along the azure <lb/>
            main, and stretch along the benches, and strike their <lb/>
            breasts with the oars. When first beaks meeting beaks <lb/>
            send forth a sound, the ships run astern, and the hurled <lb/>
            darts as they fall fill the air and the vacant deep. And. <lb/>
            now, the prows separated, the wings extend, and, the fleet. <lb/>
            sundered, the opposing ships are received. Just as, so oft <lb/>
            as the tide struggles against the Zephyrs and the eastern <lb/>
            gales, in this direction run the waves, in that the sea; so, <lb/>
            when the ships in the ploughed-up tide describe their vary­ <lb/>
            ing tracks, the sea which the one fleet impels onwards with <lb/>
            its oars, the other beats back.</p>
          <p>But the pine-tree ships of the Greeks were skilful both to. <lb/>
            challenge to the battle and to resort to flight, and to change <lb/>
            their course with no wide sweep, and with no tardiness to obey <lb/>
            the turning helm. But the Roman ship was more sure in <lb/>
            affording a keel firmly laid, and convenience to the warriors <lb/>
            equal to the dryland. Then said Brutus to the pilot sitting <lb/>

            by the Romans at the battle of Actium. The “ Liburnæ ”here mentioned, <lb/>
            from the words “ ordine gemino," appear to have had but two ranks of oars-</note> <pb n="119"/>

          <p>He obeyed, and sidelong he laid the alder barks before <lb/>
            the foe. Then, whatever ship tried the oaken sides of <lb/>
            that of Brutus, conquered by her own blow, captured, she <lb/>
            stuck fast1 to the one she had struck. But others both <lb/>

            themselves on by the oars:! ; on the covered sea the warfare <lb/>
            stood fixed to the same spot.</p>
          <p>Now no longer are the darts hurled from the shaken arms, <lb/>
            nor do the wounds fall from afar by means of the hurled <lb/>
            weapons; and hand meets hand. In a naval fight the sword <lb/>
            effects the most. Each one stands upon the bulwark of <lb/>
            his own ship, facing full the blows of the enemy; and none <lb/>
            fall slain in their own vessels. The deep blood foams in <lb/>
            the waves, and the tide is thickened with clotted gore. The <lb/>
            ships, too, which the chains of iron thrown on board are <lb/>
            dragging, the same do the dead bodies clogged together <lb/>
            hinder from being united. Some, half-dead, fall into the <lb/>
            vast deep, and drink of the sea mingled with their own <lb/>
            blood. Some, adhering to life struggling with slowly-coming <lb/>
            death, perish in the sudden wreck of the dismantled ships. <lb/>
            Javelins, missing their aim, accomplish their slaughter in <lb/>
            the sea, and whatever weapon falls, with its weight used to <lb/>
            no purpose, finds a wound on being received in the midst of <lb/>

            was borrowed from the tail of the fish. The " aplustre" rising behind the <lb/>

            uncertain from which wound to flow, until the plenteous <lb/>
            gore at the same time expels both the spears, and rends <lb/>
            asunder his life, and scatters death in the wounds.</p>
          <p>Hither also the right hand of hapless Telon directed his <lb/>
            ship, than which no hand more aptly, when the sea was <lb/>
            boisterous, did the barks obey; nor was the morrow's <lb/>

            trim the sails to the coming winds. He with the beak had <lb/>
            broken the ribs of a Latian bark; but quivering javelins <lb/>
            entered the middle of his breast, and the right hand of the <lb/>
            dying pilot turned away the ship. While Gyareus attempted <lb/>
            to leap on board the friendly bark, he received the iron <lb/>
            driven through his suspended entrails, and pinned to the <lb/>

          <p>Two twin brothers are standing, the glory of their fruitful <lb/>
            mother, whom the same womb bore to differing fates. Cruel <lb/>

            cause for everlasting tears. He always renews their grief, <lb/>

            these, the one, the oars of two ships being mingled sideways, <lb/>
            comb-like indented, dares from a Grecian stern to lay hands <lb/>
            upon1 a Roman bark, but from above a heavy blow lops it <lb/>
            off; still, however, with the effort with which it has grasped <lb/>
            it keeps hold, and as it dies, holding fast with tightened <lb/>
            nerve, it stiffens. By his mischance his valour waxes <lb/>
            stronger; mutilated, more high-spirited wrath has he, and <note type="footnote"> I To lay hands upon) ver. 610. A similar story to this is told of Cynae­ <lb/>
            gyrus, the brother of the poet Æschylus, who, when the Persians were en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to escape by sea, seized one of their ships with his right hand, <lb/>
            which was cut off. Justin magnifies the story, and states that he held with <lb/>
            both hands, which were successively cut off, and then held on with his teeth. <lb/>
            Lucan, with his usual distortion of facts at all favourable to Cæsar, here <lb/>
            attributes to the Massilians a valorous exploit which was, in reality, per­ <lb/>
            formed by a soldier of Cæsar's army. Suetonius says that," Acilius, a soldier <lb/>
            of Caesar, in the naval battle at Massilia, having seized with his right hand <lb/>
            the ship of the enemy, and it being cut off, imitating the memorable example <lb/>
            of Cynægyrus among the Greeks, leaped on board the ship and drove all be­ <lb/>

            circumstance. </note> <pb n="121"/>

            he renews the combat with valorous left hand, and about to <lb/>
            tear away his right hand he stretches out over the waves. <lb/>
            This hand, too, is cut off with the entire arm. Now de­ <lb/>
            prived of shield and weapons, he is not stowed away in the <lb/>
            bottom of the ship, but, exposed and covering his brother's <lb/>
            arms with his naked breast, pierced by many a spear, he <lb/>
            still persists; and weapons that were to have fallen to the de­ <lb/>
            struction of many of his own friends he receives with a death <lb/>
            that he has now earned. Then he summons his life, fleeting <lb/>
            with many a wound, into his wearied limbs, and nerves his <lb/>
            members with all the blood that is remaining, and, his <lb/>
            members failing in strength, he leaps on board the hostile <lb/>
            bark, destined to injure it by his weight alone.</p>
          <p>The ship, heaped up with the slaughter of the men, and <lb/>
            filled with much blood, received numerous blows on its <lb/>
            slanting sides. But after, its ribs broken, it let in the sea <lb/>
            being filled to the top of the hatches, it descended intothe <lb/>
            waves, sucking in the neighbouring waters with a whirling <lb/>
            eddy. Cleft asunder by the sunk ship, the waves divided, and <lb/>
            in the place of the bark the sea closed up. Many wondrous <lb/>
            instances of various fates besides did that day afford upon <lb/>
            the main.</p>
          <p>While a grappling-iron was fastening its grasping hooks <lb/>
            upon a ship, it fixed on Lycidas. He would have been <lb/>
            sunk in the deep; but his friends hindered it and held <lb/>
            fast his suspended thighs. Tom away he is rent in two ; <lb/>
            nor, as though from a wound, does his blood slowly flow; <lb/>
            the veins torn asunder 1, on every side it falls; and the down­ <lb/>
            ward flow of his life's blood passing into his rent limbs is <lb/>
            intercepted by the waters. The life of no one slain is parted <lb/>

            himself. Many of the learned, however, do not believe this story, while <lb/>

          <p>While, too eager for fight, the company of one ship is <lb/>
            pressing straight against the side, and leaves the deck empty <lb/>
            where it is free from the enemy, the vessel, overturned by the <lb/>
            accumulated weight, within its hollow hull incloses both sea <lb/>
            and sailors; nor is it allowed them to throw out their arms <lb/>
            in the vast deep, but they perish in the inclosed waves.</p>
          <p>Then was a remarkable kind of dreadful death beheld, <lb/>
            when by chance ships of opposite sides transfixed with their <lb/>
            beaks a youth as he swam. His breast divided in the middle <lb/>
            at such mighty blows; nor with the ground bones were the <lb/>
            limbs able to prevent the brazen beaks from re-echoing. <lb/>
            His middle burst asunder, through his mouth the blood, <lb/>
            mingled with the entrails, spouted forth corrupt matter. After <lb/>
            they backed the ships with the oars, and the beaks with­ <lb/>
            drew, the body, with the pierced breast, being cast into the <lb/>
            sea admitted the water into the wounds.</p>
          <p>The greatest part of a crew being shipwrecked, strug­ <lb/>
            gling against death with expanded arms, rushed to receive <lb/>
            the aid of a friendly ship; but when they caught hold of <lb/>
            the woodwork on high with forbidden arms, and the bark, <lb/>
            likely to perish, swayed to and fro from the multitude <lb/>
            received, the impious crew from above struck at the middle <lb/>
            of their arms with the sword: leaving their arms hanging <lb/>
            from the Grecian ship, they were slain by the hands of their <lb/>
            own side; no longer did the waves support on the surface <lb/>
            of the sea the heavy trunks.</p>
          <p>And now, all the soldiers stripped bare, the weapons being <lb/>
            expended, fury finds arms; one hurls an oar at the foe; but <lb/>
            others whirl round with stout arms the wrenched-up flag- <lb/>
            staff 1, and the benches torn away, the rowers being driven <lb/>

            The bodies slain they catch as they are falling overboard, <lb/>
            and spoil the carcases of the weapons. Many, wanting darts, <lb/>

          <p>Yet upon this ocean nothing causes more destruction <lb/>
            than the antagonist opposed to the sea. For fire fixed to <lb/>
            unctuous torches I, and alive, beneath a covering of sulphur, <lb/>
            is spread about; but the ships ready to afford a nutriment,, <lb/>
            now with pitch, now with melted wax, spread the confla­ <lb/>
            gration. Nor do the waves conquer the flames; and, the <lb/>
            barks now scattered over the sea, the fierce fire claims the <lb/>
            fragments for itself. This one takes to the waves, that <lb/>
            in the sea he may extinguish the flames; these, that they <lb/>
            may not be drowned, cling to. the burning spars. Amid <lb/>
            a thousand forms of death, that single end is an object of <lb/>
            dread, by which they have begun to perish. Nor is their <lb/>
            valour idle in shipwreck. They collect darts thrown up by <lb/>
            the sea, and supply them to the ships, and with failing <lb/>
            efforts ply their erring hands through the waves. Now <lb/>
            if but small the supply of weapons that is afforded, they <lb/>
            make use of the sea. Fierce enemy clutches hold of enemy, <lb/>
            and they delight to sink with arms entwined, and to die <lb/>
            drowning the foe.</p>
          <p>In that mode of fighting there was one Phocæan skilled <lb/>
            at keeping his breath beneath the waves, and examining <lb/>
            in the sea if anything had been, sunk in the sands, and at <lb/>
            wrenching up the tooth of the fluke too firmly fixed, as <lb/>
            often as the anchor had proved insensible to the tightened <lb/>
            rope. He took the enemy quite down when grappled with, <lb/>
            and then, victorious, returned to the surface of the water; <lb/>
            but, while he believed that he was rising amid the vacant <lb/>
            waves, he met with the ships, and at last remained for <lb/>
            good beneath the sea. Some threw their arms around the <lb/>
            hostile oars, and withheld the flight of the ships. Not to <lb/>
            throw away their deaths was the greatest care; many a one, <lb/>
            dying, applied his wounds to the stern, and warded off the <lb/>
            blows from the beaks.</p>

            the hurled bullet at Tyrrhenus as he stood on the lofty ele­ <lb/>
            vation of the prow, shattered his hollow temples with the <lb/>
            solid lead. Expelled from their sockets, after the blood had <lb/>
            burst all the ligaments, the eyes started forth; his sight <lb/>
            destroyed, he stood amazed, and thought that this was the <lb/>
            darkness of death; but after he found that strength existed <lb/>
            in his limbs, he said: “You, 0 companions, just as you are <lb/>
            wont to direct the missiles, place me also straight in a direc­ <lb/>
            tion for hurling darts. Employ, Tyrrhenus, what remains <lb/>
            of life in all the chances of war. This carcase, when dead, <lb/>
            in a great degree is of considerable use to the warriors; <lb/>
            in the place of one living shalt thou be struck by the blow." <lb/>
            Thus having said, with aimless hand he hurled the dart <lb/>
            against the foe, but still not without effect.</p>

            where the midriff slopes down to the loins, and falling down <lb/>
            he aided the weapon with his own weight. Now stood the <lb/>
            unhappy sire of Argus in the opposite part of the conquered <lb/>
            ship; in the days of his youth he would not have yielded to <lb/>
            any one in Phocæan arms: conquered by age his strength <lb/>
            had decayed, and, worn out with old age, he was a model of <lb/>
            valour, not a soldier. He, seeing the death, often stumbling, <lb/>
            being an aged man, came between the benches of the long <lb/>
            ship to the stern, and found the panting limbs. No tears fell <lb/>
            from his cheeks, lie did not beat his breast, but grew stiff <lb/>
            all over his body with distended hands. Night came on, and <lb/>
            dense shades spread over his eyes, and as he looked upon him <lb/>
            he ceased to recognize the wretched Argus. He sinking, on <lb/>
            seeing his father, raised his head and his now languid neck; <lb/>
            no voice issued from his loosened jaws; only with his silent <lb/>
            features did he ask a kiss and invite his father's right hand <lb/>
            to close his eyes. When the old man was relieved from his <lb/>
            torpor, and his grief, caused by the bloodshed, began to gain <lb/>
            strength, “I will not," he exclaimed, ”lose the time granted <lb/>
            by the cruel Gods, and I will pierce my aged throat. Argus, <lb/>
            grant pardon to thy wretched parent, that I have fled from <lb/>
            thy embrace, thy last kisses. The warm blood has not yet <lb/>
            quitted thy wounds, and but half-dead thou dost lie, and <lb/>
            mayst still be the survivor."</p>
          <p>Thus having said, although he had stained the hilt of the <lb/>
            sword driven through his entrails, still, with a headlong leap, <pb n="125"/>

            he descended beneath the deep waves. His life hastening <lb/>
            to precede the end of his son he did not entrust to but one <lb/>
            form of death.</p>
          <p>Now do the fates of the chieftains take a turn, nor is the <lb/>
            event of the warfare any longer doubtful: of the Grecian <lb/>

            was there in the city! What lamentations of matrons <lb/>

            disfigured by the waves, embracing the dead body of a <lb/>
            Roman, believe them to be the features of her husband; and, <lb/>

          <p>In the meantime Cæsar arrives in Spain, where Afranius and Petreius are <lb/>
            in command of Pompey's forces, consisting of Romans and Spaniards, 1-10. <lb/>
            A battle is fought at llerda, 11-47. By reason of the rains in the spring <lb/>
            an inundation ensues, and Cæsar's camp is overflowed, 48-90. A famine <lb/>
            prevails, 91-97. And then a flood, 98 - 120. When the waters subside <lb/>
            Petreius departs from Ilerda, 121-147. Cæsar comes up with him, and <lb/>
            a battle is fought, 148-156. Caesar commands the flying enemy to be <lb/>
            intercepted, 157-166. Both sides pitch their camps. The fellow-citizens <lb/>
            recognize each other, and interchange courtesies, 167-194. But Petreius <lb/>
            puts an end to this good feeling, and calls his own men to arms, 195-211. <lb/>
            He then harangues his troops, 212-235. The warfare is resumed, 236-253. <lb/>
            The Pompeian troops fly towards Ilerda, 254-263. Cæsar shuts them <lb/>
            out from a supply of water, 264-266. The sufferings of the Pompeians <lb/>
            are described, 267-336. Afranius sues for peace, 337-362. Which Cæsar <lb/>
            grants to the enemy, 363-401. In the meantime, Antony, the lieutenant <lb/>
            of Caesar, is besieged by the adherents of Pompey on the shores of the <lb/>
            Adriatic, and his troops are suffering from famine, 402-414. He then <lb/>
            attempts to escape by sea, 415-432. Loose chains are placed by the <lb/>
            enemy beneath the waves, which intercept the flight of one of Antony's <lb/>
            rafts, 433-464. Vulteius, the commander of the raft, exhorts his men to <lb/>
            slay each other rather than fall into the hands of the enemy, 465-520. <lb/>

            more intelligible by a reference to the narrative of Cæsar, in his Civil War, <lb/>
            B. i. c. 41, 2: “When Cæsar perceived that Afranius declined coming to an <lb/>
            engagement, he resolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's dis­ <lb/>
            tance from the very foot of the mountain ; and that his soldiers, whilst en. <lb/>
            gaged in their works, might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the <lb/>
            enemy, or disturbed in their work, he ordered them not to fortify it with a <lb/>
            wall, which must rise high and be seen at a distance, but to draw on the front <lb/>
            opposite the enemy a trench fifteen feet broad. The first and second lines <lb/>
            continued under arms, as was at first appointed. Behind them the third <lb/>
            line was carrying on the work without being seen; so that the whole was <lb/>
            completed before Afranius discovered that the camp was being fortified. <lb/>
            In the evening Cæsar drew his legions within this trench, and rested them <lb/>
            under arms the next night. The day following he kept his whole army <lb/>
            within it, and as it was necessary to bring materials from a considerable <lb/>
            distance, he for the present pursued the same plan in his work; and to <lb/>
            each legion, one after the other, he assigned one side of the camp to fortify, <lb/>
            and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut. He kept the rest <lb/>
            of the legions under arms to oppose the enemy." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 At early dawn he commanded) ver. 32. This attack is thus described in <lb/>
            the Civil War, B. i. c. 43 :—" Between the town of Ilerda and the next <lb/>
            hill, on which Afranius and Petreius were encamped, there was a plain <lb/>
            about three hundred paces broad, and near the middle of it an eminence <lb/>
            somewhat raised above the level. Cæsar hoped that if he could gain pos­ <lb/>
            session of this and fortify it he should be able to cut off the enemy from <lb/>
            the town, the bridge, and all the stores which they had laid up in the town. <lb/>
            In expectation of this, he led three legions out of the camp, and drawing </note> <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 32-55.]"/> <lb/>
            ment to ascend a hill, which in the middle separated Ilerda <lb/>
            in safety from the camp. Hither did both shame and terror <lb/>
            drive the foe, and, his troops hurried on, he first took pos­ <lb/>
            session of the hill; to these valour and the sword promised <lb/>
            the spot, but to those possession of the place itself. The <lb/>
            loaded soldiers struggled up the steep rocks ; and with faces <lb/>
            upturned the ranks clung to the opposing mountain, and, <lb/>
            likely to fall upon their backs, were elevated by the shields <lb/>
            of those that followed. There was opportunity for no one to <lb/>
            poise his dart, while he was tottering and strengthening <lb/>
            his footsteps with his javelin fixed in the ground, while they <lb/>
            were clinging to crags and stumps of trees, and, the enemy <lb/>
            neglected, cut their way with the sword.</p>
          <p>The chieftain beheld the troops likely to fail with disaster, <lb/>
            and ordered the cavalry to take part in the warfare, and by a <lb/>
            circuit to the left1 to place before them its protected side. <lb/>
            Thus was the foot, readily, and with no one pressing upon <lb/>
            it, relieved, and the disappointed conqueror, the battle <lb/>
            being cut short, stood aloft.</p>
          <p>Thus far were the vicissitudes of arms; the rest of its <lb/>
            fortunes did the weather give to the warfare, uncertain with <lb/>
            its varying fluctuations. The winter, clogged with the slug­ <lb/>
            gish ice, and the dry north winds, kept the showers in the <lb/>
            clouds, the sky being frozen up. Snows pinched the moun­ <lb/>
            tain districts, and hoar-frosts destined not to last on <lb/>
            seeing the sun; and the whole earth nearer to the sky that <lb/>
            sinks the Constellations was parched, hardened beneath the <lb/>
            winter's clear sky. <note type="footnote"> up his army in an advantageous position, he ordered the advanced men of <lb/>
            oue legion to hasten forward and take possession of the eminence. Upon <lb/>
            intelligence of this, the cohorts which were on guard before the camp of <lb/>
            Afranius were instantly sent a nearer way to occupy the same post. The <lb/>
            two parties engaged, and as the men of Afranius had reached the eminence <lb/>
            first, our men were repulsed, and on a reinforcement being sent, they were <lb/>
            obliged to turn their backs, and retreat to the standards of the legions." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 By a circuit to the left) ver. 41. Lucan seems here to confound the <lb/>

            aid given by the cavalry is thus described in the latter Chapter: — “ Our <lb/>
            cavalry also, on either flank, though stationed on sloping or low ground, <lb/>
            yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill, and riding between the <lb/>

            c. 48, thus describes this tempest and its effects:—"In two days after <lb/>
            this transaction, there happened an unexpected misfortune. For so great <lb/>
            a storm arose, that it was agreed that there were never seen higher floods <lb/>
            in those countries. It swept down the snow from all the mountains, and <lb/>
            broke over the banks of the river, and in one day carried away both the <lb/>
            bridges which Fabius had built—a circumstance which caused great dif­ <lb/>
            ficulties to Caesar's army; for as one camp was pitched between two rivers, <lb/>
            the Sicoris and the Cinga, and as neither of these could be forded for the <lb/>
            space of thirty miles, they were all of necessity confined within these nar­ <lb/>
            row limits. Neither could the states which bad espoused Caesar's cause <lb/>
            furnish him with corn, nor the troops which had gone far to forage return, <lb/>
            as they were stopped by the floods; nor could the convoys coming from <lb/>
            Italy and Gaul make their way to the camp. The states, too, were ex­ <lb/>
            hausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn, before Caesar's <lb/>
            arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had left had been already consumed by <lb/>
            Cæsar. The cattle which might have served as a secondary resource against </note></p><pb n="133"/>

            Now the air is more serene, and Phœbus, equal to the waters, <lb/>
            has scattered the dense clouds into fleecy forms, and the <lb/>
            nights are reddening with the approaching light; and, the <lb/>
            due order of things observed, moisture departs from the <lb/>

            War, B. i. c. 54, he thus describes these operations :—" When Cæsar's <lb/>
            affairs were in this unfavourable position, and all the passes were guarded <lb/>
            by the soldiers and horse of Afranius, and the hedges could not be re­ <lb/>
            paired, Cæsar ordered the soldiers to make ships of the kind that his know­ <lb/>
            ledge of Britain a few years before had taught him. First, the keels and <lb/>
            ribs were made of light timber, then the rest of the hull of the ships was <lb/>
            wrought with wicker-work, and covered over with hides. When these were <lb/>
            finished, he drew them down to the river in waggons in one night, a dis­ <lb/>
            tance of twenty-two miles from his camp, and transported in them some sol­ <lb/>
            diers across the river, and on a sudden took possession of a hill adjoining <lb/>
            the bank. This he immediately fortified, before he was perceived by the <lb/>
            enemy. To this he afterwards transported a legion; and having begun a <lb/>
            bridge on both sides, he finished it in two days. By this means he brought <lb/>
            safe to his camp the convoys and those who had gone out to forage, and <lb/>
            began to prepare a conveyance for the provisions." </note><note type="footnote"> a Of the swampy papyrus) ver. 136. Sulpitius, the Scholiast, says, that <lb/>

          <p>Thrown across on these vessels the army hastens on <lb/>
            either side to curve the cut-down wood1; and dreading the <lb/>
            swelling of the threatening river, it does not place the wooden <lb/>
            foundations on the edges of the banks, but extends the <lb/>
            bridge into the midst of the fields. And lest the Sicoris <lb/>
            may dare anything with its waters rising once again, it is <lb/>
            drawn away into channels, and, the stream being divided by <lb/>
            canals, it pays the penalty for the more swollen waters. <lb/>
            When Petreius sees that all things proceed with fortune to <lb/>
            Cæsar, he abandons the lofty Ilerda, and, distrusting the <lb/>
            might of the known world, seeks nations unsubdued 2, and <lb/>
            always fierce in arms by courting death, and he directs his <lb/>
            course to the limits of the world.</p>
          <p>Cæsar, beholding the hills forsaken and the camp aban­ <lb/>

            Obedience is given, and the soldier, rushing to the battle, <lb/>
            eagerly hastens on a path which in flight he would have <lb/>
            dreaded. Afterwards, their arms regained, they warm their <lb/>

            seeing that the cavalry had overtaken the enemy (Civil War, B. i. c. 54) <lb/>

            applied to their tribunes and centurions, and entreated them to inform <lb/>
            Cæsar that he Deed not be sparing of their labour: that they were ready <lb/>
            and able, and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed. <lb/>
            On this, Cæsar ordered all the weaker soldiers to be selected from each cen­ <lb/>

            of the legions he drew out without any baggage, and having disposed a <lb/>
            great number of horse in the river, above and below the ford, he led his <lb/>

            with darkened route safe paths lie concealed. These <lb/>

            that the warfare may be carried thence into the remote <lb/>
            regions of the earth and into savage nations. " Go," says <lb/>
            he, "without keeping your ranks2, and in your speedy course <lb/>

          <p>When they beheld the road to death, their terror was <lb/>
            turned into headlong rage. The soldiers slew the <lb/>
            horses, no useful aid to people blockaded; and at length, <lb/>
            hope raid aside, being compelled to condemn all flight, <lb/>

            saw them running down with extended front, and, devoted, <lb/>
            making their way to certain death, he said:­ <lb/>
            " Soldiers, now keep back your darts, and withhold your <lb/>
            swords from them as they rush on; with no blood shall the <lb/>
            victory be gained for me; he is not conquered at no cost, <lb/>
            who with his throat exposed challenges the foe. See how <lb/>
            life being hated by them, valueless to themselves, the youths <lb/>
            rush on, now threatening to perish with loss to myself. They <lb/>
            will feel no wounds, they will fall on the swords, and rejoice in <lb/>
            shedding their blood. Let this zeal forsake their minds, let <lb/>
            this mad fit subside. Let them be rid of their wish to die."</p>
          <p>Thus did he suffer them to be inflamed to no purpose <lb/>
            as they threatened, and, the war forbidden, to wax faint, until, <lb/>
            Phœbus having sunk, night substituted her lights. Then, <lb/>

            by degrees their fierce anger moderated, and their spirits <lb/>
            cooled; just as wounded breasts manifest the greatest courage <lb/>
            while the pain and the wound is recent, and the warm blood <lb/>
            gives an active impulse to the nerves, and the bones have <lb/>

            towards the gentle Zephyrs. There, trusting in the warlike <lb/>

            by the Adriatic sea, Antony, taking up his position in that <lb/>

            the yellow-haired Ceres produces no crops of corn; the <lb/>

          <p>For, not according to wont do they extend the keels and <lb/>
            build aloft the sterns, but with an unusual shape they <lb/>
            fasten firm planks together for supporting a massive <lb/>
            tower. For, on every side, empty caissons support the <lb/>
            raft a, a series of which, fastened together, with extended <lb/>
            chains receives alder planks laid obliquely in double rows. <lb/>
            Nor does it carry its oars exposed to the weapons in the <lb/>

            beams the oars strike, and it shows the miracle of a silent <lb/>
            course, because it neither carries sails nor beats the dis­ <lb/>
            covered waves. Then the straits are watched, while the ebb­ <lb/>
            ing tide is retreating with lessening waves, and the sands <lb/>
            are laid bare by the sea flowing out. And now, the waters <lb/>

            borne gliding along on the receding tide, and its two com­ <lb/>

            of Cæsar, he took part in his murder. He himself was slain by his own <lb/>
            slaves about a year after. The fifteenth Epistle in the sixth book Ad Fami­ <lb/>

            and Lemaire suggests that it is one description formed from a mixture of <lb/>
            several. The floats or rafts seem to have been of oblong form, and formed <lb/>
            each of two tiers of caissons, or It cuppæ " (more literally " wine vats "), the <lb/>
            space between which tiers was not covered over, for the purpose of rowing, <lb/>
            while the outer sides of the raft were protected by hurdles. Being thus <lb/>
            rowed from within, their motion would naturally astonish the enemy when <lb/>
            at a distance. Lucan speaks of the floats being made by the forces of Anto­ <lb/>

            the deep once more through the pacific appearance of the <lb/>

            the light Molossian hound3, and restrains the Spartan and <lb/>

            for the purpose of scaring them away from breaking through the nets when <lb/>
            inclosed. The " odorata penna " here mentioned is supposed by some to <lb/>
            refer to the smell of the red dye in which the feathers were steeped; <lb/>
            others, however, think that it refers to the smell of the feathers themselves, <lb/>
            and cite the Cynægeticon of Gratius Faliscus, where he says that the feathers <lb/>
            of vultures were used for foils, the strong smell of them driving away the <lb/>
            wild beasts. As the feathers seem to have been used for scaring the deer, <lb/>
            both by the sight and the smell, the line may mean, " the deer fearing the <lb/>
            strong-smelling feathers as they move about in the breeze," or, " fearing the <lb/>

            ancient skill1 prepare to lay stratagems beneath the sea, <lb/>
            and suffering the surface of the main to be free, suspend <lb/>
            chains in the midst of the deep, and permit the connected <lb/>
            links to hang loose, and fasten them to the rocks2 of the <lb/>
            Illyrian cliffs. Neither the first raft3 nor the one that <lb/>
            follows is retarded ; but the third mass sticks fast, and by <lb/>
            a rope drawn4 follows on to the rocks. The hollow cliffs <lb/>
            hang over the sea, and, strange! the mass stands, always <lb/>
            about to fall, and with the woods overshadows the deep. <lb/>
            Hither did the ocean often bear ships, wrecked by the <lb/>
            north wind, and drowned bodies, and hide them in the <lb/>
            darkened caverns. The sea enclosed restores the spoil; <lb/>
            and when the caverns have vomited forth the water, the <lb/>

            beneath the waves (he was the captain of the raft), <lb/>

            to the warfare. Valour, however, in this calamity effected <lb/>
            as much as, ensnared, it was able. The fight was be­ <lb/>
            tween so many thousands pouring in upon the captured <lb/>
            raft and scarcely on the other side a complete cohort; not <lb/>
            long indeed, for black night concealed the dubious light, <lb/>
            and darkness caused a truce.</p>
          <p>Then thus with magnanimous voice did Vulteius en­ <lb/>
            courage the cohort dismayed and dreading their approach­ <lb/>
            ing fate: “ Youths, free no longer than one short night, <lb/>
            consult in this limited time for your fortunes in this ex­ <lb/>
            tremity. A short life remains for no one who in it has <lb/>
            time to seek death for himself; nor, youths, is the glory of <lb/>
            death inferior, in running to meet approaching fate. <lb/>
            The period of their life to come being uncertain to all, <lb/>
            equal is the praise of courage, both in sacrificing the years <lb/>
            which yon have hoped for, and in cutting short the mo­ <lb/>
            ments of your closing existence, while by your own hand <lb/>
            you hasten your fate. No one is compelled to wish to die. <lb/>
            No way for flight is open; our fellow-citizens stand on every <lb/>
            side bent against our throats. Determine on death, and <lb/>
            all fear is gone; whatever is necessary, that same desire.</p>
          <p>" Still, we have not to fall amid the dark haze of warfare, <lb/>
            or when armies envelope their own darts with the shades <lb/>
            intermingling, when heaped up bodies are lying on the <lb/>
            plain, and every death goes to the common account, and <lb/>
            valour perishes overwhelmed. In a ship have the Gods <lb/>
            placed us conspicuous to our allies and to the foe. The <lb/>

          <p>“ For, Cæsar, to fall upon our own swords for thee we <lb/>
            deem to be but little; but to us, hemmed in, no greater <lb/>
            ones are existing, for us to give as pledges of affection so <lb/>

            men and children'. Let the enemy know that we are men <lb/>
            unsubdued, and dread our courage, glowing and eager for <lb/>
            death, and be glad that2 no more rafts have stuck fast. <lb/>
            They will be trying to corrupt us with treaties and with a <lb/>
            disgraced life. 0 would that, in order that our distin­ <lb/>
            guished death might gain the greater fame, they would prof­ <lb/>
            fer pardon, and bid us hope for safety; that they might <lb/>
            not, when we pierce our vitals with the warm weapon, think <lb/>
            that we are desperate. By great valour must we deserve, <lb/>
            that Cfesar, a few among so many thousands being lost, <lb/>
            may call this a loss and a calamity.</p>
          <p>“ Though the Fates should afford an egress and let us <lb/>
            escape, I would not wish to avoid what is pressing on. <lb/>
            I have parted with life, companions, and am wholly im­ <lb/>

          <p>Life now forsworn, the devoted youths stood resolved, <lb/>

            worthy of my blood, and who, with certain assurance, can <lb/>
            testify that with wounds from me he is ready to die?” <lb/>
            Having said no more, already has not one sword alone <lb/>
            pierced his entrails. He commends all, but him to whom he <lb/>
            owes the first wounds, dying, he slays with a grateful stroke. <lb/>
            The others rush to meet each other, and the whole horrors <lb/>
            of warfare on one side do they perpetrate. Thus did the <lb/>
            Dircæan band spring up from the seed sown by Cadmus 4, <note type="footnote"> I The ThessaliaM arrows) ver. 528. He alludes to the Constellation Sagit­ <lb/>

            the Theban brothers; the earth-born ones, too, sprung on <lb/>
            the plains of Phasis' from the wakeful teeth of the dragon, <lb/>
            the anger being enflamed by magic charms, filled the fur­ <lb/>

            before untried.</p>
          <p>Thus engaged to mutual destruction do the youths fall, <lb/>
            and in the deaths of the heroes death has too great a <lb/>
            share in the valour; equally do they slay and fall with <lb/>
            deadly wounds; nor does his right hand deceive any one. <lb/>
            Nor are the wounds owing to the swords driven home; <lb/>
            the blade is run against by the breast, and with their <lb/>
            throats they press against the hand of him who gives the <lb/>
            wound. When with a blood-stained fate brothers rush upon <lb/>
            brothers, and the son upon the parent, still, with no trem­ <lb/>
            bling right hand, with all their might they drive home the <lb/>
            swords. There is but one mark of duty in those who <lb/>
            strike, not to repeat the blow. Now, half-dead, they drag <lb/>
            their entrails, gushing out, to the hatches, and they pour <lb/>
            into the sea plenteous blood. It gives them pleasure to be­ <lb/>
            hold the scorned light of day, and with proud looks to gaze <lb/>
            upon their conquerors, and to feel the approach of death.</p>
          <p>Now is the raft beheld heaped up with the bloody <lb/>
            slaughter, and the victors give the bodies to the funeral <lb/>
            piles, the generals wondering 3 that to any one his leader <lb/>
            can be of value so great. Fame, spreading abroad over <lb/>
            the whole world, has spoken with greater praises of no ship <lb/>

          <p>Not more inactive than this warfare was the one which at <lb/>

            what was known to him through many ancestors. <note type="footnote"> 1 The shore of Lilybœum) ver. 583. Lilybæum was a town on the <lb/>

            " About the same time Caius Curio, having sailed from Sicily to Africa, and, <lb/>

          <p>“ Earth, not as yet barren, after the Giants being born, <lb/>
            conceived a dreadful offspring in the Libyan caves. Nor <lb/>
            to the Earth was Typhon so just a ground of pride, or <lb/>
            Tityus and the fierce Briareus; and she spared the hea­ <lb/>
            vens, in that she did not bring forth Antæus in the Phle­ <lb/>
            græan fields 1. By this privilege as well did the Earth <lb/>
            redouble the strength so vast of her offspring, in that, <lb/>
            when they touched their parent, the limbs now exhausted <lb/>
            were vigorous again with renewed strength. This cavern <lb/>
            was his abode; they report that under the lofty rock he <lb/>
            lay concealed, and had caught lions for his food. For <lb/>
            his sleep no skins of wild beasts were wont to afford a <lb/>
            bed, no wood a couch, and lying on the bare earth he reco­ <lb/>
            vered his strength. The Libyans, tillers of the fields, pe­ <lb/>
            rish; they perish whom the sea has brought; and his <lb/>
            strength, for a long time not using the aid of falling, <lb/>
            slights the gift of the Earth; unconquered was he in <lb/>
            strength by all, although he kept standing.</p>
          <p>“At length the report of the blood-stained pest teas <lb/>
            spread abroad, and invited to the Libyan shores the mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous Alcides, who was relieving the land and sea from <lb/>
            monsters. He threw off the skin of the lion of Cleonæ 2 <lb/>
            Antæus that of a Libyan lion. The stranger besprinkled <lb/>
            his limbs with oil, the custom of the Olympic exercises 3 <lb/>
            observed; the other, not entirely trusting to touching his <lb/>
            mother with his feet, sprinkled warm sand4 as an aid to his <note type="footnote"> 1 The Phlegrœan fields) ver. 597. The Phlegræan plains were said to be <lb/>
            situate in Thessaly or Macedonia, and there the Earth gave birth to Typhon, <lb/>
            Tityus, and Briareus, who waged war against the Gods. The volcanic tract <lb/>
            extending from Capua to Cumæin Campania was called by the same name, <lb/>
            and the tradition was, that there, too, the Giants warred with the Gods. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The lion of Cleonœ) ver. 612. The Nemean lion, whose skin Hercules <lb/>

            strength, always in contact with him; but dust or fine sand was univer­ <lb/>

            limbs. With many a twist they linked their hands and <lb/>
            arms. For long, in vain were their throats tried at by their <lb/>
            ponderous arms, and with fixed features the head was held <lb/>
            unmoved ; and they wondered at having found their match.</p>
          <p>" Nor in the beginning of the contest was Alcides willing <lb/>
            to employ his strength, and he wearied out the hero; which <lb/>
            his continued panting betrayed, and the cold sweat from <lb/>
            his fatigued body. Then his wearied neck began to shake ; <lb/>
            then breast to be pressed upon by breast; then the thighs <lb/>
            to totter, struck sideways by the hand. Now does the victor <lb/>
            grasp the back of the hero as it is giving way, and, his <lb/>
            flanks squeezed up, he encircles him around the middle; <lb/>
            and his feet inserted, he spreads asunder his thighs, and <lb/>
            stretches the hero with all his limbs upon the ground. <lb/>
            The scorching earth carries off his sweat; with warm <lb/>
            blood his veins are filled. The muscles swell out, and in <lb/>
            all the limbs he grows hard, and, his body refreshed, he <lb/>
            loosens the Herculean grasp. Alcides stands astounded at <lb/>
            strength so vast; and not so much, although he was then <lb/>
            inexperienced, did he dread the Hydra cut asunder in the <lb/>
            Inachian waves 1, her snakes renewed.</p>
          <p>" Equally matched they struggle, the one with strength <lb/>
            from the earth, the other with it his own. Never has it <lb/>
            been allowed his unrelenting stepdame2 to be more in <lb/>
            hopes. She sees the limbs of the hero exhausted by sweat, <lb/>
            and his neck parched, upon which he bore Olympus. And <lb/>
            when again he lays hands upon his wearied limbs, An­ <lb/>
            tæus, not waiting for the might of the foe, falls of his <lb/>
            own accord, and, strength received, rises more mighty. <lb/>
            Whatever vigour there is in the ground it is infused into <lb/>
            his weary limbs, and with the struggling hero the earth <lb/>
            labours.</p>
          <p>" When at last Alcides perceived the aid of the contact of <lb/>
            his parent availing him, he said, ‛ Thou must stand, and no <note type="footnote"> 1 In the Inachian vaves) ver. 634. Inachus was one of the ancient kings <lb/>

            aloft the youth, straggling to gain the ground. Earth was <lb/>
            not able to infuse strength into the limbs of her dying son. <lb/>
            Alcides held him by the middle; now was his breast <lb/>
            numbed by a torpid chill; for long he did not entrust <lb/>
            his foe to the earth. Hence, recording antiquity, the <lb/>
            guardian of ancient times and the admirer of herself, has <lb/>
            marked the land with his name. But a more noble <lb/>

            former commanders, pitching his unlucky tents upon the <lb/>
            fortunate spot, indulged his camp with hopes, and took their <lb/>
            omen away from the hills, and with unequal strength pro­ <lb/>
            voked the warlike foes. All Africa, which had submitted to <lb/>

            Gods above and things human, by a tribunitial law Curio <lb/>
            had attempted to expel from the throne of his forefathers, <lb/>

            Cæsar. This circumstance is thus referred to in the Civil War, B. ii. c. 28:— <lb/>
            “In the army there was one Sextus Quintilius Varus, who, as we have men­ <lb/>
            tioned before, was at Corfinium. When Caesar gave him his liberty he went <lb/>
            over to Africa. Now Curio had transported to Africa those legions which <lb/>
            Cxsar had received under his command a short time before at Corfinium; <lb/>
            so that the officers and companies were still the same, excepting the change <lb/>
            of a few centurions. Quintilius, making this a pretext for addressing them, <lb/>
            began to go round Curio's lines, and to entreat the soldiers not to lose all <lb/>
            recollection of the oath which they first took to Domitius and to himself, <lb/>
            their Quæstor, nor bear arms against those who bad shared the same fortune, <lb/>
            and endured the same hardships in siege, nor fight for those by whom they <lb/>
            had opprobriously been called deserters." </note> <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 698-722.]"/> <lb/>
            their new leaders, and wavering to their former one, they <lb/>
            deem either side equally right. But after he perceives all <lb/>
            faint with inactive dread, and the nightly guards of the <lb/>
            trenches forsaken by desertion, thus in his agitated mind <lb/>
            does he speak :— <lb/>
            " By daring great fears are concealed; to arms willI re­ <lb/>
            sort the first. Let the soldiers descend to the level plains <lb/>
            while they are yet my own ; rest ever produces a wavering <lb/>
            disposition ; remove all consideration by fight. When the <lb/>
            dire intent waxes strong with the sword grasped in hand, <lb/>
            and helmets conceal their shame, who thinks of comparing <lb/>
            the leaders, who of weighing the causes ? The side he has <lb/>
            taken to that does he wish well; just as in the shows of the <lb/>
            fatal sand1 no ancient grudge compels those brought for­ <lb/>
            ward to combat together, but they hate those pitted against <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>Thus having said2, in the open plains he drew up his <lb/>
            ranks, whom the fortune of war, about to deceive him with <lb/>
            future woes, blandly received. For he drove Varus 3 from <lb/>
            the field, and smote their backs exposed in disgraceful <lb/>
            flight, until their camp prevented it. But after the sad <lb/>
            battle of the worsted Varus was heard of by Juba; joyous <lb/>
            that the glory of the warfare might be recovered by his <lb/>
            own aid, by stealth he hurried on his troops, and by en­ <lb/>
            joined silence retarded the report of himself approaching, <lb/>
            fearing this alone, through want of caution to be dreaded <lb/>
            by the enemy. Sabura,4, next after the king among the <lb/>
            Numidians, was sent before to provoke the commencing <lb/>
            battle with a small troop and to draw them on, as though <lb/>
            pretending5 that the warfare was entrusted to himself.</p>

          <p>He himself in a hollow valley keeps back the strength of <lb/>
            the realm; just as the more crafty enemy 1 with his tail de­ <lb/>
            ceives the Pliarian asps, and provokes them, enraged by a <lb/>
            deceiving shadow; and obliquely seizes with safe grip the <lb/>
            head of the serpent, stretching out in vain into the air, with­ <lb/>
            out its deadly matter; then the venom, baulked of its purpose, <lb/>
            is squeezed out, and its jaws overflow with the wasted poison.</p>
          <p>To the stratagems Fortune gives success ; and fierce, the <lb/>
            strength of the concealed foe not surveyed, Curio com­ <lb/>
            mands his cavalry to sally forth from the camp by night, <lb/>
            and to spread far and wide over the unknown plains. He <lb/>
            himself, about the first break of dawn, commands the signal <lb/>
            to sound in the camp, often and vainly having begged them <lb/>
            to apprehend Libyan stratagem and the Punic warfare, <lb/>
            always fraught with treachery.</p>
          <p>The destiny of approaching death had delivered up the <lb/>
            youth to the Fates, and the civil warfare urged on its author <lb/>
            to his doom. Over steep rocks, over crags, along an abrupt <lb/>
            path he led his standards; when, espied afar from the tops <lb/>
            of the hills, the enemy, in their stratagem, gave way a <lb/>
            little, until, the hill being left, he entrusted his extended <lb/>
            ranks to the wide plains. He, believing this a flight, and <lb/>
            unacquainted with the concealed design, as though victo­ <lb/>
            rious, led forward his forces into the midst of the fields. <lb/>
            Then first was the stratagem disclosed, and the flying <lb/>
            Numidians, the mountains filled on every side, hemmed in <lb/>
            the troops. At the same moment the leader himself was <lb/>
            astounded, and the multitude, doomed to perish. <note type="footnote"> is not near at hand. So in the Civil War, B. ii. c. 38, Cxsar says, It Curio <lb/>
            is informed by some deserters from the town that Juba has stayed behind in <lb/>
            his own kingdom, being called home by a neighbouring war, and a dispute <lb/>
            with the people of Leptis; and that Sabura, who has been sent with a small <lb/>
            force, is drawing near to Utica. Curio, rashly believing this information, <lb/>
            alters his design, and resolves to hazard a battle." It appears, however, by <lb/>
            Cæsar's account, that there was no stratagem at first on the part of Juba, <lb/>
            whose advanced guard was attacked unexpectedly by the cavalry of Curio, <lb/>
            with great slaughter; shortly after which, Curio neglecting to make proper <lb/>
            enquiries, again attacked Sabura, who, falling back, gradually surrounded <lb/>
            him with his army, and destroyed him and his forces. See the Civil War, <lb/>

          <p>The fearful sought not flight, the valiant not battle; <lb/>
            since not there did the charger, moved by the clangor of <lb/>
            trumpets, shake the rocks with the beating of his hoof, <lb/>
            working at his mouth that champs the stiffened reins, and <lb/>
            spread his mane, and prick up his ears, and not with the <lb/>
            varying movement of the feet did he struggle not to be at <lb/>
            rest. His wearied neck hangs down. His limbs reek <lb/>
            with sweat, and his parched mouth is clammy, his tongue <lb/>
            hanging out; his hoarse breast, which an incessant panting <lb/>
            excites, groans aloud; and the breath, hardly drawn, con­ <lb/>
            tracts the spent flanks; the foam, too, grows hard upon <lb/>
            the blood-stained bits. And now, compelled neither by <lb/>
            whips nor goads, nor though prompted by frequent spur­ <lb/>
            ring, do they increase their speed. By wounds are the <lb/>
            horses urged on. Nor avails it any one to have cut short <lb/>
            the delay of his horny-hoofed steed, for they have neither <lb/>
            space nor force for the onset; he is only carried on against <lb/>
            the foe, and affords room for the javelins, the wound being <lb/>
            offered.</p>
          <p>But when first the skirmishing African sent forth his <lb/>
            steeds in a troop, then did the plains re-echo with the <lb/>
            sound; and, the earth loosened, the dust enveloped the air <lb/>
            in its clouds, and brought on the shades, as vast as it is <lb/>
            when hurled by the Bistonian whirlwind 1. But when the <lb/>
            miserable fate of war befell the foot, no fortune stood in <lb/>
            suspense upon the decision of a doubtful conflict, but <lb/>
            death occupied the duration of the battle. Nor yet had <lb/>
            they the power to run straight against them, and to mingle <lb/>
            their troops. Thus, the youths, hemmed in on every side, <lb/>
            by those who fight hand to band2 and by those who send <lb/>
            them from above, are overwhelmed with lances obliquely <lb/>
            slanting and held horizontally; doomed to perish not by <lb/>
            wounds or bloodshed, solely through the cloud of darts and <lb/>
            the weight of the weapons. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Bistonian whirlwind) ver. 767. Thrace is called " Bistonia," from <lb/>

            compass, and if any one, fearing, creeps into the middle of <lb/>

            swords of his own friends; and the mass is made more <lb/>
            dense, inasmuch as the first rank, their feet bearing back­ <lb/>

            now no room for wielding their arms, and their crowded <lb/>
            limbs are trodden on; armed breast is broken by breast <lb/>
            beaten against it. The victorious Moor did not enjoy a <lb/>

            behold the streams of blood, and the fainting of the limbs, <lb/>

          <p>In the early part of the year the Consuls convene the Senate in Epirus, <lb/>
            1-14. Lentulus addresses the Senators, and advises them to appoint <lb/>
            Pompey Commander-in-chief, which is accordingly done, 15-49. The Poet <lb/>
            praises the monarchs and nations who lent their aid, 50-64. Appius <lb/>
            goes to consult the oracle at Delphi, which has now long been silent, as <lb/>
            to the result of the-war, 65-70. The oracle is described, 71-120. <lb/>
            The Temple is opened, and Phemonoë, the Priestess, tries to dissuade <lb/>
            Appius from his enquiries, 121-140. She is forced, however, to ascend <lb/>
            the oracular tripod, 141-162. And is inspired by the prophetic frenzy. <lb/>
            The oracle foretells, in ambiguous terms, the death of Appius himself <lb/>
            before the battle of Pharsalia, at the Island of Euboea, 163-197. The <lb/>
            oracle is apostrophized by the Poet, 198-236. The soldiers of Caesar's <lb/>
            party become mutinous, 237-261. Their threats and clamours for peace, <lb/>
            262-296. Caesar presents himself before them thus complaining, 297-318. <lb/>
            He addresses them, 319-364. The tumult is appeased, 365-373. Caesar <lb/>
            sends his army to Brundisium, and orders a fleet to be collected there, <lb/>
            374-380. He then repairs to Rome, where he is made Dictator and <lb/>
            Consul, 380-384. Evil omens give portentous signs, 384-402. He goes <lb/>
            thence to Brundisium; where collecting a fleet, he orders part of his troops <lb/>
            to embark, although the skies betoken an approaching tempest, 403-411. <lb/>
            He harangues his soldiers, 412-423. The sea is suddenly becalmed, and <lb/>
            passing over he lands at Palæste, in Epirus, 424-460. He encamps <lb/>
            at Dyrrhachium, 461-475. Caesar entreats Antony to send over the <lb/>
            remaining forces, 476-497. Impatient at his delay, he determines to go <lb/>
            across, 498-503. He does so in a small boat, 504-570. Cæsar en­ <lb/>
            courages the mariners in a tempest, 571-593. Which is described, <lb/>
            594-653. He arrives in Italy, 654-677. He returns to Epirus, and his <lb/>
            soldiers expostulate with him for leaving them, 678-700. Antony passes <lb/>
            over with the rest of his troops, 701-721. Pompey determines to send <lb/>
            his wife Cornelia to Lesbos, 722-739. He apprises her of his intentions, <lb/>
            740-759. Cornelia's answer, 760-790. She embarks, 790-801. And <lb/>
            sails for Lesbos, 801-815.</p>
          <p>THUS did Fortune reserve the two1 generals who had suffered <lb/>

            But while the latter part still remained of their expiring <lb/>
            sway, each Consul invited the Senators dispersed amid the <lb/>
            duties of the warfare to Epirus. A foreign and a lowly <lb/>
            retreat received the Roman nobles, and a foreign senate <lb/>
            under a distant roof heard the secrets of the state. For <lb/>
            who could call so many axes wielded by the laws, so many <lb/>
            fasces 4, a camp? The venerable order taught the people <lb/>
            that it was not the party of Magnus, but that Magnus was <lb/>
            their partisan.</p>
          <p>When first silence pervaded the sorrowing assembly, <lb/>
            Lentulus 5 from a lofty seat thus spoke :—" If strength exists <lb/>
            in your minds worthy of the Latian spirit, if of your ancient <lb/>
            blood, consider not in what land you are banished, and how <lb/>
            far we are located from the abodes of the captured City; <lb/>
            but think of the aspect of your own assembly; and, able <lb/>
            to command everything, first, Senators, decree this, which <lb/>
            to realms and to nations is manifest, that we are the <lb/>
            Senate. For whether Fortune shall lead us beneath the icy <lb/>
            Wain of the Hyperborean Bear, or where the burning region <lb/>
            and the clime shut up in vapours permits not the <lb/>
            nights nor yet the days, unequal, to increase, the dominion <lb/>
            of the world will attend us, and empire as our attendant. <lb/>

            Whoever was not expelled by us from an order so mighty, <lb/>
            is here. Unacquainted with crimes, and at rest during a <lb/>
            lengthened peace, the first fury of warfare dispersed us; <lb/>
            once again do all the members of the state return to <lb/>
            their place. Behold! with all the might of the world <lb/>
            do the Gods above recompense us for Hesperia lost; <lb/>
            the enemy lies overwhelmed in the Illyrian waves 2; in <lb/>
            the loathsome fields of Libya, Curio, a large portion of <lb/>

            and let fortune give us courage as great, as the cause gave <lb/>
            when you fled from the foe. Our rule is closing with the <lb/>
            finished year; you, whose power is destined to experience <lb/>

          <p>With joyous, applause the Senate received the name, and <lb/>
            entrusted to Magnus his own and his country's fate. Then <lb/>
            honors were distributed among kings and nations that <lb/>

            twelve miles from Rome. It was here that the Senate were convened <lb/>
            when the Gauls had destroyed Rome, on which they appointed Camillus <lb/>
            Dictator. The Romans at this time were anxious to make Veii their <lb/>

            who, though extremely advanced in years, came to the aid of Pompey with, <lb/>
            six hundred horsemen. He was afterwards pardoned by Caesar, but, according <lb/>
            to Cicero, Caesar deprived him of his Tetrarchy and kingdom, though he <lb/>
            suffered him to retain his title. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 And Rhasipolis) ver. 55. This person, whose name is also spelt <lb/>

            Dyrrhachium. Cæsar, in the Civil War, B. iii. c. iv., speaks of his troops as <lb/>
            coming from Macedonia, and as being of extraordinary valour. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Ptolemy, to thee) ver. 59. This was Ptolemy XII., king of Egypt, <lb/>

            by " him of Pella," Alexander the Great. More particulars relative to this <lb/>

            given to Ptolemy and his sister Cleopatra jointly; but he succeeded in ex­ <lb/>
            pelling her after she had reigned jointly with him for three years. By his <lb/>
            murder of Pompey, he saved Cæsar, doubtless to our Poet's sorrow, the <lb/>

            of heaven to unfold the destiny of events, and opened again <lb/>

            according to tradition, it was named after Carystus, son of Chiron. The <lb/>

            brought to Greece for the purpose of making a statue of Victory, and <lb/>
            which was thus appropriately devoted to the Goddess of Retribution. <lb/>
            It wore a crown and had wings, and, holding a spear of ash in the right <lb/>
            hand, was seated on a stag. According to another account the statue was <lb/>
            the work of Agoracritus, the disciple of Phidias. </note> <pb n="176"/>

          <p>In the meantime, the Iberians subdued, Cæsar returned, <lb/>
            about to carry his eagles into another region; when almost <lb/>
            did the Gods turn aside the course so mighty of fate <lb/>
            amid his prosperity. For, in no warfare subdued, within <lb/>
            the tents of his camp did the chieftain fear to lose the <lb/>
            profit3 of his excesses; when almost, the bands, faithful <lb/>
            throughout so many wars, satiated with blood, at last forsook <lb/>
            their leader: whether it was that the trumpet-call ceas­ <lb/>
            ing for a time from its melancholy sound, and the sword <lb/>
            sheathed and cold, had expelled the mania for war; or <lb/>
            whether, while the soldier looked for greater rewards, he <lb/>
            condemned both the cause and the leader, and even then <lb/>
            held on sale his sword stained with crime. Not in any <lb/>
            danger4 was Cæsar more tried, as now, not from a firm <lb/>
            height, but from a trembling one, he looked down on <lb/>
            everything, and stood propped up upon a stumbling spot; <lb/>
            deprived of hands so many, and left almost to his own <lb/>
            sword, he who dragged so many nations to war, was sensible <lb/>

            he is a cause of fear, and thinks that the injustice of tyranny <lb/>

            Whatever offence is committed by many goes unpunished. <lb/>
            Thus they pour forth their threats :— <lb/>
            ,, Let it be permitted us, Cæsar, to depart from the <lb/>
            frantic career of crime. By land and by sea thou dost seek <lb/>
            a sword for these throats, and our lives, held so cheap, thou <lb/>
            art ready to throw away upon any foe. Gaul has snatched <lb/>
            from thee a part of us; Spain, with her severe wars, a part; <lb/>
            a part lies in Hesperia; and the whole world over, thee <lb/>
            being the conqueror, does the army perish. What profits it <lb/>
            to have poured forth our blood in the northern regions, the <lb/>
            Rhone and the Rhine subdued? In return for so many <lb/>
            woes to me thou hast given civil war. When, the Senate <lb/>
            expelled, we captured the abodes of our country, which of <lb/>
            mortals or which of the Gods was it allowed us to spoil? <lb/>
            Guilty with hands and weapons we incur every crime, <lb/>
            pious, however, in our poverty. What limit is sought for <lb/>
            our arms ?</p>
          <p>" What is enough, if Rome is too little ? Now look upon <lb/>
            our hoary locks and our weak hands, and behold our feeble <lb/>
            arms. The prime of our life is past, our years we have <lb/>
            consumed in wars; dismiss us, aged men, to die. Behold <lb/>
            our unreasonable request! to allow us not to lay our dying <lb/>
            limbs upon the hard turf; not with our breath as it flies <lb/>
            to beat against the clod1, and to seek in death the right <lb/>
            hand that shall close our eyes 2; to sink amid the tears of <lb/>
            our wives, and to. know that a pile is prepared for each. <lb/>
            May it be allowed us by disease to end our old age Be­ <lb/>
            sides the sword let there be under Cæsar's rule some other <lb/>
            death. Why by hopes dost thou draw us on, as though <lb/>
            ignorant for what monstrous crimes we are being trained ? <lb/>
            As though, indeed, we alone are not aware, amid civil war, <lb/>
            of which treason the reward is the greatest? Nothing has <lb/>
            been effected by the wars, if he has not yet discovered that <lb/>

          <p>" Nor do right or the bonds of law forbid us to attempt <lb/>
            this. Amid the waves of the Rhine Cresar was my chieftain, <lb/>
            here he is my comrade. Those whom criminality defiles, it <lb/>
            renders equal. Add that, under a thankless estimator of our <lb/>
            deserts, our valour is lost; whatever we do is entitled for­ <lb/>
            tune.' Let him be aware that we are his destiny. Though <lb/>
            thou shouldst hope for every favour of the Gods, the soldiers <lb/>
            enraged, Cæsar, there will be peace." Thus having said, <lb/>
            they began to rush to and fro throughout all the camp, and <lb/>
            with hostile looks to demand the chief.</p>
          <p>Thus may it be, 0 Gods of heaven! when duty and <lb/>
            fidelity forsake us, and it is left to place our hopes in evil <lb/>
            ways, let discord make an end in civil war. What chieftain <lb/>
            could not that tumult alarm? But Cæsar comes, accus­ <lb/>
            tomed headlong to meet the Fates, and rejoicing to exercise <lb/>
            his fortunes amid extreme dangers; nor does he wait until <lb/>
            their rage may abate: he hastens to tempt their fury in full <lb/>
            career. Not to them would he have denied cities and temples <lb/>
            to be spoiled, and the Tarpeian abode of Jove, and the ma­ <lb/>
            trons of the Senate 1, and brides doomed to suffer disgraceful <lb/>
            indignities. He wishes indeed for everything to be asked of <lb/>
            him; he wishes the rewards of warfare to be courted; only <lb/>
            the recovered senses of the disobedient soldiery are feared.</p>
          <p>Alas! Cæsar, art thou not ashamed for wars now to prove <lb/>
            pleasing to thyself alone that have been condemned by thy <lb/>
            own bands ? Shall these be weary first of bloodshed ? Shall <lb/>
            the law of the sword prove burdensome to them ? Wilt thou <lb/>
            thyself rush through all right and wrong? Be tired at last, <lb/>
            and learn to be able to endure existence without arms; let it <lb/>
            be possible for thee to put an end to criminality. Barbarous <lb/>
            man, why dost thou press on ? Why now dost thou urge on <lb/>
            the unwilling? Civil war is flying from thee. On a mound <lb/>
            of turf built up he stood, intrepid in countenance, and not <lb/>
            alarmed, deserved to be feared; and, anger dictating, thus <lb/>

            that dares nothing bravely, proves faint hearts, and youths <lb/>
            that meditate flight alone, and wearied with the prospering <lb/>

            return heroes as many as the weapons that shall be un­ <lb/>

            Magnus with a fleet so great, and shall victory give us no <lb/>
            attending multitude, to bear off the rewards of the shortened <lb/>
            warfare, only receiving the concluding stroke, and, the price <lb/>
            of your labours snatched away, to attend with no wound <lb/>

          <p>" Do you suppose that the career of Cæsar can possibly <lb/>
            feel ill results from your flight? Just as, though all the rivers <lb/>

            with the deep, the sea would never decrease the more, its <lb/>
            waters diminished, than now it swells. Do you suppose that <lb/>
            you have imparted any weight to me? Never does the care <lb/>
            of the Gods thus lower itself, that the Fates should have <lb/>
            leisure to attend to your death and your safety. On the move­ <lb/>

          <p>The motionless throng trembled beneath his stern voice <lb/>

            he could command the swords themselves, able to wield <lb/>

            commanded Pompey's fleet received frequent reproofs from him by letter, <lb/>
            that as they had not prevented Caesar's arrival at the first, they should at <lb/>
            least stop the remainder of his army; and they were expecting that the <lb/>
            season for transporting troops would every day become more unfavorable, as <lb/>
            the winds grew calmer. Cæsar, feeling some trouble on this account, wrote <lb/>
            in severe terms to his officers at Brundisium, and gave them orders that as <lb/>
            soon as they found the wind to answer, they should not let the opportunity <lb/>
            of setting sail pass by, if they were even to steer their course to the shore of <lb/>
            Apollonia, because there they might run their ships aground. That these <lb/>
            parts principally were left unguarded by the enemy's fleet, because they <lb/>
            dared not venture too far from the harbour." </note> <pb n="188"/>

            trusted thy arms to an untried deep, and art thou dragged <lb/>
            into dangers unknown ? Sluggard, Cæsar commands thee <lb/>
            to come, not to go. I myself, the first, amid the foe touched <lb/>
            upon sands in the midst of them, and under the sway of <lb/>
            others. Dost thou fear my camp ? I lament that the hours <lb/>
            of fate are wasting; upon the winds and the waves do I <lb/>
            expend my prayers. Keep not those back who desire to go <lb/>
            on the shifting deep; if I judge aright, the youths would <lb/>
            be willing by shipwreck even to repair to the arms of Cfesar. <lb/>
            Now must I employ the language of grief; not on equal <lb/>
            terms have we divided the world. Cæsar and the whole <lb/>
            Senate occupy Epirus; thou alone dost possess Ausonia."</p>
          <p>After he sees that he, summoned three or four times <lb/>
            in this language, is still delaying, as he believes that it is <lb/>
            he himself who is wanting to the Gods, and not the Deities <lb/>
            to him, of his accord amid the unsafe shades of night he <lb/>
            dares to try the sea, which they, commanded, stand in fear <lb/>
            of, having experienced that venturous deeds have prospered <lb/>
            under a favoring Divinity; and waves, worthy to be feared <lb/>
            by fleets, he hopes to pass over in a little bark.</p>
          <p>Night with its languor had now relaxed the wearied care <lb/>
            of arms; rest was obtained for the wretched, into whose <lb/>
            breasts by sleep a more humble lot inspires strength. Now <lb/>
            was the camp silent; now had its third hour1 brought <lb/>
            on the second watch; Cæsar with anxious step amid the <lb/>
            vasty silence attempted things hardly by his servants2 to be <lb/>
            dared; and, all left behind, Fortune alone pleased him as his <lb/>
            companion. After he had gone through the tents, he passed <lb/>
            over the bodies of the sentinels which had yielded to sleep, <lb/>
            silently complaining that he was able3 to elude them. He <note type="footnote"> 1 Now had its third hour) ver. 507. This would be from 11 to 12 o'clock <lb/>

            passed along the winding shore, and at the brink of the waves <lb/>
            found a bark attached by a cable to the rocks eaten away.</p>
          <p>Not far from thence a house, free from all cares, propped <lb/>
            up with no stout timbers, but woven with barren rushes <lb/>
            and the reeds of the marsh, and covered on its exposed <lb/>
            side with a boat turned bottom upwards, sheltered the pilot <lb/>
            and the owner of the bark. Cæsar twice or thrice knocked <lb/>
            with his hand at this threshold, that shook the roof. <lb/>
            Amyclas arose from the soft couch, which the sea-weed <lb/>
            afforded. “ What shipwrecked person, I wonder," said he, <lb/>
            It repairs to my abode ? Or whom has Fortune compelled <lb/>
            to hope for the aid of our cottage?" Thus having said, <lb/>
            the tow now raised 2 from the dense heap of warm ashes, <lb/>
            he nourished the small spark into kindled flames; free <lb/>
            from care of the warfare, he knew that in civil strife <lb/>
            cottages are no prey. 0 safe the lot of a poor man's life, <lb/>

            befall, to be alarmed with no tumult, the hand of Cæsar <lb/>
            knocking ?</p>
          <p>Then, the door being opened, the chieftain says:­ <lb/>
            “ Look for what is greater than thy moderate wishes, and <lb/>
            give scope to thy hopes, 0 youth. If, obeying my com­ <lb/>

            be owing everything to thy bark, and by thy hands dragging <lb/>
            on a needy old age. Hesitate not to entrust thy fate to <lb/>

            wealtli." <note type="footnote"> 1 With a boat) ver. 518. "Phaselo." The vessel which was called "phase- <lb/>
            Ius” was long and narrow, and probably received its name from its resem­ <lb/>
            blance to the shape of a kidney-bean, which was called " pbaselus." They <lb/>
            were especially used by the Egyptians, and were of various sizes, from that <lb/>
            of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage. Appian mentions them <lb/>
            as being a medium between ships of war and merchant vessels. Being built <lb/>
            for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness than their strength. <lb/>
            Juvenal, Sat. xv. 1. 127, speaks of them as being made of clay; but of <lb/>

          <p>Thus he says, unable to be taught to speak as a private <lb/>
            man, though clad in a plebeian garb. Then says the poor <lb/>
            Amyclas, “ Many things indeed forbid me to trust the deep <lb/>
            to-night. For the sun did not take down into the seas <lb/>
            ruddy clouds, and rays of one hue1; one portion of Phœbus <lb/>
            invited the southern gales, another, with divided, light, the <lb/>
            northern. Dimmed, too, and languid in the middle of his <lb/>
            orb, he set, not dazzling the eyes that looked on him, with <lb/>
            his weakly light. The moon, also, did not rise, shining <lb/>
            with slender horn, or hollowed with clear cavities in her <lb/>
            mid orb; nor did she describe tapering points on her <lb/>
            straitened horn; and with the signs of wind she was red; <lb/>
            besides, pallid, she bears a livid aspect, sad with her face <lb/>
            about to sink beneath the clouds.</p>
          <p>"But neither does the waving of the woods, nor the <lb/>
            lashings of the sea-shore, nor the fitful dolphin, that <lb/>
            challenges the waves 2, please me; nor yet that the sea-gull <lb/>
            loves the dry land; the fact, too, that the heron ventures <lb/>
            to fly aloft, trusting to its hovering wing; and that, <lb/>
            sprinkling its head with the waves, as though it would <lb/>
            forestall the rain, the crow paces the sea-shore with infirm <lb/>
            step. But if the weight of great events demands, I would <lb/>
            not hesitate to lend my aid. Either I will touch the com­ <lb/>
            manded shore, or, on the other hand, the seas and the winds <lb/>
            shall deny it."</p>
          <p>Thus having said and unmooring his craft, he spreads <lb/>
            the canvass to the winds; at the motion of which, not only <lb/>
            meteors gliding along the lofty air, as they fall, describe <lb/>
            tracks in all quarters of the heavens; but even the stars which <lb/>
            are held fixed in the loftiest skies, appear to shake. A <lb/>
            dusky swell pervades the surface of the sea; with many a <lb/>
            heaving along their lengthened track the threatening waves <lb/>
            boil up, uncertain as to the impending blasts; the swelling <lb/>
            seas betoken the winds conceived. Then says the master <lb/>
            of the quivering bark :­ <lb/>
            " Behold, how vast dangers the raging sea is preparing. <lb/>
            Whether it presages the Zephyrs, or whether the east <note type="footnote"> 1 Rays of one hue) ver. 542. “ Concordes radii” may mean either " rays <lb/>

            winds, it is uncertain. On every side the fitful waves are <lb/>
            beating against the bark. In the clouds and in the heavens <lb/>
            are the southern blasts; if we go by the murmurs of the <lb/>
            sea, Corus is skimming along the deep. In a storm thus <lb/>
            mighty neither will bark nor shipwrecked person reach the <lb/>
            Hesperian shores. To despair of making our way, and to <lb/>
            turn from the forbidden course, is our only safety. Let it <lb/>
            be allowed me to make for shore with the tossed bark, lest <lb/>
            the nearest land should be too distant."</p>
          <p>Cæsar, confident that all dangers will give way for him, <lb/>
            says, “ Despise the threats of the deep, and spread sail to <lb/>
            the raging winds. If, heaven prompting thee, thou dost <lb/>
            decline Italy, myself thy prompter, seek it. This alone is <lb/>
            thy reasonable cause for fear, not to have known thy freight; <lb/>
            one whom the Deities never forsake; of whom Fortune <lb/>
            deserves badly then, .when after his wishes expressed she <lb/>
            comes. Secure in my protection, burst through the midst <lb/>
            of the storms. This is the labour of the heavens and of <lb/>
            the sea, not of our bark; that, trod by Cæsar, the freight <lb/>
            will protect from the waves. Nor will long duration be <lb/>
            granted to the raging fury of the winds; this same bark will <lb/>
            advantage the waves. Turn not thy hands; avoid, with <lb/>
            thy sails, the neighbouring shores; believe that then thou <lb/>
            hast gained the Calabrian port, when no other land can be <lb/>
            granted to the ship and to our safety. Art thou ignorant <lb/>
            what, amid a tempest so great, is preparing? Amid the <lb/>
            tumult of the sea and sky, Fortune is enquiring how she <lb/>
            shall favour me."</p>
          <p>No more having said, a furious whirlwind, the stern <lb/>
            being struck, tears away the shrouds rent asunder, and <lb/>
            brings the flapping sails upon the frail mast; the joints <lb/>
            overstrained, the vessel groans. Then rush on perils <lb/>
            gathered together from the whole universe. First, moving <lb/>
            the tides, Corus, thou dost raise thy head from the Atlantic <lb/>
            Ocean ; now, as thou dost lift it, the sea rages, and uplifts <lb/>
            all its billows upon the rocks. The cold Boreas meets it, <lb/>
            and beats back the ocean, and doubtful stands the deep, un­ <lb/>
            decided which wind to obey. But the rage of the Scythian <lb/>
            north wind conquers and hurls aloft the waves, and <lb/>
            makes shallows of the sands entirely concealed. And <lb/>
            Boreas does not carry the waves on to the rocks, and he <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. V. 605-636."/> <lb/>
            dashes his own seas against the billows of Corus; and the <lb/>
            aroused waves, even with the winds lulled, are able to meet <lb/>
            in conflict</p>
          <p>I would surmise that the threats of Eurus were not with­ <lb/>
            held, and that the winds of the South, black with showers, <lb/>
            did not lie beneath the dungeons of the Æolian rocks; that <lb/>
            all, rushing from their wonted quarters, with violent whirl­ <lb/>
            winds defended their own regions, and that thus the ocean <lb/>
            remained in its place. No small seas do they speak of <lb/>
            as having been carried along by the gales; the Tyrrhenian <lb/>
            runs into the Ægean waves; the wandering Adriatic echoes <lb/>
            in the Ionian sea. 0 how often did that day overwhelm <lb/>
            mountains before beaten in vain by the waves ! What lofty <lb/>
            summits did the subdued earth permit to be overcome! <lb/>
            Not on that shore do waves so tremendous rise, and, rolling <lb/>
            from another region of the earth, from the vast ocean have <lb/>
            they come, and the waves that encircle the world speed on <lb/>
            their monstrous billows.</p>
          <p>Thus did the ruler of Olympus aid his wearied light­ <lb/>
            nings against the world with his brother's trident, and the <lb/>
            earth was added to the secondary realms of Neptune, when <lb/>
            Tethys was unwilling to submit to any shores, content to be <lb/>
            bounded by the skies alone. Now as well would the mass <lb/>
            of sea so vast have increased to the stars, if the ruler of the <lb/>
            Gods of heaven had not kept down the waves with clouds. <lb/>
            That was not a night of the heavens2; the air lay concealed <lb/>
            infected with the paleness of the infernal abodes, and, op­ <lb/>
            pressed with storms, was kept down, and the waves received <lb/>
            the showers in the clouds. Even the light so dreadful is <lb/>
            lost, and the lightnings flash not with their brilliance, but <lb/>
            the cloudy atmosphere obscurely divides for their flashes.</p>
          <p>Then do the convex abodes of the Gods of heaven resound, <lb/>
            and the lofty skies re-echo, and, the structure strained, the <lb/>
            poles re-echo. Nature dreads Chaos, the elements seem to <lb/>
            have burst from their concordant repose, and night once more3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Did the ruler of Olympus) ver. 620. The meaning is, that with storms <lb/>

            to return about to mingle the shades below with the Gods of <lb/>
            heaven. The sole hope of safety is, that not as yet have they <lb/>
            perished amid ruin of the universe so great. As far as from <lb/>
            the Leucadian heights the calm deep is beheld below, so far <lb/>
            do the trembling mariners look down upon the headlong <lb/>
            sea from the summits of the waves; and when the swelling <lb/>
            billows gape open once again, hardly does the mast stand <lb/>
            above the surface. The clouds are touched by the sails, and <lb/>
            the earth by the keel. For the sea, in the part where it is <lb/>
            at rest, does not conceal the sands ; it arises in mountains, <lb/>
            and all the waters are in waves. Fears conquer the resources <lb/>
            of art, and the pilot knows not which to break, to which <lb/>
            wave to give way.</p>
          <p>The discord of the sea comes to their aid in their dis­ <lb/>
            tress, and billow is not able to throw over the vessel against <lb/>
            billows; the resisting wave supports the yielding side, and <lb/>
            the bark rises upright amid all the winds. They dread <lb/>
            not the lowly Sason 1 with its shallows, nor yet the rocky <lb/>
            shores of curving Thessaly, and the dangerous harbours of <lb/>
            the Ambracian coast 2; of the summits of rocky Ceraunia <lb/>
            the sailors are in dread. Now does Cæsar believe there to <lb/>
            be a danger worthy of his destiny.</p>
          <p>“ Is it a labour so great," says he, “ with the Gods above <lb/>
            to overwhelm me, whom, sitting in a little bark, they have <lb/>
            assaulted with seas so vast ? If the glory of my end has <lb/>
            been granted to the deep, and I am denied to the warfare, <lb/>
            fearlessly will I receive whatever death, ye Deities, you send <lb/>
            me. Although the day hurried on by the Fates should cut <lb/>
            short my mighty exploits, things great enough have I done. <lb/>
            The nations of the north have I conquered; hostile arms <lb/>
            have I subdued with fear; Rome has beheld Magnus second <lb/>
            to me. The commonalty ordered by me, I have obtained by <lb/>
            warfare the fasces which were denied unto me. No Roman <lb/>

            lifts with the frail bark on high; nor again does it hurl it <lb/>
            down from the lofty heights of the sea, but the wave bears <lb/>
            it along, and casts it on dry land, where the narrow shore <lb/>
            is free from rugged cliffs. At the same moment, the land <lb/>

            occasion of his silent flight. Thronging around their general <lb/>

            tions and not displeasing complaints 3. “ Whither, cruel <lb/>
            Cæsar, has thy rash valour carried thee, or to what fate <lb/>
            abandoning us, valueless lives, didst thou give thy limbs to <lb/>
            be scattered by the reluctant storm? Since the existence and <lb/>
            the safety of so many nations depend upon this life of thine, <lb/>
            and the world so great has made thee its head, it is cruelty <lb/>
            to wish to die. Did no one of thy followers deserve, not to <lb/>
            be able to be a survivor of thy fate? When the sea was <lb/>
            hurrying thee along, slothful slumber was in possession of <lb/>
            our bodies. Alas! we are ashamed! This was the cause <lb/>
            of thy seeking Hesperia; it seemed cruel to commit any <note type="footnote"> 1 A tenth wave) ver. 672. It was a notion among the ancients that every <lb/>
            tenth wave (probably reckoning from the beginning of the storm) was more <lb/>

            El. 2,11. 49, 50 :—" The wave that is now coming on o'ertops all the others; <lb/>
            'tis the one that comes after the ninth and before the eleventh." He also <lb/>

            not that thou shouldst be ruler of the world, not chief of <lb/>
            the state, but fortunate in shipwreck?" Uttering such <lb/>
            things, the night dispersed, the day with its sunshine came <lb/>
            upon them, and the wearied deep lulled the swelling waves, <lb/>

            close together, the fleet united, just as a troop on land. But <lb/>
            relentless night took away from the sailors the steadiness of <lb/>

            to be able to bear up against the violence of the storm; and although we <lb/>

            on the coast of Epirus, at the month of the river Drilon. It was situate on <lb/>
            a hill, and had a strongly-fortified citadel, which was considered impregnable. <lb/>
            Cæsar, in the Civil War, B. iii. c. 26, thus relates the circumstances here <lb/>
            referred to:—" Our men, taking advantage of the favour of fortune, for they <lb/>
            were still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if the wind abated, <lb/>
            having come near a port called Nymphæum, about three miles beyond Lissus, <lb/>
            put into it (this port is protected from a south-west wind, but is not secure <lb/>
            against a south wind); and they thought less danger was to be apprehended <lb/>
            from the storm than from the enemy. But as soon as they were in harbour, <lb/>
            the south wind, which had blown for two days, by extraordinary good luck <lb/>
            veered round to the south-west. Here one might observe the sudden turn of <lb/>
            Fortune. We who, a moment before, were alarmed for ourselves, were <lb/>
            safely lodged in a very secure harbour; and they who had threatened ruin to <lb/>
            our fleet were forced to be uneasy on their own account; and thus, by a <lb/>
            change of circumstances, the storm protected our ships, and damaged the <lb/>
            Rhodian fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships, sixteen in number, <lb/>
            foundered without exception, and were wrecked; and of the prodigious num­ <lb/>
            ber of seamen and soldiers, some lost their lives by being dashed against the <lb/>
            rocks, others were taken by our men; but Cæsar sent them all safe home." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Made for Nymphœum) ver. 720. Nymphæum was the name of several <lb/>
            places. The one here mentioned was a port and Promontory on the coast of <lb/>
            Illyricum, three Roman miles from Lissus. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The waves exposed) ver. 720. By “ undas," literally “ waves," the Poet <lb/>
            means the harbour of Nymphæum. His meaning is that the harbour was <lb/>
            exposed to the north wind, by means of which Cæsar's ships had entered it; <lb/>
            immediately after which the wind veered to the south, by reason of which <lb/>
            the ships were secure. Cæsar makes the wind to veer from south to south- <lb/>
            west, Lucan from north to south. </note> <pb n="197"/>

            doubtful and anxious as to the result of battles; thy wife <lb/>

            the close of the night, the repose of slumber banished, white <lb/>

            are downward speeding. 'Tis enough to have heard of <lb/>

            let us sever the union of our marriage torch; let us appease <lb/>
            thy father-in-law. Has, Magnus, my fidelity been thus ex­ <lb/>
            perienced by thee? And dost thou believe that anything <lb/>

            ruin so mighty? Does my lot seem a tranquil one to thee, <lb/>
            to be perishing with apprehension, when even now thou art <lb/>
            entertaining hopes ? As I shall be reluctant to be the slave <lb/>

            fessing it; I fear to be able to endure it. But if my prayers <lb/>
            are realized, and I am heard by the Gods, last of all will thy <lb/>

          <p>Cæsar, being unable to bring Pompey to a battle, marches to seize Dyrr­ <lb/>
            hachium, 1-14. Pompey intercepts him on his march, 15-18. The <lb/>
            situation of the city is described, 19-28. Caesar surrounds the city <lb/>
            and the forces of Pompey with vast outworks, 29-63. Pompey sal­ <lb/>
            lies forth to interrupt the works, 64-79. A famine and pestilence arise <lb/>
            in his army, 80-105. The army of Cæsar also suffers from famine, 106- <lb/>
            117. Pompey attempts to break through the outworks, 118-124. He is <lb/>
            at first successful in his attempts, 125-139. But is driven back by Scæva, <lb/>
            140-144. Whose praises are sung by the Poet, 145-148. Scæva exhorts <lb/>
            his comrades, 149-165. While bravely fighting, he is pierced by an <lb/>
            arrow, 166-227. He requests to be carried to the camp of Pompey, 228- <lb/>
            235. Deceived by his stratagem, Aulus is slain by him, 235-239. The <lb/>
            words of Scæva, 240-246. His wounds are described, and his praises de­ <lb/>
            scanted upon, 247-262. Pompey attacks the outworks nearer to the sea, <lb/>
            263-278. Cæsar prepares to renew the engagement, 278-289. At the <lb/>
            approach of Pompey, the troops of Cæsar are in alarm, 290-299. Pompey <lb/>
            neglects to follow up his successes, 299-313. Cæsar repairs to Thessaly, <lb/>
            and is followed by Pompey, 314-332. The situation of Thessaly is <lb/>
            described, 333-412. Both sides pitch their camps, the troops anxiously <lb/>
            awaiting the event, 413-419. Sextus, the son of Pompey, is urged by <lb/>
            fear to enquire into the destinies of futurity by means of magic arts, 420- <lb/>
            434. The Thessalian incantations are described, 434-506. Erictho, a <lb/>
            Thessalian enchantress, and her rites, are described, 507-569. Sextus <lb/>
            repairs to her at night, 570-588. He addresses her, and requests her to <lb/>
            disclose to him the future, 589-603. She promises him that she will do <lb/>
            so, 604-623. A dead body is chosen for her to restore to life, and is <lb/>
            dragged to her cave, 624-641. The cave of Erictho is described, 642-653. <lb/>
            Commencing her incantations, she reproaches the attendants of Sextus, <lb/>
            654 660. By her incantations and magic skill she raises the dead body <lb/>
            to life, 667-761. She requests it to disclose the future, 702-774. It <lb/>
            discloses the woes of Rome, and of the adherents of Pompey in particular, <lb/>
            775-820. The body is then burned, and Sextus returns to the camp, <lb/>
            820-830.</p>

            any prosperous warfare except against his son-in-law. In <lb/>
            all his prayers he asks for the hour so fatal to the world, <lb/>
            that is to bring everything to a crisis. The die of destiny <lb/>
            that is to sink the head of the one or the other alone pleases <lb/>
            him. Three times on the hills he draws out all his troops1 <lb/>
            and his standards that threaten battle, testifying that he is <lb/>
            never wanting to the downfall of Latium.</p>
          <p>When he beholds that his son-in-law can be aroused by <lb/>
            no alarms to battle, but confides in his close entrench­ <lb/>

            through fields o'erspread with woods, with headlong haste <lb/>
            he marches to seize the towers of Dyrrhachium. This <lb/>
            march Magnus forestalls by following the sea-line, and <note type="footnote"> for they had seen the ships sail past Apollonia and Dyrrhachium. They <lb/>
            directed their march after them by land ; but at first they were ignorant to <lb/>
            what part they had been carried; but when they were informed of it, they <lb/>
            each adopted a different plan : Cæsar, to form a junction with Antony as <lb/>
            soon as possible; Pompey, to oppose Antony's forces on their march to <lb/>
            Cæsar, and, if possible, to fall upon them unexpectedly from ambush; and <lb/>
            the same day they both led out their armies from their winter encampment <lb/>
            along the river Apsus, Pompey secretly by night, Cæsar openly by day. <lb/>
            But Cæsar had to march a longer distance round, along the river, to find a <lb/>
            ford. Pompey's route being clear, because he was not obliged to cross <lb/>
            the river, he advanced rapidly and by forced marches, against Antony, and <lb/>
            being informed of his approach, chose a convenient situation, where he posted <lb/>
            his forces; and kept his men close within camp and forbade fires to be <lb/>
            kindled, that his arrival might be the more secret. An account of this was <lb/>
            immediately carried to Antony by the Greeks. He dispatched messengers <lb/>
            to Cæsar and confined himself in his camp, for one day. The next day <lb/>
            Cæsar came up with him. On learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his <lb/>
            being hemmed in between two armies, quitted his position, and moved with <lb/>
            all his forces to Asparagium, in the territory of Dyrrhachium, and there en­ <lb/>
            camped in a convenient situation." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Draws out all his troops) ver. 8. These circumstances are thus related <lb/>
            by Cæsar in the Civil War, B. iii. c. 41:—" As soon as Cæsar heard that <lb/>

            having taken the capital of the Parthenians on his march, where there was <lb/>
            a garrison of Pompey's, he reached Pompey in Macedonia on the third day, <lb/>
            and encamped beside him; and on the day following, having drawn out all <lb/>
            his forces before his camp, he offered Pompey battle. But perceiving that <lb/>
            he kept within his trenches he led his army back to the camp, and thought <lb/>
            about pursuing some other plan." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dyrrhachium) ver. 14. This is the same city which is called Epidamnus <lb/>

            are broken down, and Cæsar draws the work on a level <lb/>

            Then drawing a fortification from one fort to the other, as the nature of <lb/>
            each position allowed, he began to draw a line of circumvallation around <lb/>
            Pompey ; and with these views, as he had but a small quantity of corn, <lb/>
            and Pompey was strong in cavalry, that he might furnish his army with <lb/>

            namely, to possess himself of as many hills as he could, and cover as great an <lb/>
            extent of country as possible with his troops, and divide Cæsar's forces as much <lb/>
            as possible; and so it happened ; for having raised twenty-four forts, and taken <lb/>
            in a compass of fifteen miles, he got forage in this space, and within this circuit <lb/>
            there were several fields lately sown, in which the cattle might feed in the <lb/>

            of communication from one fort to another, were afraid that Pompey's men <lb/>
            would sally out from some part and attack us on the rear; so the enemy were <lb/>
            making a continued fortification in a circuit within ours, to prevent us from <lb/>
            breaking in on any side, or surrounding them in the rear. But they com­ <lb/>
            pleted their wokrs first; both because they had a greater number of men, and <lb/>
            because they had a smaller compass to enclose." </note> <pb n="207"/>

            of the grain." Cæsar, however, acknowledges, in c. 47, that, " having <lb/>

            soldiers bore all with uncommon patience." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And tearing from, unknown roots) ver. 113. He probably refers to <lb/>

            " There was a kind of root called 'chara,' discovered by the troops which <lb/>
            served under Valerius. This they mixed up with milk, and it greatly con­ <lb/>

            great plenty of it, loaves made thereof, when Pompey's men upbraided ours <lb/>

            on this occasion that Pompey, on seeing the loaves, exclaimed that surely he <lb/>

            Then did the hurled torches roll down pitchy fires; then did <lb/>

            groaned at the frequent blows of the oak battered against <lb/>

            less nimble than that which hurries the swift leopard on the <lb/>
            tops of the hunting spears. Then, compressed amid the <lb/>
            dense masses and hemmed in by all the war, whatever foe <lb/>
            he looks upon he conquers. And now, the ; point of the <lb/>
            sword of Scæva, blunted and through clotted blood, no <lb/>
            longer sharp, bruises the smitten foe, and wounds him not 1. <lb/>
            The sword loses its use, and breaks limbs without a wound2. <lb/>
            Him does the entire mass aim at, at him do all the wea­ <lb/>

            aimed, and Fortune beholds a new r pair of combatants <lb/>
            meeting together, an army and a man. The stout shield <lb/>
            resounds with frequent blows, and the compressed fragments <lb/>
            of the hollow helmet bruise his temples; nor does anything <lb/>
            now protect3 his exposed vitals, except the darts that pro­ <lb/>
            trude on the surface of his bones.</p>

            you waste wounds that will never attach to the vital parts ? <lb/>
            Let either the wild-fire4 hurled from the twisted cords over­ <lb/>

            many of the warfare, and, bearing a dense thicket of darts <lb/>
            on his breast, with now flagging steps he chooses an enemy <lb/>
            on whom to fall.</p>
          <p>Like was he to the monsters of the deep1. Thus the <lb/>
            beast of the Libyan land, thus the Libyan elephant, <lb/>
            overwhelmed by dense arms, breaks every missile as it <lb/>
            bounds off from his rough back, and moving his skin <lb/>
            shakes forth the darts that stick there; his entrails lie safe <lb/>
            concealed within, and without blood do the darts stand in <lb/>
            the pierced wild beast; wounds made by arrows so many, <lb/>
            by javelins so many, suffice not for a single death. Behold ! <lb/>
            afar, a Gortynian shaft is aimed against Scæva by a Dictæan <lb/>
            hand2, which, more unerring than all expectation, descends <lb/>
            upon his head and into the ball of the left eye. He tears <lb/>
            away the impediment of the weapon and the ligaments of <lb/>
            the nerves, fearlessly plucking forth the arrow fastened in <lb/>
            the eye-ball hanging to it, and tramples upon the weapon <lb/>

            did not see him holding his sword with the point upright; <lb/>
            and, about to bear away both the body of the prisoner <lb/>
            and his arms, he received his lightning blade in the middle <lb/>
            of his throat. His valour waxed hot, and by one slaughter <lb/>
            refreshed, he said :­ <note type="footnote"> amentavit habena." The spears of the ancients, both those used in war and <lb/>
            in the chase, often had a thong of feather tied to the middle of the shaft, <lb/>
            which was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγϰύλη</foreign> by the Greeks, and by the Romans "amentum," <lb/>
            and was of assistance in throwing the spear. It is not known how the <lb/>
            "amentum" added either to the force or the correctness of the aim in the <lb/>
            use of the spear; but it has been suggested that it was through imparting <lb/>
            volution to it, and perhaps thereby giving it steadiness in its course. This <lb/>
            is rendered more probable from the frequent use of the verb " torquere," <lb/>

            stance occurred to prevent the ruin of our whole army, namely, that Pompey, <lb/>
            suspecting an ambuscade (because, as I suppose, his success had far exceeded <lb/>
            his hopes, as he had seen his men, a moment before, flying from the camp), <lb/>
            did not dare for some time to approach the fortification, and that his horse <lb/>

            probably founded on the supposition of the existence of the so-called threads <lb/>

            The soldiers prepare for battle, 124-150. Portentous signs appear, 151- <lb/>
            184. Distant nations are made aware of the impending catastrophe, 185- <lb/>
            213. The army of Pompey is described, 214-234. Cæsar's delight on <lb/>
            seeing them preparing for battle, 235-249. He harangues his soldiers, <lb/>
            250-329. They prepare for battle, 330-336. Pompey harangues his <lb/>
            army, 337-384. The Poet laments the approaching slaughter, 385-459. <lb/>
            The soldiers hesitate on both sides on recognizing each other, 460-469. <lb/>
            Crastinus, a soldier in Cæsar's army, commences the battle, 470-475. <lb/>
            The beginning of the battle is described, 476-505. Cæsar attacks <lb/>
            the army of Pompey in flank, and the cavalry is repulsed, 506-544. <lb/>
            The centre of Pompey's army offers a stronger resistance, 545-550. The <lb/>
            Poet is averse to describe the scenes of horror there perpetrated, 551-556. <lb/>
            Caesar exhorts his men to deeds of valour, 557-585. It is the design <lb/>
            of Brutus to slay Caesar, 586-596. Multitudes of the Patricians are slain, <lb/>
            among whom is Domitius, 597-616. The Poet laments the carnage, 617- <lb/>

            The bodies of Pompey's troops lie unburied, a prey to birds and wild beasts, <lb/>
            787-846. The Poet concludes with imprecations against the scene of <lb/>

            that he himself was adorning the Temple of Venus Victrix, or " the Victo­ <lb/>

            by this dream; but the latter feeling was predominant, inasmuch as he feared <lb/>
            lest the adorning a place consecrated to Venus should be performed by Cæsar <lb/>

            being too fond of his sway over monarchs gathered from all regions of the <lb/>

            the “King of kings." Caesar, in his account of the Civil War, B. iii. c. 82, <lb/>
            confirms the present statement of Lucan. “The forces of Pompey, being <lb/>
            thus augmented by the troops of Scipio, their former expectations were con­ <lb/>
            firmed, and their hopes of victory so much increased, that whatever time <lb/>

            despotic sway over them, and that they are only your obedient soldiers, or <lb/>
            whether you look upon them as your equals and sharers in the command." <lb/>
            This is the old interpretation, but Lemaire suggests another, which seems <lb/>
            much more consistent with probability: “Do you look upon the Senators as <lb/>
            soldiers who have placed themselves under your command, ready to fight, or <lb/>
            merely as fellow travellers, forsooth, in your journey and flight from the <lb/>
            arms of Cæsar ?” </note> <pb n="254"/>

            whether they are to follow thee as soldiers or whether as <lb/>
            companions.”</p>
          <p>The leader groaned, and perceived that this was a subter­ <lb/>
            fuge of the Gods, and that the Destinies were opposed to <lb/>
            his own feelings.</p>
          <p>" If this is the pleasure of all” he said; “if the occasion <lb/>
            requires Magnus as a soldier, not a general, no further will <lb/>
            I delay the Fates. In one ruin let Fortune involve the <lb/>
            nations, and let this day be to a large portion of mankind <lb/>
            the very last. Still, Rome, I call thee to witness, that <lb/>
            Magnus has received1, the day on which all things came to <lb/>
            ruin. The labour of the war might have cost thee no wound2; <lb/>
            it might have delivered up the leader, subdued without <lb/>
            slaughter and a captive, to violated peace3. What frenzy is <lb/>
            this in crimes, 0 ye, blind to fate? Do they dread to wage <lb/>
            a civil war, so as not to conquer with blood ? The earth we <lb/>
            have wrested from him4, from the whole ocean we have <lb/>
            excluded him; his famishing troops we have compelled <lb/>
            to premature rapine of the crops5; and in the enemy have <lb/>
            we wrought the wish to prefer to be slaughtered with swords, <lb/>
            and to mingle the deaths of his partisans with my own.</p>
          <p>" A great part of the warfare has been accomplished in <lb/>
            those measures, by which it has been brought about that the <lb/>
            raw recruit is in no dread of the combat, if only under the <lb/>
            excitement of valour and in the heat of resentment they de­ <lb/>
            mand the standards to be raised. The very fear of an evil <lb/>

            this head, if without the ruin of the state and the downfall <lb/>
            of the party, it were about to fall; for not more joyous to <lb/>

            and gives loose rein to them as they rage with anger; and <lb/>
            just as the mariner, overpowered by the boisterous Corus, <lb/>

            circumstances here alluded to, in the Civil War, B. iii.. c. 75:—"Cæsar, <lb/>
            seeing no likelihood of being able to bring Pompey to an action, judged it <lb/>
            the most expedient method of conducting the war, to decamp from that post, <lb/>

            corn, and also, that by being in motion he might get some opportunity of <lb/>
            forcing them to battle, and, by constant marches, harass Pompey's army, <lb/>
            which was not accustomed to fatigue. These matters being settled, when <lb/>
            the signal for marching was given, and the tents struck, it was observed that <lb/>
            shortly before, contrary to his daily practice, Pompey's army had advanced <lb/>
            further than usual from his entrenchments, so that it appeared possible to <lb/>

            had sent out three legions the night before, to forage, which, on perceiving <lb/>

          <p>Cæsar having hardly said all this 2, his duties attract each <lb/>

            of the Poet, to show the determination with which the troops of Cæsar <lb/>
            began the engagement. Caesar, in his Civil War, B. iii. c. 89, gives the <lb/>
            following account of his line of battle:—" Cæsar, observing his former <lb/>
            custom, had placed the tenth legion on the right, the ninth on the left, <lb/>
            although it was very much weakened by the battles at Dyrrhachium. <lb/>
            He placed the eighth legion so close to the ninth as to almost make one of <lb/>
            the two, and ordered them to support one another. He drew up on the field <lb/>
            eighty cohorts, making a total of twenty-two thousand men. He left two <lb/>
            cohorts to guard the camp; he gave the command of the left wing to Antony, <lb/>
            of the right to P. Sulla, and of the centre to Cn. Domitius; he himself took <lb/>
            his post opposite Pompey. At the same time, fearing, from the disposition </note> <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. VII. 332-360."/> <lb/>
            stand, with no disposition made by their general; everything <lb/>
            they leave to destiny. If in the direful combat you had <lb/>
            placed so many fathers-in-law of Magnus, and so many <lb/>
            aspiring to the sway of their own city, not with course so <lb/>
            precipitate would they have rushed to the combat.</p>
          <p>When Pompey beheld the hostile troops coming forth <lb/>
            straight on, and allowing no respite for the war, but that <lb/>
            the day was pleasing to the Gods of heaven, with frozen <lb/>
            heart he stood astounded ; and for a chieftain so great thus <lb/>
            to dread arms was ominous. Then he repressed his fears, <lb/>
            and, borne on a stately steed along all the ranks, he said :­ <lb/>
            " The day which your valour demands, the end of the <lb/>
            civil warfare which you have looked for, is at hand. Show <lb/>
            forth all your might; the last work of the sword is at hand, <lb/>
            and one hour drags on nations to their fate. Whoever looks <lb/>
            for his country and his dear household Gods; who looks for <lb/>
            his offspring, and conjugal endearments, and his deserted <lb/>
            pledges of affection, let him seek them with the sword; <lb/>
            everything has the Deity set at stake in the midst of tho <lb/>
            plain. Our cause the better one bids us hope for the Gods <lb/>
            of heaven as favouring; they themselves will direct the <lb/>
            darts through the vitals of Cæsar; they themselves will be <lb/>
            desirous with this blood to ratify the Roman laws. If they <lb/>
            had been ready to grant to my father-in-law kingly sway and <lb/>
            the world, they were able, by fatality, to hurry on my old age. <lb/>
            It is not the part of the Gods, angered at nations and the <lb/>
            City, to preserve Pompey as their leader.</p>
          <p>" Everything that could possibly conquer have we con­ <lb/>

            times would permit the Curii and the Camilli to come back, <lb/>
            and the Decii, who devoted their lives to death, on this side <lb/>
            would they take their stand. Nations collected from the <note type="footnote"> of the enemy which we have previously mentioned, lest his right wing might <lb/>
            be surrounded by their numerous cavalry, he rapidly drafted a single cohort <lb/>
            from each of the legions of the third line, formed of them a fourth line, and <lb/>
            set them opposite to Pompey's cavalry, and, acquainting them with his wishes, <lb/>
            admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage. <lb/>
            At the same time be ordered the third line, and the entire army, not to <lb/>
            charge without his command; that he would give them the signal whenever <lb/>
            be wished them to do so." </note> <pb n="269"/>

            men there are included within the limits of the heavens1 that <lb/>

            we, arms do we wield. Shall we not with our wings extended <lb/>
            around place the collected foe in the midst of us? Few <lb/>
            right hands does victory require; and many troops will <lb/>
            only wage the warfare with their shouts. Cæsar suffices <lb/>
            not for our arms 2.</p>
          <p>" Think that your mothers, hanging over the summits <lb/>
            of the walls of the City, with their dishevelled hair, are en­ <lb/>
            couraging you to battle. Think that a Senate, aged, and <lb/>
            forbidden by years to follow arms, are prostrating at your <lb/>
            feet their hallowed hoary locks; and that Rome herself, <lb/>
            dreading a tyrant, comes to meet you. Think that that <lb/>
            which now is the people, and that which shall be the people, <lb/>
            are offering their mingled prayers. Free does this mul­ <lb/>
            titude wish to be born; free does that wish to die. If, after <lb/>
            pledges so great, there is any room for Pompey, suppliant <lb/>
            with my offspring and my wife, if with the majesty of com­ <lb/>
            mand preserved it were possible, I would throw myself <lb/>
            before your feet. I, Magnus, unless you conquer, an exile, <lb/>
            the scorn of my father-in-law, your own disgrace, do earn­ <lb/>
            estly deprecate my closing destinies, and the disastrous <lb/>
            years of the latest period of my life, that I may not, an <lb/>

            War, B. iii. c. 91, thus relates the circumstance here alluded to :—" There <lb/>
            was in Cæsar's army a volunteer of the name of Crastinus, who the year <lb/>
            before had been first centurion of the tenth legion, a roan of distinguished <lb/>
            bravery. He, when the signal was given, said, ' Follow me, my old <lb/>
            comrades, and display such exertions in behalf of your general as you have <lb/>
            resolved to display ; this is our last battle, and when it shall have been won, <lb/>
            he will recover his dignity, and we our liberty.' At the same time he <lb/>
            looked back towards Cæsar, and said, ' General, I will act in such a man­ <lb/>
            ner to-day, that you will feel grateful to me, living or dead.' After utter­ <lb/>
            ing these words he was the first to charge on the right wing, and about one <lb/>
            hundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed." In <lb/>
            c. 94, Cæsar says, " In this battle, Crastinus, of whom mention was made <lb/>
            before, fighting most courageously, lost his life by the wound of a sword in <lb/>
            the mouth; nor was that false which he declared when marching to battle; <lb/>

            this critical moment, for they received our javelins, stood our charge, and <lb/>
            maintained their ranks; and, having launched their javelins, had recourse to <lb/>

            disposed in deep bodies, joined their arms, their shields <lb/>
            closed together in a line 1; and, hardly able to find room <lb/>
            for moving their right hands and their darts, they stood <lb/>
            close, and, wedged together, kept their swords sheathed.</p>
          <p>With headlong course the furious troops of Cæsar are <lb/>
            impelled against the dense masses, and, through arms, <lb/>
            through the foe do they seek a passage. Where the .twisted <lb/>
            coat of mail2 presents its links, and the breast, beneath <lb/>
            a safe covering, lies concealed, even here do they reach <lb/>
            the entrails, and amid so many arms it is the vitals <lb/>
            which each one pierces. Civil war does the one army <lb/>
            suffer, the other wage; on the one hand the sword stands <lb/>

            had given an order that aim should be taken at the faces of all indis­ <lb/>

            Brutus, probably for the sake of his mother Servilia, who had implored Cæsar <lb/>
            to spare him. After the battle Brutus escaped to Larissa, but did not accom­ <lb/>

          <p>He spoke, but the breath of Domitius struggling in his <lb/>
            breast sufficed him for a voice, and he thus opened his dying <lb/>
            lips : “Beholding thee, Cæsar, not yet in possession of the <lb/>
            direful reward of thy crimes, but doubtful of thy fate, and <lb/>
            less mighty than thy son-in-law, I go to the shades free <lb/>

            subdued in the ruthless warfare, and to be about to pay a <lb/>
            heavy penalty to Pompey and to us, while I die, it is allowed <lb/>
            me to hope." Life fled from him having said no more, and <lb/>
            dense shades pressed upon his eyes.</p>
          <p>I scruple to expend tears at the downfall of the world <lb/>
            upon deaths innumerable, and, tracing them out, to enquire <lb/>
            into individual fates; through whose vitals the deadly wound <lb/>
            made its way; who it was that trod upon entrails scattered <lb/>
            on the ground; who, the hostile sword being thrust into his <lb/>
            jaws, dying, breathed forth his soul; who fell down at the <lb/>
            blow; who, while his limbs dropped down, lopped off, stood <lb/>
            upright; who received the darts right through the breast, or <lb/>
            whom the lance pinned to the plain; whose blood, the veins <lb/>
            being severed, gushed through the air, and fell upon the <lb/>
            arms of his foe; who pierced the breast of his brother, and <lb/>
            that he might be able to spoil the well-known carcase, threw <lb/>
            afar the head cut off; who mangled the features of a parent, <lb/>
            and by his extreme fury would prove to lookers-on that he <lb/>
            whom he stabbed was not his father.</p>
          <p>No death is deserving of a lament its own, and no indi­ <lb/>
            viduals have we the leisure to mourn. Pharsalia had not <lb/>
            those features of combat which other slaughters had1; there <lb/>
            did Rome perish by the fates of individuals, here by mul­ <lb/>
            titudes; that which was there the death of a soldier, was <lb/>
            here that of a nation; there flowed Achæan blood, Pontic <lb/>
            and Assyrian; the gore of all did the Roman torrent forbid <lb/>
            to remain and stagnate upon the plain. Greater wounds do <lb/>
            nations receive from this battle-field than their own times <lb/>

          <p>Now had the wretched Magnus perceived that the Gods <lb/>
            and the destinies of Rome had forsaken him; hardly pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon by the whole slaughter to rebuke his own for­ <lb/>
            tune. He stood upon a rising ground of the plain, on <lb/>

            the Thessalian fields, which, while the battle hindered, lay <lb/>
            concealed. With weapons so many he beheld his destinies <lb/>
            attacked, so many bodies lying prostrate, and himself pe­ <lb/>
            rishing with bloodshed so great. Nor yet, as is the way of <lb/>
            the unfortunate, does he take pleasure in dragging, together <lb/>
            with himself, everything to sink, by involving nations in his <lb/>
            own ruin; that after himself the greatest part of the Latian <lb/>
            multitude may survive, he endures even yet to deem the <lb/>
            inhabitants of heaven worthy of his prayers, and reflects <lb/>
            upon this solace of his misfortune</p>
          <p>“Forbear, ye Gods of heaven," he says, “to lay all na­ <lb/>

            them back as they rush upon a speedy death, and denies <lb/>

            chieftain the earth may fall; or else from Cæsar’s eyes he <note type="footnote"> 1 Reflects upon this solace of his misfortune) ver. 658. Revolves in his <lb/>

            to join Cornelia, whose apprehensions are described, 35-49. He <lb/>

            him, amid the regrets of the inhabitants, 147-158. At night he ad­ <lb/>
            dresses the pilot of the ship and orders him to avoid the coasts of Italy <lb/>
            and Thessaly, and to leave to fortune the course of the ship, 159-201. He <lb/>
            despatches Deiotarus to seek aid for his cause, 202-243. And then sails past <lb/>
            Ephesus, Samoa, Rhodes, Pamphylia, and Taurus, 244-255. Arriving in <lb/>
            Cilicia he addresses his companions, and recommends them to take refuge <lb/>
            with Phraates, the king of Partbia, as he suspects the fidelity of the Egyp­ <lb/>
            tians and Numidians, 256-327. He is opposed by Lentulus, who advises <lb/>
            him to take refuge with Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, 328-455. He follows <lb/>
            the advice of Lentulus, and proceeds to Pelusium, 456-466. The ministers <lb/>
            of Ptolemy are in trepidation, and deliberate what steps to take, 467-475. <lb/>
            Pothinus urges the King to slay Pompey, 476-535. Achillas is commis­ <lb/>
            sioned by Ptolemy to do so, 536-538. The Poet expresses his grief and <lb/>
            indignation, 539-560. Pompey goes on board a small boat for the shore, <lb/>
            561-595. He is there murdered in the sight of Cornelia by Septimius <lb/>
            and Achillas, 596-620. His last words, 621-636. The lamentations <lb/>
            of Cornelia, 637-662. Septimius cuts off his head, and gives it to <lb/>
            Achillas, who carries it to Ptolemy, 663-686. By whose order it is <lb/>
            embalmed, 687-691. The Poet deplores the fate of Pompey, 692-711. <lb/>
            Cordus, an attendant of Pompey, burns the body on the shore, and bury­ <lb/>
            ing the bones places over them a stone with an inscription, 712-793. The <lb/>
            Poet again laments his fate, and concludes with imprecations against <lb/>
            treacherous Egypt, 794-872.</p>

            able by no enemy in his powers of flight; but where the <lb/>
            earth swells he will not ascend the rugged mountain ridges; <lb/>
            nor will he wage the warfare in darkening shades, weak <lb/>
            with his uncertain bow, nor by swimming cleave the current <lb/>
            with its strong eddies ; nor, besprinkled in battle over all <lb/>
            his limbs with blood, will he endure the summer's sun be­ <lb/>
            neath the heated dust. No battering-rams have they, no <lb/>

            bows from afar, and to leave their wounds to the winds, <lb/>
            wherever they choose to carry them. The sword requires <lb/>
            strength, and every nation that exists of men wages the <lb/>
            warfare with the sword; but the Medians the first onset <lb/>
            disarms, and their emptied quivers bid them retreat. No <lb/>

            Ptolemy, a minor, was there with a considerable army, engaged in war with <lb/>
            his sister Cleopatra, whom, a few months before, by the assistance of his <lb/>
            relations and friends, he had expelled from the kingdom ; and her camp lay <lb/>
            at a small distance from his. To him Pompey applied to be permitted to <lb/>
            take refuge in Alexandria, and to be protected in his calamity by his <lb/>
            powerful assistance, in consideration of the friendship and good feeling which <lb/>
            had subsisted between his father and him. But Pompey's deputies having <lb/>
            executed their commission, began to converse with less restraint with the <lb/>
            king's troops, and to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey, and not <lb/>
            to think meanly of his bad fortune. In Ptolemy's army were several of <lb/>
            Pompey's soldiers, of whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria, and <lb/>
            had brought them over to Alexandria, and, at the conclusion of the war, had <lb/>

            that break them, which forbid foreign fleets to approach the <lb/>

            ordination, forced Magnus, condemned to destruction, unto <lb/>
            the shore, to no one of his attendants were wanting omens <lb/>

            fess that the majestic gracefulness of his hallowed form still <lb/>
            remained, and that his features were angered at the Gods, <lb/>
            and that the last moments of death changed nothing of the <lb/>
            mien and features of the hero. But ruthless Septimius <lb/>
            in this act of villany invents a villany still greater; and, <lb/>
            the covering cut asunder1, he uncovers the sacred features <lb/>
            of the half-dead Magnus, and lays hold of the breathing <lb/>
            head, and places the languid neck crosswise upon a bench. <lb/>
            Then he cuts the nerves and veins, and is long in breaking <lb/>
            the knotty bones; not as yet was it an art to whip off a <lb/>
            head with the sword.</p>
          <p>. But after the neck, divided, shrunk back from the trunk, <lb/>

            Philippus, Pompey's freedman, who had accompanied him from the ship. He <lb/>
            made the funeral pile with pieces of wreck which he found on the sea-shore, <lb/>

            assisted him, having served under Pompey in his youth. It is just possible <lb/>
            that his name may have been Cordus, which was not an uncommon cognomen <lb/>
            among the Romans. The word " quæstor” has been thought to mean that <lb/>

            wood from beneath the limbs, he says: “ Whoever thou art, <lb/>

          <p>Affection compels him to place the finishing stroke to <lb/>

            unconsumed he quenches them with sea-water, and, col­ <lb/>
            lected together, encloses them in a little spot of earth. <lb/>
            Then, that the light breeze may not bear away the ashes <lb/>
            uncovered, he presses down the sand with a stone; and <lb/>
            that the sailor may not disturb the grave for fastening the <lb/>

            unburied, he should be haunted by his ghost; and because he might <lb/>
            deem it a greater disgrace to Pompey's remains to be entombed in this homely <lb/>
            manner than to be deprived of burial altogether. Another reason would <lb/>
            be that, in consequence of the burial, Cæsar would feel more sure of his <lb/>

            reference to the orders given by Pompey and the Senate to the Proconsul <lb/>

            1. 747. Apuleius tells us that the worship of Isis was introduced at Rome <lb/>
            in the time of Sulla. Many enactments were passed to check the licentious­ <lb/>
            ness of her worship, but were resisted by the populace. It was, in a great <lb/>
            measure, kept without the City walls. The most important Temple was <lb/>
            in the Campus Martins, whence she obtained the epithet of Isis Campensis. <lb/>

            at least, receive the bones of thy Magnus, if, not yet rooted <lb/>

            Some writers say that it was Mercury who was thus represented, and that <lb/>
            this form was given him in remembrance of the fact of Isis having em­ <lb/>
            ployed dogs in her search for Osiris, when he was slain by his brother <lb/>
            Typhon. Other anthers say that Anubis was the son of Osiris, and that he <lb/>
            distinguished himself with a helmet wearing the figure of a dog, when he <lb/>
            followed his father to battle. Herodotus mentions the worship of dogs by <lb/>
            the Egyptians. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The sistra commanding grief) ver. 832. The "sistrum" was a mystical <lb/>
            musical instrument, used by the ancient Egyptians in the worship of Isis, <lb/>
            and other ceremonials. It was shaken with the hand, and emitted a tink­ <lb/>
            ling sound. Plutarch tells us that the shaking of its four cross-bars was <lb/>
            supposed to represent the agitation of the four elements, earth, air, fire, and <lb/>
            water; and that the cat which was usually sculptured on the end of it, <lb/>
            represented the moon. Apuleius says that these instruments were sometimes <lb/>
            made of silver, and even of gold. It was introduced at Rome with the wor­ <lb/>
            ship of Isis, and it is said to be used in Nubia and Abyssinia at the present <lb/>
            day. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And Osiris, whom) ver. 833. Osiris was the chief male Divinity of the <lb/>
            Egyptians, and the husband of Isis. Heliodorus says that he was God of <lb/>

            the ashes scattered perchance upon the surface of the sands <lb/>

          <p>The soul of Pompey, leaving the tomb, soars to the abodes of the Blessed, <lb/>
            and thence looking down upon the earth inspires the breasts of Brutus and <lb/>
            Cato, 1-23. Cato, with the remnant of Pompey'a forces, repairs to Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra, 24-35. And thence to Crete and Africa, where he meets the fleet <lb/>
            of Pompey with Cornelia, 36-50. She, having beheld the death of her <lb/>
            husband and the funeral pile, has been reluctant to leave the shores of <lb/>
            Egypt, 51-116. After which she has touched at Cyprus, whence she has <lb/>
            repaired to Africa to join Cato and the eldest son of Pompey, where <lb/>
            Sextus informs his brother Cneius of their father's death, 117-145. Cneius <lb/>
            is desirous to proceed to Egypt, but is dissuaded by Cato, 146-166. Cor­ <lb/>
            . nelia having landed, bums the vestments and arms of Pompey, which she <lb/>
            has brought with her, in place of his body, and performs the funereal <lb/>
            rites, 167-185. Cato delivers an oration in praise of Pompey, 186-214. <lb/>
            The soldiers of Cato become dissatisfied, and wish to return home, the <lb/>
            chief among the malcontents being Tarchondimotus, the Cilician, whom <lb/>
            Cato rebukes; on which another one replies that they followed Pompey <lb/>
            for his own sake, and not for the love of civil war, and that they are <lb/>
            now desirous to return home, 215-254. Cato is indignant, and by his <lb/>
            eloquence prevails upon them to stay, 255-293. The soldiers are trained <lb/>
            to arms, and the city of Cyrene is taken, 294-299. They embark <lb/>
            for the kingdom of Juba; the Syrtes are described, 300-318. A tern. <lb/>
            pest arises, and the ships are separated, 319-347. The region of Tritonis <lb/>
            is described, in which were formerly the golden orchards of the Hesperides, <lb/>
            and the river Lethe, 348-367. The fleet, having escaped the Syrtes, <lb/>
            anchors off the coast of Libya, 368-370. Cato, impatient of delay, per­ <lb/>

            travel there, 411-497. The soldiers are tormented by thirst, 498-511. <lb/>
            They arrive at the Temple of Jupiter Ammon; its situation is described, <lb/>
            512-543. Labienus exhorts them to consult the oracle, 544-563. Cato <lb/>
            dissuades them, saying that it is enough to know that a brave man ought <lb/>
            to die with fortitude, 564-586. They proceed on their march, and arrive at <lb/>
            a spring filled with serpents, at which, however, encouraged by Cato, they <lb/>
            drink, 587-618. The Poet enters on an enquiry how Africa came to be <lb/>
            thus infested with serpents, and relates the story of Medusa, 619-658. <lb/>
            And how Perseus cut off her head, 659-684. And then flew in the air <lb/>
            over Libya, the blood of the Gorgon falling on which produced the ser­ <lb/>
            pents, which are then described, 685-733. During Cato's march, many of <lb/>

            such words addresses the chief:­ <lb/>
            " Cato, grant us pardon, it was the love of Pompey, not of <lb/>
            civil war, that moved us to arms, and through affection did <lb/>
            we espouse a faction. He lies prostrate, whom the earth <lb/>
            preferred to peace, and fallen is our cause; allow us to re­ <lb/>
            visit our country's household Gods, and our deserted homes <lb/>
            and dear children. For what end of the contest will there <lb/>
            be, if neither Pharsalia nor Pompey shall be so ? The mo­ <lb/>

            us in our retreat; let our old age look forward to the flames <lb/>
            its due. Civil warfare can hardly afford sepulchres to chief­ <lb/>
            tains. No barbarian sway awaits the conquered ; no cruel <lb/>
            Fortune threatens me with an Armenian or a Scythian <lb/>
            yoke; I come beneath the rule of a citizen who wears the <lb/>

            is closed against us in our wretchedness, and in the whole <lb/>
            earth there is one alone, who is willing and is able to give <lb/>
            safety to the conquered. Pompey slain, civil war is a crime, <lb/>

            broken by shoals, and the land is torn away by the deep, <lb/>
            and the waves intervening, resound behind many a shallow. <lb/>

            At a future day, when destroying time shall have enough <lb/>

            in shipwrecks do the Nasamonians have traffic, with the <lb/>

            march. There is the youthful band regardless of the winds, <lb/>
            and, dreading no storms by land, suffers the terrors of the <lb/>
            deep 1. For upon the dry shore does the Syrtis with <lb/>
            greater violence receive the south winds than on the sea, <lb/>
            and more injurious is it to the land.</p>
          <p>With no mountains opposing does Libya break itsforce, <lb/>
            and scatter it repelled by rocks, and change it from a hurri­ <lb/>
            cane into serene air; nor does it rush into woods, and weary <lb/>
            itself with hurling down aged oaks ; all the land lies open, <lb/>
            and in its passage it works out the rage of Æolus, free from <lb/>
            all rein ; and the sand whirled aloft, sweeping along it drives <lb/>
            in wreaths a cloud teeming with no rain. The greater por­ <lb/>
            tion of the land is raised on high, and, in a whirlwind2 <lb/>
            never dissolved, hangs aloft. The poor Nasamonian sees <lb/>
            his possessions 3 floating in the wind, and his home rent <lb/>
            asunder; and, the Garamantian laid bare, the cottages, torn <lb/>
            away, fly from the roofs. Not higher does fire bear aloft <lb/>
            what it consumes; and as far as it is possible for smoke to <lb/>
            arise and to obscure the day, so high does the sand pos­ <lb/>
            sess the air.</p>
          <p>Then, too, more violently than usual does it attack the <lb/>
            Roman troops, and not a soldier is able to keep his footing, <lb/>
            infirm of hold, even the sands being borne away on which <lb/>
            he treads. It would shake the earth, and would move the <lb/>
            region away from the spot, if Libya, of solid texture and of <lb/>
            hard substance, all covered with crags, were to enclose the <lb/>
            southern blasts in its caverns eaten away; but because it is <lb/>
            easily moved with its shifting sands, by never struggling <lb/>
            it remains firm, and the lower part of the land stands <lb/>
            fast, because the upper gives way.</p>

            the skies, and, torn away from the arms of men, they think <lb/>

            down, and, dreading to be borne away, girded fast their <lb/>

            weight alone did they lie, but by their efforts to hold fast, <lb/>
            hardly thus unmoved by the southern blasts; which rolled <lb/>
            upon them vast heaps of sand, and covered the men with <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>Hardly is the soldier able to raise his limbs, sticking fast <lb/>
            in a large pile of dust. Some even standing the vast mass <lb/>
            of drifted sand overpowers; and, unable to move, they <lb/>
            are held fast in the rising ground. Stones does it bear <lb/>

            thirst. A little water was beheld afar in a scanty streamlet; <lb/>
            which a soldier, with difficulty scooping it up from the <lb/>
            dust, poured forth into the wide concavity of a helmet and <lb/>
            offered to the general. The jaws of all were clogged with <lb/>
            dust; and, receiving the tiny draught of water, the general <lb/>
            himself was an object of envy.</p>
          <p>“What," said he, “degenerate soldier, didst thou suppose <lb/>
            that I alone in this multitude was devoid of manliness? <lb/>

            Rowe has the following note on this passage :—" Lucan has made no scruple <lb/>

            the place itself, except that (as I understand him) he places it under the <lb/>
            Equator, is agreeable to most other ancient authors. It is pretty well <lb/>
            known that Jupiter was worshipped in this place under the shape of a Ram <lb/>
            (at least the upper part), and there are still to be found among the Egyptian <lb/>

            have Libyan nations erected costly Temples, nor do shrines <lb/>
            glitter with eastern gems. Although among the tribes of the <lb/>
            Æthiopians 1 and the rich nations of the Arabians and the <lb/>
            Indians, Jupiter Ammon is the only God, still he is a poor <lb/>
            God, possessing sanctuaries polluted in no age with wealth, <lb/>
            and a Divinity of primitive habits, he protects the Temple <lb/>
            from Roman gold. That there are Deities in the spot a <lb/>
            wood attests, the only one verdant2 throughout all Libya.</p>
          <p>For whatever country with its parching sand separates <lb/>
            burning Berenice from hot Leptis, is destitute of shrubs; <lb/>
            Ammon alone produces a grove. A fountain on the spot is <lb/>
            the cause of the woods, which knits together the crumbling <lb/>
            particles of earth, and unites the sand subdued by its waters. <lb/>
            Here, as well, nothing resists Phcebus, when in the highest <lb/>

            shadow its trunk, so small a shadow is thrown down <lb/>
            perpendicularly by the rays. It has been ascertained that <lb/>
            this is the spot where the circle3 of the elevated solstice <lb/>
            cuts through the mid sphere of the Constellations. Not ob­ <lb/>

            conduct through the Syrtes and the extremities of Libya <lb/>
            than thrice with the chariot of Pompey ascend the Capitol, <lb/>
            than break the neck of Jugurtha1. Behold a true parent <lb/>
            of his country, most worthy, Rome, of thy altars; by whom <lb/>

          <p>Now was the heat more intense, and a region, beyond <lb/>
            which none2 in the southern climes have the Gods created, <lb/>
            was traversed, and the water was more scarce. There was <lb/>
            found in the middle of the sands a single spring abounding <lb/>
            in water, but which a multitude of serpents possessed, the <lb/>
            spot hardly containing them. Parched asps 3 were standing <lb/>
            at the brink, in the midst of the waves the Dipsas 4 <lb/>
            thirsted. The chieftain, when he saw them likely to perish, <lb/>
            the spring left behind, addressed them: “ Alarmed with <lb/>
            the false show of death, fear not, soldiers, in safety to <lb/>
            quaff the stream. Noxious is the poison of serpents when <lb/>
            mixed with the blood; they have venom in their sting, and <lb/>

            to die in a state of torpor. Cleopatra put an end to her life by the bite of <lb/>

            to ascertain; except that a story, spread throughout all the <lb/>
            world, has deceived ages, in place of the real cause. In <lb/>
            the extreme parts of Libya, where the glowing earth re­ <lb/>
            ceives the ocean warmed by the setting sun, far and wide <lb/>
            lay parched the fields of Medusa, the daughter of Phoreys 1; <lb/>

            by ridges, but rugged with rocks 2 looked upon by the COWl­ <lb/>
            tenance of its mistress. In this body first did noxious <lb/>
            nature produce deadly plagues; from those jaws snakes <lb/>
            poured forth whizzing hisses with vibrating tongues, which, <lb/>
            after the manner of a woman's hair flowing along the back, <lb/>
            flapped about the very neck of the delighted Medusa. <lb/>
            Upon her forehead turned towards you erect did serpents <lb/>
            rise, and viper's venom flowed from her combed locks.</p>
          <p>This alone does unhappy Medusa possess, which with im­ <lb/>

            the mouth and the head of the monster ? Whom, that with <lb/>
            glance direct4 has seen her, has Medusa suffered to die? <lb/>

          <p>From the skies the birds fell with sudden weight; <lb/>

            Aulus, a young standard-bearer of Etrurian blood. Hardly <lb/>
            was there pain or any feeling of the sting, and his face itself <lb/>
            was free from the anguish of death, nor did the wound <lb/>
            threaten anything. Behold! the venom creeps silently on, <lb/>
            and a devouring flame consumes his marrow, and burns his <lb/>
            entrails with the heating poison. The virus sucks up the <lb/>
            moisture flowing around the vitals, and begins to scorch <lb/>
            the tongue with the dried palate; no perspiration is there <lb/>
            to run down his wearied limbs, and the fountain of tears <lb/>
            flies from his eyes. Not the ensign of the state2, not the <lb/>
            orders of the sorrowing Cato, restrained the parched man <lb/>
            from daring to hurl down the standard, and, infuriate, seek­ <lb/>
            ing over all the fields the water which the venom, thirsting <lb/>
            in his heart, demanded.</p>
          <p>He, sent even to Tanais and Rhone and Padus, would be <lb/>
            parched, and even if drinking of Nile as it wanders through <lb/>
            the fields. Libya promoted his death 3, and the Dipsas has <lb/>
            a fame unequal to its deadliness, when aided by the scorch­ <lb/>
            ing regions. Deep down he seeks for rain in the glowing <lb/>

            in his mouth; and the moisture of the deep is grateful, <lb/>
            but suffices not for him. Nor is he sensible of the nature <lb/>
            of the death and -the fatality of the venom, but lie thinks <lb/>
            that it is thirst alone, and brooks to open the swelling veins, <lb/>
            and to fill his mouth with blood. Instantly does Cato order <lb/>
            the standard to be taken up; to no one is it allowed to <lb/>
            learn that thirst can have this effect.</p>
          <p>But a more sad death than that was before their eyes; <lb/>
            and upon the thigh of the wretched Sabellius there stood a <lb/>
            little Seps, which, hanging with its barbed tooth, he both <lb/>
            tore off with his hand, and pinned with his javelin to the <lb/>
            sand; a little serpent only, but than which not one is so <lb/>
            sure a source of a bloody death. For the skin nearest the <lb/>
            wound, torn off, disappears, and discloses the pallid bones. <lb/>
            And now with open surface, without a body left, the wound <lb/>
            is bare; the limbs swim in corrupt matter; the calves fall <lb/>
            off; without any covering are the hams; of the thighs, too, <lb/>
            every muscle is dissolved, and the groin distils black matter. <lb/>
            The membrane that binds the stomach snaps asunder, and <lb/>
            the bowels flow away; nor does just so much of the entire <lb/>
            body as may be expected flow upon the earth, but the <lb/>
            raging venom melts the limbs; soon does the poison <lb/>
            convert all the ligaments of the nerves, and the textures of <lb/>
            the sides, and the hollow breast, and what is concealed in <lb/>
            the vital lungs, everything that composes man, into a dimi­ <lb/>
            nutive corrupt mass. By a foul death does nature lie ex­ <lb/>
            posed ; the shoulders and strong arms melt; the neck and <lb/>
            head flow away.</p>
          <p>Not more quickly does the snow fall away, dissolved by <lb/>
            the warm south wind, nor is wax influenced by the sun. <lb/>
            Trifling things I mention, how that the body flowed away <lb/>
            scorched up by corruption; this flame can do as well. But <lb/>
            what pile has ever dissolved the bones? These, too, <lb/>
            disappear, and, following the crumbling marrow, suffer <lb/>
            no vestiges of their rapid destruction to remain. Among <lb/>

          <p>Behold! a form occurs quite different from this wasting <lb/>
            death. A scorching Prester stung Nasidius, a cultivator of <lb/>
            the Marsian fields. A fiery redness lighted up his face, <lb/>
            and, his shape destroyed, a swelling, confounding all fea­ <lb/>
            titres, now larger than the whole body, stretched out his <lb/>
            skin; and, exceeding the human growth, the corrupt matter <lb/>
            puffed up throughout all the limbs; the poison prevailing <lb/>
            far and wide, he himself lay concealed, completely hidden <lb/>
            within his swollen body: nor did the coat of mail withhold <lb/>
            the increase of the distended body. Not thus does the <lb/>
            foaming mass of water boil over on the cauldron being <lb/>
            heated, nor do the sails under the effects of Corus swell <lb/>
            out into a bellying form so vast. Now he wielded not his <lb/>
            limbs a deformed bloated mass, and a trunk in a confused <lb/>
            heap. Not daring to commit it to the tomb, they fled from <lb/>
            the increasing carcase, untouched, and destined to afford a <lb/>
            feast to the beaks of the birds and to the wild beasts, not <lb/>
            with impunity, the swelling not even ceasing after death.</p>
          <p>But sights more monstrous do the Libyan pests provide. <lb/>
            A fierce Hæmorrhois thrust its fangs into Tullus, a noble <lb/>
            youth, and an admirer of Cato. And just as the pressure1 <lb/>
            of the Corycian saffron2 is wont to discharge itself from <lb/>
            all the statues of the Theatre, in such manner do all <lb/>
            the members at the same moment send forth a red virus <lb/>

            his mouth is running over, the distended nostrils too; his <lb/>

            discharging saffron-water over the Theatres with pipes, which the Greeks <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰρόϰον ῥαιγισμὸς</foreign>. Sometimes the saffron was even mixed with wine <lb/>

            that it fell upon the spectators in the form of the finest dust. If " signis " is <lb/>

            egg it has brought forth its unfledged young ones, turns <lb/>
            them to the rising of the sun; those which can endure <lb/>

            heaven, are preserved for rearing; those which flinch from <lb/>
            Phœbus, it leaves exposed; so does the Psyllian consider <lb/>
            it a pledge of its origin, if any infant does not shudder <lb/>
            at the snakes when touched, if any one plays with the pre­ <lb/>

          <p>Nor is that race only contented with its own safety; the <lb/>

            poison in the wound. Then, with foaming tongue, he <lb/>
            hurries over many a charm in a continuous murmur, nor <lb/>
            does the rapid spread of the wound give time for breathing, <lb/>
            or death allow him for an instant to be silent. Full oft, <lb/>
            indeed, the venom, received into the blackening marrow, <lb/>
            charmed forth, takes to flight; but if any poison obeys too <lb/>
            tardily, and, summoned forth and commanded, refuses to <lb/>
            depart, then, lying down upon the pallid wounds, he licks <lb/>
            them, sucking the poison with his mouth, and squeezes <lb/>
            the limbs with his teeth, and, holding the deadly matter <lb/>
            drawn forth from the cold body, spits it out; and even from <lb/>
            the taste of the poison it is quite easy for the Psylli to tell <lb/>

          <p>Cæsar, although finding the people of Egypt hostile to him, comes to Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, and visits the tomb of Alexander the Great, 1-19. The Poet <lb/>
            inveighs against Alexander and the people of the East, 20-52. In the <lb/>
            meantime Ptolemy comes to Cæsar as an hostage; Cleopatra also obtains <lb/>
            admission to him by stratagem, 53-60. The Poet utters maledictions <lb/>
            against Cleopatra, 61-81. Cleopatra entreats Caesar to protect her and <lb/>
            her brother against the power of Pothinus, 82-103. Caesar assents. <lb/>
            The luxury of the Egyptians is described, 104-135. The dress and <lb/>
            beauty of Cleopatra are depicted, and the sumptuousness of the banquet, <lb/>
            136-171. At the feast Cæsar addresses Achoreus, the chief priest, on <lb/>
            the subject of the Egyptian Gods and the sources of the Nile, 172-192. <lb/>
            Achoreus first combats the false notions that exist on the rise of the <lb/>
            Nile, 193-261. And then states his own opinions on the subject, <lb/>
            252-331. Potbinus plans the death of Caesar with Achillas, 332-398. <lb/>
            Collecting his soldiers, Achillas surrounds the palace, 399-443. Caesar <lb/>
            orders the gates to be closed, and detains the king as a hostage, 444-4 67. <lb/>
            The palace is besieged, 468-484. The valour of Caesar is described. The <lb/>
            ships of the enemy being burnt, Cæsar takes possession of Pharos, 485-509. <lb/>
            Pothinus is put to death, 510-519. Arsinoë, the younger sister of Ptolemy, <lb/>
            slays Achillas, 519-529. Ganymedes, the newly-appointed general, actively <lb/>
            wages the war against Caesar, and the work concludes, 530-546.</p>
          <p>WHEN Cæsar, following the head of Pompey 1, first reached <lb/>
            the shore, and trod upon the direful sands, the fortune of <lb/>
            the chieftain and the fate of guilty Egypt struggled, as to <lb/>
            whether the realms of Lagus should come under the Ro­ <lb/>
            man sway, or whether the Memphitic sword should snatch <lb/>

            that the fasces and the Roman authority are encroach­ <lb/>

            doubtful feelings, and that Magnus has perished not <lb/>
            for him. Then, his looks always concealing his fears2, <lb/>
            without hesitation he goes about the abodes of the Gods <lb/>
            of heaven and the Temples of the ancient Divinity3, <lb/>
            that attest the former strength of the Macedonians; and, <lb/>
            touched by no beauty of the objects, not by the gold and <lb/>
            the rites of the Gods, not by the walls of the city, he <lb/>
            eagerly descends into a cavern dug out among the tombs. <lb/>
            There, the mad offspring of Pellæan Philip, the fortunate <lb/>
            robber, lies interred, snatched away by Fate4, the avenger <lb/>
            of the earth. The members of the man that should have <lb/>

            laughing-stock he would have been kept, shown as no useful <lb/>
            precedent to the world, that countries so numerous could <lb/>
            be under a single man. The limits of the Macedonians and <lb/>
            the lurking-holes of his own people he forsook, and Athens, <lb/>

            intercalary month Mercedonius. This year in consequence was styled “ the <lb/>
            year of confusion." Finding also that the year would be too short by a <lb/>
            quarter of a day, he provided for the deficiency, by the insertion, every fourth <lb/>
            year, of an extra day immediately after the 23rd of February, which was to <lb/>
            be esteemed as a duplicate of the 24 th of February, or, as the Romans called <lb/>

            the stars1 to move onward, and modifies their wandering <lb/>

            selves.</p>
          <p>0 right! where has not the wretched fate of our empire <lb/>
            met with civil war? Troops far removed from Thessaly <lb/>
            rage after the manner of their country on the banks of the <lb/>
            Nile. What more, Magnus, thyself received with hospitality, <lb/>
            could the house of Lagus have dared? Every right hand <lb/>
            performs, forsooth, that which is due to the Gods of heaven; <lb/>
            and to no Roman is it permitted to be unemployed. Thus <lb/>
            has it pleased the Gods to rend the Latian body; the people <lb/>
            do not separate in partisanship for the father-in-law and the <lb/>
            son-in-law: a dependant on a court arouses the civil war, <lb/>
            and Achillas sides with a faction of the Romans. And un­ <lb/>
            less the Fates avert their hands from the blood of Cæsar, <lb/>
            this faction will prove the conqueror.</p>
          <p>Ready prepared did each2 come, and, engaged in feasting, <lb/>
            the palace was exposed to all treachery, and the blood of <lb/>
            Cæsar might have been poured forth amid the royal cups, <lb/>
            and his head have fallen on the table. But they feared <lb/>
            the startling alarms of war in the night, lest the slaughter, <lb/>
            promiscuous and sanctioned by the Fates, might, Ptolemy, <lb/>
            destroy thee. So great was their confidence in the sword. <lb/>
            They did not hasten on their guilt; the opportunity for a <lb/>
            deed so momentous was despised; it seemed to the slaves <lb/>
            a, loss that might be made good to let that hour pass for <lb/>
            slaying Cæsar. To pay the penalty in open light was he <lb/>
            reserved. One night was granted to the chieftain, and Cæsar, <lb/>
            reprieved till the rising of Phœbus, lived by the favour of <lb/>
            Pothinus.</p>
          <p>Lucifer looked down from the Casian rock, and sent the <lb/>
            day over Egypt, warmed even by the rising sun, when, afar <lb/>

            nor yet unmarshalled, but just as they march with straight <lb/>
            front against an equal foe. Ready to stand the attack hand <lb/>
            to hand and to make it, they rushed on. But Cæsar, dis­ <lb/>
            trusting1 the walls of the city, protected himself within the <lb/>
            gates of the closed palace, submitting to an unworthy re­ <lb/>
            treat. Nor for him, pent up, was the whole palace avail­ <lb/>
            able ; in the smaller portion of the house he had collected <lb/>
            his forces; both anger and fear affected their minds; he <lb/>
            both dreaded the onset and he disdained to dread.</p>
          <p>Thus rages the noble brute confined within the narrow <lb/>
            cage, and, the prison gnawed, breaks his frantic teeth; not <lb/>
            otherwise would thy flames grow furious, Mulciber, in the <lb/>
            caverns of Sicily, if any one were to block up the summits <lb/>
            of Ætna2 for thee. He who, in his boldness, so lately be­ <lb/>
            neath the heights of Thessalian Hremus, feared not all the <lb/>
            nobles of Hesperia and the ranks of the Senate and Pom­ <lb/>
            pey their leader, the cause forbidding3 him to look at them, <lb/>
            and promised for himself an unmerited success, dreaded <lb/>
            the guilty attempts of slaves, and within a house4 was as­ <lb/>

            warlike boy, just like a woman in a captured city, seeks <lb/>
            the safe retreats of a house; his hope of life be places in a <lb/>
            closed threshold, and, wandering about with uncertain steps, <lb/>
            surveys the halls; not without the king, however, whom he <lb/>

            Ptolemy, .thy head against the slaves, if there be not darts <lb/>

            flight, with her sword and with the head of her brother as <lb/>
            well, ready prepared, to have awaited her father.</p>
          <p>However, the emergency of affairs forces the chieftain to <lb/>
            have recourse to hopes of peace; and a royal attendant2 is <lb/>
            sent to corrupt the slaves in the name of their absent mo­ <lb/>

            But neither does the law of the world3 avail, nor the ties <lb/>
            that are ratified by nations. The ambassador of the king <lb/>
            and the pleader for peace, guilty of so many misdeeds, <lb/>
            gives proof of what is to be placed in the number of thy <lb/>

            to keep within the town in the most convenient places, and to get informa­ <lb/>
            tion of the designs of Acbillas. However, he ordered his soldiers to repair <lb/>
            to their arms, and advised the king to send some of his friends, who had the <lb/>
            greatest influence, as deputies to Achillas, and to signify his royal pleasure. <lb/>
            Dioscorides and Serapio, the persons sent by him, who had both been am­ <lb/>
            bassadors at Rome, and had been in great esteem with Ptolemy, the father, <lb/>
            went to Achillas. But as soon as they appeared in his presence, without <lb/>
            hearing them, or learning the occasion of their coming, he ordered them to <lb/>
            be seized and put to death. One of them, after receiving a wound, was <lb/>
            taken up and carried off by the attendants as dead; the other was killed on <lb/>

            The Fates forbid, and Fortune, in place of a wall, defends <lb/>
            Cæar. With ships likewise1 is the palace attempted, where <lb/>
            the luxurious abode extends itself with proud extremities <lb/>
            into the midst of the waves.</p>
          <p>But Cæsr is present everywhere defending, and these <lb/>
            does he keep from entering with the sword, those with <lb/>
            flames; and, blockaded (so great is his presence of mind), <lb/>
            he does the work of the besieger. He orders torches dipped <lb/>
            in pitch and fat to be hurled against the sails in the joined <lb/>
            barks. Nor is the fire slow amid shrouds of tow and amid <lb/>
            planks dripping with wax; and at the same moment do <lb/>
            both the benches of the sailors and the topmost ropes of <lb/>
            the sailyards catch fire. Now almost are the half-burnt <lb/>
            ships sunk in the deep, and now both enemies and weapons <lb/>
            are floating. Nor on the ships alone do the flames take <lb/>
            hold; but the roofs which are near to the sea, with extending <lb/>
            smoke, catch fire. The south winds, too, feed the destruc­ <lb/>
            tion, and the flame, smitten by a whirlwind, runs along the <lb/>
            roofs with no other motion than a meteor is wont to run <lb/>
            along the æhereal track, both lacking fuel, and burning in <lb/>
            the desert air.</p>
          <p>This disaster for a short time called away the people <lb/>
            from the besieged palace to the aid of the city. Nor did <lb/>
            Cresar lose the moments for destruction in sleep, but in the <lb/>
            darkness of the night he leapt aboard ship, always success­ <lb/>
            fully employing the sudden turns of war and the opportunity <lb/>
            seized. Then he took Pharos, the key to the main. Once <lb/>
            did it stand as an island in the mid sea, at the time of the <lb/>
            prophet Proteus; but now it is adjoining to the Pellæan <note type="footnote"> 1 With ships likewise) ver. 486. These naval contests are described at <lb/>
            length by Cæsar in the Civil War, B. iii. c. 111-112. In the latter chapter <lb/>
            he says:—“In this quarter of the town was a wing of the king's palace, in <lb/>
            which Cæsar was lodged on his first arrival, and a theatre adjoining the <lb/>
            house, which served for a citadel, and commanded an avenue to the port and <lb/>
            other docks." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Stand as an island) ver. 510. Homer describes the Isle of Pharos as <lb/>

            scribes Proteus, the prophetic old man of the sea, as dwelling in the Isle of <lb/>

            walls. A double aid in war did that afford to the chieftain: <lb/>
            it cut off the power of making incursions and the outlets of <lb/>
            the main from the foe; and to the aid of Cæsar, it left an <lb/>
            inlet and free access to the sea.</p>
          <p>Nor then did he any further delay the punishment of <lb/>
            Pothinus; but not with the wrath his due, not with the <lb/>
            cross, not with the flames, not with the ravenous teeth of <lb/>
            wild beasts. Oh shame ! his bead unbecomingly struck off <lb/>
            with the sword1 atoned ; he died by the death of Magnus!</p>
          <p>Moreover, escaping by a stratagem2 prepared by the slave <lb/>
            Ganymedes, Arsinoë goes over to the foes of Cæsar; and <lb/>
            she holds the camp deprived of its monarch, as the offspring <lb/>
            of Lagus, and pierces the grim Achillas3, the slave of the <lb/>
            king, with a righteous sword. Now, Magnus, another victim <lb/>
            is dispatched to thy shade; nor does Fortune deem this <lb/>
            enough. Afar be it, that this should be the sum of thy <lb/>
            vengeance. Not the tyrant himself suffices for retribution, <lb/>
            not the whole palace of Lagus. Until the swords of his <lb/>
            country reach the vitals of Cæsar, Magnus will be unre­ <lb/>
            venged.</p>
          <p>But, the author of the commotion removed, the frenzy did <lb/>
            not cease ; for again did they have recourse to arms, under <lb/>
            the guidance of Ganymedes4; and many battles did they <note type="footnote"> 1 Struck, off with the sword) ver. 518. Caesar says, in the Civil War, B. iii. <lb/>

            fight with successful warfare. That day might, with fatal <lb/>
            results to Cæsar, have been handed down to fame and to <lb/>
            future ages.</p>
          <p>His arms being crowded within the compass of a slight <lb/>
            rampart, while the Latian chieftain is preparing to disem­ <lb/>
            bark his forces in empty ships, he is surrounded with all <lb/>
            the dangers of a sudden attack; on the one side, numerous <lb/>
            ships line the shores; on the other, foot soldiers are attack­ <lb/>
            ing in the rear; no way is there for safety, no flight, no room <lb/>
            for valour; hardly, even, is there the hope of an honorable <lb/>
            death. With no army routed, and with no heaps of vast <lb/>
            carnage, was Cæsar then about to be conquered, but with <lb/>
            no bloodshed, captured through the fatality of the spot.</p>
          <p>He hesitates whether, in his doubt, to fear, or whether to <lb/>
            wish to die. He recollects Scæva1 amid the- dense mass, <lb/>
