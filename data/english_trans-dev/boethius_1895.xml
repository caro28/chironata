          <p>A PORTION of the works of King Alfred having already <lb/>
            appeared in the series of which this volume forms a part, the <lb/>
            Editor thought that a complete edition of his Anglo-Saxon. <lb/>
            translation of the treatise of Boethius de Consolatione Philo­ <lb/>
            sophiæ would be acceptable. Some years since, the late Mr. <lb/>
            Cardale published the prose of the Anglo-Saxon version with <lb/>
            an English translation, which was soon afterwards followed <lb/>
            by an edition of the Metres, with a literal translation by the <lb/>
            present Editor. In the edition now printed, the judicious <lb/>
            selection by Mr. Cardale from the different readings of the <lb/>
            only MSS. in existence has been carefully weighed, and, for <lb/>
            the most part, followed. The MSS. alluded to are the Cot­ <lb/>
            tonian MS., Otho, a. vi., now in the library of the British <lb/>
            Museum, and one which contains merely a prosaic version, <lb/>
            in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The MS. in the British <lb/>
            Museum formerly belonged to Sir Robert Cotton, and was <lb/>
            so much injured by the fire which destroyed a portion of his <lb/>
            valuable collection before its removal to our great public <lb/>
            library, that for many years it was utterly useless, con­ <lb/>
            sisting merely of detached fragments thrown together in a <lb/>
            box, until, by the skill and industry of the Rev. Joseph <lb/>
            Stevenson and the late John Holmes, Esq., it was rearranged <lb/>
            in 1844, the detached parts being neatly put together within <lb/>
            a border of new parchment, and is now rendered so perfect <lb/>
            that most of it can be read with the greatest ease! This <lb/>
            MS. contains a similar translation of the prose portion of <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            Boethius to that in the Bodleian Library, but the Latin <lb/>
            Metres are rendered in Anglo-Saxon verse, while those in <lb/>
            the Bodleian MS. are translated in a prosaic form. In this <lb/>
            edition every word contained in both MSS. is given, and the <lb/>
            variations, which are the result of a careful collation, are <lb/>
            marked at the foot of each page.</p>
          <p>The original work of Boetbius de Consolatione Philo­ <lb/>
            sophiæ is extremely interesting from the circumstances <lb/>
            under which it was written. The author, whose full name <lb/>
            was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, was born between <lb/>
            A.D. 470 and 475. His father dying while he was young, he <lb/>
            was brought up among his father's friends at Rome, who <lb/>
            were distinguished men, and of whom Symmachus, to whom <lb/>
            allusion is made, was one. Boethius was famous for his <lb/>
            general learning, and also for his extensive charities. He <lb/>
            married Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus, and was <lb/>
            the father of two sons, Aurelius Anicius Symmachus, and <lb/>
            Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, who were consuls A.D. <lb/>
            522. His high character naturally brought him into public <lb/>
            notice, and, after being consul A.D. 510, he attracted the <lb/>
            attention of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who gave <lb/>
            him a responsible appointment in his court, and consulted <lb/>
            him on many important subjects. After attaining the greatest <lb/>
            height of worldly prosperity, his happiness was suddenly <lb/>
            overcast. His unflinching integrity provoked enmity in the <lb/>
            court of Theodoric; and his boldness in pleading the cause <lb/>
            of Albinus, when accused of treason by an informer, seems <lb/>
            to have afforded his enemies a plea for charging him and <lb/>
            Symmachus with the intention of delivering Rome from the <lb/>
            barbarian yoke. Whatever grounds there may have been <lb/>
            for the charge, he was treated with great injustice, not being <lb/>
            allowed a trial, and a sentence of confiscation and death <lb/>
            being passed against him without a hearing! He was im­ <lb/>
            prisoned in the baptistry of the church at Ticinum, which <lb/>
            was to be seen till A.D. 1584; and during this imprisonment <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            he wrote his books De Consolatione Philosophiæ. He was <lb/>
            afterwards beheaded, or, according to some writers, he was <lb/>
            beaten to death with clubs. Symmachus was also beheaded, <lb/>
            and Rusticiana was reduced to poverty, until, through the <lb/>
            kindness of the widow of Theodoric, who was regent during <lb/>
            her son's minority, her husband's confiscated property was <lb/>
            restored to her. A tomb was erected to the memory of <lb/>
            Boethius by Luitprand, king of the Lombards, in the <lb/>
            church of S. Pietro Cielo d'Oro; and afterwards a more <lb/>
            magnificent one by Otho III., with an epitaph by Pope <lb/>
            Sylvester II. There is much difficulty in deciding whether <lb/>
            Boethius was a Christian or a devout heathen. Whatever <lb/>
            he may have been, there is not in the original treatise any <lb/>
            mention of the consolations which Christianity affords to the <lb/>
            unfortunate. As is elsewhere stated, any allusions to the <lb/>
            Christian religion which occur in the following pages, are in­ <lb/>
            troduced by King Alfred. Yet, as it has been well observed <lb/>
            by an eminent writer, "If, on the one hand, the general <lb/>
            silence on the subject of Christianity in such a book, at such <lb/>
            a period of his life, proves that, if he was a Christian, its <lb/>
            doctrines could hardly have been a part of his living belief; <lb/>
            on the other hand, the incidental phrases which occur, the <lb/>
            strong religious theism which pervades the whole work, the <lb/>
            real belief which it indicates in prayer and Providence, and <lb/>
            the unusually high tone of his public life, prove that, if a <lb/>
            heathen, his general character must have been deeply tinged <lb/>
            by the contemporaneous influences of Christianity."</p>
          <p>The peculiar circumstances of King Alfred's life very <lb/>
            naturally produced a sympathy in his mind for the suffer­ <lb/>
            ings of the noble Roman, and were the happy means of pro­ <lb/>
            ducing a work, in which, at the distance of a thousand years, <lb/>
            we can hear, as it were, our revered sovereign speaking to us <lb/>
            in his own language on some of the most important topics of <lb/>
            human life! For although King Alfred professed to trans. <lb/>
            late the work of Boethius, yet he inserted in various parts <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            many of his own thoughts and feelings, and thus composed <lb/>
            several moral essays, in which lie has, in a manner, trans­ <lb/>
            mitted himself to posterity. The imperfection of King <lb/>
            Alfred's early education will account for a few mistakes in <lb/>
            names and historical facts. These, however, by no means <lb/>
            lessen the value of the translation ; and instead of wonder­ <lb/>
            ing at their occurrence, one should rather feel surprised that <lb/>
            they are not more numerous and more important, consider­ <lb/>
            ing the disadvantages under which he laboured. The trans­ <lb/>
            lation was made, as the royal author states, amid " various <lb/>
            and manifold worldly occupations, which often busied him <lb/>
            both in mind and in body. The occupations," said he, " are <lb/>
            very difficult to be numbered which in his days came upon <lb/>
            the kingdoms which he had undertaken to govern." On this <lb/>
            account our wonder may well be excited, since we meet with <lb/>
            literary attainments which, in those days, were to be sought <lb/>
            rather in the retirement of the cloister than in the noise and <lb/>
            tumult of a camp, which was often in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            harassing foes.</p>
          <p>King Alfred entirely altered the arrangement of Boethius, <lb/>
            for, instead of dividing his work into four books, and sub­ <lb/>
            dividing each book into chapters, as his author had done, he <lb/>
            divided the whole work into forty-two chapters, alluding <lb/>
            occasionally to the books of the original. The first six <lb/>
            chapters of the Anglo-Saxon version comprise the chief part <lb/>
            of the first book of Boethius, together with a short introduce <lb/>
            tion. The next fifteen chapters contain the substance of the <lb/>
            second book. The third book is translated in the fourteen <lb/>
            chapters which follow. Four chapters and part of another, <lb/>
            viz. part of chapter xl., are devoted to the fourth book ; and <lb/>
            the remaining portion of chapter xl., together with chapters <lb/>
            xli. and xlii., completes the whole.</p>
          <p>Although the work is deeply interesting, yet the most <lb/>
            striking portion will be found in the following chapters: In <lb/>
            chapter xv., there is a pleasing description of the golden age. <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            In chapter xix., the vanity of a too eager pursuit of fame is <lb/>
            pointed out. In chapter xxi., the power and goodness of <lb/>
            the Creator in governing and upholding the universe are <lb/>
            displayed. Chapter xxv. contains a dissertation on natural <lb/>
            disposition. The first part of chapter xxix. describes the <lb/>
            weakness and unhappiness of kings, while the second part <lb/>
            illustrates the dangers to which royal favourites are exposed <lb/>
            by the treatment which Seneca and Papinian met with. <lb/>
            The second part of chapter xxx. declares the natural equality <lb/>
            of mankind. Chapter xxxiii., part iv., contains an address <lb/>
            to God. Chapter xxxv., part iv., contains the fable of the <lb/>
            giants warring against Jupiter, and the history of the tower <lb/>
            of Babel; and part vi, relates the story of Orpheus and <lb/>
            Eurydice. Chapter xxxviii., part i., gives the account of <lb/>
            Ulysses and Circe. Chapters xl. and xli. are devoted to an <lb/>
            inquiry into divine predestination and human liberty. The <lb/>
            last chapter treats of God and eternity.</p>
          <p>The Editor has availed himself of the kind permission of <lb/>
            Martin Tupper, Esq., D.C.L., &amp;c. &amp;c., to substitute his <lb/>
            excellent poetical translation of the Metres for his own <lb/>
            literal one, and he tenders his sincere thanks for the per­ <lb/>
            mission which has been so freely accorded. He also begs to <lb/>
            acknowledge the great assistance which he has derived from <lb/>
            the labours of the late J. S. Cardale, Esq., and from the <lb/>
            valuable suggestions of his highly-esteemed friend Dr. Bos­ <lb/>
            worth, Professor of Anglo-Saxon in the University of <lb/>
            Oxford.</p>

          <p>KING ALFRED was translator of this book, and turned it <lb/>
            from book Latin into English, as it is now done. Sometimes <lb/>
            he set word by word, sometimes meaning <unclear>ofmeaning</unclear>, as be <lb/>
            the most plainly and most clearly could explain it, for the <lb/>
            various and manifold worldly occupations which often busied <lb/>
            him both in mind and in body. The occupations are to us <lb/>
            very difficult to be numbered, which in his days came upon <lb/>
            the kingdoms which he had undertaken, and yet when he <lb/>
            had learned this book, and turned it from Latin into the <lb/>
            English language, he afterwards composed it in verse, as it is <lb/>
            now done. And he now prays, and for God's name implores <lb/>
            every one of those who lists to read this book, that he would <lb/>
            pray for him, and not blame him, if be more rightly under­ <lb/>
            stood it than he could. For every man must, according to <lb/>
            the measure of his understanding, and according to his leisure, <lb/>
            speak that which he speaketh, and do that which he doeth.</p><pb n="x"/>

          <p>Then began Wisdom again to speak a parable concerning <lb/>
            the sun, how she outshines all other stars, and obscures them <lb/>

            ments which be formerly thought should be happiness, were <lb/>
            nothing: and how Wisdom, that he might show that he <lb/>
            was happy, said, that his anchor was still fast in the earth. <lb/>

            to the same dignity which he before had : and asked him who <lb/>
            had all that he would in this world: some have nobility and <lb/>

          <p>How this present wealth hinders the men who are attracted <lb/>

            the body; and though any one should collect together all <lb/>

          <p>AT the time when the Goths of the country of Scythia <lb/>
            made war against the empire of the Romans, and with their <lb/>
            kings, who were called Rhadgast and Alaric, sacked the Roman <lb/>
            city, and reduced to subjection all the kingdom of Italy, which <lb/>
            is between the mountains and the island of Sicily, and then, <lb/>
            after the before-mentioned kings, Theodoric obtained posses­ <lb/>
            sion of that same kingdom: Theodoric was of the race of the <lb/>
            Amali; he was a Christian, but he persisted in the Arian <lb/>
            heresy. He promised to the Romans his friendship, so that <lb/>
            they might enjoy their ancient rights. But he very ill per­ <lb/>
            formed that promise, and speedily ended with much wicked­ <lb/>
            ness; which was, that in addition to other unnumbered <lb/>
            crimes, he gave order to slay John the Pope. Then was <lb/>
            there a certain consul, that we call heretoha, who was named <lb/>
            Boethius. He was in book-learning and in worldly affairs <lb/>
            the most wise. He then observed the manifold evil, which <lb/>
            the king Theodoric did against Christianity, and against the <lb/>
            Roman senators. He then called to mind the favours and <lb/>
            the ancient rights which they had under the Caesara, their <lb/>
            ancient lords. Then began he to inquire, and study in him­ <lb/>
            self, how he might take the kingdom from the unrighteous <lb/>
            king, and bring it under the power of faithful and righteous <lb/>
            men. He therefore privately sent letters to the Cæsar, at <lb/>
            Constantinople, which is the chief city of the Greeks, and <lb/>
            their king's dwelling-place, because the Cæsar was of the kin <lb/>
            of their ancient lords: they prayed him that he would succour <lb/>
            them with respect to their Christianity and their ancient <lb/>
            rights. When the cruel king Theodoric discovered this, be <lb/>
            gave order to take him to prison, and therein lock up. When <lb/>
            it happened that the venerable man was fallen into so great <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>

              trouble, then was he so much the more disturbed in his mind, <lb/>
              as his mind had formerly been the more accustomed to worldly <lb/>
              prosperity; and he then thought of no comfort in the prison; <lb/>
              but be fell down prostrate on the floor, and stretched himself, <lb/>

          <p>THE lays which I, an exile, formerly with delight sung, I <lb/>
            shall now mourning sing, and with very unfit words compose. <lb/>
            Though I formerly readily invented, yet I now, weeping and <lb/>
            sobbing, wander from appropriate words. To blind me, these <lb/>
            unfaithful worldly riches, and to leave me so blinded in this <lb/>
            dim hole! At that time they bereaved me of all happiness, <lb/>
            when I ever best trusted in them : at that time they turned <lb/>
            their back upon me, and altogether departed from me! <lb/>
            Wherefore should my friends say that I was a prosperous <lb/>
            man ? How can he be prosperous, who in prosperity cannot <lb/>
            always remain ?</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN I, said Boethius, had mournfully sung this lay, <lb/>
            then came there into me heavenly Wisdom, and greeted my <lb/>
            sorrowful Mind with his words, and thus said: How, art not <lb/>
            thou the man who was nourished and instructed in my school ? <lb/>
            But whence art thou become so greatly afflicted by these <lb/>
            worldly cares ? unless, I wot, thou hast too soon forgotten <lb/>
            the weapons which I formerly gave thee. Then Wisdom <lb/>
            called out and said, Depart now ye execrable worldly cares <lb/>
            from my disciple's mind, for ye are the greatest enemies. <lb/>
            Let him again turn to my precepts. Then came Wisdom <lb/>
            near, said Boethius, to my sorrowing thought, and it so <lb/>
            prostrate somewhat raised, then dried the eyes of my Mind, <lb/>
            and asked it with pleasant words, whether it knew its foster- <lb/>
            mother. Thereupon, when the Mind turned towards him, it <lb/>
            knew very plainly its own mother, that was the Wisdom that <lb/>
            long before had instructed and taught it. But it perceived <lb/>
            his doctrine much torn and greatly broken, by the hands of <lb/>
            foolish persons, and therefore asked him how that happened. <pb n="6"/>

              Then answered Wisdom to him and said, that his scholars <lb/>
              had thus torn him, when they endeavoured to possess them­ <lb/>
              selves of him entirely. But they gather much folly by pre­ <lb/>
              sumption, and by arrogance, unless any of them to their <lb/>
              amendment return.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then began Wisdom to grieve for the frailty of the <lb/>
            Mind, and began to sing, and thus said: Alas! into how un­ <lb/>
            fathomable gulf the Mind rushes when the troubles of this <lb/>
            world agitate it. If it then forget its own light, which is <lb/>
            eternal joy, and rush into the outer darkness, which are the <lb/>
            cares of this world, as this Mind now does, now it knows <lb/>
            nothing else but lamentations.</p>
          <p>§ III. When Wisdom and Reason had sung this lay, then <lb/>
            began he again to speak, and said to the Mind: I see that <lb/>
            there is now more need to thee of comfort, than of bewailing.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Therefore, if thou wilt be ashamed of thine error, <lb/>
            then will I soon begin to bear thee up, and will bring thee <lb/>
            with me to the heavens. Then answered the sorrowful Mind <lb/>
            to him, and said: What! 0, what! are these now the goods, <lb/>
            and the reward, which thou always promisedst to the men <lb/>
            who would obey thee ? Is this now the saying, which thou <lb/>
            formerly toldest me that the wise Plato said, that was, that <lb/>
            no power was right without right manners ? Seest thou <lb/>
            now, that the virtuous are hated and oppressed, because they <lb/>
            would follow thy will: and the wicked are exalted through <lb/>
            their crimes and through their self-love ? That they may <lb/>
            the better accomplish their wicked purpose they are promoted <lb/>
            with gifts and with riches. Wherefore I will now earnestly <lb/>
            call upon God. He then began to sing, and thus singing <lb/>
            said:</p>

              heaven: and sometimes bereaves the sun of her light, when <lb/>
              he is betwixt us and her; and sometimes the bright star <lb/>
              which we call the morning star; the same we call by another <lb/>
              name, the evening star. Thou, who to the winter days givest <lb/>
              short times, and to the summer's days, longer! Thou, who <lb/>
              the trees, by the stark north-east wind in harvest-time, of <lb/>
              their leaves bereavest; and again in spring, other leaves <lb/>
              givest, through the mild south-west wind! What! do all <lb/>
              creatures obey thee, and keep the institutions of thy com­ <lb/>
              mandments, except man alone, who is disobedient ? 0, thou <lb/>
              almighty maker and governor of all creatures, help now thy <lb/>
              miserable mankind. Wherefore, 0 Lord, ever wouldest thou, <lb/>
              that fortune should so vary ? She afflicts the innocent, and <lb/>
              afflicts not the guilty. The wicked sit on high seats, and <lb/>
              trample the holy under their feet. Bright virtues lie hid, <lb/>
              and the wicked deride the virtuous. Wicked oaths in no <lb/>
              wise injure men, nor the false lot which is with fraud con­ <lb/>
              cealed. Therefore almost all mankind will now proceed in <lb/>
              doubt, if fortune may thus vary according to the will of evil <lb/>
              men, and thou wilt not control her. 0, my Lord, thou who <lb/>
              overseest all creatures, look now mercifully on this miserable <lb/>
              earth, and also on all mankind: because it now all struggles <lb/>

          <p>§ I. WHILST the Mind was uttering such sorrow, and was <lb/>
            singing this lay, Wisdom and Reason looked on him with <lb/>
            cheerful eyes; and be was nothing disturbed on account of <lb/>
            the Mind's lamentation, but said to the Mind: As soon as I <lb/>
            first saw thee in this trouble, thus complaining, I perceived <lb/>
            that thou wast departed from thy father's country, that is <lb/>
            from my precepts. Thou departedst therefrom when thou <lb/>
            didst abandon thy fixed state of mind, and tboughtest that <lb/>
            Fortune governed this world according to her own pleasure, <lb/>
            without God's counsel, and his permission, and men's deserts. <lb/>
            I knew that thou wast departed, but I knew not how far, <lb/>
            until thou thyself toldest it to me, by thy lamentations. <lb/>
            But though thou art now farther than thou wast, thou art <lb/>
            not nevertheless entirely driven from the country; though <lb/>
            thou bast wandered therein. Nor, moreover, could any other <pb n="10"/>

              man lead thee into error, except thyself, through thine own <lb/>
              negligence. Nor could any one thus believe it of thee, when <lb/>
              thou wouldest call to mind, of what families thou wast, and <lb/>
              of what citizens, as to the world: or again, spiritually, of <lb/>
              what society thou wast in thy mind, and in thy reason: that <lb/>
              is that thou art one of the just, and of those who will rightly, <lb/>
              who are the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem. Thence no <lb/>
              one was ever driven against his own will, that is from his <lb/>
              right will. Wheresoever he might be, he had this always <lb/>
              with him; when he had this with him, wheresoever he might <lb/>
              be, he was with his own kin, and with his own citizens, in <lb/>
              his own land, when he was in the company of the just. <lb/>
              Whosoever, then, is worthy of this, that be may be in their <lb/>
              service, he is in the highest freedom. I shun not this <lb/>
              inferior, and this unclean place, if I find thee well in­ <lb/>
              structed. I am not desirous of walls wrought with glass, or <lb/>
              of thrones ornamented with gold and with jewels; nor am I <lb/>
              so desirous of-books written with gold, as I am desirous of a <lb/>
              right will in thee. I seek not here books, but that which <lb/>
              books are profitable for, that I may make thy mind perfectly <lb/>
              right. Thou complainedest of evil fortune, both on account <lb/>
              of the height of unjust power, and on account of my mean­ <lb/>
              ness and dishonour; and also on account of the uncontrolled <lb/>
              license of the wicked, with respect to these worldly goods. <lb/>
              But as very great trouble has now come upon thee, both from <lb/>
              thine anger and from thy sorrow, I may not yet answer thee, <lb/>
              before the time for it arrives.</p>
          <p>§ II. For whatsoever any one begins out of season, has no <lb/>
            good end. When the sun's brightness in the month of August <lb/>
            hottest shines; then does he foolishly, who will at that time <lb/>
            sow any seed in the dry furrows. So also does he, who will <lb/>
            seek flowers in the storms of winter. Nor canst thou press <lb/>
            wine at mid-winter, though thou be desirous of warm must.</p>
          <p>§ III. Then spake Wisdom, and said: May I now inquire <lb/>
            a little concerning the fixedness of thy mind, that I may <lb/>
            thereby discover whence and how I may effect thy cure ? <lb/>
            Then answered the Mind, and said: Inquire as thou wilt. <pb n="12"/>

              Then said Reason : Dost thou believe that Fortune governs <lb/>
              this world, or that aught of good can be thus made, without <lb/>
              the Maker ? Then answered the Mind, and said: I do not <lb/>
              believe that it could be made so full of order; but I know <lb/>
              forsooth that God is governor of his own work, and I never <lb/>
              swerved from this true belief. Then answered Wisdom again, <lb/>
              and said: About that very thing thou wast singing a little <lb/>
              while ago, and saidst, that every creature from God knew its <lb/>
              right time, and fulfilled its right institution, except man alone. <lb/>
              Therefore I wonder beyond measure, what it can be, or what <lb/>
              thou meanest, now thou hast this belief. We must, however, <lb/>
              inquire still more deeply concerning it. I do not know very <lb/>
              well about what thou still doubtest. Tell me, since thou <lb/>
              sayest that thou doubtest not that God is governor of this <lb/>
              world, how He, then, would that it should he. Then answered <lb/>
              the Mind, and said: I can scarcely understand thy questions, <lb/>
              and yet thou sayest that I must answer thee. Wisdom then <lb/>
              said: Dost thou think that I am ignorant of the severity of <lb/>
              thy trouble, that thou art encompassed with P But tell me, <lb/>
              to what end does every beginning tend ? Then answered the <lb/>
              Mind, and said: I remembered it formerly, but this grief has <lb/>
              deprived me of the recollection. Then said Wisdom: Dost <lb/>
              thou know whence every creature came ? Then answered the, <lb/>
              Mind, and said: I know that every creature came from God. <lb/>
              Then said Wisdom: How can it be, that now thou knowest <lb/>
              the beginning, thou knowest not also the end P for grief may <lb/>
              agitate the mind, but it cannot bereave it of its faculties. <lb/>
              But I desire that thou wouldest inform me, whether thou <lb/>
              knowest what thou thyself art. It then answered, and said: <lb/>
              I know that I am of living men, and rational, and neverthe­ <lb/>
              less of mortal. Then answered Wisdom, and said: Knowest <lb/>
              thou anything else, to say of thyself, besides what thou hast <lb/>
              now said ? Then said the Mind: I know nothing else. Then <lb/>
              said Wisdom : I have now learned thy mental disease, since <lb/>
              thou knowest not what thou thyself art: but I know how I <lb/>
              must cure thy disease. For this reason thou saidst thou wert <lb/>
              an exile, and bereaved of all good, because thou knewest not <lb/>
              what thou wert. Thou showedst that thou didst not know to <lb/>
              what end every beginning tended, when thou thoughtest that <pb n="14"/>

              outrageous and reckless men were happy and powerful in this <lb/>
              world: and moreover thou showedst that thou didst not know <lb/>
              with what government God rules this world, or how He would <lb/>
              that it should be, when thou saidst that thou thoughtest that <lb/>
              this inconstant Fortune changes this world without God's <lb/>
              counsel. But it was a very great peril that thou shouldest <lb/>
              so think. Not only wast thou in immoderate trouble, but <lb/>
              thou hadst well-nigh altogether perished. Thank God, there­ <lb/>
              fore, that he has assisted thee, so that I have not entirely for­ <lb/>
              saken thy mind. We have already the chief part of the fuel <lb/>
              for thy cure, now thou believest that Fortune cannot of her­ <lb/>
              self, without God's counsel, change this world. Now thou <lb/>
              hast no need to fear anything, for from the little spark which <lb/>
              thou hast caught with this fuel, the light of life will shine upon <lb/>
              thee. But it is not yet time that I should animate thee more <lb/>
              highly: for it is the custom of every mind, that as soon as it <lb/>
              forsakes true sayings, it follows false opinions. From hence, <lb/>
              then, begin to grow the mists which trouble the mind, and <lb/>
              withal confound the true sight, such mists as are now on thy <lb/>
              mind.. But I must dispel them first, that I may afterwards <lb/>
              the more easily bring upon thee the true light.</p>

          <p>LOOK now at the sun, and also at the other heavenly <lb/>
            bodies; when the swarthy clouds come before them, they <lb/>
            cannot give their light. So also, the south wind sometimes <lb/>
            with a great storm troubles the aea, which before, in serene <lb/>
            weather, was transparent as glass to behold. When it then is <lb/>
            so mingled with the billows it is very quickly unpleasant, <lb/>
            though it before was pleasant to look upon. So also is the <lb/>
            brook, though it be strong in its right course, when a great <lb/>
            stone rolling down from the high mountain falls into it, and <lb/>
            divides it, and hinders it from its right course. In like <lb/>
            manner does the darkness of thy trouble now withstand my <lb/>
            enlightened precepts. But if thou art desirous with right <lb/>
            faith to know the true light; put away from thee evil and <lb/>
            vain joys, and also the vain sorrows, and the evil fear of this <lb/>

          <p>§ I. THEN was Wisdom silent a little while, till he per­ <lb/>
            ceived the Mind's thoughts. When he had perceived them, <lb/>
            then said he: If I have rightly understood thy trouble, <lb/>
            nothing affects thee more than this, that thou hast lost the <lb/>
            worldly prosperity which thou formerly hadst, and now <lb/>
            lamentest because it is changed. I perceive clearly enough <lb/>
            that worldly goods with many an allurement very deceitfully <lb/>
            flatter the minds which they intend at last utterly to betray: <lb/>
            and then at length, when they least expect it, scornfully leave <lb/>
            them in the deepest sorrow. If thou now desirest to know <lb/>
            whence they come, then mayest thou learn that they come <lb/>
            from worldly covetousness. If thou then wilt know their <lb/>
            manners, thou mayest learn that they are not faithful to any <lb/>
            man. Hence thou mayest understand that thou hadst no <lb/>
            pleasure when thou hadst them; nor again, didst lose .any <lb/>
            when thou didst lose them. I thought that I had formerly <lb/>
            instructed thee, so that thou mightest know them ; and I <lb/>
            knew that thou despisedst them when thou hadst them, <lb/>
            though thou didst use them. I knew that thou, against <lb/>
            their will, didst often repeat my sayings. But I know that <lb/>
            no custom can be changed in any man without the mind <lb/>
            being in some measure disquieted. Therefore thou art also <lb/>
            now moved from thy tranquillity.</p>
          <p>§ If. 0 Mind, what has cast thee into this care, and into <lb/>
            these lamentations ? Is it something unusual that has bap­ <lb/>
            pened to thee, so that the same before ailed not other men ? <lb/>
            If thou then thinkest that it is on thy account that worldly <lb/>
            goods are so changed towards thee, then art thou in error: <lb/>
            for their manners are such. They kept towards thee their <lb/>
            own nature, and in their changeableness they show their con­ <lb/>
            stant state. They were exactly, when they most allured thee, <lb/>
            such as they are now, though they flattered thee with false <lb/>
            happiness. Thou hast now understood the unstable promises <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="18"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VII. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              of this blind pleasure. These promises which are now ex­ <lb/>
              posed to thee, are yet to many others concealed. Thpu now <lb/>
              knowest what manners worldly goods have, and how they <lb/>
              change. If thou, then, art desirous to be their servant, and <lb/>
              their manners are pleasing to thee, wherefore mournest thou <lb/>
              so much? Why changest thou not also with them? But <lb/>
              if thou wouldst avoid their deceits, then despise them, and <lb/>
              drive them from thee, for they seduce thee to thy ruin. The <lb/>
              same things which have now occasioned to thee these lamenta­ <lb/>
              tions, because thou hadst them, would have suffered thee to <lb/>
              be in tranquillity if thou never hadst obtained them. The <lb/>
              same things have now forsaken thee, of their own will, not of <lb/>
              thine, which never forsake any man without occasioning <lb/>
              sorrow. Do these things now seem to thee very dear and very <lb/>
              precious, which are neither constant to possess, nor yet easy <lb/>
              to relinquish : but when they are departing from any one, he <lb/>
              shall with the greatest sorrow of his mind relinquish therm? <lb/>
              Since, then, thou canst not, according to thy wish, have them <lb/>
              faithful to thee, and they will bring thee into mourning when <lb/>
              they depart from thee; for what else then do they come, but <lb/>
              for a token of care and unmixed sorrow ? The worldly goods <lb/>
              are not alone to be thought about which we at the time pos­ <lb/>
              sess, but every prudent mind observes what end they have; <lb/>
              and forewarns itself both against their threats, and against <lb/>
              their allurements. But if thou choosest to be their servant, <lb/>
              then oughtest thou willingly to bear whatever belongs to <lb/>
              their service, and to their manners, and to their will. If <lb/>
              thou, then, art desirous that they should, on thy account, <lb/>
              assume other manners than their will and custom is; dost <lb/>
              thou not then dishonour thyself, inasmuch as thou rebellest <lb/>
              against the government which thou thyself hast chosen ? and <lb/>
              nevertheless thou canst not change their custom or their <lb/>
              nature. Besides, thou knowest that if thou spreadest the <lb/>
              sail of thy ship to the wind, thou then leanest all thy course <lb/>
              to the power of the wind. So, if thou hast given up thyself <lb/>
              to the power of worldly goods, it is right that thou shouldest <lb/>
              also follow their manners. Thinkest thou, that thou canst <lb/>
              turn back the revolving wheel when it moves in its course ? <lb/>
              No more canst thou alter the inconstancy of worldly pros­ <lb/>
              perity. <note type="footnote"> o2 <lb/>

          <p>§ III. I am still desirous that we should discourse further <lb/>
            concerning worldly goods. Why didst thou, just now, up­ <lb/>
            braid me that thou hadst lost them on ray account? Why <lb/>
            dost thou complain against me, as if thou, for my advantage, <lb/>
            wert deprived of thine own ; either of thy riches or thy dig­ <lb/>
            nity ? both of which formerly came to thee from me, when <lb/>
            they were lent thee. Let us now speak before such judge as <lb/>
            thou wilt; and if thou art able to prove that any mortal <lb/>
            man possessed anything of this kind as his own, I will give <lb/>
            thee again all that thou canst say was thine own. I received <lb/>
            thee ignorant and uninstructed, when thou first earnest to <lb/>
            man's estate, and then taught and instructed thee, and im­ <lb/>
            parted to thee wisdom, whereby thou obtainedst the worldly <lb/>
            possessions which thou now sorrowing hast lost. Thou mayest <lb/>
            therefore be thankful that thou hast well enjoyed my gifts. <lb/>
            Nor canst thou say that thou hast lost aught of thine own. <lb/>
            Why complainest thou against me ? Have I in any wise de­ <lb/>
            prived thee of those thy gifts which came to thee from me? <lb/>
            All true wealth and true dignity, are mine own servants, and <lb/>
            wheresoever I am, they are with me. Know thou for truth, <lb/>
            if the riches which thou art lamenting that thou hast lost <lb/>
            them, had been thine own, thou couldest not have lost them, <lb/>
            0, how unjustly do many worldly men act towards me, in <lb/>
            that I may not govern mine own servants! The heaven may <lb/>
            bring light days, and again obscure the light with darkness: <lb/>
            the year may bring blossoms, and the same year again take <lb/>
            them away. The sea may enjoy calm waves ; and all creatures <lb/>
            may keep their custom and their will, except me alone. I <lb/>
            alone am deprived of my manners, and am allured to manners <lb/>
            foreign to me, through the insatiable covetousness of worldly <lb/>
            men. Through covetousness have they deprived me of my <lb/>
            name, which I should rightly have. This name I should <lb/>
            rightly have, that I am wealth and dignity: but they have <lb/>
            taken it from me, and in their pride they have given and <lb/>
            drawn me to their false riches; so that I may not, with my <lb/>
            servants, exercise my employments as all other creatures may. <lb/>
            My servants are wisdom, and virtues, and true riches. With <lb/>
            these servants was always my pastime; with these servants I <lb/>
            am encompassing all the heaven, and the lowest I bring to the <lb/>
            highest, and the highest to the lowest; that is, I bring humility <pb n="22"/>

              <note type="margin"> § IV. V. </note> <lb/>
              to the heavens, and heavenly blessings to the humble. But <lb/>
              when I ascend with my servants, then look we down on this <lb/>
              stormy world, like the eagle, when he soars above the clouds <lb/>
              in stormy weather, that the storms may not hurt him. In <lb/>
              like manner, I am desirous, 0 Mind, that thou shouldest <lb/>
              ascend to us, if thou art willing: on the condition that thou <lb/>
              wilt again with us seek the earth for the advantage of good <lb/>
              men. Dost thou not know my manners ? how careful I <lb/>
              always was concerning the wants of good men ? Knowest <lb/>
              thou how mindful I was of the necessity of Crœsus, the <lb/>
              Grecian king, when Cyrus, king of Persia, had seized him, <lb/>
              and would burn him ? When they cast him into the fire, I <lb/>
              delivered him with heavenly rain. But thou, on account of <lb/>
              thy virtue, wast over-confident; and thoughtest that because <lb/>
              of thy good intention nothing unjust could befal thee: as if <lb/>
              thou wouldest have the reward of all thy good works in this <lb/>
              world ! How couldest thou dwell in the midst of the common <lb/>
              country, without suffering the same as other men ? How <lb/>
              couldest thou be in the midst of this changeable state, with­ <lb/>
              out also feeling some evil through adversity ? What else do <lb/>
              the poets sing concerning this world, but the various changes <lb/>
              of this world ? What is there peculiar to thee, that thou <lb/>
              shouldest not change therewith ? Why carest thou how it <lb/>
              may change, when I am always with thee ? This change <lb/>
              was to thee more tolerable, because thou didst not too much <lb/>
              desire these worldly goods, and because thou didst not, more­ <lb/>
              over, place greater confidence in them.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Though to the covetous man come as many riches <lb/>
            as there are grains of sand by the sea-cliffs, or stars which in <lb/>
            dark nights shine; he nevertheless will not cease from com­ <lb/>
            plaints, so as not to lament his poverty. Though God fulfil <lb/>
            the wishes of wealthy men with gold, and with silver, and <lb/>
            with all precious things, nevertheless the thirst of their <lb/>
            avarice will not be satisfied, but the unfathomable gulf will <lb/>
            have very many waste holes to gather into. Who can give <lb/>
            enough to the insane miser ? The more any one gives to him, <lb/>
            the more he covets.</p>
          <p>§ V. How wilt thou now answer worldly goods, if they say <lb/>
            to thee: Why blamest thou us, 0 Mind ? why art thou angry <pb n="24"/>

              <note type="margin"> CHAP. Till. </note> <lb/>
              with us ? in what have we offended thee ? Indeed thou wast <lb/>
              desirous of us, not we of thee! Thou didst set us on the seat <lb/>
              of thy Maker, when thou didst look to us for that good which <lb/>
              thou shouldest have sought from him. Thou gayest that we <lb/>
              have betrayed thee; but we may rather say that thou hast <lb/>
              betrayed us, since through thy desire, and through thy <lb/>
              covetousness, the Maker of all creatures will abhor us. Thou <lb/>
              art therefore more guilty than we, both on account of thine <lb/>
              own wicked desire, and also because, through thee, we cannot <lb/>
              perform our Maker's will. For he lent us to thee, to be en­ <lb/>
              joyed according to his commandments, not to fulfil the desire <lb/>
              of thine evil covetousness. Answer us now, said Wisdom, as <lb/>
              thou wilt: we wait for thine answer.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THEN said the Mind, I perceive myself every way guilty; <lb/>
            but I am so greatly oppressed with this loathsome sorrow, <lb/>
            that I cannot answer you. Then said Wisdom again: It is <lb/>
            still thy fault that thou art almost despairing. But I am <lb/>
            unwilling that thou shouldest despair: I would rather that <lb/>
            thou wert ashamed of such error; for he who despairs is dis­ <lb/>
            tracted; but he who is ashamed is in repentance. If thou <lb/>
            now wilt call to mind all the honours, in respect of this world, <lb/>
            which thou hast had since thou first wert born, until this day; <lb/>
            if thou wilt now reckon all the enjoyments against the sor­ <lb/>
            rows; thou canst not very easily say that thou art miserable <lb/>
            and unhappy. For I took charge of thee unexperienced, and <lb/>
            uninstructed; and adopted thee as my child, and inured thee <lb/>
            to my discipline. Who can then say aught else, but that thou <lb/>
            wert most happy, when thou wert beloved by me ere known; <lb/>
            and sooner than thou knewest my discipline and my manners : <lb/>
            and I taught thee young such wisdom as is to many other <lb/>
            older minds denied: and improved thee with mine instruc­ <lb/>
            tions, until thou wert chosen a judge ? If thou now sayest, <lb/>
            that thou art not happy, because thou hast not the temporary <lb/>
            honours and the enjoyments which thou formerly hadst, still <lb/>
            thou art not unhappy : for the sorrows wherein thou now art, <lb/>
            will in like manner pass away, as thou sayest the enjoyments <lb/>
            formerly did. Thinkest thou now, that to thee alone such <lb/>
            change and such sorrow happen, and that the like could <pb n="26"/>

              happen to no other mind, either before thee, or after thee ? <lb/>
              Or thinkest thou that to any human mind there can be any <lb/>
              thing constant, without change ? Or if it for a time to any <lb/>
              man firmly remain, death at .least will take it away, so that <lb/>
              it may not be where it before was. What are worldly goods, <lb/>
              but an emblem of death ? For death comes for nothing else, <lb/>
              but that it may take away life. So also worldly goods come <lb/>
              to the mind, in order that they may deprive it of that which <lb/>
              is dearest to it in this world; that is, when they depart from <lb/>
              it. Say, 0 Mind, whether thou judgest more wisely, seeing <lb/>
              that naught of worldly -power can be constant and unchange­ <lb/>
              able ? Whether thou despisest them, and of thine own choice <lb/>
              canst relinquish them without regret, so that thou canst abide <lb/>
              it when they leave thee sorrowful ?</p>

          <p>THEN began Wisdom to sing, and sung thus: When the <lb/>
            sun in the serene heaven brightest shines, then become dark <lb/>
            all the stars, because their brightness is no brightness by <lb/>
            reason of her. When the south-west wind gently blows, then <lb/>
            grow very quickly field flowers; but when the stark wind <lb/>
            cometh from the north-east, then does it very soon destroy <lb/>
            the rose's beauty. So oftentimes the north wind's tempest <lb/>
            stirs the too tranquil sea. Alas! that there is nothing of <lb/>
            fast-standing work ever remaining in the world!</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER X.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THEN said Boetbius: 0 Wisdom, thou who art the mother <lb/>
            of all virtues, I cannot gainsay or deny that which thou hast <lb/>
            said to me, because it is all true: for I have now learned that <lb/>
            those my felicities, and the prosperity, which I formerly <lb/>
            thought should be happiness, are no happiness because they <lb/>
            so speedily depart. But this has most of all troubled me, <lb/>
            when I most deeply think about that which I have clearly <lb/>
            learned, that it is the greatest infelicity of this present life, <lb/>
            that any one is first happy, and afterwards unhappy. Then <lb/>
            auswered Wisdom and Reason, and said: Thou canst not with <pb n="28"/>

              <note type="margin"> CHAP. X. </note> <lb/>
              truth accuse thy fortune and thy happiness, as thou supposest, <lb/>
              on account of the false unhappiness which thou art suffering. <lb/>
              It is a deception when thou imaginest that thou art unhappy. <lb/>
              But if it has so much troubled thee and made thee sad, that <lb/>
              thou hast lost the false happiness; then may I plainly tell <lb/>
              thee, that thou well knowest that thou hast still the greatest <lb/>
              part of thy felicities, which thou formerly hadst. Tell me <lb/>
              now, whether thou canst with justice complain of thy mis­ <lb/>
              fortunes, as if thou hadst altogether lost thy happiness, since <lb/>
              thou hast yet kept entire everything most precious, which <lb/>
              thou wast anxious about? How canst thou, then, lament <lb/>
              the worse, and the more unworthy, when thou hast retained <lb/>
              the more desirable ? Thou knowest, however, that the orna­ <lb/>
              ment of all mankind, and the greatest honour, yet lives; that <lb/>
              is Symmachus, thy father-in-law. He is yet hale and sound, <lb/>
              and has enough of every good; for I know that thou wouldest <lb/>
              not be unwilling to give thine own life for him, if thou wert <lb/>
              to see him in any difficulties. For the man is full of wisdom <lb/>
              and virtues, and sufficiently free, as yet, from all earthly fear. <lb/>
              He is very sorry for thy troubles, and for thy banishment. <lb/>
              How! is not thy wife also living, the daughter of the same <lb/>
              Symmachus ? and she is very prudent, and very modest. <lb/>
              She has surpassed all other wives in virtue. All her excel­ <lb/>
              lence I may sum up to thee in few words: that is, that she <lb/>
              is in all her manners like her father. She now lives for thee, <lb/>
              thee alone: for she loves nothing else except thee. Of all <lb/>
              good she has enough in this present life, but she has despised <lb/>
              it all, beside thee alone. She renounces it all, because she <lb/>
              has not thee. Of this alone she feels the want. Because of <lb/>
              thy absence, everything which she has seems naught to her. <lb/>
              Therefore she is through love of thee, wasted, and almost <lb/>
              dead with tears and with grief. What shall we say concern­ <lb/>
              ing thy two sons, who are noblemen and counsellors; in <lb/>
              whom is manifest the ability and all the virtues of their <lb/>
              father, and of their grandfather, so far as young men may <lb/>
              most resemble old men ? Therefore I wonder why thou <lb/>
              canst not understand, that thou art, as yet, very happy, since <lb/>
              thou still livest and art hale. This, indeed, is the greatest <lb/>
              possession of mortal men, that they live and are hale; and <lb/>
              thou hast yet in addition, all that I have already mentioned <pb n="30"/>

              <note type="margin"> §I. </note> <lb/>
              to thee. But I know that this is even more valuable than <lb/>
              man's life: for many a man would wish that he himself <lb/>
              should die, rather than behold his wife and children dying. <lb/>
              Why toilest thou then in weeping without a cause ? Thou <lb/>
              canst not yet blame thy fortune, nor upbraid thy life: nor <lb/>
              art thou altogether brought to naught, as thou thinkest. <lb/>
              No unbearable misery has yet befallen thee, for thine anchor <lb/>
              is still fast in the earth: that is, the noblemen whom we <lb/>
              before mentioned. They suffer thee not to despair of this <lb/>
              present life: and again, thine own faith, and the divine love <lb/>
              and hope; these then suffer thee not to despair of the ever­ <lb/>
              lasting life. Then answered the sorrowful Mind, and said: <lb/>
              0, that the anchors were so secure, and so permanent, both <lb/>
              for God, and for the world, as thou sayest! then might we <lb/>
              the more easily bear whatsoever misfortunes come upon us. <lb/>
              They all seem the lighter to us, so long as the anchors are <lb/>
              fast. But thou mayest, nevertheless, perceive how my felici­ <lb/>
              ties, and my dignity here, in respect of the world, is changed.</p>

          <p>§ I. THEN answered Wisdom and Reason, and said: I <lb/>
            think, however, that I have, in some measure, raised thee up <lb/>
            from this sorrow; and almost brought thee to the same dig­ <lb/>
            nity which thou before hadst. Only thou art yet too full of <lb/>
            what thou hast relinquished, and art therefore grieved. But <lb/>
            I cannot endure thy lamentations for the little that thou <lb/>
            hast lost. For thou always, with weeping and with sorrow, <lb/>
            mournest, if there be to thee a lack of anything desired, <lb/>
            though it be of something little. Who was ever in this <lb/>
            present life, or who is now, or who shall be yet after us in <lb/>
            this world, to whom nothing against his will may happen, <lb/>
            either little or much ? Very narrow, and very worthless, are <lb/>
            human enjoyments: for either they never come to a man, or <lb/>
            they never constantly remain there such as they first came. <lb/>
            This I will hereafter more clearly show. We know that <lb/>
            some may have enough of all worldly wealth ; but they have <lb/>
            nevertheless shame of the wealth, if they are not so Noble in <lb/>
            birth as they wish. Some are. very noble and eminent on <lb/>
            account of their birth, but they are oppressed and made sad <pb n="32"/>

              by indigence and poverty, so that it were more desirable to <lb/>
              them to be unnoble, than so poor, if it were in their power. <lb/>
              Many are, indeed, both full noble and full wealthy, and are <lb/>
              nevertheless very unhappy, when they have either of these <lb/>
              things; either when they have wives as yoke-fellows with <lb/>
              them, or have not yoke-fellows. Many have married happily <lb/>
              enough, but for want of children, they leave all the riches <lb/>
              which they amass to strangers to enjoy, and they are there­ <lb/>
              fore unhappy. Some have children enough, but they are <lb/>
              sometimes unhealthy, or evil and worthless, or soon depart, <lb/>
              so that the parents therefore mourn all their life. Hence no <lb/>
              man can, in this present life, be altogether suited in respect <lb/>
              of his fortune. Though he have nothing at all to sorrow <lb/>
              about, this is able to make him sorrowful, that he knows not <lb/>
              what is about to happen to him, whether good or evil, any <lb/>
              more than thou knewest; and moreover he fears, that what <lb/>
              he then happily enjoys, be may lose. Show me now any man <lb/>
              of those who appear to thee the happiest, and who is most <lb/>
              distinguished for the enjoyment of his desires. I tell thee <lb/>
              at once, that thou mayest observe that he is often immo­ <lb/>
              derately troubled for very trifling things: if anything hap­ <lb/>
              pens to him against his will, or contrary to his custom, <lb/>
              though it be ever so little; unless he may give his nod to <lb/>
              every man to run at his will. Wonderfully little can cause <lb/>
              the happiest man of all, here in respect of the world, that he <lb/>
              should think that his happiness is either much lessened, or <lb/>
              entirely lost. Thou now thickest that thou art very miser­ <lb/>
              able : and I know that to many a man, it would seem that <lb/>
              he were exalted to the heavens, if he had any part of thy <lb/>
              felicities, which thou hast still. Moreover, the place wherein <lb/>
              thou art now detained, and which thou callest thy place of <lb/>
              exile, is the country of the men who were born there, and <lb/>
              also of those who by their own will dwell there. Nothing <lb/>
              is evil, until a man thinks that it is evil: and though it be <lb/>
              now heavy and adverse, yet it will be happiness, if he acts <lb/>
              willingly, and patiently bears it. Scarcely any one is so pru­ <lb/>
              dent when he is in impatience, as not to wish that his happi­ <lb/>
              ness were destroyed. With very much bitterness is the <lb/>
              sweetness of this world mingled. Though it seem pleasant <lb/>
              to any one, he will be unable to hold it, if it begin to fly <lb/>
              from him. Is it not, then, very evident, how inconstant <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>

              worldly goods are; when they are not able to satisfy the <lb/>
              poor, inasmuch as he always desires something of that which <lb/>
              he has not; neither do they always dwell with the patient <lb/>
              and moderate.</p>
          <p>§ II. Why seek ye, then, around you the happiness which <lb/>
            ye have placed within you by the divine power ? But ye <lb/>
            know not what ye do: ye are in error. But I can, with few <lb/>
            words, show you what is the roof of all happiness: for which <lb/>
            I know thou wilt strive until thou obtainest it: this, then, is <lb/>
            good. Canst thou now discover whether thou hast anything <lb/>
            more precious to thee than thyself? I think, though, thou <lb/>
            wilt say that thou hast nothing more precious. I know, if <lb/>
            thou badst full power of thyself, thou wouldest then have <lb/>
            something in thyself, which thou never, with thine own con­ <lb/>
            sent, wouldest relinquish, nor could Fortune take it from <lb/>
            thee. Therefore I advise thee, that thou learn, that there is <lb/>
            no happiness in this present life. But learn that nothing is <lb/>
            better in this present life than reason: because man cannot <lb/>
            by any means lose it. Therefore that wealth is better, which <lb/>
            never can be lost, than that which may, and shall be lost. <lb/>
            Is it not, now, clearly enough proved to thee, that Fortune <lb/>
            cannot give thee any happiness? because each is insecure, <lb/>
            both Fortune and happiness; for these goods are very frail, <lb/>
            and very perishable. Indeed, every one who possesses these <lb/>
            worldly goods, either knows that they are about to depart <lb/>
            from him, or he is ignorant of it. If, then, he is ignorant of <lb/>
            it, what happiness has he in riches, when he is so foolish, and <lb/>
            so unwise as to be ignorant of this ? But if he knows it, then <lb/>
            he dreads that they may be lost, and also is well aware that <lb/>
            he must leave them. Continual fear suffers not any man to <lb/>
            be happy. If then any man cares not whether he have that <lb/>
            wealth, which be may not have, even when be has it; truly <lb/>
            that is for little happiness, or none, which a man may so <lb/>
            easily lose. I think, moreover, that I had formerly with <lb/>
            sufficient clearness taught thee by many arguments, that the <lb/>
            souls of men are immortal and eternal: and it is so evident <lb/>
            that no man need doubt it, that all men end in death, and <lb/>
            also their riches. Therefore I wonder why meu are so irra­ <lb/>
            tional as to think that this present life can make man happy <lb/>
            whilst he lives, seeing that it cannot, after it is ended, make <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>

              who have sought eternal happiness, not by this alone, that <lb/>
              they chose the bodily death, but they also willingly submitted <lb/>
              to many grievous torments on account of the eternal life: <lb/>
              those were all the holy martyrs.</p>

          <p>THEN began Wisdom to sing, and sung thus,—he prolonged <lb/>
            with verse the speech that he before made, and said: He who <lb/>
            will build a firm house, must not set it upon the highest hill; <lb/>
            and he who will seek heavenly wisdom, must not seek it with <lb/>
            arrogance. And, again, he who is desirous to build a firm <lb/>
            house, should not set it on sand-hills. So also if thou art <lb/>
            desirous to build wisdom, set it not on avarice.. For as <lb/>
            thirsty sand swallows the rain, so avarice swallows the <lb/>
            perishable riches of this middle-earth, because it is always <lb/>
            thirsty after them. A house cannot long stand on the high <lb/>
            mountain, if a very violent wind press on it; nor has it that <lb/>
            which may stand on the thirsty sand for excessive rain. Thus <lb/>
            also the human mind is subverted, and moved from its place, <lb/>
            when the wind of strong afflictions agitate it, or the rain of <lb/>
            immoderate care. But he who wishes to have eternal happi­ <lb/>
            ness, should fly from the dangerous splendour of this middle- <lb/>
            earth, and build the house of his mind on the firm rock of <lb/>
            humility. For Christ dwells in the vale of humility, and in <lb/>
            the mind of wisdom. Therefore the wise man ever leads all <lb/>
            his life in joy, unchangeable and secure, when he despises <lb/>
            both these earthly goods, and also the evils; and hopes for <lb/>
            the future, which are eternal. For God preserves him every­ <lb/>
            where, perpetually dwelling in the enjoyments of his mind: <lb/>
            though the wind of troubles, and the continual care of these <lb/>
            worldly goods, blow upon him.</p>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom and Reason had thus sung this lay, then <lb/>
            began he again to make a speech, and thus said: Methiuks <lb/>
            that we may now argue more closely, and with profounder <lb/>
            words; for I perceive that my doctrine, in some degree, <pb n="38"/>

              enters into thy mind, and thou understandest well enough <lb/>
              what I say unto thee. Consider, now, what is thine own of <lb/>
              all these worldly possessions and riches; or what of great <lb/>
              price thou hast therein, if thou rationally examinest it. <lb/>
              What bast thou from the gifts and from the riches, which <lb/>
              thou sayest fortune gives you, even though they were eternal ? <lb/>
              Tell me now, whether in thy judgment, this thy wealth, is so <lb/>
              precious to thee from its own nature. But I say to thee <lb/>
              that it is from its own nature, not from thine. If it, then, <lb/>
              is from its own nature and not from thine, why art thou ever <lb/>
              the better for its good ? Tell me what of it seems to thee <lb/>
              most precious: whether gold, or what ? I know, however, <lb/>
              gold. But though it be good and precious, yet will he be <lb/>
              more celebrated and more beloved, who gives it, than he who <lb/>
              gathers, and takes it from others. Riches, also, are more <lb/>
              honourable, and more estimable when any one gives them, <lb/>
              than they are when he gathers and keeps them. Covetous­ <lb/>
              ness, indeed, makes misers loathsome both to God and to men: <lb/>
              and liberality always makes them estimable, and famous, and <lb/>
              worthy, both to God and to the men whom they befriend. <lb/>
              Since, then, wealth cannot be both with those who give it, <lb/>
              and with those who receive it; all wealth is therefore better <lb/>
              and more precious given than held. If even all the wealth <lb/>
              of this middle-earth should come to one man, would not all <lb/>
              other men be poor, except one? It is sufficiently evident <lb/>
              that the good word and good fame of every man is better and <lb/>
              more precious than any wealth : for this word fills the ears of <lb/>
              all those who hear it, and yet is not the less with him who <lb/>
              speaks it. His heart's recess it opens, and the locked heart <lb/>
              of another it penetrates, and in the way between them it is <lb/>
              not lessened, nor can any one with sword slay it, nor with <lb/>
              rope bind, nor does it ever perish. But these your riches, if <lb/>
              they were always yours, there does not the sooner seem to you <lb/>
              enough of them; and if ye may not give them to other men, <lb/>
              ye never the more therewith satisfy their want and their de­ <lb/>
              sire, Though thou divide them as small as dust, yet thou <lb/>
              canat not satisfy all men equally: and when thou hast divided <lb/>
              all, thou wilt tLon be poor thyself. Are the riches of this <lb/>
              middle-earth worthy of a man when no one can fully have <pb n="40"/>

              another to poverty. Does the beauty of gems attract your <lb/>
              eyes to them, to wonder at them ? I know that they do so. <lb/>
              But the excellence of the beauty which is in gems is theirs, <lb/>
              not yours. Wherefore I am excessively astonished why the <lb/>
              good of the irrational creature seems to you better than your <lb/>
              own good: why ye so immoderately admire gems, or any of <lb/>
              the insensible things which have not reason : for they with <lb/>
              no justice can deserve that ye should admire them. Though <lb/>
              they are God's creatures, they are not to be compared with <lb/>
              you. For either it is no good for yourselves, or at least for <lb/>
              little good, compared with you. We too much despise our­ <lb/>
              selves when we love that which is beneath us, in our own <lb/>
              power, more than ourselves, or the Lord who made us, and <lb/>
              gave us all good things. Do fair lands delight thee ?</p>

          <p>§ I. THEN answered the Mind to Reason, and said: Why <lb/>
            should not fair land delight me ? Is not that the fairest part <lb/>
            of God's creatures ? Full often we rejoice at the serene sea, <lb/>
            and also admire the beauty of the sun, and of the moon, and <lb/>
            of all the stars. Then answered Wisdom and Reason to the <lb/>
            Mind, and thus said : What belongs to thee of their fairness ? <lb/>
            Darest thou to boast that their fairness is thine ? No, no. <lb/>
            Dost thou not know that thou madest none of them ? But <lb/>
            if thou wilt glory, glory in God. Dost thou rejoice in the <lb/>
            fair blossoms of Easter, as if thou madest them ? Canst thou <lb/>
            then make anything of this kind, or hast thou any part in the <lb/>
            work ? No, no. Do not thou so. Is it through thy power <lb/>
            that the harvest is so rich in fruits ? Do not 1 know that it <lb/>
            is not through thy power ? Why art thou then inflamed with <lb/>
            such vain glory ? or why lovest thou external goods so im­ <lb/>
            moderately, as if they were thy own? Thinkest thou that <lb/>
            fortune can cause to thee, that those things should be thy <lb/>
            own, which their own natures have made foreign to thee ? <lb/>
            No, no. It is not natural to thee that thou shouldest pos­ <lb/>
            sess them; nor is it their nature, that they should follow thee. <lb/>
            But heavenly things are natural to thee, not these earthly. <pb n="42"/>

              These earthly fruits are created for the food of cattle; and <lb/>
              worldly riches are created for a snare to those men who are <lb/>
              like cattle, that is, vicious and intemperate. To those, more­ <lb/>
              over, they come ofteuest. But if thou wouldest have the <lb/>
              measure, and wouldest know what is needful; then is it, <lb/>
              meat and drink, and clothes, and tools for such craft as thou <lb/>
              knowest, which is natural to thee, and which is right for thee <lb/>
              to possess. What advantage is it to thee, that thou shouldest <lb/>
              desire these present goods beyond measure, when they can <lb/>
              neither help thee nor themselves ? With very little of them <lb/>
              nature has enough. With so much she has enough, as we <lb/>
              before mentioned. If thou givest her more, either it hurts <lb/>
              thee, or it at least is unpleasant to thee, or inconvenient, or <lb/>
              dangerous,—all that thou dost beyond measure. If thou <lb/>
              beyond measure eatest, or drinkest, or hast more clothes on <lb/>
              thee, than thou needest, the superfluity becomes to thee <lb/>
              either pain, or loathing, or inconvenience, or danger. If <lb/>
              thou thinkest that wonderful apparel is any honour, then <lb/>
              ascribe I the honour to the artificer who made it, not to thee. <lb/>
              The artificer is God, whose skill I therein praise. Thinkest <lb/>
              thou that the multitude of thy men can make thee happy? <lb/>
              No, no. But if they are wicked and deceitful, then are they <lb/>
              more dangerous, and more troublesome to thee, had, than <lb/>
              not had: for wicked thanes are always their lord's enemies. <lb/>
              But if they are good and faithful to their lord, and sincere, <lb/>
              is not that, then, their good, not thine ? How canst thou, <lb/>

              of it dost thou not boast of their good, not of thine ?</p>

            those goods is thine which we have already spoken about, and <lb/>
            thou didst think should be thine. If, then, the beauty and <lb/>
            wealth of this world is not to be desired, why dost thou re­ <lb/>
            pine on account of what thou bast lost? or wherefore dost <lb/>
            thou long for what thou formerly hadst? If it is fair, that <lb/>
            is of their own nature, not of thine: it is their fairness, not <lb/>
            thine. Why then dost thou delight in their fairness ? what <lb/>
            of it belongs to thee P Thou didst not make it, nor are they <lb/>
            thine own. If they are good and fair, then were they so <lb/>
            made; and such they would be, though thou never hadst <pb n="44"/>

              them. Thinkest thou that they are ever the more precious, <lb/>
              because they were lent for thy use ? But, because foolish <lb/>
              men admire them,and they to them seem precious, therefore <lb/>
              thou gatherest and keepest them in thy hoard. How then <lb/>
              dost thou hope to have happiness from anything of this sort ? <lb/>
              Believe me now, I say it unto thee, thou hast nought there­ <lb/>
              from, except that thou toilest to avoid poverty, and therefore <lb/>
              gatherest more than thou needest. But nevertheless I very <lb/>
              well know, that all which I here speak, is contrary to thy <lb/>
              will. But your goods are not what ye think they are: for <lb/>
              he who desires to have much and various provision, needs <lb/>
              also much help. The old saying is very true, which men for­ <lb/>
              merly said; that those need much, who desire to possess <lb/>
              much, and those need very little, who do not desire more <lb/>
              than enough. But they hope by means of superfluity to <lb/>
              satisfy their greediness; which they never do. I wot that <lb/>
              ye think ye have no natural good or happiness within your­ <lb/>
              selves, because ye seek them without you, from external <lb/>
              creatures. So is it perverted, that man, though he is divinely <lb/>
              rational, thinks that he has not happiness enough in himself, <lb/>
              unless he collects more of irrational creatures than he has <lb/>
              need of, or than is suitable for him: whilst the irrational <lb/>
              cattle are desirous of no other wealth, but think that sum­ <lb/>
              cient for them, which they have within their own skin, in <lb/>
              addition to the fodder which is natural to them. Whatsoever, <lb/>
              then, though little, ye have of divine in your soul, is the un­ <lb/>
              derstanding, and memory, and the rational will which delights <lb/>
              in them both. He therefore who has these three, has his <lb/>
              maker's likeness, as much as any creature can at all have its <lb/>
              maker's likeness. But ye seek the happiuess of the exalted <lb/>
              nature, and its dignity, from low and perishable things. But <lb/>
              ye understand not how great injury ye do to God your creator. <lb/>
              For he would that all men should be governors of all other <lb/>
              creatures. But ye degrade your highest dignity below the <lb/>
              meanest creatures of all: and thereby ye have shown that, <lb/>
              according to your own judgment, ye make yourselves worse <lb/>
              than your own possessions, now ye think that your false <lb/>
              riches are your happiness, and are persuaded that all your <pb n="46"/>

              worldly goods are superior to yourselves. So indeed it is, <lb/>
              when ye so will!</p>
          <p>§ III. It is the condition of the life of men, that they then <lb/>
            only are before all other creatures, when they themselves know <lb/>
            what they are, and whence they are: and they are worse than <lb/>
            cattle, when they will not know what they are, or whence they <lb/>
            are. It is the nature of cattle that they know not what they <lb/>
            are; but it is a fault in meo, that they know not what they <lb/>
            arc. It is therefore very plain to thee, that ye are in error, <lb/>
            when ye think that any one can be made honourable by ex­ <lb/>
            ternal riches. If any one is made honourable with any riches, <lb/>
            and endowed with any valuable possessions, does not the <lb/>
            honour then belong to that which makes him honourable ? <lb/>
            That is to be praised somewhat more rightly. That which is <lb/>
            adorned with anything else, is not therefore fairer, though <lb/>
            the ornaments be fair, with which it is adorned. If it before <lb/>
            was vile, it is not on that account fairer. Know thou, as­ <lb/>
            suredly, that no good hurts him who possesses it. Thou <lb/>
            knowest that I lie not to thee, and also knowest that riches <lb/>
            often hurt those who possess them, in many things : and in <lb/>
            this chiefly, that men become so lifted-up on account of riches, <lb/>
            that frequently the worst man of all, and the most unworthy <lb/>
            of all, thinks that he is deserving of all the wealth which-is <lb/>
            in this world, if he knew how he might arrive at it. He who <lb/>
            has great riches, dreads many an enemy. If he had no pos­ <lb/>
            sessions, he would not need to dread any. If thou wert <lb/>
            travelling, and hadst much gold about thee, and thou then <lb/>
            shouldest meet with a gang of thieves, then wouldest not <lb/>
            thou be anxious for thy life ? If thou hadst nothing of this <lb/>
            kind, then thou wonldest not need to dread anything, but <lb/>
            mightest go singing the old adage which men formerly sung, <lb/>
            that the naked traveller fears nothing. When thou then wert <lb/>
            safe, and the thieves were departed from thee, then mightest <lb/>
            thou scoff at these present riches, and mightest say, 0, how <lb/>
            good and pleasant it is, that any one should possess great <lb/>
            wealth, since he who obtains it is never secure!</p><pb n="48"/>

          <p>WHEN Reason had made this speech, she began to sing, <lb/>
            and thus said: 0, how happy was the first age of this middle- <lb/>
            earth, when to every man there seemed enough in the fruits <lb/>
            of the earth! There were not then splendid houses, nor <lb/>
            various sweetmeats nor drinks; nor were they desirous of <lb/>
            costly apparel, for they as yet were not, nor did they see or <lb/>
            hear anything of them. They cared not for any luxury, but <lb/>
            very temperately followed nature. They always ate once in <lb/>
            the day, and that was in the evening. They ate the fruits of <lb/>
            trees, and herbs. They drank no pure wine, nor knew they <lb/>
            how to mix any liquor with honey, nor cared they for silken <lb/>
            garments of various colours. They always slept out in the <lb/>
            shade of trees. They drank the water of the clear springs. <lb/>
            No merchant visited island or coast, nor did any man as yet <lb/>
            hear of any ship-army, nor even the mention of any war. The <lb/>
            earth was not yet polluted with the blood of slain men, nor <lb/>
            was any one even wounded. They did not as yet look upon <lb/>
            evil-minded men. Such had no honour; nor did any man <lb/>
            love them. Alas, that our times cannot now become such ! <lb/>
            But now the covetousness of men is as burning as the fire in <lb/>
            the hell, which is in the mountain that is called Ætna, in the <lb/>
            island that is called Sicily. The mountain is always burning <lb/>
            with brimstone, and burns up all the near places thereabout. <lb/>
            Alas, what was the first avaricious man, who first began to <lb/>
            dig the earth after gold, and after gems, and found the dan­ <lb/>
            gerous treasure, which before was hid and covered with the <lb/>
            earth!</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he <lb/>
            again to speak, and thus said: What more can I say to thee, <lb/>
            concerning the dignity and concerning the power of this <lb/>
            world ? For power ye would raise yourselves up to heaven, <lb/>
            if ye were able. This is, because ye do not remember, nor <lb/>
            understand, the heavenly power and the dignity which is your <lb/>
            own, and whence ye came. What, then, with regard to your <lb/>
            wealth, and your power, which ye now call dignity, if it <lb/>
            should come to the worst men of all, and to him that of all <lb/>
            is unworthiest of it, as it lately did to this same Theodoric, <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>

              and also formerly to Nero the Cæsar, and moreover fre­ <lb/>
              quently to many like them ? Will he not then do as they <lb/>
              did, and still do ? slay and destroy all the rich who are under, <lb/>
              or anywhere near him, as the flame of fire does the dry heath <lb/>
              field, or as the burning brimstone burneth the mountain <lb/>
              which we call Ætna, which is in the island of Sicily ? very <lb/>
              like to the great flood which was formerly in Noab's days. <lb/>
              I think that thou mayest remember that your ancient Roman <lb/>
              senators formerly, in the days of Tarquin the proud king, on <lb/>
              account of his arrogance first banished the kingly name from <lb/>
              the city of Rome. And again, in like manner, the consuls <lb/>
              who had driven them out, these they were afterwards desirous <lb/>
              to expel on account of their arrogance (but they could not) ; <lb/>
              because the latter government of the consuls still less pleased <lb/>
              the Roman senators, than the former one of the kings. If, <lb/>
              however, it at any time happens, as it very seldom does, <lb/>
              happen, that power and dignity come to good men and to <lb/>
              wise; what is there then worthy of esteem, except the good <lb/>
              and the dignity of him, the good king, not of the power? <lb/>
              For power never is good unless he is good who possesses it. <lb/>
              Therefore if power be good, it is the good of the man, not of <lb/>
              the power. Hence it is, that no man by his authority comes <lb/>
              to virtues and to merit: but by his virtues, and by his merit, <lb/>
              he comes to authority and to power. Therefore is no man for <lb/>
              his power the better; but for his virtues he is good, if he be <lb/>
              good: and for his virtues he is deserving of power, if he be <lb/>
              deserving of it. Learn, therefore, wisdom; and when ye <lb/>
              have learned it, do not then despise it. Then I say to you, <lb/>
              without all doubt, that ye may through it arrive at power, <lb/>
              though ye be not desirous of power. Ye need not be anxious <lb/>
              for power, nor press after it. If ye are wise and good, it will <lb/>
              follow you, though.ye are not desirous of it. But tell me now, <lb/>
              what is your most valuable wealth and power, which ye most <lb/>
              desire ? I know, however, that it is this present life, and this <lb/>
              perishing wealth, which we before spoke about.</p>
          <p>§ II. 0, ye beastlike men, do ye know what wealth is, and <lb/>
            power, and worldly goods ? They are your lords and your <note type="footnote"> E2 </note> <pb n="52"/>

              rulers, not ye theirs! If ye now saw some mouse that was <lb/>
              lord over other mice, and set them judgments, and subjected <lb/>
              them to tribute, how wonderful would ye think it! What <lb/>
              scorn would ye have, and with what laughter would ye be <lb/>
              moved! How much greater, then, is man's body, compared <lb/>
              with the mind, than the mouse compared with the man ? <lb/>
              Indeed, ye may easily conceive, if ye will carefully consider <lb/>
              and examine it, that no creature's body is more tender than <lb/>
              man's. The least flies can injure it: and the gnats with very <lb/>
              little stings hurt it: and also the small worms which corrupt <lb/>
              the man both inwardly and outwardly, and sometimes make <lb/>
              him almost dead. Moreover the little flea sometimes kills <lb/>
              him. Such things injure him both inwardly and outwardly. <lb/>
              Wherein can any man injure another, except in his body? <lb/>
              or again in their riches, which ye call goods? No man can <lb/>
              injure the rational mind, or cause it that it should not be <lb/>
              what it is. This is very evidently to be known by a certain <lb/>
              Roman nobleman, who was called Liherius. He was put to <lb/>
              many torments because he would not inform against his as­ <lb/>
              sociates, who conspired with him against the king who had <lb/>
              with injustice conquered them. When he was led before the <lb/>
              enraged king, and he commanded him to say who were his <lb/>
              associates who had conspired with him, then bit he off his <lb/>
              own tongue, and immediately cast it before the face of the <lb/>
              tyrant. Hence it happened that, to the wise man, that was <lb/>
              the cause of praise and honour, which the unjust king ap­ <lb/>
              pointed to him for punishment. What is it, moreover, that <lb/>
              any man can do to another, which he may not do to him in <lb/>
              like manner ? and if he may not, another man may. We <lb/>
              have learned also concerning the cruel Busiris, who was in <lb/>
              Egypt. This tyrant's custom was, that he would very honour­ <lb/>
              ably receive every stranger, and behave very courteously to <lb/>
              him when first he came. But afterwards, before he departed <lb/>
              from him, he would be slain. And then it happened that <lb/>
              Hercules, the son of Jove, came to him. Then would he do <lb/>
              to him, as he had done to many a stranger before: he would <lb/>
              drown him in the river which is called Nile. Then was he <lb/>
              stronger, and drowned him, very justly by God's judgment, <lb/>
              as he many another before bad done! So also, Regulus, the <lb/>
              illustrious consul! When he fought against the Africans, he <pb n="54"/>
              <note type="margin"> CHAP XVI. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              obtained an almost indescribable victory over the Africans. <lb/>
              When he had grievously slain them, lie gave order to bind <lb/>
              them, and lay them in heaps. Then happened it very soon, <lb/>
              that he was bound with their fetters. What thinkest thou, <lb/>
              then ? What good is power, when he who possesses it, can <lb/>
              in no wise, by his own strength, avoid suffering from other <lb/>
              men the same evil which he before did to others ? Is not, <lb/>
              then, power in that case naught ?</p>
          <p>§ III. What thinkest thou? If dignity and power were <lb/>
            good of its own nature, and had power of itself, would it <lb/>
            follow the most wicked men, as it now sometimes doth ? <lb/>
            Dost thou not know, that it is neither natural nor usual, that <lb/>
            any contrary thing should be mixed with other contrary, or <lb/>
            have any fellowship therewith P But nature refuses it that <lb/>
            they should be mixed together; still more that good and evil <lb/>
            should be together. Hence it is very manifestly shown to <lb/>
            thee, that this present authority, and these worldly goods, <lb/>
            and this power, are not good of their own nature, and of their <lb/>
            own efficacy, nor have any power of themselves: since they <lb/>
            are willing to cleave to the worst men, and permit them to be <lb/>
            their lords. There is not indeed any doubt of this, that often <lb/>
            the most wicked men of all come to power and to dignity. <lb/>
            If power, then, were good of its own nature, and of its own <lb/>
            efficacy, it never would be subservient to the evil, but to the <lb/>
            good: The same is to be thought with regard to all the goods <lb/>
            which fortune brings in this present life, both of talents and <lb/>
            possessions: for they sometimes come to the most wicked. <lb/>
            We very well know that no man doubts of this, that he is <lb/>
            powerful iu his strength, who is seen to perform laborious <lb/>
            work: any more than if he be anything, any one doubts that <lb/>
            he is so. Thus the art of music causes the man to be a <lb/>
            musician, and medical knowledge to be a physician, and <lb/>
            rhetoric causes him to be a rhetorician. In like manner <lb/>
            also the nature of things causes to every man that good <lb/>
            cannot be mixed with evil, nor evil with good. Though they <lb/>
            are both in one man, yet is each in him separately. Nature <lb/>
            will never suffer anything contrary to mix, for each of them <lb/>
            rejects the other, and each will be what it is. Riches cannot <pb n="56"/>

              cause the miser not to be a miser, or satisfy his boundless <lb/>
              desires, nor can authority make its possessor powerful. Since, <lb/>
              then, every creature avoids that which is contrary to it, and <lb/>
              very earnestly endeavours to repel it, what two things are. <lb/>
              more contrary to each other than good and evil ? They are <lb/>
              never united together. Hence thou mayest understand, that <lb/>
              if the goods of this present life through themselves, had power <lb/>
              of themselves, and were in their own nature good, then would <lb/>
              they always cleave to him who did good with them, not evil. <lb/>
              But wheresoever they are good, they are good through the <lb/>
              good of the good man, who works good with them, and he is <lb/>
              good through God. If, then, an evil man has it, it is evil <lb/>
              through the man's evil, who doth evil with it, and through <lb/>
              the devil. What good is wealth, then, when it cannot satisfy <lb/>
              the boundless desires of the miser ? or power, when it cannot <lb/>
              make its possessor powerful, but the wicked passions bind <lb/>
              him, with their indissoluble chaius! Though any one give <lb/>
              to any evil man power, the power does not make him good <lb/>
              nor meritorious, if he before were not: but exposes his evil, <lb/>
              if he before were evil, and makes it then manifest, if it before <lb/>
              were not. For though he formerly desired evil, he then knew <lb/>
              not how he might so fully show it, before lie had full power. <lb/>
              It is through folly that ye are pleased, because ye can make <lb/>
              a name, aDd call that happiness which is none, and that merit <lb/>
              which is none: for they show by their ending, when they <lb/>
              come to an end, that neither wealth, nor power, nor dignity, <lb/>
              is to be considered as the true happiness. So is it most as­ <lb/>
              suredly to be said concerning all the worldly goods that <lb/>
              fortune brings; that there is nothing therein which is to be <lb/>
              desired, because there is nothing therein of natural good <lb/>
              which comes from themselves. This is evident from hence, <lb/>
              that they do not always join themselves to the good, nor <lb/>
              make the evil good, to whom they moat frequently join them­ <lb/>
              selves.</p>

              ties, and what ruins, what adulteries, and what wickedness, <lb/>
              and what impiety, the unrighteous Cæsar, Nero, wrought. <lb/>
              He at one time gave order to burn all the city of Rome at <lb/>
              once, after the example that formerly the city of Troy was <lb/>
              burned! He was desirous also to see how it would burn, <lb/>
              and how long, and how light, in comparison of the other: and <lb/>
              besides gave order to slay all the wisest senators of the Ro­ <lb/>
              mans, and also his own mother, and his own brother! He <lb/>
              moreover slew his own wife with a sword. And for such <lb/>
              things he was in.no wise grieved, but was the blither, and re­ <lb/>
              joiced at it! And yet amid such crimes all this middle-earth <lb/>
              was nevertheless subject to him, from eastward to westward, <lb/>
              and again from southward to northward: it was all in his <lb/>
              power. Thinkest thou that the heavenly Power could not <lb/>
              take away the empire from this unrighteous Cæsar, and cor­ <lb/>
              rect this madness in him, if be would? Yes, 0 yes, I know <lb/>
              that be could, if he would! Alas! how heavy a yoke did he <lb/>
              lay on all those who in his times were living on the earth! <lb/>
              and how oft his sword was stained with innocent blood! <lb/>
              Was it not then sufficiently evident, that power of its own. <lb/>
              nature was not good, when he was not good to whom it <lb/>
              came?</p>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay he was silent, and the <lb/>
            Mind then answered, and thus said: 0 Reason, indeed thou <lb/>
            knowest that covetousness and the greatness of this earthly <lb/>
            power never well pleased me, nor did I altogether very much <lb/>
            yearn after this earthly authority. But nevertheless I was <lb/>
            desirous of materials for the work which I was commanded <lb/>
            to perform; that was, that I might honourably and fitly guide <lb/>
            and exercise the power which was committed to me. More­ <lb/>
            over, thou knowest that no man can show any skill, nor ex­ <lb/>
            ercise or control any power, without tools and materials. <lb/>
            That is, of every craft the materials, without which man <lb/>
            cannot exercise the craft. This, then, is a king's materials <lb/>
            and his tools to reign with: that he have his land well <lb/>
            peopled; he must have prayer-men, and soldiers, and work­ <pb n="60"/>

              men. Thou knowest that without these tools no king can <lb/>
              show his craft. This is also his materials which he must <lb/>
              have besides the tools; provisions for the three classes. This <lb/>
              is, then, their provision; land to inhabit, and gifts and <lb/>
              weapons, and meat, and ale, and clothes, and whatsoever is <lb/>
              necessary for the three classes. He cannot without these <lb/>
              preserve the tools, nor without the tools accomplish any of <lb/>
              those things which he is commanded to perform. Therefore <lb/>
              I was desirous of materials wherewith to exercise the power, <lb/>
              that my talents and power should not be forgotten and con­ <lb/>
              cealed. For every craft and every power soon becomes old, <lb/>
              and is passed over in silence, if it be without wisdom : for no <lb/>
              man can accomplish any craft without wisdom. Because <lb/>
              whatsoever is done through folly, no one can ever reckon for <lb/>
              craft. This is now especially to be said; that I wished to <lb/>
              live honourably whilst I lived, and after my life, to leave to <lb/>
              the men who were after me, my. memory in good works.</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN this was spoken, the Mind remained silent, and <lb/>
            Reason began to speak, and thus said: 0, Mind, one evil is <lb/>
            very greatly to be shunned; that is, that which very con­ <lb/>
            tinually and very grievously deceives the minds of all those <lb/>
            men, who are in their nature excellent, and nevertheless are <lb/>
            not yet arrived at the roof of perfect virtues. This, then, is <lb/>
            the desire of false glory, and of unrighteous power, and of <lb/>
            unbounded fame of good works among all people. Many <lb/>
            men are desirous of power, because they would have good <lb/>
            fame, though they be unworthy of it: and even the most <lb/>
            wicked of all are desirous of the same. But he who will <lb/>
            wisely and diligently inquire concerning fame, will very soon <lb/>
            perceive how little it is, and how slender and how frail, and <lb/>
            how destitute of all good. If thou wilt now studiously in­ <lb/>
            quire, and wilt understand concerning the circumference of <lb/>
            all this earth, from the eastward of this middle-earth to the <pb n="62"/>

              westward, and from the southward to the northward, as thou <lb/>
              hast learned in the book which is called Astrologium ; then <lb/>
              mayest thou perceive that it is all, compared with the heaven, <lb/>
              like a little point on a broad board, or the boss on. a shield, <lb/>
              according to the opinion of wise men. Dost thou not know <lb/>
              what thou hast learned in the books of Ptolemy, who wrote <lb/>
              of the measure of all this middle-earth in one book ? Therein <lb/>
              thou migbtest see that all mankind, and all cattle, do not <lb/>
              occupy anywhere nigh the fourth part of this earth, which <lb/>
              meu are able to go over. For they cannot inhabit it all; <lb/>
              some part for heat, some for cold; and the greatest part of <lb/>
              it the sea has covered. Take, then, from this fourth part, in <lb/>
              thy mind, all that the sea has covered of it, and all the shards <lb/>
              which it has taken from it; and all that fens and moors have <lb/>
              taken of it, and all that in all countries lies waste,, then <lb/>
              mayest thou understand, that, of the whole, there is not more <lb/>
              left for men to inhabit, than as it were a small enclosure. It <lb/>
              is, then, in foolish labour that ye toil all your life, because ye <lb/>
              wish beyond measure to spread your fame over such an en­ <lb/>
              closure as that is which men inhabit in this world; almost <lb/>
              like a point compared with the other! But what of spacious, <lb/>
              or of great, or of honourable, has this your glory, when ye <lb/>
              therein inhabit the fifth part halved of land and desert ? so <lb/>
              is it narrowed with sea, with fen, and with all! Wherefore <lb/>
              desire ye, then, too immoderately, that ye should spread your <lb/>
              name over the tenth part, since there is not more of it, with <lb/>
              sea, with fen, and with all!</p>
          <p>§ II. Consider also that in this little park which we before <lb/>
            have spoken about, dwell very many nations, and various, and <lb/>
            very unlike both in speech, and in mauners, and in all the <lb/>
            customs of all the nations, which ye now very immoderately <lb/>
            desire that ye should spread your name over. This ye never <lb/>
            can do, because their language is divided into seventy-two; <lb/>
            and every one of these languages is divided among many <lb/>
            nations, and they are separated and divided by sea, and by <lb/>
            woods, aud by mountains, and by fells, and by many and <lb/>
            various wastes, and impassable lands, so that even merchants <pb n="64"/>

              do not visit it. But how, then, can any great man's name <lb/>
              singly come there, when no man there hears even the name <lb/>
              of the city, or of the country, of which he is an inhabitant? <lb/>
              Therefore I know not through what folly ye desire that ye <lb/>
              should spread your name over all the earth ! That ye cannot <lb/>
              do, nor even anywhere nigh. Moreover, thou knowest how <lb/>
              great the power of the Romans was in the days of Marcus, <lb/>
              the consul, who was by another name called Tullius, and by <lb/>
              a third Cicero. But he has shown in one of his books, that, <lb/>
              as then, the Roman name had not passed beyond the moun­ <lb/>
              tains that we call Caucasus, nor had the Scythians who dwell <lb/>
              on the other side of those mountains even heard the name of <lb/>
              the city or of the people: but at that time it had first come <lb/>
              to the Parthians, and was then very new. But nevertheless <lb/>
              it was very terrible thereabout to many a people. Dosye not <lb/>
              then perceive how narrow this your fame will be, which ye <lb/>
              labour about, and unrighteously toil to spread ? How great <lb/>
              fame, and how great honour, dost thou think one Roman could <lb/>
              have in that land, where even the name of the city was never <lb/>
              heard, nor did the fame of the whole people ever come ? <lb/>
              Though any man immoderately and unreasonably desire that <lb/>
              he may spread his fame over all the earth, he cannot bring it <lb/>
              to pass, because the manners of the nations are very unlike, <lb/>
              and their institutions very various; so that in one country <lb/>
              that pleases best which is at the same time in another deemed <lb/>
              most reprehensible, and moreover deserving of great punish­ <lb/>
              ment. Therefore no man can have the same praise in every <lb/>
              land, because in every land that pleases not, which in another <lb/>
              pleases.</p>
          <p>§ III. Therefore every man should be well contented with <lb/>
            this, that he be approved in his own country. Though he be <lb/>
            desirous of more, he cannot, indeed, bring it to pass: because <lb/>
            it is seldom that aught in any degree pleases many men; on <lb/>
            which account the praise of a good man is frequently con­ <lb/>
            fined within the same country where he is an inhabitant; <lb/>
            and also because it has often very unfortunately happened, <lb/>
            through the misconduct of writers, that they from their sloth, <lb/>
            and from negligence, and from carelessness, have left un­ <lb/>
            written the manners of the men, and their deeds, who in <lb/>
            their days were most famous, and most desirous of honour. <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>

              And even if they had written the whole of their lives and of <lb/>
              their actions, as they ought if they were honest, would not <lb/>
              the writings nevertheless wax old and perish, as often as it <lb/>
              was done, even as the writers did, and those about whom <lb/>
              they wrote ? And yet it seems to you that ye have eternal <lb/>
              honour, if ye can, in all your life, earn that ye may have good <lb/>
              fame, after your days! If thou now comparest the duration <lb/>
              of this present life, and this temporal, with the duration of <lb/>
              the never-ending life, what is it then ? Compare now the <lb/>
              length of the time wherein thou mayest wink thine eye, with <lb/>
              ten thousand winters; then have the times somewhat of like, <lb/>
              though it be little; that is, that each of them has an end. <lb/>
              But compare these ten thousand years, and even more if thou <lb/>
              wilt, with the eternal and the never-euding life; then wilt <lb/>
              thou not find there anything of like, because the ten thousand <lb/>
              years, though it seem long, will shorten: but of the other <lb/>
              there never will come an end. Therefore it is not to be com­ <lb/>
              pared, the ending with the never ending! If thou even reckon <lb/>
              from the beginning of this middle-earth to the end, and then <lb/>
              compare the years with that which has no end, there will be <lb/>
              nothing of like. So is also the fame of celebrated men. <lb/>
              Though it sometimes may be long and endure many years, <lb/>
              it is nevertheless very short compared with that which never <lb/>
              ends!</p>
          <p>§ IV. And ye nevertheless care not whether ye do any <lb/>
            good, on any other account, than for the little praise of the <lb/>
            people, and for the short fame which we have before spoken <lb/>
            about. Ye labour for this, and overlook the excellences of <lb/>
            your mind, and of your understanding, and of your reason, <lb/>
            and would have the reward of your good works from the re­ <lb/>
            port of strangers! Ye desire to obtain then the reward which <lb/>
            ye should seek from God! But thou hast heard that it long <lb/>
            ago happened, that a very wise man, and very noble, began to <lb/>
            try a philosopher, and scoffed at him, because he so arrogantly <lb/>
            lifted himself up, and proclaimed this, that he was a philoso­ <lb/>
            pher. He did not make it known by any talents, but by false <lb/>
            and proud boasting. Then the wise man would prove him, <lb/>
            whether he were as wise as he himself thought that he was. <lb/>
            He therefore began to revile, and speak ill of him. Then the <lb/>
            philosopher heard very patiently the wise man's words for <lb/>

              fended himself against him very impatiently, though he before <lb/>
              pretended that he was a philosopher, and asked him again, <lb/>
              whether he thought him to be a philosopher or not. Then <lb/>
              answered the wise man to him, and said: I would say that <lb/>
              thou wert a philosopher, if thou wert patient, and able to be <lb/>
              silent. How lasting was to him the fame which he before <lb/>
              falsely sought! How did be not immediately burst because <lb/>
              of one answer! What has it then availed the best men who <lb/>
              were before us, that they so greatly desired vain glory and <lb/>
              fame after their death ? Or what does it profit those who <lb/>
              now are ? Therefore it were to every man more needful that <lb/>
              he were desirous of good actions thau of deceitful fame. <lb/>
              What has he from this fame, after the separation of the body <lb/>
              and the soul ? Do we not know that all men bodily die, and <lb/>
              yet the soul is living ? But the soul goes very freely to the <lb/>
              heavens, after it is set loose and liberated from the prison of <lb/>
              the body. It then despises all these earthly things, and re­ <lb/>
              joices in this, that it may enjoy the heavenly, after it is taken <lb/>
              away from the earthly. Then the mind will itself be a witness <lb/>
              of God's will.</p>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom had made this speech, then began he again <lb/>
            to sing, and thus singing, said: Whosoever desires to have <lb/>
            vain fame and unprofitable glory, let him behold on the four <lb/>
            sides of him, how spacious the expanse of the heaven is, and <lb/>
            how narrow the space of the earth is, though it seem large to <lb/>
            us! Then may it shame him of the spreading of his fame, <lb/>
            because he cannot even spread it over the narrow earth alone! <lb/>
            0, ye proud, why are ye desirous to sustain with your necks <lb/>
            this deadly yoke ? or why are ye in such vain labour, because <lb/>
            ye would spread your fame over so many nations ? Though <lb/>
            it even happen that the farthest nations exalt your name, and <lb/>
            praise you in many a language; and though any one with <lb/>
            great nobleness add to his birth, and prosper in all riches, <lb/>
            and in all splendour, death nevertheless cares not for things <lb/>
            of this sort, but he despises nobility, and devours the rich and <lb/>
            the poor alike, and thus levels the rich and the poor! What <lb/>
            are now the bones of the celebrated and the wise goldsmith, <lb/>
            Weland? I have therefore said the wise, because to the <pb n="70"/>

              easily take it from him than he can turn aside the sun from <lb/>
              her place. Where are now the bones of Weland ? or who <lb/>
              knows now where they were ? Or where is now the illus­ <lb/>
              trious and the patriotic consul of the Romans, who was called <lb/>
              Brutus, by another name Cassius ? or the wise and inflexible <lb/>
              Cato, who was also a Roman consul ? He was evidently a <lb/>
              philosopher. Were not these long ago departed ? and no one <lb/>
              knows where they are now. What of them is now remaining, <lb/>
              except the small fame and the name written with a few <lb/>
              letters ? And it is yet worse that we know of many mUll <lb/>
              trious and memorable men departed, of whom very few per­ <lb/>
              sons have ever heard. But many lie dead, entirely forgotten, <lb/>
              so that fame does not even make them known! Though ye <lb/>

              what is it to you then the better ? Does not death come, <lb/>
              though he come late, and take you away from this world ? <lb/>
              And what then does glory profit you ? at least those whom <lb/>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he to speak, <lb/>
            and thus said : Do not suppose that I too obstinately attack <lb/>
            fortune. I myself have no dread of it, because it frequently <lb/>
            happens that deceitful fortune can neither render aid to a <lb/>
            man, nor cause any injury. Therefore she is deserving of no <lb/>
            praise, because she herself shows that she' is nothing. But <lb/>
            she reveals her fountain when she discloses her manners. I <lb/>
            think, nevertheless, that thou dost not yet understand what <lb/>
            I say to thee: for what I wish to say is wonderful, and I <lb/>
            can hardly explain it with words as I would. It is, that I <lb/>
            know that adverse fortune is more useful to every man than <lb/>
            prosperous. For the prosperous always lies and dissembles, <lb/>
            that men may think that she is the true happiness. But the <lb/>
            adverse is the true happiness, though to any one it may not <lb/>
            seem so, for she is constant and always promises what is true. <lb/>
            The other is false, and deceives all her followers; for she <lb/>
            herself shows it by her changeableness, that she is very un­ <lb/>
            stable : but the adverse improves and instructs every one to <lb/>
            whom she joins herself. The other binds every one of the <lb/>
            minds which enjoy her, through the appearance which she <pb n="72"/>

              feigns of being good: but the adverse unbinds, and frees <lb/>
              every one of those whom she adheres to, in that she discloses <lb/>
              to them how frail these present goods are. But prosperity <lb/>
              goes confusedly as the wind's storm; while adversity is always <lb/>
              faultless, and is saved from injury by the experience of her <lb/>
              own danger. In fine, the false happiness necessarily draws <lb/>
              those who are associated with her, from the true felicities, by <lb/>
              her flattery: but adversity often necessarily draws all those <lb/>
              who are subjected to her, to the true goods, as a fish is <lb/>
              caught by a hook. Does it then seem to thee little gain, <lb/>
              and little addition to thy felicities, which this severe and this <lb/>
              horrible adversity brings to thee: that is, that she very <lb/>
              quickly lays open to thee the minds of thy true friends, and. <lb/>
              also of thine enemies, that thou'mayest very plainly dis­ <lb/>
              tinguish them? But these false goods, when they depart <lb/>
              from thee, then take they their men with them, and leave <lb/>
              thy few faithful cues with thee. How wouldest thou now <lb/>
              buy, or when thou wert happiest, and it seemed to thee that <lb/>
              fortune proceeded most according to thy will, with how much <lb/>
              money wouldest thou then have bought, that thou mightest <lb/>
              clearly distinguish thy friend and thy foe ? I know, how­ <lb/>
              ever, that thou wouldest have bought it with much money <lb/>
              that thou mightest well know how to distinguish them. <lb/>
              Though it now seem to thee that thou hast lost precious <lb/>
              wealth, thou hast nevertheless therewith bought much more <lb/>
              precious, that is, true friends, whom thou art now able to <lb/>
              distinguish, and knowest what of them thou hast. But this <lb/>
              is the most valuable wealth of all.</p>

            all doubt, and he is also governor of heaven and earth, and <lb/>
            of all creatures, visible and invisible. He is God Almighty. <lb/>
            Him serve all those creatures which serve, both those which <lb/>
            have understanding, and those which have not understand­ <lb/>
            ing: both those which know it that they serve him, and <lb/>
            those which know it not. The same has appointed un- <pb n="74"/>

              <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXI. </note> <lb/>
              changeable customs and habits, and also natural agreement, <lb/>
              to all his creatures, when be would, and so long as he would, <lb/>
              which now shall stand for ever. The motion of the moving <lb/>
              creatures cannot be stayed, nor yet turned from the course <lb/>
              aud from the order that is set to them. But the governor <lb/>
              has so with his bridle caught hold of, and restrained, and ad­ <lb/>
              monished, all his creatures, that they neither can be still, nor <lb/>
              yet move farther than he the space of his rein allows to them. <lb/>
              So has the Almighty God controlled all his creatures by his <lb/>
              power, that each of them strives with another, and yet sup­ <lb/>
              ports another, so that they cannot slip asunder, but are <lb/>
              turned again to the same course which they before ran, and <lb/>
              thus become again renewed. So are they vane, that con­ <lb/>
              trary creatures both strive with each other, and also hold <lb/>
              firm agreement with each other. Thus fire doth, and water; <lb/>
              and sea and earth; and many other creatures, which will <lb/>
              ever be as discordant between themselves, as they are; and <lb/>
              yet they are so accordant that not only they may be com­ <lb/>
              panions, but moreover, that even no one of them without <lb/>
              another can exist. But ever must the contrary the other <lb/>
              contrary moderate. So has now the Almighty God very <lb/>
              wisely and very fitly appointed change to all his creatures. <lb/>
              Thus spring and harvest. In spring it groweth, and in <lb/>
              harvest it ripens. And again summer and winter. In <lb/>
              summer it is warm, and in winter cold. So also the sun <lb/>
              bringeth light days, and the moon gives light in the night, <lb/>
              through the power of the same God. The same warns the <lb/>
              sea that it may not overstep the threshold of the earth: <lb/>
              but he has so fixed their limits, that it may not extend its <lb/>
              boundary over the still earth. By the same government is <lb/>
              ordered a very like change of the flood and the ebb. This <lb/>
              appointment, then, he allows to. stand as long as he wills. <lb/>
              But whenever he shall let go the rein of the bridles with <lb/>
              which he has now bridled the creatures, that contrariety <lb/>
              which we before mentioned, if be shall allow these to be re­ <lb/>
              laxed, then will they forsake the agreement which they now <lb/>
              keep, arid strive, each of them with other, after its own will, <lb/>
              and forsake their companionship, and destroy all this middle- <lb/>
              earth, and bring themselves to naught. The same God joins <lb/>
              people together with friendship, and uuites families with <lb/>
              virtuous love. He brings together friends and companions, <lb/>
              that they faithfully hold their agreement and their friendship. <pb n="76"/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then had he bound <lb/>
            me with the sweetness of his song, so that I was greatly ad­ <lb/>
            miring it, and very desirous to hear him with inward mind: <lb/>
            and immediately thereupon I spoke to him, and thus said: <lb/>
            0, Wisdom, thou who art the highest comfort of all weary <lb/>
            minds! how hast thou comforted me, both with thy profound <lb/>
            discourse and with the sweetness of thy song! So much <lb/>
            hast thou now corrected and overcome me with thy reason­ <lb/>
            ing, that it now seems to me that not only am I able to bear <lb/>
            this misfortune which has befallen me, but even if still <lb/>
            greater peril should come upon me, I will never more say <lb/>
            that it is without deserving: for I know that I were deserving <lb/>
            of more, and heavier. But I am desirous to hear something <lb/>
            more of the medicine of these thine instructions. Though <lb/>
            thou just now saidst that thou thoughtest that they would <lb/>
            seem very bitter to me, I am not now afraid of them, but I <lb/>
            am very anxious after them, both to hear, and also to observe: <lb/>
            and very earnestly entreat thee that thou wouldest perform <lb/>
            to me, as thou a little while ago promisedst me. Then said <lb/>
            Wisdom: I knew immediately when thou didst so well keep <lb/>
            silence, and so willingly heardest my doctrine, that thou <lb/>
            wouldest with inward mind receive and consider it. There­ <lb/>
            fore I waited very well till I knew what. thou wouldest, and <lb/>
            how thou wouldest understand it; and, moreover, I very <lb/>
            earnestly endeavoured that thou mightest understand it. <lb/>
            But I will now tell thee what the medicine of my doctrine <lb/>
            is, which thou askest of me. It is very bitter in the mouth, <lb/>
            and it irritates thee in the throat, when thou first triest it: <lb/>
            but it grows sweet after it enters in, and is very mild in the <lb/>
            stomach, and pleasant to the taste.</p><pb n="78"/>

          <p>§ II. But when thou shouldest perceive whither I now <lb/>
            design to lead thee, I knew that thou wouldest very anxiously <lb/>
            tend thither, and be very greatly inflamed with that desire. <lb/>
            For I heard what thou before saidst, that thou wast very de­ <lb/>
            sirous to bear it. Then said the Mind: Whither wilt thou <lb/>
            now especially lead me ? Then answered Reason, and said : <lb/>
            I propose that I should lead thee to the true goods, about <lb/>
            which thy mind often meditates, and is greatly moved: and <lb/>
            thou hast not yet been able to find the most direct way to <lb/>
            the true goods, because thy mind was occupied with the view <lb/>
            of these false goods. Then said the Mind: I beseech thee <lb/>
            that thou wouldest show me, beyond all doubt, what the true <lb/>
            happiness is. Then said Reason: I will gladly, for love of <lb/>
            thee. But I must, by some example, teach thee some re­ <lb/>
            semblance of the thing, till the thing be better known to <lb/>
            thee; in order that thou mayest clearly view the example, <lb/>
            and then, by the resemblance of the true goods, thou mayest <lb/>
            know the true goods, and forsake what is contrary to them, <lb/>
            that is, the false goods: and then with the anxious thought <lb/>
            of all thy mind, strive that thou mayest arrive at those goods, <lb/>
            which for ever remain!</p>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom had ended this discourse, then began he <lb/>
            again to sing, and thus said: Whosoever is desirous to sow <lb/>
            fertile land, let him first draw out the thorns, and the furze, <lb/>
            and the fern, and all the weeds which he observes to do injury <lb/>
            to the field, in order that the wheat may grow the better. <lb/>
            Also, this example is to be considered, that is, that to every <lb/>
            man honeycomb seems the sweeter, if he, a little before, taste <lb/>
            anything bitter. And, again, calm weather is the more agree­ <lb/>
            able, if it a little before be stark storms, and north winds, and <lb/>
            much rain and snow. And more agreeable also is the light of <lb/>
            the day, for the horrible darkness of the night, than it would <lb/>
            be if there were no night. So is also the true happiness much <lb/>
            the more pleasant to enjoy, after the calamities of this present <lb/>
            life. And, moreover, thou mayest much the sooner discover <lb/>
            the true goods, and arrive at the knowledge of them, if thou <lb/>
            first rootest out from thy mind the false goods, and removest <pb n="80"/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN he had sung this lay, he ceased the song, and <lb/>
            was silent awhile, and began to think deeply in his mind'a <lb/>
            thought, and thus said: Every mortal man troubles himself <lb/>
            with various and manifold anxieties, and yet all desire, through <lb/>
            various paths, to come to one end: that is, they desire, by dif­ <lb/>
            ferent means, to arrive at one happiness; that is, then, God! <lb/>
            He is the beginning and the end of every good, and he is the <lb/>
            highest happiness. Then said the Mind: This, methinks, must <lb/>
            be the highest good, so that man should need no other good, <lb/>
            nor moreover be solicitous beyond that: since he possesses <lb/>
            that which is the roof of all other goods; for it includes all <lb/>
            other goods, and has all of them within it. It would not be <lb/>
            the highest good, if any good were external to it, because it <lb/>
            would then have to desire some good which itself had not. <lb/>
            Then answered Reason, and said: It is very evident that this <lb/>
            is the highest happiness, for it is both the roof and the floor <lb/>
            of all good. What is that, then, but the best happiness, which <lb/>
            gathers the other felicities all within it, and includes, and <lb/>
            holds them within it: and to- it there is a deficiency of none, <lb/>
            neither has it need of any; but they all come from it, and <lb/>
            again all return to it: as all waters come from the sea, and <lb/>
            again all come to the sea ? There is none in the little fountain <lb/>
            which does not seek the sea, and again, from the sea it arrives <lb/>
            at the earth, and so it flows gradually through the earth, till <lb/>
            it again comes to the same fountain that it before flowed from, <lb/>
            and so again to the sea.</p>
          <p>§ II. Now this is an example of the true goods, which all <lb/>
            mortal men desire to obtain, though they by various ways <lb/>
            think to arrive at them. For every man has natural good in <lb/>
            himself because every mind desires to obtain the true good: <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="82"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              but it is hindered by the transitory goods, because it is more <lb/>
              prone thereto. For some men think that it is the best happi­ <lb/>
              ness that a man be so rich that he have need of nothing more: <lb/>
              and they choose their life accordingly. Some men think that <lb/>
              this is the highest good, that he be among his fellows the most <lb/>
              honourable of his fellows, and they with all energy seek this. <lb/>
              Some think that the supreme good is in the highest power. <lb/>
              These desire, either for themselves to rule, or else to associate <lb/>
              themselves in friendship with their rulers. Some persuade <lb/>
              themselves that it is best that a man be illustrious and cele­ <lb/>
              brated, and have good fame; they therefore seek this both in <lb/>
              peace and in war. Many reckon it for the greatest good and <lb/>
              for the greatest happiness, that a man be always blithe in this <lb/>
              present life, and fulfil all his lusts. Some, indeed, who desire <lb/>
              these riches, are desirous thereof, because they would have the <lb/>
              greater power, that they may the more securely enjoy these <lb/>
              worldly lusts, and also the riches. Many there are of those <lb/>
              who desire power because they would gather overmuch <lb/>
              money: or again, they are desirous to spread the celebrity <lb/>
              of their name.</p>
          <p>§ III. On account of such and other like frail and perish­ <lb/>
            able advantages, the thought of every human mind is troubled <lb/>
            with solicitude and with anxiety. It then imagines that it <lb/>
            has obtained some exalted good when it has won the flattery <lb/>
            of the people; and methinks that it has bought a very false <lb/>
            greatness. Some with much anxiety seek wives, that thereby <lb/>
            they may, above all things, have children, and also live hap­ <lb/>
            pily. True friends, then, I say, is the most precious thing of <lb/>
            all these worldly felicities. They are not, indeed, to be <lb/>
            reckoned as worldly goods, but as divine: for deceitful for­ <lb/>
            tune does not produce them, but God, who naturally formed <lb/>
            them as relations. For of every other thing in this world <lb/>
            man is desirous, either that he may through it attain to <lb/>
            power, or else some worldly lust: except of the true friend, <lb/>
            whom he loves sometimes for affection and for fidelity, though <lb/>
            be expect to himself no other rewards. Nature joins and <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>

              cements friends together with inseparable love. But with <lb/>
              these worldly goods, and with this present wealth, men make <lb/>
              oftener enemies than friends. By these and by many such <lb/>
              things it may be evident to all men, that all the bodily goods <lb/>
              are inferior to the faculties of the soul. We indeed think that <lb/>
              a man is the stronger, because he is great in his body. The <lb/>
              fairness, moreover, and the vigour of the body, rejoices and <lb/>
              delights the man, and health makes him cheerful. In all <lb/>
              these bodily felicities, men seek simple happiness, as it seems <lb/>
              to them. For whatsoever every man chiefly loves above all <lb/>
              other things, that he persuades himself is best for him, and <lb/>
              that is his highest good. When, therefore, he has acquired <lb/>
              that, he imagines that he may be very happy. I do not deny, <lb/>
              that these goods and this happiness are the highest good of <lb/>
              this present life. For every man considers that thing best, <lb/>
              which he chiefly loves above other things; and therefore he <lb/>
              persuades himself that he is very happy if he can obtain what <lb/>
              he then most desires. Is not now clearly enough shown to <lb/>
              thee the form of the false goods, that is, then, possessions, <lb/>
              dignity, and power, and glory, and pleasure ? Concerning <lb/>
              pleasure, Epicurus the philosopher said, when he inquired <lb/>
              concerning all those other goods, which we before mentioned; <lb/>
              then said he that pleasure was the highest good, because all <lb/>
              the other goods which we before mentioned gratify the mind <lb/>
              and delight it, but pleasure alone chiefly gratifies the body <lb/>
              only.</p>
          <p>§ IV. But we will still speak concerning the nature of <lb/>
            men, and concerning their pursuits. Though, then, their <lb/>
            mind and their nature be now dimmed, and they are by that <lb/>
            fall sunk down to evil, and thither inclined, yet they are <lb/>
            desirous, so far as they can and may, of the highest good. <lb/>
            As a drunken man knows that he should go to his house and <lb/>
            to his rest, and yet is not able to find the way thither, so is <lb/>
            it also with the mind, when it is weighed down by the <lb/>
            anxieties of this world. It is sometimes intoxicated and <lb/>
            misled by them, so far that it cannot rightly find out good. <pb n="86"/>

              Nor yet does it appear to those men that they at all err, who <lb/>
              are desirous to obtain this, that they need labour after nothing <lb/>
              more. But they think that they are able to collect together <lb/>
              all these goods, so that none may be excluded from the <lb/>
              number. They therefore know no other good than the col- <lb/>
              Meeting of all the most precious things into their power, that <lb/>
              they may have need of nothing besides them. But there is <lb/>
              no one that has not need of some addition, except God alone. <lb/>
              He has of his own enough, nor has he need of anything but <lb/>
              that which he has in himself. Dost thou think, however, <lb/>
              that they foolishly imagine that that thing is best deserving <lb/>
              of all estimation, which they may consider most desirable ? <lb/>
              No, no. I know that it is not to be despised. How can <lb/>
              that be evil, which the mind of every man considers to be <lb/>
              good, and strives after, and desires to obtain ? No, it is not <lb/>
              evil: it is the highest good. Why is not power to be reckoned <lb/>
              one of the highest goods of this present life ? Is that to be <lb/>
              esteemed vain and useless, which is the most useful of all <lb/>
              these worldly things, that is, power? Is good fame and <lb/>
              renown to be accounted nothing? No, no. It is not fit <lb/>
              that any one account it nothing; for every man thinks that <lb/>
              best which he most loves. Do we not know that no anxiety, <lb/>
              or difficulties, or trouble, or pain, or sorrow, is happiness ? <lb/>
              What more, then, need we say about these felicities ? Does <lb/>
              not every man know what they are, and also know that they <lb/>
              are the highest good ? And yet almost every man seeks in <lb/>
              very little things the best felicities ; because he thinks that <lb/>
              he may have them all, if he have that which he then chiefly <lb/>
              wishes to obtain. This. is, then, what they chiefly wish to <lb/>
              obtain, wealth, and dignity, and authority, and this world's <lb/>
              glory, and ostentation, and worldly lust. Of all this they are <lb/>
              desirous, because they think that, through these things, they <lb/>
              may obtain that there be not to them a deficiency of anything <lb/>
              wished; neither of dignity, nor of power, nor of renown, nor <lb/>
              of bliss. They wish for all this, and they do well that they <lb/>
              desire it, though they seek it variously. By these things we <lb/>
              may clearly perceive that every man is desirous of this, that <lb/>
              he may obtain the highest good, if they were able to discover <lb/>
              it, or knew how to seek it rightly. But they do not seek it <lb/>
              in the most right way. It is not of this world.</p><pb n="88"/>

          <p>WHEN Wisd om had made this speech, then began be again <lb/>
            to sing, and thus said: I will now with songs declare how <lb/>
            wonderfully the Lord governs all creatures with the bridles <lb/>
            of his power, and with what order he establishes and regulates <lb/>
            all creatures, and how be has restrained and bound them with <lb/>
            his indissoluble chains, so that every creature is kept within <lb/>
            bounds with its kind, the kind that it was fashioned to, except <lb/>
            men and some angels, sometimes depart from their kind. <lb/>
            THus the lion, though she be very tame, and have fast chains, <lb/>
            and greatly love, and also fear her master; if it ever happen <lb/>
            that she tastes blood, she immediately forgets her new tamer, <lb/>
            and remembers the wild manner of her parents. She'then <lb/>
            begins roaring, and to break her chains, and bites first her <lb/>
            leader, and afterwards whatsoever she may seize, both of men <lb/>
            and of cattle. So do also wood-fowls. Though they be well <lb/>
            tamed, if they return to the woods, they despise their teachers, <lb/>
            and remain with their kind. Though their teachers then offer <lb/>
            them the same meals with which they before allured them to <lb/>
            become tame: they then care not for those meals, so that they <lb/>
            may enjoy the wood. But it seems to them pleasanter, that <lb/>
            the weald resound to them, and they hear the voice of other <lb/>
            fowls. So is it also with trees, whose nature it is to stand <lb/>
            up high. Though thou pull any bough down to the earth, <lb/>
            such as thou mayest bend; as soon as thou lettest it go, so <lb/>
            soon springs it up, and moves towards its kind. So doth <lb/>
            also the sun. Though; she after mid-day sink and incline to <lb/>
            the earth, again she seeks her kind, and departs by unknown <lb/>
            ways to her rising, and so.. hastens higher and higher, until <lb/>
            she comes so far up aa' her highest nature is. So cloth every <lb/>
            creature. Ittends towards-its kind,: and is joyful if it ever <lb/>
            may come thereto. There is no creature formed which de­ <lb/>
            sires not that it may come thither whence it before came, <lb/>
            that is, to rest and to tranquillity. The rest is with God, and <lb/>
            it is God. But every creature turns on itself like a wheel: and <lb/>
            so it thus turns that it may again come where it was before, <lb/>
            and be the same that it was before, as often as it is turned <lb/>
            round may be what it before was, and may do what it before <lb/>
            did.</p><pb n="90"/>

            § I. When Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he again <lb/>
            to speak, and thus said: 0 ye earthly men, though ye now <lb/>
            make yourselves like cattle by your folly, ye nevertheless can <lb/>
            in some measure understand, as in a dream, concerning your <lb/>
            origin, that is God. Ye perceive the true beginning, and the <lb/>
            true end of all happiness, though ye do not fully know it. <lb/>
            And nevertheless nature draws you to that knowledge, but <lb/>
            very manifold error draws you from that knowledge. Consider <lb/>
            now whether men can arrive at the true goods through these <lb/>
            present goods; since almost all men say that he is happiest <lb/>
            who possesses all these earthly goods. Can, then, much money, <lb/>
            or dignity, or all this present wealth, make any man so happy <lb/>
            that he may need nothing more ? No, no. I know this, that <lb/>
            they cannot. Why, is it not then from this very clear, that <lb/>
            these present goods are not the true goods, because they <lb/>
            cannot give what they promise ? But they pretend to do <lb/>
            what they are not able to fulfil, when they promise to those <lb/>
            who are willing to love them, the true felicities, and tell lies <lb/>
            to them more than they perform to them; for they are de­ <lb/>
            ficient in more of these felicities than they possess of them. <lb/>
            Consider now concerning thyself, 0 Boethius, whether thou <lb/>
            wert ever aught uneasy, when thou wert most prosperous ? <lb/>
            or whether there were ever to thee a want of anything de­ <lb/>
            sired, when thou hadst most wealth? or whether thy life <lb/>
            were then all according to thy wish ? Then answered Boe­ <lb/>
            tbius, and said: No, 0 no! I was never yet at any time of <lb/>
            so even mind, as far as I can remember, that I was altogether <lb/>
            without care: that I was so without care that I bad no <lb/>
            trouble: nor did all that I experienced ever yet please me, <lb/>
            nor was it ever with me entirely as I wished, though I con­ <lb/>
            cealed it. Then answered Wisdom, and said: Wast thou <lb/>
            not, then, poor enough, and unhappy enough, though it <lb/>
            seemed to thee that thou wert rich; when thou either hadst <lb/>
            that which thou wouldest not, or hadst not that which thou <lb/>
            wouldest? Then answered Boethius, and said: All was to <pb n="92"/>

              me as thou hast said. Then said Wisdom : Is not every man <lb/>
              poor enough in respect of that which he has not, when he is <lb/>
              desirous to have it ? That is true, said Boethius. Then said <lb/>
              Wisdom: But if he is poor, he is not happy, for he desires <lb/>
              that he may have what he has not, because he wishes to have <lb/>
              enough. Then said Boethius: That is all true which thou <lb/>
              sayest. Then said Wisdom: Hadst thou not, then, poverty <lb/>
              when thou wert richest? Then answered I, and said: I <lb/>
              know that thou sayest truth, that I had it. Then said <lb/>
              Wisdom : Does it not appear to me, then, that all the riches <lb/>
              of this middle-earth are not able to make one man wealthy ? <lb/>
              so wealthy that he may have enough, and may not need <lb/>
              more? And nevertheless they promise it to every one who <lb/>
              possesses them. Then said I: Nothing is truer than what <lb/>
              thou sayest.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said Wisdom : But why, then, art thou not an <lb/>
            assenter to this ? Canst thou not see every day, that the <lb/>
            stronger take riches from the weaker? Wherefore else is. <lb/>
            every day such sorrow, and such contentions, and assemblies, <lb/>
            and judgments; except that every one demands the spoil <lb/>
            which is taken from him, or, again, covets that of another? <lb/>
            Then answered I, and said: Thou arguest rightly enough; <lb/>
            so it is as thou sayest. Then said he: On these accounts <lb/>
            every man has need of help in addition to himself, that he <lb/>
            may keep his riches. Then said I: Who denies it? Then <lb/>
            said he: If he had nothing of that which he fears he may be <lb/>
            obliged to lose, then he would not have occasion for any more <lb/>
            help than himself. Then said I: Thou sayest truly. Then <lb/>
            retorted Wisdom sharply, and said: 0, how inconsistent, in <lb/>
            every man's custom and every man's will, does that thing <lb/>
            appear to me, which I will now mention ; that is, that from <lb/>
            whence they persuade themselves that they shall become <lb/>
            happier, they from thence become poorer and weaker! For, <lb/>
            if they have any little, then it behoves them to cringe for <lb/>
            protection to those who have anything more. Whether they <lb/>
            need, or whether they need not, they yet crave. Where, <lb/>
            then, is moderation, or who has it, or when will it come, that <lb/>
            it may entirely drive away miseries from the wealthy ? The <lb/>
            more he has, the more men he must cringe to. Do the rich <lb/>
            never hunger, nor thirst, nor become cold ? But I suppose <lb/>
            thou wilt say that the rich have wherewith they may remedy <lb/>
            all that. But though thou say so, riches cannot altogether <pb n="94"/>

              <note type="margin"> § I. </note> <lb/>
              remedy it, though they somewhile may. For it behoves them <lb/>
              every day to add, what man every day lessens; because human <lb/>
              want, which is never satisfied, requires each day something <lb/>
              of this world's wealth, either of clothing, of meat, of drink, or <lb/>
              of many things besides. Therefore no man is so wealthy that <lb/>
              he needs not more. But covetousness neither knows limit, <lb/>
              nor ever is bounded by necessity; but desires always more <lb/>
              than it needs. I know not why ye confide in these perish­ <lb/>
              able riches, when they are not able to remove your poverty <lb/>
              from you, but ye increase your poverty whenever they come <lb/>
              to you.</p>
          <p>§ III. When Wisdom had made this speech, then begau he <lb/>
            again to sing, and thus singing said: What profit is it to the <lb/>
            rich miser, that he gather an infinite quantity of these riches, <lb/>
            and obtain abundance of every kind of jewel: and though he <lb/>
            till his land with a thousand ploughs; and though all this <lb/>
            middle-earth be subject to his power! He will not take <lb/>
            with him from this middle-earth any more of it than he <lb/>
            brought hither.</p>

          <p>§ I. Two things may dignity and power do, if it come to <lb/>
            the unwise. It may make him honourable and respectable <lb/>
            to other unwise persons. But when he quits the power, or <lb/>
            the power him, then is he to the unwise neither honourable <lb/>
            nor respectable. Has, then, power the custom of extermi­ <lb/>
            nating vices, and rooting them out from the mind of great <lb/>
            men, and planting therein virtues ? I know, however, that <lb/>
            earthly power never sows the virtues, but collects and gathers <lb/>
            vices; and when it has gathered them, then it nevertheless <lb/>
            shows, and does not conceal them. For the vices of great <lb/>
            men many men see: because many know them, and many <lb/>
            are with them. Therefore we always lament concerning <lb/>
            power, and also despise it, when we see that it cometh to <lb/>
            the worst, and to those who are to us most unworthy. It <lb/>
            was on these accounts that formerly the wise Catulus was <lb/>
            angry, and so immoderately censured Nonius the rich, be- <pb n="96"/>

              cause he observed him to sit in an ornamented chair of state. <lb/>
              It was a great custom among the Romans that no others <lb/>
              should sit therein, except the most worthy. Then Catulus <lb/>
              despised him, because he should sit therein; for he knew him <lb/>
              to be very unwise, and very intemperate. Then began Ca­ <lb/>
              tulus to spit upon him. Catulus was a consul in Rome, a <lb/>
              very wise man. He would not have despised the other so <lb/>
              greatly, if he had not possessed any rule, or any power.</p>
          <p>§ II. Canst thou now understand how great dishonour <lb/>
            power brings on the unworthy when he receives it ? for every <lb/>
            man's evil is the more public when he has power. But tell <lb/>
            me now, I ask thee, Boethius, why thou hadst such manifold <lb/>
            evil, and such great uneasiness in authority, whilst thou <lb/>
            hadst it ? or why thou, again, didst unwillingly relinquish <lb/>
            it ? Dost thou not know that it was for no other reasons <lb/>
            but that thou wouldest not in all things be conformable to <lb/>
            the will of the unrighteous king Theodoric; because thou <lb/>
            didst find him in all respects unworthy of power, very shame­ <lb/>
            less, and unrelenting, without any good conduct ? For we <lb/>
            cannot easily say that the wicked are good, though they have <lb/>
            power. Yet thou wouldest not have been driven from Theo­ <lb/>
            doric, nor would he have despised thee, if his folly and his <lb/>
            injustice had pleased thee, as well as it did his foolish favour­ <lb/>
            ites. If thou now shouldest see some very wise man, who <lb/>
            had very excellent dispositions, and was, nevertheless, very <lb/>
            poor, and very unhappy, wouldest thou say that he were un­ <lb/>
            worthy of power and dignity? Then answered Boethius, <lb/>
            and said: No, 0 no! If I found him such, I would never <lb/>
            say that he were unworthy of power and dignity. But <lb/>
            methinks that he would be worthy of all that is in this <lb/>
            world. Then said Wisdom : Every virtue has its proper ex­ <lb/>
            cellence : and the excellence and the dignity which it has, it <lb/>
            imparts immediately to every one who loves it. Thus wisdom <lb/>
            is the highest virtue, and it has in it four other virtues; of <lb/>
            which one is prudence, another temperance, the third is for­ <lb/>
            titude, the fourth justice. Wisdom makes its lovers wise, and <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              prudent, and moderate, aud patient, and just, and it fills him <lb/>
              who loves it with every good quality. This they cannot do <lb/>
              who possess the power of this world. They cannot impart <lb/>
              any virtue to those who love them, through their wealth, if <lb/>
              they have it not in their nature. Hence it is very clear that <lb/>
              the rich in worldly wealth have no proper dignity: but the <lb/>
              wealth is come to them from without, and they cannot from <lb/>
              without have aught of their own. Consider, now, whether <lb/>
              any man is the less honourable because many men despise <lb/>
              him. But if any man be the less honourable, then is every <lb/>
              foolish man the less honourable, the more authority he has, <lb/>
              to every wise man. Hence it is sufficiently clear that power <lb/>
              and wealth cannot make its possessor the more honourable. <lb/>
              But it makes him the less honourable when it comes to him, <lb/>
              if he were not before virtuous. So is also wealth and power <lb/>
              the worse, if he be not virtuous who possesses it. Each of <lb/>
              them is the more worthless, when they meet with each other.</p>
          <p>§ III. But I may easily instruct thee by an example, so <lb/>
            that thou mayest clearly enough perceive that this present <lb/>
            life is very like a shadow, and in that shadow no man can <lb/>
            attain the true felicities. How thinkest thou, then ? If <lb/>
            any very great man were driven from his country, or goeth <lb/>
            on his lord's errand, and so cometh to a foreign people where <lb/>
            no man knows him, nor he any man, nor even knows the <lb/>
            language, thinkest thou that his greatness can make him <lb/>
            honourable in that land ? But I know that it cannot. But <lb/>
            if dignity were natural to wealth, and were its own, or again, <lb/>
            wealth were the rich man's own, then could not it forsake <lb/>
            him. Let the man who possessed them be in whatsoever <lb/>
            land he might, then would his wealth and his dignity be with <lb/>
            him. But because the wealth and the power are not his own, <lb/>
            therefore they forsake him; and because they have no natural <lb/>
            good in themselves, therefore they go away like shadows or <lb/>
            smoke. Yet the false opinion, and the imagination. of foolish <lb/>
            men, persuades them that power is the highest good. But <lb/>
            it is entirely otherwise. When the great are either among, <lb/>
            foreigners, or in their own country among wise men; then <note type="footnote"> II 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>

              either to the wise, or to the foreigners, is his wealth for <lb/>
              naught, when they learn that they were chosen for no virtue, <lb/>
              but through the favour of foolish people. But if they in <lb/>
              their power had anything of proper or natural good, then <lb/>
              would they have that with them, even if they should lose the <lb/>
              power. They would not lose the natural good, but that would <lb/>
              always follow them, and always make them honourable, let <lb/>
              them be in whatsoever land they might.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Now thou mayest understand that wealth and power <lb/>
            cannot make any man honourable in a foreign country. I <lb/>
            wot, however, thou mayest think that they always can in <lb/>
            their own country. But though thou mayest think it, I <lb/>
            kuow that they cannot. It was formerly, through all the <lb/>
            territories of the Romans, that consuls, and judges, and the <lb/>
            treasurers, who kept the money, which they were every year <lb/>
            to give to the soldiers, and the wisest senators, had the <lb/>
            greatest honour. But now, either none of these exists, or <lb/>
            they have no honour, if any one of them exists. So it is with <lb/>
            respect to every one of those things which have not in them­ <lb/>
            selves proper and natural good. One while it is to be cen­ <lb/>
            sured, another while it is to be praised. But what of de­ <lb/>
            lightful or of useful appears to thee, then, in wealth and in <lb/>
            power; when they have enough of nothing, nor have anything <lb/>
            of proper good, nor can give anything durable to their pos­ <lb/>
            sessors P</p>

          <p>WHEN Wisdom had made this speech, then began he again <lb/>
            to sing, and thus said: Though the wicked king Nero decked <lb/>
            himself with all the most splendid clothes, and adorned him­ <lb/>
            self with gems of every kind, was he not, nevertheless, to all <lb/>
            wise men, loathsome and unworthy, and full of all vice and <lb/>
            debauchery? Yet he enriched his favourites with great <lb/>
            riches: but what was to them the better ? What wise man <lb/>
            could say that he was the more honourable, when he had en­ <lb/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then began be again <lb/>
            to speak, and thus said: Dost thou think that the king's <lb/>
            familiarity, and the wealth and the power which he gives <lb/>
            to his favourites, can make any man wealthy or powerful ? <lb/>
            Then answered I, and said: Why cannot they ? What in <lb/>
            this present life is pleasanter and better than the king's ser­ <lb/>
            vice and his presence, and moreover wealth and power? <lb/>
            Then answered Wisdom, and said: Tell me, now, whether <lb/>
            thou hast ever heard, that it always remained to any one who <lb/>
            was before us ? or thinkest thou that any one who now has <lb/>
            it, can always have it ? Dost thou not know that all books <lb/>
            are full of examples of the men who were before us, and every <lb/>
            one knows concerning those who are now living, that from <lb/>
            many a king power and wealth go away, until he afterwards <lb/>
            becomes poor? Alas! is that, then, very excellent wealth, <lb/>
            which can preserve neither itself nor its lord, so that he may <lb/>
            not have need of more help, lest they should both be lost ? <lb/>
            But is not this your highest felicity-the power of kings ? <lb/>
            And yet if to the king there be a want of anything desired, <lb/>
            then that lessens his power, and augments his misery. There­ <lb/>
            fore these your felicities are always in some respects infeli­ <lb/>
            cities ! Moreover kings, though they govern many nations, <lb/>
            yet they do not govern all those which they would govern; <lb/>
            but are very wretched in their mind, because they have not <lb/>
            some of those things which they would have: for I know that <lb/>
            the king who is rapacious has more wretchedness than power. <lb/>
            Therefore a certain king, who unjustly came to empire, for­ <lb/>
            merly said: 0, how happy is the man to whom a naked sword <lb/>
            hangs not always over the head by a small thread, as to me it <lb/>
            ever yet has done! How does it now appear to thee ? How <lb/>
            do wealth and power please thee, when they are never with­ <lb/>
            out fear, and difficulties, and anxieties ? Thou knowest that <lb/>
            every king would be without these, and yet have power if he <pb n="104"/>

              might. But I know that he cannot: therefore I wonder why <lb/>
              they glory in such power. Does it seem to thee that the man <lb/>
              has great power, and is truly happy, who always desires that <lb/>
              which he cannot obtain ? Or thinkest thou that lie is really <lb/>
              happy who always goes with a great company ? Or again, <lb/>
              he who dreads both him that is in dread of him, and him that <lb/>
              is not in dread of him ? Does it seem to thee that the man <lb/>
              has great power who seems to himself to have none, even as <lb/>
              to many a man it seems that he has none, unless he have <lb/>
              many a man to serve him ? What shall we now say more <lb/>
              concerning the king, and concerning his followers, except <lb/>
              that every rational man may know that they are full miser­ <lb/>
              able and weak ? How can kings deny or conceal their weak­ <lb/>
              ness, when they are not able to attain any honour without <lb/>
              their thanes' assistance?</p>
          <p>§ II. What else shall we say concerning thanes, but this, <lb/>
            that it often happens that they are hereaved of all honour, <lb/>
            and even of life, by their perfidious king? Thus we know <lb/>
            that the wicked king Nero would hate his own master, and <lb/>
            kill his foster-father, whose name was Seneca. He was a <lb/>
            philosopher. When, therefore, he found that he must die, he <lb/>
            offered all his possessions for his life, but the king would not <lb/>
            accept of it, or grant him his life. When he learned this, he <lb/>
            chose for himself the death, that they should let for him blood <lb/>
            from the arm; and they did so. We have also heard that <lb/>
            Papinianus was to Antoninus the Cæsar, of all his favourites <lb/>
            the most beloved, and of all his people had the greatest <lb/>
            power. But he gave order to bind, and afterwards to slay <lb/>
            him. Yet all men know that Seneca was to Nero, and Pa­ <lb/>
            pinianus to Antoninus, the most worthy and the most dear; <lb/>
            and they had the greatest power, both in their court and <lb/>
            elsewhere, and nevertheless, without any guilt, they were <lb/>
            destroyed! Yet they both desired, most earnestly, that the <lb/>
            lords would take whatsoever they had, and let them live, but <lb/>
            they could not obtain it: for the cruelty of those kings was <lb/>
            so severe, that their submission could naught avail, nor in­ <lb/>
            deed would their high-mindedness, howsoever they might do, <pb n="106"/>

              have availed them either, but they were obliged to lose life. <lb/>
              For he who does not take timely care for himself, will at <lb/>
              length be destitute. How doth power and wealth now please <lb/>
              thee, now thou hast heard that a man neither can have it <lb/>
              without fear, nor can part with it though he wish ? What <lb/>
              did the crowd of friends avail the favourites of those kings, <lb/>
              or what avails it to any man ? For friends come with wealth, <lb/>
              and again with wealth go away, except very few. But the <lb/>
              friends who before, for wealth's sake, love any one, go away <lb/>
              afterwards with the wealth, and then turn to enemies. But <lb/>
              the few, who before loved him for affection and for fidelity, <lb/>
              these would, nevertheless, love him though he were poor. <lb/>
              These remain to him. What is a worse plague, or greater <lb/>
              hurt to any man, than that be have, in his society and in his <lb/>
              presence, an enemy in the likeness of a friend ?</p>
          <p>§ III. When Wisdom had made this speech, then began he <lb/>
            again to sing, and thus said: Whosoever desires fully to pos­ <lb/>
            sess power, ought to labour first that he may have power over <lb/>
            his own mind, and be not indecently subject to his vices ; also <lb/>
            let him put away from his mind unbecoming anxieties, and <lb/>
            desist from complaints of his misfortunes. Though he reign <lb/>
            over all the middle-earth, from eastward to westward, from <lb/>
            India, which is the south-east end of this middle-earth, to the <lb/>
            island which we call Thule, which is at the north-west end of <lb/>
            this middle-earth, where there is neither night in summer nor <lb/>
            day in winter; though he rule even all this, he has not the <lb/>
            more power, if he has not power over his mind, and if he does <lb/>
            not guard himself against the vices which we have before <lb/>
            spoken about.</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this song, then began he <lb/>
            again to make a speech, and said: Worthless and very false <lb/>

              formerly sung. When he contemned this present life, he <lb/>
              said: 0 glory of this world! Alas! why do foolish men call <lb/>
              thee with false voice, glory, when thou art none! For man <lb/>
              more frequently has great renown, and great glory, and great <lb/>
              honour, through the opinion of foolish people, than he has <lb/>
              through his deservings. But tell me now, what is more un­ <lb/>
              suitable than this: or why men may not rather be ashamed <lb/>
              of themselves than rejoice, when they hear that any one belies <lb/>
              them ? Though men even rightly praise any one of the good, <lb/>
              he ought not the sooner to rejoice immoderately at the people's <lb/>
              words. But at this he ought to rejoice, that they speak truth <lb/>
              of him. Though he rejoice at this, that they spread his name, <lb/>
              it is not the sooner so extensively spread as he persuades him­ <lb/>
              self; for they cannot spread it over all the earth, though they <lb/>
              may in some land; for though it be praised in one, yet in <lb/>
              another it is not praised. Though he in this land be cele­ <lb/>
              brated, yet is he in another not celebrated.. Therefore is the <lb/>
              people's esteem to be held by every man for nothing; since <lb/>
              it comes not to every man according to his deserts, nor in­ <lb/>
              deed remains always to any one. Consider first concerning <lb/>
              birth: if any one boast of it, how vain and how useless is the <lb/>
              boast; for every one knows that all men come from one <lb/>
              father and from one mother. Or again, concerning the <lb/>
              people's esteem, and concerning their applause. I know not <lb/>
              why we rejoice at it. Though they be illustrious whom the <lb/>
              vulgar applaud, yet are they more illustrious and more rightly <lb/>
              to be applauded who are dignified by virtues. For no man <lb/>
              is really the greater or the more praiseworthy for the excel­ <lb/>
              lence of another, or for his virtues, if he himself has it not. <lb/>
              Art thou ever the fairer for another man's fairness ? A man <lb/>
              is full little the better though he have a good father, if he <lb/>
              himself is incapable of anything. Therefore I advise that <lb/>
              thou rejoice in other men's good and their nobility, so far <lb/>
              only, that thou ascribe it not to thyself as thine own. Be. <pb n="110"/>

              cause every man's good, and his nobility, is more in the mind <lb/>
              than in the flesh. This only, indeed, I know of good in <lb/>
              nobility; that it shames many a man, if he be worse than <lb/>
              his ancestors were; and therefore he strives with all his <lb/>
              power to reach the manners of some one of the best, and his <lb/>
              virtues.</p>
          <p>§ II. When Wisdom had finished this speech, then began <lb/>
            he again to sing about the same, and said: Truly all men had <lb/>
            a like beginning, for they all came from one father and from <lb/>
            one mother: they are all, moreover, born alike. That is no <lb/>
            wonder, because one God is father of all creatures; for he <lb/>
            made them all, and governs them all. He gives light to the <lb/>
            sun, and to the moon, and places all the stars. He has <lb/>
            created men on the earth, joined together the soul and the <lb/>
            body by his power, and made all men equally noble in their <lb/>
            original nature. Why do ye then lift up yourselves above <lb/>
            other men, on account of your birth, without cause, since ye <lb/>
            can find none unnohle, but all are equally noble, if ye are <lb/>
            willing to remember the creation, and the Creator, and more­ <lb/>
            over the birth of every one of you ? But true nobility is in <lb/>
            the mind, not in the flesh, as we have before said. But every <lb/>
            man, who is altogether subject to vices, forsakes his Maker, <lb/>
            and his first origin, and his nobility, and thence becomes de­ <lb/>
            graded till he is unnoble.</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he again <lb/>
            to make a speech, and thus said: What good can we say of <lb/>
            the fleshly vices? For whosoever will yield to them shall <lb/>
            suffer great anguish and many troubles. For intemperance <lb/>
            always nourishes vices, and vices have great need of repent­ <lb/>
            ance, and repentance is not without sorrow and without <lb/>
            anguish. Alas! how many diseases, and how great pain, and <lb/>
            how great watching, and how great sadness, has he who pos­ <lb/>
            sesses wicked lust in this world! And how much more <pb n="112"/>

              thinnest thou they shall have after this world, as the re­ <lb/>
              tribution of their deserts ? even as a woman brings forth a <lb/>
              child, and suffers much trouble, after she formerly has ful­ <lb/>
              filled great lust. Therefore I know not what joy the worldly <lb/>
              lusts bring to their lovers. If any one say that he is happy <lb/>
              who fulfils all his worldly lusts, wherefore will he not also say <lb/>
              that the cattle are happy, for their desire is extended to no <lb/>
              other things, but to gluttony and to lust. Very pleasant is <lb/>
              it that a man have wife and children. But nevertheless <lb/>
              many children are begotten for their parents' destruction. <lb/>
              For many a woman dies by reason of her child, before she <lb/>
              can bring it forth. And we have also learned that formerly <lb/>
              a most unusual and unnatural crime happened, that the <lb/>
              children conspired together, and lay in wait for the father. <lb/>
              And moreover, what was worse, we have heard, long ago in <lb/>
              ancient histories, that a certain son slew his father. I know <lb/>
              not in what manner, but we know that it was an inhuman <lb/>
              deed. Besides, every one may know, how heavy trouble to <lb/>
              a man is the care of his children. I need not, however, say <lb/>
              that to thee, for thou hast experienced it of thyself. Con­ <lb/>
              cerning the heavy care of children, said my master Euripides, <lb/>
              that it sometimes happened to the unhappy, that it would be <lb/>
              better for him that he had not children, than that he had.</p>
          <p>§ II. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began he <lb/>
            again to sing, and thus singing, said: Alas! the evil desire of <lb/>
            unlawful lust disquiets the mind of almost every living man. <lb/>
            As the bee shall perish when she stings anything angrily, so <lb/>
            shall every soul perish after unlawful lust, unless the man <lb/>
            turn to good. <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he again <lb/>
            to speak, and thus said : Therefore there is no doubt that this <lb/>
            present wealth obstructs and hinders those men who are in­ <lb/>
            tent upon the true felicities; and it can bring no one where <lb/>
            it promised him, that is, to the highest good. But I can in <lb/>
            a few words declare to thee with how many evils these riches <lb/>
            are filled. What meanest thou, then, by covetousness of <lb/>
            ., money; when thou no how else canst acquire it, unless thou <lb/>
            steal it, or take it by force, or find it hid: and wheresoever it <lb/>
            increases to thee, it decreases to others ? Thou wouldest,, <lb/>
            then, be illustrious in dignity ? But if thou wilt have this, <lb/>
            then must thou very meanly, and very humbly, flatter him <lb/>
            who is able to help thee thereto. If thou wilt make thyself <lb/>
            greater and more honourable than many, then must thou <lb/>
            suffer thyself to be inferior to one. Is not this, then, some­ <lb/>
            what of misery, that a man must so anxiously cringe to him <lb/>
            who has the power of giving to him ? Of power thou art <lb/>
            desirous ? But thou never obtainest it without danger, on <lb/>
            account of foreigners, and still more on account of thine own <lb/>
            men and kindred. Of glory thou art desirous ? But thou <lb/>
            canst not have it without care: for thou shalt have always <lb/>
            something adverse and inconvenient. Thou wouldest, then, <lb/>
            enjoy immoderate lust? But then thou art desirous to <lb/>
            despise God's servants, inasmuch as thy vile flesh has the <lb/>
            mastery of thee, not thou of it. How can any man conduct <lb/>
            himself more wretchedly than when he subjects himself to <lb/>
            his vile flesh, and will not to his rational soul? If, then, ye <lb/>
            were greater in your body than the elephant, or stronger than <lb/>
            the lion or the bull, or swifter than the tiger, that wild beast; <lb/>
            and if thou wert of all men the fairest in beauty, and then <lb/>
            wouldest studiously seek after wisdom, until thou couldest <lb/>
            perfectly understand it; then mightest thou clearly perceive <note type="footnote">12 </note> <pb n="116"/>

              that all the powers and the faculties which we have before <lb/>
              spoken about, are not to be compared with any one of the <lb/>
              faculties of the soul. Indeed, wisdom is one single faculty <lb/>
              of the soul, and yet we all know that it is better than all the <lb/>
              other faculties, which we have before spoken about.</p>
          <p>§ II. Behold now the amplitude, and the firmness, and the <lb/>
            swift course of this heaven. Then may ye understand that it <lb/>
            is absolutely nothing, compared with its creator, and with <lb/>
            its ruler. Why then suffer ye it not to warn you, that ye <lb/>
            should not admire and praise that which is less perfect, that <lb/>
            is, earthly wealth ? Even as the heaven is better, and higher, <lb/>
            and fairer than all which it includes, except men alone; so is <lb/>
            man's body better and more precious than all his possessions. <lb/>
            But how much thinkest thou, then, the soul better, and more <lb/>
            precious than the body ? Every creature is to be honoured <lb/>
            in its measure, and always the highest in the greatest degree. <lb/>
            Therefore is the heavenly power to be honoured, and to be <lb/>
            admired, and to be adored above all other things. The beauty <lb/>
            of the body is very fleeting, and very frail, and very like the <lb/>
            flowers of the earth. Though any one be as fair as Alcibiades, <lb/>
            the noble youth, was: if any one be so sharp-sighted, that he <lb/>
            can see through him, as Aristotle the philosopher said that <lb/>
            wild beast was, which could see through everything, both <lb/>
            trees, and even stones, which wild beast we call lynx; if, <lb/>
            then, any one were so sharp-sighted that he could see through <lb/>
            the youth whom we have before spoken about, then would he <lb/>
            not appear to him so fair within as he outwardly seemed. <lb/>
            Though thou seem fair to any one, it is not the sooner so; <lb/>
            but the imperfection of their eyes hinders them, so that they <lb/>
            cannot observe that they behold thee outwardly, not inwardly. <lb/>
            But consider now very carefully, and inquire rationally, what <lb/>
            these fleshly goods are, and these felicities which ye now im­ <lb/>
            moderately desire. Then may ye evidently perceive that the <lb/>
            fairness of the body, and its strength, may be taken away by <lb/>
            three days' fever. I therefore say to thee all that I have be­ <lb/>
            fore said to thee, because I would clearly prove to thee, in <lb/>
            the conclusion of this chapter, that all these present goods <lb/>
            cannot perform to their lovers that which they promise them, <pb n="118"/>

              that is, the supreme good which they promise them. Though <lb/>
              they collect together all these present goods, they have not <lb/>
              the sooner perfect good therein; neither can they make their <lb/>

          <p>§ III. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began <lb/>
            he again to sing, and thus singing, said: Alas! how grievous <lb/>
            and how dangerous the error is which seduceth miserable men <lb/>
            and leads them from the right way! The way is God. Do <lb/>
            ye seek gold on trees ? I know, however, that ye seek it not <lb/>
            there, neither find ye it; for all men know that it grows not <lb/>
            there, any more than jewels grow in vineyards. Do ye set <lb/>
            your net on the highest hill, when ye are minded to fish ? <lb/>
            But I know that ye set it not there. Do ye carry out your <lb/>
            hounds and your net iuto the sea, when ye wish to hunt ? I <lb/>
            think, however, that ye then place them upon hills and in <lb/>
            woods. Truly it is wonderful that diligent men know that <lb/>
            they must seek on the sea-shore and on river banks both <lb/>
            white jewels and red, and gems of every kind; and they know <lb/>
            also in what waters, and in what rivers' mouths they must <lb/>
            seek fishes, and they know where they must seek all this <lb/>
            present wealth, and incessantly seek it. But it is a very <lb/>
            miserable thing that foolish men are so destitute of all judg­ <lb/>
            ment, that they know not where the true felicities are bid, nor <lb/>
            indeed have they any desire to seek them! But they think <lb/>
            that in these frail and perishable things they can find the true <lb/>
            happiness, that is, God! I know not how I can their folly <lb/>
            all so plainly declare, and so greatly censure as I would, for <lb/>
            they are more miserable, and more foolish, and more unhappy <lb/>
            than I can explain. Wealth and honour they desire; and when <lb/>
            they have it, then think they, so unwise! that they have the <lb/>
            true happiness!</p>

              that I show thee itself. Then answered I, and said: Now I <lb/>
              plainly perceive that there is not enough of every good in <lb/>
              these worldly riches; nor is perfect power in any worldly <lb/>
              authority; nor is true dignity in this world; nor are the <lb/>
              greatest honours in this world's glory; nor is the highest <lb/>
              pleasure in the fleshly lusts. Then answered Wisdom, and <lb/>
              said: Dost thou fully understand why it is so ? Then <lb/>
              answered I, and said: Though I understand it iu some mea­ <lb/>
              sure, I would nevertheless learn it more fully and more dis­ <lb/>
              tinctly from thee. Then answered Wisdom, and said: It <lb/>
              is sufficiently clear that good is single and indivisible, though <lb/>
              foolish men divide it into many, when they erring seek the <lb/>
              highest good in the worse creatures. But dost thou think <lb/>
              that he has need of nothing more, who has the greatest power <lb/>
              in this world ? Then answered I again, and said : I do not <lb/>
              say that he has need of nothing more, for I know that no one <lb/>
              is so wealthy that he needs not some addition. Then answered <lb/>
              Wisdom, and said: Thou sayest rightly enough. Though any <lb/>
              one have power, if another have more, the weaker needs the <lb/>
              aid of the stronger. Then said I: It is all as thou sayest. <lb/>
              Then said Wisdom : Though any one call power and abund­ <lb/>
              ance two things, it is nevertheless one. Then said I: So I <lb/>
              think. Then he said: Thinkest thou now that power and <lb/>
              abundance is to be despised ? or, again, more to be esteemed <lb/>
              than other goods ? Then said I: No man can doubt of this, <lb/>
              that power and abundance is to be esteemed. Then said lie: <lb/>
              Let us now, if it so seem to thee, make an addition to the <lb/>
              power and the abundance; let us add dignity thereto, and <lb/>
              then account the three as one. Then answered I, and said: <lb/>
              Let us do so, for it is true. Then said he: Does the assem­ <lb/>
              blage of these three things, then, seem to thee worthless and <lb/>
              ignoble, when the three are united together? or whether, <lb/>
              agaio, does it seem to thee of all things the most worthy and <lb/>
              the most noble ? If thou knewest any man who had power <lb/>
              over everything, and bad all dignity, even so far that he <lb/>
              needed nothing more, consider, now, how honourable and how <lb/>
              eminent the man would seem to thee ; and yet, though he bad <lb/>
              the three, if he were not celebrated, then would there never- <pb n="122"/>

              theless be to him a deficiency of some dignity .Then said I: <lb/>
              I cannot deny it. Then said be: Is it not, then, sufficiently <lb/>
              clear that we should add celebrity to the three, and make the <lb/>
              four as one? Then said I: That is proper. Theu said be: <lb/>
              Dost thou think that be is blithe who has all these four ? <lb/>
              The fifth is pleasure, and that any one may do whatsoever he <lb/>
              will, and need nothing more than he possesses ? Then said I: <lb/>
              I can never imagine, if be were such and bad all this, whence <lb/>
              any trouble should come to him. Then said he: But it must, <lb/>
              then, be considered that the five things which we have before <lb/>
              spoken about, though they are separately named in words, <lb/>
              that it is all one thing when they are collected together, <lb/>
              that is, power, and abundance, and glory, and dignity, and <lb/>
              pleasure.</p>
          <p>§ II. These five things, when they are all collected together, <lb/>
            then, that is God. For all the five no human being can fully <lb/>
            have while he is in this world. But when these five things, <lb/>
            as we before said, are all collected together, then is it all one <lb/>
            thing, and that one thing is God: and he is single and un­ <lb/>
            divided, though they before were, in many, separately named. <lb/>
            Then answered I, and said: Of all this I approve. Then said <lb/>
            he: Though God be single and undivided, as he is, human <lb/>
            error divides him into many, by their vain words. Every man <lb/>
            proposes to himself for the supreme good that which he chiefly <lb/>
            loves. Then one loves this, and one another thing. That, then, <lb/>
            is his good, which he chiefly loves. But when they divide <lb/>
            their good into so many parts, then find they neither good <lb/>
            itself, nor the part of good which they chiefly love. When <lb/>
            they add it all together, they then have neither all of it, nor <lb/>
            the part which they separated therefrom. For this reason <lb/>
            every man finds not what he seeks, because he seeks it not <lb/>
            rightly. Ye seek where ye cannot find, when ye seek all good <lb/>
            in one good. Then said I: That is true. Then said he: When <lb/>
            the man is poor, he is not desirous of power, but wishes for <lb/>
            wealth, and flies from poverty. He labours not for this, how <lb/>
            he may be most illustrious; nor, moreover, does any one <lb/>
            obtain that which he labours not for. But he labours all his <pb n="124"/>

              life for wealth, and foregoes many a worldly pleasure in order <lb/>
              that he may acquire and keep wealth, because he is desirous <lb/>
              of that above all other things. But if he obtain it, he then <lb/>
              thinks that be has not enough, unless, he have also power be­ <lb/>
              sides: for he thinks that he cannot keep the wealth without <lb/>
              power. Nor, moreover, does there ever seem to him enough, <lb/>
              until he has all that he desires. For wealth desires power, <lb/>
              and power desires dignity, and dignity desires glory. After <lb/>
              he is full of wealth, it then seems to him that he may have <lb/>
              every desire if he have power: and he gives all the wealth for <lb/>
              power, unless he is able to obtain it for less; and foregoes <lb/>
              every other advantage, in order that he may attain to power. <lb/>
              And then it often happens, that when he has given all that <lb/>
              he had for power, he has neither the power, nor moreover that <lb/>
              which he gave for it, but at length becomes so poor that he <lb/>
              has not even mere necessaries, that is, food and clothing. He <lb/>
              then is desirous of necessaries, not of power. We before spoke <lb/>
              of the five felicities, that is, wealth, and power, and dignity, <lb/>
              and renown, and pleasure. Now have we treated of wealth <lb/>
              and of power; and the same we may say of the three which <lb/>
              we have not treated of: that is, dignity, and renown, and <lb/>
              pleasure. These three things, and the two which we before <lb/>
              named, though any man think that in any one soever of them <lb/>
              he can possess full happiness, it is not the sooner so, though <lb/>
              they hope for it, unless they have all the five. Then answered <lb/>
              I, and said: What ought we then to do ? since thou sayest <lb/>
              that we cannot in any one soever of these have the highest <lb/>
              good, and full happiness: and we do not at all think that <lb/>
              any one soever of us can obtain the five all together. Then <lb/>
              answered lie, and said: If any one desire that he may have <lb/>
              all the five, then desireth he the highest felicities; but he <lb/>
              cannot fully obtain them in this world. For though he <lb/>
              should obtain all the five goods, it nevertheless would not be <lb/>
              the supreme good, nor the best happiness, because they are <lb/>
              not eternal. Then answered I, and said: Now I perceive <lb/>
              clearly enough, that the best felicities are not in this world. <pb n="126"/>

              Then said lie: No man needs in this present life to seek after <lb/>
              the true felicities, nor think that here he can find sufficient <lb/>
              good. Then said I: Thou sayest truly.</p>
          <p>§ III. Then said he: I think that I have said enough to <lb/>
            thee about the false goods. But I am desirous that thou <lb/>
            shouldest turn thy attention from the false goods; then wilt <lb/>
            thou very soon know the true goods, which I before promised <lb/>
            thee that I would show thee. Then said I: Even foolish men <lb/>
            know that full goods exist, though they may not be where <lb/>
            they suppose them. Thou promisedst me, a little while ago, <lb/>
            that thou wouldest teach me them. But of this I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded, that that is the true and the perfect happiness, which <lb/>
            can give to all its followers permanent wealth, and everlasting <lb/>
            power, and perpetual dignity, and eternal glory, and full <lb/>
            abundance. And moreover, I say that is the true happiness <lb/>
            which can fully bestow any of these five; because in every <lb/>
            one they all are. I say these words to thee, because I am <lb/>
            desirous that thou shouldest know that the doctrine is well <lb/>
            fixed in my mind: so fixed, that no man can draw me aside <lb/>
            from it. Then said he: 0, child, how happy art thou that <lb/>
            thou hast so learned it! But I am desirous that we should <lb/>
            still inquire after that which is deficient to thee. Then said <lb/>
            I: What is that, then ? Then said he: Dost thou think that <lb/>
            any of these present goods can give thee full happiness ? <lb/>
            Then answered I, and said: I know nothing in this present <lb/>
            life that can give such. Then said he: These present goods <lb/>
            are images of the eternal good, not full good, because they <lb/>
            cannot give true good nor full good to their followers. Theu <lb/>
            said I: I am well enough assured of that which thou sayest. <lb/>
            Then said he: Now thou knowest what the false goods are, <lb/>
            and what the true goods are, I would that thou shouldest <lb/>
            learn how thou mayest come to the true goods. Then said <lb/>
            I: Didst thou not formerly promise me that thou wouldest <lb/>
            teach it me ? and I am now very anxiously desirous to hear <lb/>
            it. Then said be: What ought we now to do, in order that <lb/>
            we may come to the true goods ? Shall we implore the divine <lb/>
            help as well in less as in greater things, as our philosopher <lb/>
            Plato said ? Then said I: I think that we ought to pray to <lb/>
            the Father of all things: for he who is unwilling to pray to <pb n="128"/>

              him, will not find him, nor moreover will he pursue the right <lb/>
              way towards him. Then said he: Very rightly thou sayest; <lb/>
              and began then to sing, and thus said:</p>
          <p>§ IV. 0 Lord, how great and how wonderful thou art! <lb/>
            Thou who all thy creatures visible and also invisible wonder­ <lb/>
            fully hast created, and rationally governest them! Thou, who <lb/>
            times, from the beginning of the middle-earth to the end, <lb/>
            settest in order, so that they both depart and return ! Thou, <lb/>
            who all moving creatures according to thy will stirrest, and <lb/>
            thou thyself always fixed and unchangeable remainest! For <lb/>
            none is mightier than thou, nor anylike thee! No necessity <lb/>
            taught thee to make that which thou hast made, but by thine <lb/>
            own will and by thine own power thou madest all things, <lb/>
            though thou didst need none of them. Very wonderful is <lb/>
            the nature of thy good, for it is all one, thou and thy good­ <lb/>
            ness. Good is not come to thee from without, but it is thine <lb/>
            own. But all that we have of good in this world is come to <lb/>
            us from without, that is, from thee! Thou hast no envy to <lb/>
            anything, because no one is more skilful than thou, nor any <lb/>
            like thee; for thou, by thy sole counsel, hast designed and <lb/>
            wrought all good! No man set thee an example, for no one <lb/>
            was before thee, who anything or nothing might make. But <lb/>
            thou hast made all things very good, and very fair, and thou <lb/>
            thyself art the highest good and the fairest. As thou thyself <lb/>
            didst design, so hast thou made this middle-earth, and dost <lb/>
            govern it as thou wilt; and thou thyself dost distribute all <lb/>
            good as thou wilt. And thou hast made all creatures like to <lb/>
            each other, and also in some respects unlike. Though thou <lb/>
            hast named all these creatures separately with one name, <lb/>
            thou hast named them all together, and called them World. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, that one name thou hast divided into four <lb/>
            elements. One of them is earth ; another, water; the third, <lb/>
            air; the fourth, fire. To every one of them thou hast set its <lb/>
            own separate place, and yet every one is with other classed, <lb/>
            and peaceably bound by thy commandment; so that no one <lb/>
            of them should pass over another's boundary, and the cold <lb/>
            suffer by the heat, and the wet by the dry. The nature of <lb/>
            earth and of water is cold; the earth is dry and' cold, and the <lb/>
            water wet and cold. But the air is distinguished, that it is <lb/>
            either cold, or wet, or warm. It is no wonder; because it is <lb/>
            created in the midst, between the dry and the cold earth and <lb/>
            the hot fire. The fire is uppermost over all these worldly <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

              creatures. Wonderful is thy counsel, which thou hast in <lb/>
              both respects accomplished: both hast bounded the creatures <lb/>
              between themselves, and also hast intermixed them: the dry <lb/>
              and the cold earth under the cold and the wet water, that the <lb/>
              soft and flowing water may have a floor on the firm earth, be­ <lb/>
              cause it cannot of itself stand ; but the earth holds it, and in <lb/>
              some measure imbibes, and by that moistening it becomes <lb/>
              wet, so that it grows, and blossoms, and produces fruits. <lb/>
              For if the water moistened it not, then would it become dry, <lb/>
              and would be driven by the wind like dust or ashes. Nor <lb/>
              could anything living enjoy the earth, or the water, or dwell <lb/>
              in either for cold, if thou didst not a little mix them with fire. <lb/>
              With wonderful skill thou hast caused it, that the fire burns <lb/>
              not the water and the earth, when it is mixed with both: <lb/>
              nor, again, the water and the earth entirely extinguish the <lb/>
              fire. The water's own region is on the earth, and also in the <lb/>
              air, and again above the sky. But the fire's own place is <lb/>
              above all visible worldly creatures; and though it is mixed <lb/>
              with all elements, nevertheless it cannot altogether overcome <lb/>
              any one of the elements, because it has not leave from the <lb/>
              Almighty. The earth, then, is heavier and thicker than other <lb/>
              elements, because it is lower than any other creature except <lb/>
              the sky: for the sky extends itself every day outwardly, and <lb/>
              though it approaches it nowhere, it is in every place equally <lb/>
              nigh to it, both above and beneath. Every one of the ele­ <lb/>
              ments which we formerly spoke about has its own region <lb/>
              apart, and yet is every one mixed with other; because no <lb/>
              one of the elements can exist without another, though it be <lb/>
              imperceptible in the other. Thus water and earth are very <lb/>
              difficult to be seen or to be perceived by ignorant men in fire, <lb/>
              and yet they are nevertheless mixed therewith. So is there <lb/>
              also fire in stones and in water; very difficult to be seen, but <lb/>
              it is nevertheless there. Thou hast bound the fire with very <lb/>
              indissoluble chains, that it may not come to its own region, <lb/>
              that is, to the greatest fire which is over us; lest it should <lb/>
              forsake the earth, and all other creatures should perish by <lb/>
              excessive cold, if it should altogether depart. Thou hast <lb/>
              established earth very wonderfully and firmly, so that it <lb/>
              does not incline on any side, nor stand on any earthly thing, <lb/>
              nor does anything earthly hold it that it may not sink; and <lb/>
              it is not easier for it to fall downwards than upwards. Thou <lb/>

              there is not less of the soul in the least finger than in all <lb/>
              the body. I said that the soul was threefold, because philo­ <lb/>
              sophers say that she has three natures. One of these natures <lb/>
              is, that she has the power of willing; the second is, that she is <lb/>
              subject to anger; the third, that she is rational. Two of these <lb/>
              natures beasts have, the same as men. One of them is will, <lb/>
              the other is anger. But man alone has reason, and not any <lb/>
              other creature. Therefore he has excelled all earthly creatures <lb/>
              by thought and by understanding. For reason should govern <lb/>
              both will and anger, because it is the peculiar faculty of the <lb/>
              soul. So hast thou created the soul that she should always <lb/>
              turn upon herself, as all this sky turns, or as a wheel turns <lb/>
              round, inquiring about her maker, or about herself, or about <lb/>
              these earthly creatures. When she inquires about her maker, <lb/>
              then is she above herself. But when she inquires about her­ <lb/>
              self, then is she in herself. And she is beneath herself when <lb/>
              she loves these earthly things and admires them. Thou, 0 <lb/>
              Lord, hast given to souls a dwelling in the heavens, and ou <lb/>
              them thou bestowest worthy gifts, to every one according to <lb/>
              its deserving: and causest them to shine very bright, and yet <lb/>
              with very varied brightness, some brighter, some less bright, <lb/>
              even as the stars, every one according to its desert. Thou, <lb/>
              O Lord, bringest together the heavenly souls and the earthly <lb/>
              bodies, and unitest them in this world. As they from thee <lb/>
              came hither, so shall they also to thee hence tend. Thou <lb/>
              filledest this earth with various kinds of animals, and after­ <lb/>
              wards didst sow it with various seed of trees and plants! <lb/>
              Grant now, 0 Lord, to our minds, that they may ascend to <lb/>
              thee through these difficulties of this world, and from these <lb/>
              occupations come to thee; and that with the open eyes of <lb/>
              our mind we may see the noble fountain of all goods. That <lb/>
              art thou ! Grant to us, then, sound eyes of our mind, that <lb/>
              we may fix them on thee; and drive away the mist that now <lb/>
              hangs before the eyes of our mind, and enlighten the eyes <lb/>
              with thy light: for thou art the brightness of the true light, <lb/>
              and thou art the quiet rest of the just, and thou wilt cause <lb/>
              that they shall see thee. Thou art of all things the beginning <lb/>
              and the end. Thou supportest all things without labour. Thou <lb/>
              art both the way and the guide, and the place that the way <lb/>
              leads to. All men tend to thee!</p><pb n="134"/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay and this prayer, <lb/>
            then began he again to speak, and thus said: I think that it <lb/>
            is now, in the first place, necessary that I show thee where <lb/>
            the highest good is, now I have already shown thee what it <lb/>
            was; or which was the perfect good, and which the imperfect. <lb/>
            But one thing I would first ask thee: Whether thou thinkest <lb/>
            that anything in this world is so good that it can give thee <lb/>
            full happiness ? For this reason I ask thee, because I am <lb/>
            unwilling that any false resemblance should impose upon us <lb/>
            for the true happiness. For no man can deny that some <lb/>
            good is the highest: as it were a great and deep fountain, <lb/>
            and from which many brooks and rivers flow. We therefore <lb/>
            say concerning any good, that it is not full good, because <lb/>
            there is in it a deficiency of something; and yet it is not <lb/>
            entirely without good, for everything comes to naught if it <lb/>
            has no good in it. Hence thou mayest learn that from the <lb/>
            greatest good come the less goods; not from the less the <lb/>
            greatest, any more than the river may become a fountain. <lb/>
            But the fountain may become a river, and yet the river comes <lb/>
            again to the fountain! So every good comes from God, and <lb/>
            again to him, and he is the full and perfect good, which is <lb/>
            not deficient in any will. Now thou msyest clearly under. <lb/>
            stand that this is God himself. Why canst thou not imagine, <lb/>
            that if nothing were full, then would nothing be deficient; <lb/>
            and if nothing were deficient, then would nothing be full ? <lb/>
            Therefore is anything full, because some is deficient; and <lb/>
            therefore is anything deficient, because some is full. Every­ <lb/>
            thing is fullest in its proper station. Why canst thou not <lb/>
            then conceive, that if in any of these earthly goods there is a <lb/>
            deficiency of any will and of any good, then is some good full <lb/>
            of every will, and is deficient in no good ? Then answered <lb/>
            I, and said: Very rightly and very rationally thou bast over­ <lb/>
            come and convinced me, so that I cannot contradict, or even <lb/>
            imagine anything contrary to it, but that it is all even as thou <lb/>
            sayest.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said Wisdom: Now I would that thou shoulder <lb/>
            consider studiously until thou discover where the full happi- <pb n="136"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              ness is. Dost thou not then know that all mankind is unani­ <lb/>
              mously consenting that God is the origin of all goods, and the <lb/>
              ruler of all creatures ? He is the highest good; nor do any <lb/>
              men doubt it, for they know nothing better, nor indeed any­ <lb/>
              thing equally good. Therefore every argument informs us, <lb/>
              and all men confess the same, that God is the highest good: <lb/>
              for they show that all good is in him. For if it were not so, <lb/>
              then he would not be that which he is called. Or if any­ <lb/>
              thing were more ancient or more excellent, then would that <lb/>
              be better than he. But because nothing was more ancient <lb/>
              than he, nor more excellent than be, nor more precious than <lb/>
              he, therefore is he the origin, and the source, aud the roof of <lb/>
              all goods. It is sufficiently evident that the perfect good was <lb/>
              before the imperfect. This then is to be acknowledged, that <lb/>
              the highest good is fullest of every good, that we may not <lb/>
              speak longer about it than we need. The same God is, as <lb/>
              we before said, the highest good and the best happiness; <lb/>
              since it is evidently kuown that the best felicities are in <lb/>
              no other things but in God. Then said I: I am convinced <lb/>
              of it.</p>
          <p>§ III. Then said be: I beseech thee that thou wouldest. <lb/>
            rationally understand this, that God is full of all perfection, <lb/>
            and of all good, and of all happiness. Then said I : I cannot; <lb/>
            fully comprehend why thou again sayest the same thing which <lb/>
            thou saidst before. Then said he: For this reason I say it to <lb/>
            thee again, because I am unwilling that thou shouldest sup­ <lb/>
            pose that God, who is the father and origin of all creatures ; <lb/>
            that the supreme goodness of him, of which he is full, came <lb/>
            to him from without. Nor moreover am I willing that thou. <lb/>
            shouldest suppose that his good and his happiness were one <lb/>
            thing, and himself another. For if thou thinkest that the <lb/>
            good which he has, came to him from without, then would <lb/>
            that thing from which it came to him be better than he, if it <lb/>
            were so. But it is very foolish, and a very great sin, that any <lb/>
            one should thus think of God ; or moreover think that any­ <lb/>
            thing was before him, or better than he, or like him. But we <lb/>
            must be convinced that God is of all things the best. If thou <lb/>
            then believest that God is like as it is among men, that one <lb/>
            thing is the man, that is soul and body, and another is his <lb/>
            goodness, which God joins and afterwards holds together and <pb n="138"/>

              regulates; if thou believest that it is so with God, then must <lb/>
              thou of necessity believe that some power is greater than his, <lb/>
              which may join together what belongs to him, as he does what <lb/>
              appertains to us. Besides, whatsoever is distinct from another <lb/>
              thing is one, and the thing another, though they be together, <lb/>
              If therefore anything is distinct from the highest good, then <lb/>
              that is not the highest good. It is, however, great sin to <lb/>
              imagine concerning God that any good can be external to <lb/>
              him, or any separated from him; because nothing is better <lb/>
              than he, or equally good with him. What thing can be better <lb/>
              than its creator ? Therefore I say with right reason, that <lb/>
              that is the highest good in its own nature, which is the origin <lb/>
              of all things. Then said I: Now thou hast very rightly in­ <lb/>
              structed me. Then said he: But then I before said, that the <lb/>
              highest good and the highest happiness were one. Then said <lb/>
              I: So it is. Then said he: What shall we then say ? What <lb/>
              else is that but God ? Then said I: I cannot deny this, for <lb/>
              I was before convinced of it.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Then said he: Perhaps tbou mayest more clearly <lb/>
            apprehend it, if I still give thee some instance. If therefore <lb/>
            two goods existed, which might not be together, and were <lb/>
            nevertheless both good, would it not be then sufficiently <lb/>
            evident that neither of them was the other ? Therefore the <lb/>
            full good cannot be divided. How can it be both full and <lb/>
            deficient? Hence we say that the full happiness and good, <lb/>
            are one good, and that is the highest. They can never be <lb/>
            separated. Must we not then necessarily be convinced that <lb/>
            the highest happiness and the supreme divinity are one ? <lb/>
            Then said I: Nothing is more true than that. We are not <lb/>
            able to discover anything better than God. Then said he: <lb/>
            But I would still prepare thee by some example, so that thou <lb/>
            mayest not find any way of escaping; as the manner of philo­ <lb/>
            sophers is, that they always wish to declare something new <lb/>
            and strange, that they may thereby awaken the mind of the <lb/>
            hearers.</p>
          <p>§ V. Have we not already proved that happiness and the <lb/>
            divinity were one ? He then who has happiness, has both in <lb/>
            having either. Is he not, then, full happy ? Knowest thou not, <lb/>
            moreover, what we say, that any one is wise who has wisdom ; <lb/>
            and righteous, who has righteousness ? So we also say that <pb n="140"/>

              <note type="margin"> § VI. </note> <lb/>
              that is God which has goodness and happiness: and every <lb/>
              happy man is a God. And yet there is one God who is the <lb/>
              stem and foundation of all goods, and from whom cometh all <lb/>
              good, and again they tend to him, and he governs all. He is, <lb/>
              moreover, the origin and the foundation of all goods which <lb/>
              proceed from him. Thus all the stars are lighted and made <lb/>
              bright by the sun: some, however, more brightly, some less <lb/>
              brightly. So also the moou gives light in such measure as <lb/>
              the sun shines upon him. When she shines upon him all <lb/>
              over, then is he all bright. When I heard this speech, I was <lb/>
              astonished and greatly afraid, and said: This, indeed, is a <lb/>
              wonderful and delightful and rational argument which thou <lb/>
              now usest. Then said he: Nothing is more delightful or <lb/>
              more certain than the thing which this argument is about, <lb/>
              and which we will now speak of, for methinks it good that <lb/>
              we mix it with the preceding. Then said I: Oh! what is <lb/>
              that ?</p>
          <p>§ VI. Then said he: Thou knowest that I before said to <lb/>
            thee that the true happiness was good; and that from the <lb/>
            true happiness come all the other goods, which we have <lb/>
            before spoken about, and again return to it. Thus, from the <lb/>
            sea the water enters into the earth, and then becomes fresh. <lb/>
            It then comes up at the fountain, then runs to the brook, then <lb/>
            to the river, then along the river till it returns to the sea. But <lb/>
            I would now ask thee how thou hast understood this discourse. <lb/>
            Whetherthou thinkest that the five goods, which we have often <lb/>
            before mentioned, that is, power, and dignity, and renown, <lb/>
            and abundance, and pleasure; I would know whether thou <lb/>
            thoughtest that these goods were members of the true happi­ <lb/>
            ness, as there are many members in one man, and yet all <lb/>
            belong to one body; or whether thou though test that any <lb/>
            one of the five goods constituted the true happiness, and then <lb/>
            the four other goods were its good, as soul and body consti­ <lb/>
            tute one man, and the one man has many members, and <lb/>
            nevertheless to these two, that is, to the soul and to the body, <lb/>
            belong all these goods of the man, both ghostly and bodily. <lb/>
            This then is the good of the body, that a man be fair, and <lb/>
            strong, and tall, and broad, and many other goods in addition <lb/>
            to these; and yet it is not the body itself, because if that <lb/>
            loses any of these goods, it is nevertheless what it was be­ <lb/>
            fore. Then the good of the soul is prudence, and temperance, <lb/>
            and patience, and justice, and wisdom, and manv like virtues ; <pb n="142"/>

              and nevertheless the soul is one thing , and its virtues are <lb/>
              another. Then said I: I wish that thou wouldest speak to <lb/>
              me more plainly about the other goods which appertain to <lb/>
              the true happiness. Then said he: Did I not say to thee <lb/>
              before that the happiness was good ? Tes, said I, thou saidst <lb/>
              that it was the supreme good. Then said be : Art thou now <lb/>
              convinced that power, and dignity, aud renown, aud abund­ <lb/>
              auce, and pleasure, and happiness, and the supreme good, <lb/>
              that these are all one, and that one is good ? Then said I: <lb/>
              How shall I deny this? Then said he: Which dost thou <lb/>
              then consider these things to be; members of the true feli­ <lb/>
              cities, or the felicity itself? Then said I: I now perceive <lb/>
              what thou wouldest know. But I rather wish that thou <lb/>
              wouldest inform me somewhile concerning it, than that thou <lb/>
              shouldest inquire of me. Then said he: Canst thou not <lb/>
              imagine that if the goods were members of the true happi­ <lb/>
              ness, they would then be in some degree separated, as the <lb/>
              members of a man's body are iu some degree separated ? But <lb/>
              the nature of the members is, that they constitute one body, <lb/>
              and yet are not altogether alike. Then said I: Thou needest <lb/>
              not labour more about that. Thou hast clearly enough proved <lb/>
              to me that the goods are in no wise separated from the true <lb/>
              happiness. Then said he: Very rightly thou understandest <lb/>
              it, now thou understandest that the goods are all the same <lb/>
              that happiness is; and happiness is the highest good; and <lb/>
              the highest good is God; and God is ever one, inseparable. <lb/>
              Then said I: There is no doubt of this. But I wish that <lb/>
              thou wouldest now inform me of something unknown.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Then said lie: It is now evident that all the goods <lb/>
            which we have before spoken about, belong to the highest <lb/>
            good: and therefore meu seek sufficient good, when they <lb/>
            consider that which they seek the highest good. Therefore <lb/>
            they seek power, and also the other goods which we before <lb/>
            mentioned, because they think that it is the highest good. <lb/>
            Hence thou mayest know that the highest good is the roof of <lb/>
            all the other goods which men desire and covet. For no man <lb/>
            covets anything but good, or something of that which resem­ <lb/>
            bles good. They are desirous of many a thing which is not <unclear/> <lb/>
            fide good, but it has nevertheless something of resemblance <lb/>
            to good. Therefore we say, that the highest good is the <lb/>
            highest roof of all goods, and the hinge on which all good <lb/>
            turns, and also the cause on account of which man does all <pb n="144"/>

              <note type="margin"> § VIII. </note> <lb/>
              good. For this cause, men covet every one of the goods which <lb/>
              they covet. This thou mayest very plainly perceive hereby, <lb/>
              that no man desires the thing which he desires, nor that which <lb/>
              he does, but that which he thereby earns. For he thinks that <lb/>
              if he obtain his desire, and accomplish that which he has re­ <lb/>
              solved, that then he shall have full happiness. Dost thou not <lb/>
              know that no man rides because he lists to ride, but rides <lb/>
              because he by riding attains some earning ? Some by their <lb/>
              riding earn that they may be the healthier; some earn that <lb/>
              they may be the more active; some that they may come to <lb/>
              one of the places which they are then hastening to. Is it not <lb/>
              then sufficiently clear to thee, that men love nothing more <lb/>
              earnestly than they do the highest good ; because everything <lb/>
              which they desire or do, they do for this reason, that they <lb/>
              would have the highest good thereby ? But, some of them <lb/>
              err in thinking that they can have full good and full happi­ <lb/>
              ness in these present goods. But the full happiness and the <lb/>
              highest good is God himself, as we have often before said. <lb/>
              Then said I: I cannot imagine how I can deny this. Then <lb/>
              said he: Let us then relinquish this discourse, and be so far <lb/>
              secure; since thou hast so fully learned that God is ever in­ <lb/>
              separable and full good, and that his good and his happiness <lb/>
              came to him from nowhere without, but was always in him­ <lb/>
              self, and now is, and for ever shall be.</p>
          <p>§ VIII. When Wisdom had ended this discourse, then <lb/>
            began he again to sing, and thus said: Well, 0 men, well! <lb/>
            Let every one who is free, aspire to this good, and to these <lb/>
            felicities. And whosoever is now bound with the vain love <lb/>
            of this middle-earth, let him seek freedom for himself, that <lb/>
            he may arrive at these felicities. For this is the only rest of <lb/>
            all our labours; the only haven which is ever calm after all <lb/>
            the storms and billows of our labours. This is the only asylum <lb/>
            and the only comfort of the wretched after the calamities of <lb/>
            this present life. But golden stones and silver, and gems of <lb/>
            every kind, and all this present wealth, neither enlighten the <lb/>
            eyes of the mind, nor improve their sharpness for the contem­ <lb/>
            plation of the true happiness; but rather blind the eyes of the <lb/>
            mind than sharpen them. For all the things which give plea­ <lb/>
            sure here in this present life are earthly, and are therefore <lb/>
            fleeting. But the wonderful brightness which brightens all <lb/>
            things, and governs all, wills not that souls should perish, <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>

              but wills to enlighten them. If, then, any man may behold <lb/>
              the brightness of the heavenly light with the clear eyes of <lb/>
              his mind, then will he say that the brightness of the sun­ <lb/>
              shine is darkness to be compared with the eternal brightness <lb/>
              of God.</p>
          <p>§ IX. When Wisdom had sung this lay, then said I: I am <lb/>
            convinced of that which thou sayest, for thou hast proved it <lb/>
            by rational discourse. Then said he: With how much money <lb/>
            wouldest thou have bought, that thou mightest know what <lb/>
            the true good was, and of what kind it was ? Then said I: <lb/>
            I would rejoice with excessive gladness, and I would buy with <lb/>
            countless money, that I might see it. Then said he: I will <lb/>
            then teach it thee. But this one thing I enjoin thee; that <lb/>
            thou, on account of this instruction, forget not what I before <lb/>
            taught thee. Then said I: No, I will not forget it. Then <lb/>
            said he: Did we not before say to thee, that this present life <lb/>
            which we here desire, was not the highest good; because it <lb/>
            was varied, and so manifoldly divided, that no man can have <lb/>
            it all, so that there be not to him a lack of something ? I <lb/>
            then taught thee that the highest good was there where the <lb/>
            goods are all collected, as if they were melted into one mass. <lb/>
            Then is there full good when the goods which we before spoke <lb/>
            of are all collected into one good. Then is there a deficiency <lb/>
            of no good. Then the goods are all in unity, and the unity <lb/>
            is eternal! If they were not eternal, then would they not be <lb/>
            so anxiously to be desired. Then said I: That is proved, nor <lb/>
            can I doubt it. Then said he: I have formerly proved to <lb/>
            thee, that that was not full good, which was not all together: <lb/>
            because that is full good which is all together undivided. <lb/>
            Then said I: So methinks. Then said he: Dost thou think <lb/>
            that all the things which are good in this world, are therefore <lb/>
            good, because they have something of good in them ? Then <lb/>
            said I: What else can I think ; is it not so ? Then said he: <lb/>
            Thou must, however, believe that unity and goodness are one <lb/>
            thing. Then said I: I cannot deny this. Then said he: <lb/>
            Canst thou not perceive, that everything is able to exist both <lb/>
            in this world and in the future, so long as it remains un­ <lb/>
            separated, but afterwards it is not altogether as it before <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>

              was ? Then said T: Say that to me more plainly; I cannot <lb/>
              fully understand after what thou art inquiring. Then said <lb/>
              he: Dost thou know what man is F Then said I: I know <lb/>
              that he is soul and body. Then said lie: But thou knowest <lb/>
              that it is man, while the soul and the body are unseparated. <lb/>
              It is not man after they are separated. So also the body is <lb/>
              body while it has all its members; but if it lose any member, <lb/>
              then it is not all as it before was. The same thou mightest <lb/>
              conceive with respect to everything: that nothing is such as <lb/>
              it was after it begins to decay. Then said I: Now I know <lb/>
              it. Then said he: Dost thou think that there is any creature <lb/>
              which of its will desires not always to be, but of its own will <lb/>
              desires to perish ?</p>
          <p>§ X. Then said I: I cannot find any living thing which <lb/>
            knows what it wills, or what it wills not, which uncompelled. <lb/>
            chooses to perish. For everything, of such as I deem living, <lb/>
            desires to be bale and to live. But I know not concerning <lb/>
            trees and concerning herbs, and concerning such creatures as <lb/>
            have no souls. Then smiled he, and said: Thou needest not <lb/>
            doubt concerning these creatures any more than about the <lb/>
            others. Canst thou not see that every herb and every tree <lb/>
            will grow best in that land which suits it best, and is natural <lb/>
            and habitual to it; and where it perceives that it may soonest <lb/>
            grow, and latest fall to decay ? Of some herbs or of some <lb/>
            wood, the native soil is on bills, of some in marshes, of some <lb/>
            on moors, of some on rocks, of some on bare sands. Take, <lb/>
            therefore, tree or herb, whichsoever thou wilt, from the place <lb/>
            which is its native soil and country to grow in, and set it in <lb/>
            a place unnatural to it: then will it not grow there at all, but <lb/>
            will wither. For the nature of every land is that it should <lb/>
            nourish herbs suitable to it, and suitable wood. And so it <lb/>
            does: protecting and supporting them very carefully, as long <lb/>
            as it is their nature that they should grow. What thinkest <lb/>
            thou ? Why should every seed grow in the earth, and turn <lb/>
            to germs and to roots in the earth, except because they en­ <lb/>
            deavour that the trunk and the head may the more firmly and <lb/>
            the longer stand ? Why canst thou not understand, though <lb/>
            thou art not able to see it, that all that part of the tree which <pb n="150"/>

              grows in twelve months, begins from the roots and so grows <lb/>
              upwards into the trunk, and afterwards along the pith, and <lb/>
              along the bark to the head; and afterwards through the <lb/>
              boughs, until it springs out in leaves, and in blossoms, and in <lb/>
              fruits ? Why canst thou not understand, that every living <lb/>
              thing is inwardly softest, and unbroken hardest ? Moreover, <lb/>
              thou mayest observe how trees are outwardly clothed and <lb/>
              covered with bark against the winter, and against the stark <lb/>
              storms; and also against the heat of the sun in summer. <lb/>
              Who can refrain from admiring such works of our Creator, <lb/>
              and still more the Creator ? And though we admire him, <lb/>
              which of us can declare worthily our Creator's will and <lb/>
              power ? How his creatures grow and again decay, when the <lb/>
              time thereof comes; and from their seed become again re­ <lb/>
              newed, as if they were then newly created ? What they then <lb/>
              again are, and also in some measure alone are, such they ever <lb/>
              shall be, because they are every year newly created.</p>
          <p>§ XI. Dost thou now understand that even inanimate crea­ <lb/>
            tures would desire to exist for ever, the same as men, if they <lb/>
            could ? Dost thou understand why fire tends upwards, and <lb/>
            earth downwards ? Wherefore is it, but because God made <lb/>
            the station of one up, and of the other down ? For every <lb/>
            creature chiefly tends thither where its station and its health <lb/>
            especially is, and flies from what is contrary, and disagreeing, <lb/>
            and unlike to it. Stones, because they are .of immovable and <lb/>
            hard nature, are difficult to divide, and also with difficulty <lb/>
            come together, when they are divided. If thou cleavest a <lb/>
            stone, it never becomes united together as it before was. But <lb/>
            water and air are of a somewhat softer nature. They are very <lb/>
            easy to separate, but they are again soon together. The fire, <lb/>
            indeed, cannot ever be divided. I just now said that nothing <lb/>
            of its own will would perish; but I am speaking more about <lb/>
            the nature than about the will, for these sometimes are dif­ <lb/>
            ferently inclined. Thou mayest know by many things that <lb/>
            nature is very great. It is through mighty'nature that to <lb/>
            our body comes all its strength from the food which we eat, <lb/>
            and yet the food goes out through the body. But neverthe- <pb n="152"/>

              less its savour and its virtue enters every vein, even as any <lb/>
              one sifts meal: the meal runs through every hole, and the <lb/>
              bran becomes separated. So also our spirit is very widely <lb/>
              wandering, without our will, and without our power, by <lb/>
              reason of its nature, not by reason of its will, that happens <lb/>
              when we sleep. But cattle, and also other creatures, seek <lb/>
              that which they desire, more from nature than from will. It <lb/>
              is unnatural to everything that it should desire danger or <lb/>
              death, but still many a thing is so far compelled that it de­ <lb/>
              sires both of them; because the will is then stronger than <lb/>
              the nature. Sometimes the will is more powerful than the <lb/>
              nature, sometimes the nature overcomes the will. Thus lust <lb/>
              does. It is natural to all meu, and yet its nature is some­ <lb/>
              times denied to it through the man's will. All the desire of <lb/>
              cohabitation is from nature, not from will.</p>
          <p>§ XII. By this thou mayest plainly know that the Maker <lb/>
            of all things has imparted one desire and one nature to all <lb/>
            his creatures, that is, that they would exist for ever. It is <lb/>
            natural to everything that it should desire to exist for ever; <lb/>
            so far as it can and may retain its nature. Thou needest <lb/>
            Dot doubt concerning that which thou before didst question, <lb/>
            that is, concerning the creatures which have no souls. Every <lb/>
            one of the creatures which have souls, as well as those which <lb/>
            have not, desires always to exist. Then said I: Now I un­ <lb/>
            derstand that about which I before doubted, that is, that <lb/>
            every creature is desirous always to exist; which is very clear <lb/>
            from the propagation of them. Then said he: Dost thou then <lb/>
            understand that every one of the things which perceives itself <lb/>
            to exist, perceives itself to be together, whole and undivided; <lb/>
            because if it be divided, then it is not whole ? Then said I: <lb/>
            That is true. Then said he: All things, however, have one <lb/>
            will, that is, that they would exist for ever. Through this one <lb/>
            will they desire the one good which for ever exists, that is <lb/>
            God! Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said he: <lb/>
            Thou mayest then plainly perceive that it is on account of a <lb/>
            thing, good in itself, that all creatures and all things desire <pb n="154"/>

              to possess it. Then said I: No man can more truly say; for <lb/>
              I know that all creatures would flow away like water, and <lb/>
              keep no peace nor any order, but very confusedly dissolve, <lb/>
              and come to naught, as we before said in this same book, if <lb/>
              they had not one God who guided, and directed, and governed <lb/>
              them all! But now, since we know that there is one governor <lb/>
              of all things, we must needs be convinced, whether we will, <lb/>
              or whether we will not, that he is the highest roof of all <lb/>
              goods. Then he smiled upon me, and said: 0, my child, <lb/>
              how truly happy art thou, and how truly glad am I, on ac­ <lb/>
              count of thine understanding! Thou hast very nearly dis­ <lb/>
              covered the truth ; and the same that thou before saidest thou <lb/>
              couldest not understand, of that thou hast now been con­ <lb/>
              vinced. Then said I: What was that, which I before said I <lb/>
              knew not? Then said he: Thou saidst that thou knewest <lb/>
              not the end of every creature. But know now, that that is <lb/>
              the end of every creature, which thou thyself hast already <lb/>
              named, that is, good. To this all creatures tend. They have <lb/>
              no good besides this to seek, nor can they discover anything <lb/>
              either above or beyond it!</p>

          <p>§ I. WHEN be had ended this discourse, then began he <lb/>
            again to sing, and thus said: Whosoever is desirous to search <lb/>
            deeply with inward mind after truth, and is unwilling that <lb/>
            any man, or anything should mislead him, let him begin to <lb/>
            seek within himself that which he before sought around him ; <lb/>
            and let him dismiss vain anxieties as he best may, and resort <lb/>
            to this alone, and say to his own mind that it may find within <lb/>
            itself all the goods which it seeks externally. Then may he <lb/>
            very soon discover all the evil and vanity which he before had <lb/>
            in his mind, as plainly as thou canst behold the sun. And <lb/>
            thou wilt know thine own mind, that it is far brighter and <lb/>
            lighter than the sun. For no heaviness of the body, or any <lb/>
            fault, can wholly take away from his mind wisdom, so that be <lb/>
            have not some portion of it in his mind; though the sluggish­ <lb/>
            ness of the body and its imperfections often prepossess the <lb/>
            mind with forgetfulness, and affright it with the mist of error, <pb n="156"/>

              soul, while the soul and the body are united. That grain <lb/>
              must be excited by inquiry and by instruction if it shall <lb/>
              grow. How then can any man wisely and rationally inquire, <lb/>
              if he has no particle of wisdom in him ? No one is so en­ <lb/>
              tirely destitute of wisdom, that he knows no right answer <lb/>
              when any one inquires. Therefore it is a very true saying <lb/>
              that Plato the philosopher said. He said: Whosoever is <lb/>
              forgetful of wisdom, let him have recourse to his mind; then <lb/>
              will he there find the wisdom concealed by the heaviness of <lb/>
              the body, and by the trouble and occupation of his mind.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said I: I am convinced that it was a true <lb/>
            saying which Plato said. But hast thou not again twice re­ <lb/>
            minded me of the same argument ? First thou saidst that I <lb/>
            had forgotten the natural good which I had within myself, <lb/>
            through the heaviness of the body. At another time thou <lb/>
            saidst to me, that thou hadst discovered that it seemed to <lb/>
            myself that I had altogether lost the natural good which I <lb/>
            should have within myself, through the immoderate uneasi­ <lb/>
            ness which I had on account of lost wealth. Then said he: <lb/>
            Since thou now rememberest the words which I said to thee <lb/>
            in the first book, thou mayest by those words clearly enough <lb/>
            call to mind what thou before saidst thou wert ignorant of. <lb/>
            Then said I: What was that ? What did I say that I was <lb/>
            ignorant of? Then said he: Thou saidst in that same book <lb/>
            that thou knewest that God governed this middle-earth ; but <lb/>
            thou saidst that thou couldest not discover in what manner <lb/>
            he governed it, or how he governed it. Then said I: I very <lb/>
            well remember mine own folly, and I have already acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged it to thee. But though I know it in some measure, I <lb/>
            would yet hear more concerning it from thee. Then said he: <lb/>
            Thou formerly hadst not auv doubt that God ruled and <lb/>
            governed all the middle-earth. Then said I: Nor do I now <lb/>
            doubt it, nor ever shall doubt it. I will, moreover, at once <lb/>
            tell thee through what I at first comprehended it. I per­ <lb/>
            ceived that this middle-earth was composed of very many and <lb/>
            various things, and very firmly cemented and joined together. <lb/>
            If these, such contrary creatures, had not been united and re­ <lb/>
            duced to order by an all-powerful Being, then they would <pb n="158"/>

              never have been formed nor joined together: and if he had <lb/>
              not bound them with his indissoluble chains, then would they <lb/>
              all be dissolved. Neither would their station and their course <lb/>
              be formed so wisely, and so orderly and so suitably in their <lb/>
              places, and in their times, if one unchangeable God did not <lb/>
              exist. Good, therefore, directed whatever is. This I call <lb/>
              God, as all creatures call it.­</p>
          <p>§ III. Then said he: Since thou hast so clearly understood <lb/>
            this, I need not now greatly labour in order that I may in­ <lb/>
            struct thee further concerning good; for thou art now almost <lb/>
            come into the city of the true happiness, which thou some <lb/>
            time ago couldest not discover. But we must nevertheless <lb/>
            consider what we have already proposed. Then said I: What <lb/>
            is that? Theu said he: Have we not before agreed that sum­ <lb/>
            ciency was happiness, and happiness was God ? Then said <lb/>
            I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said lie: God needs no <lb/>
            other help besides himself to govern his creatures with, any <lb/>
            more than he before needed for the creation; for if be had <lb/>
            need of any help in anything, then would be himself not have <lb/>
            sufficiency. Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said <lb/>
            he : By himself he created all things, and governs all. Then <lb/>
            said I: I cannot deny it. Then said he: We have before <lb/>
            shown to thee that God was of himself good. Then said I: <lb/>
            I remember that thou so saidst. Then said he: Through <lb/>
            good, God created everything, for he governs by himself all <lb/>
            that which we before said was good: and he is the only stable <lb/>
            governor, and pilot, and rudder; for he directs and rules all <lb/>
            creatures as a good pilot steers a ship. Then said I: Now I <lb/>
            confess to thee that I have found a door, where I before saw <lb/>
            only a little chink, so that I scarcely could see a very small <lb/>
            ray of light in this darkness. And yet thou hadst before <lb/>
            pointed out to me the door, but I could not ever the more <lb/>
            discover it, though I groped for it whereabout I saw that <lb/>
            little light twinkle. I said to thee some time ago in this <lb/>
            same book, that I knew not what was the beginning of all <pb n="160"/>

              creatures. Thou didst then inform me that it was God. Then <lb/>
              again I knew not concerning the end, until thou hadst told <lb/>
              me that it was also God. Then said I to thee that I knew <lb/>
              not how he governed all these creatures, but thou bast now <lb/>
              explained it to me very clearly, as if thou hadst opened the <lb/>
              door which I before sought. Then answered he me, and <lb/>
              said: I know that I before reminded thee of this same argu­ <lb/>
              ment, and now methinks that thou underatandest, as the <lb/>
              later, so the better, concerning the truth. But I would yet <lb/>
              show thee some example as manifest as that was which I be­ <lb/>
              fore mentioned to thee. Then said I: What is that ?</p>
          <p>§ IV. Then said be: No man can doubt this, that by the <lb/>
            proper consent of all creatures God reigns over them, and <lb/>
            bends their will conformably to his will. By this it is very <lb/>
            evident that God governs everything with the helm and with <lb/>
            the rudder of his goodness. For all creatures naturally of <lb/>
            their own will endeavour to come to good, as we have often <lb/>
            before said in this same book. Then said I: Indeed I cannot <lb/>
            doubt it, for God's power would not be entirely perfect if <lb/>
            creatures obeyed him against their will: and again the crea­ <lb/>
            tures would not be worthy of any thanks or any honour if <lb/>
            they unwillingly obeyed their lord. Then said he: There is <lb/>
            no creature which attempts to contend against its Maker's <lb/>
            will, if it desire to retain its nature. Then said I: There is <lb/>
            no creature which contends against its Maker's will except <lb/>
            foolish man, or, again, the rebellious angels. Then said he: <lb/>
            What thinkest thou? If any creature determined that it <lb/>
            would contend against his will, what could it do against one <lb/>
            so powerful as we have proved him ? Then said I: They <lb/>
            cannot do anything, though they will it. Then wondered he, <lb/>
            and said: There is no being which can or will oppose so high <lb/>
            a God. Then said I: I do not imagine that there is anything <lb/>
            which opposes, except what we before said. Then smiled he, <lb/>
            and said: Be assured that that is the highest good, which so <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>

              powerfully does everything, and has created all things, and so <lb/>
              widely over all extends, and so easily without any labour dis­ <lb/>
              poses everything. Then said I: I well liked what thou be­ <lb/>
              fore saidst, and this pleases me still better, but I am now <lb/>
              ashamed that I did not know it before. Then said he: I wot <lb/>
              thou hast often heard tell in old fables, that Jove, the son of <lb/>
              Saturn, should be the highest god above other gods; and he <lb/>
              should be the son of heaven, and should reign in the heavens; <lb/>
              and the giants should be the sons of earth, and should reign <lb/>
              over the earth; and then they should be as if they were sisters' <lb/>
              children, for he should be the son of heaven, and they of earth. <lb/>
              Then should it bethink the giants that he possessed their <lb/>
              kingdom. Then were they desirous to break the heaven under <lb/>
              him. Then should he send thunders, and lightnings, and <lb/>
              winds, and therewith overturn all their work, and slay them. <lb/>
              Such fictions they invented, and might easily have related <lb/>
              true history, if the fictions had not been more agreeable to <lb/>
              them, and yet very like to these. They might have related <lb/>
              what folly Nimrod the giant wrought. Nimrod was the son <lb/>
              of Cush; Cush was the son of Ham, and Ham of Noah. <lb/>
              Nimrod gave order to erect a tower in the field which is <lb/>
              called Shinar, and in the country which is called Dura, very <lb/>
              near to the city which men now call Babylon. They did it <lb/>
              for these reasons; that they wished to know how high it was <lb/>
              to the heaven, and how thick the heaven was, and how firm, <lb/>
              or what was over it. But it happened, as was fit, that the <lb/>
              divine power dispersed them before they could complete it, <lb/>
              and overthrew the tower, and slew many a one of them, and <lb/>
              divided their speech into seventy-two languages. So happens <lb/>
              it to every one of those who strive against the divine power. <lb/>
              No honour accrues to them thereby, but that is diminished <lb/>
              which they before had.</p>
          <p>§ V. But see now whether thou art desirous that we still <lb/>
            should seek after any argument further, now we have dis- <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>

              covered what we before sought. I think, however, if we <lb/>
              again strike our words together, there may spring out some <lb/>
              spark of truth of those things which we have not yet ob­ <lb/>
              served. Then said I: Do as thou wilt. Then said he: No <lb/>
              man doubts that God is so mighty that he is able to work <lb/>
              whatsoever he will. Then said I: No man doubts this, who <lb/>
              knows anything. Theu said he: Does any man think that <lb/>
              there is aught which God cannot do ? Then said I: I know <lb/>
              that there is nothing which he cannot do. Then said he: <lb/>
              Dost thou imagine that he can do any evil ? Then said I: <lb/>
              I know that he cannot. Then said he: Thou sayest truly, <lb/>
              for it is nothing. If evil were anything, then could God do <lb/>
              it. Therefore it is nothing. Then said I: Methinks thou <lb/>
              misleadest and deludest me, as any one does a child: thou <lb/>
              leadest me hither and thither in so thick a wood that I <lb/>
              cannot find the way out. For thou always, on account of <lb/>
              some small matter, betakest thyself to the same argument <lb/>
              that thou before wert speaking of, and again leavest that <lb/>
              before thou bast ended it, and begin nest a fresh one. There­ <lb/>
              fore I know not what thou wouldest. Methinks thou re­ <lb/>
              volvest about some wonderful and extraordinary argument <lb/>
              concerning the oneness of the divine nature. I remember <lb/>
              that thou formerly madest to me a wonderful speech, wherein <lb/>
              thou toldest me that it was all one, happiness and the highest <lb/>
              good: and saidst that the felicities were fixed in the highest <lb/>
              good, and the highest good was God himself, and he was full <lb/>
              of all happiness. And thou saidst that every happy man was <lb/>
              a God ! And again thou saidst, that God's goodness, and <lb/>
              his happiness, and himself, that this was all one, and was, <lb/>
              consequently, the highest good; and to this good all crea­ <lb/>
              tures which retain their nature tend, and are desirous to <lb/>
              come. And moreover thou saidst, that God governed all <lb/>
              his creatures with the rudder of his goodness; and also <lb/>
              saidst, that all creatures of their own will, uncompelled, <lb/>
              were subject to him. And now, at last, thou saidst that evil <lb/>
              was nothing! And all this thou hast proved for truth very <lb/>
              rationally, without any ambiguity. Then said he: Thou <pb n="166"/>

              saidst just now that I deceived thee; but methinks that <lb/>
              I have not deceived thee, but have stated to thee a very long <lb/>
              and wonderful argument, very rationally, concerning that <lb/>
              God to whom we some time ago prayed: and I still intend <lb/>
              to teach thee something unknown concerning the same God. <lb/>
              It is the nature of the divinity, to be able to exist unmixed <lb/>
              with other beings, without the help of other beings, in such <lb/>
              a way as nothing else is capable of. No other thing is able <lb/>
              to exist of itself. Thus formerly Parmenides the poet sung, <lb/>
              and said: The Almighty God is ruler of all things, and he <lb/>
              alone remains unchangeable, and governs all changeable <lb/>
              things. Therefore thou needest not greatly wonder, when <lb/>
              we are inquiring concerning what we have begun, whether <lb/>
              we may prove it with fewer words, or with more. Though <lb/>
              we should produce many and various examples and fables, <lb/>
              yet our mind always hangs on that which we are inquiring <lb/>
              after. We do not betake ourselves to examples and fables, <lb/>
              for love of fictitious speeches, but because we desire therewith <lb/>
              to point out the truth, and desire that it may be useful to the <lb/>
              hearers. I called to mind just now some instructions of the <lb/>
              wise Plato, how be said that the man who would relate <lb/>
              a fable, should not choose a fable unlike the subject of his <lb/>
              discourse. But hear now patiently what I shall further say, <lb/>
              though it formerly appeared to thee unprofitable, whether the <lb/>
              end may better please thee.</p>
          <p>§ VI. He began then to sing, and said: Happy is the man <lb/>
            who can behold the clear fountain of the highest good, and can <lb/>
            put away from himself the darkness of his mind! We will <lb/>
            now from old fables relate to thee a story. It happened for­ <lb/>
            merly that there was a harper in the country called Thrace, <lb/>
            which was in Greece. The harper was inconceivably good. <lb/>
            His name was Orpheus. He had a very excellent wife, who <lb/>
            was called Eurydice. Then began men to say concerning the <lb/>
            harper, that he could harp so that the wood moved, and the <pb n="168"/>

              stones stirred themselves at the sound, and wild beasts would <lb/>
              run thereto, and stand as if they were tame; so still, that <lb/>
              though men or hounds pursued them, they shunned them <lb/>
              not. Then said they, that the harper's wife should die, and <lb/>
              her soul should be led to hell. Then should the harper be­ <lb/>
              come so sorrowful that he could not remain among other <lb/>
              men, but frequented the wood, and sat on the mountains, <lb/>
              both day and night, weeping and harping, so that the woods <lb/>
              shook, and the rivers stood still, and no hart shunned any <lb/>
              lion nor hare any hound ; nor did cattle know any hatred, or <lb/>
              any fear of others, for the pleasure of the sound. Then it <lb/>
              seemed to the harper that nothing in this world pleased him. <lb/>
              Then thought he that he would seek the gods of hell, and <lb/>
              endeavour to allure them with his harp, and pray that they <lb/>
              would give him back his wife. When he came thither, then <lb/>
              should there come towards him the dog of hell, whose name <lb/>
              was Cerberus; he should have three heads, and began to wag <lb/>
              his tail, and play with him for his harping. Then was there <lb/>
              also a very horrible gatekeeper, whose name should be Charon. <lb/>
              He had also three heads, and he was very old. Then began <lb/>
              the harper to beseech him that he would protect him while <lb/>
              he was there, and bring him thence again safe. Then did he <lb/>
              promise that to him, because he was desirous of the unac­ <lb/>
              customed sound. Then went he farther, until he met the <lb/>
              fierce goddesses, whom the common people call Parcæ, of <lb/>
              whom they say, that they know no respect for any man, but <lb/>
              punish every man according to his deeds; and of whom they <lb/>
              say, that they control every man's fortune. Then began he <lb/>
              to implore their mercy. Then began they to weep with him. <lb/>
              Then went he farther, and all the inhabitants of hell ran <lb/>
              towards him, and led him to their king; and all began to <lb/>
              speak with bim, and to pray that which he prayed. And the <lb/>
              restless wheel which Ixion the king of the Lapithæ was <lb/>
              bound to for his guilt; that stood still for his harping. And <lb/>

              greedy, and whom that same vice of greediness followed <lb/>
              there; he became quiet. And the vulture should cease, so <lb/>
              that be tore not the liver of Tityus the king, which before <lb/>
              therewith tormented him. And all the punishments of the <lb/>
              inhabitants of hell were suspended, whilst he harped before <lb/>
              the king. When he long and long had harped, then spoke <lb/>
              the king of the inhabitants of hell, and said : Let us give the <lb/>
              man his wife, for he has earned her by his harping. He <lb/>
              then commanded him that he should well observe that he <lb/>
              never looked backwards after he departed thence, and said, <lb/>
              if be looked backwards, that he should lose the woman. But <lb/>
              men can with great difficulty, if at all, restrain love! Well­ <lb/>
              away ! what! Orpheus then led his wife with him till he <lb/>
              came to the boundary of light and darkness. Then went his <lb/>
              wife after him. When he came forth into the light, then <lb/>
              looked he behind his back towards the woman. Then was <lb/>
              she immediately lost to him. This fable teaches every man <lb/>
              who desires to fly the darkness of hell, and to come to the <lb/>
              light of the true good, that he look not about him to his old <lb/>
              vices, so that he practise them again as fully as be did before. <lb/>
              For whosoever with full will turns his mind to the vices, <lb/>
              which he had before forsaken, and practises them, and they <lb/>
              then fully please him, and he never thinks of forsaking them : <lb/>
              then loses he all his former good, unless he again amend <lb/>
              it! Here ends the third book of Boethius, and begins the <lb/>

          <p>§ I. WHEN Wisdom had very delightfully and wisely sung <lb/>
            this lay, then had I as yet some little remembrance in my <lb/>
            mind of the sorrow which I formerly had, and said: 0 <lb/>
            Wisdom, thou who art the messenger and forerunner of the <lb/>
            true light, how wonderful does that appear to me which thou <pb n="172"/>

              <note type="margin"> § I. </note> <lb/>
              declarest to me! Therefore I am persuaded that all which <lb/>
              thou before saidst to me, God said to me through thee! <lb/>
              And I also knew it before in some measure; but this sorrow <lb/>
              had distracted me, so that I had entirely forgotten it. And <lb/>
              this, besides, is the chief part of my unhappiness, that I <lb/>
              wonder why the good God should suffer any evil to exist: <lb/>
              or, if it yet must exist, and he wills to permit it, why he then <lb/>
              does not speedily punish it. Indeed, thou mayest thyself <lb/>
              know that this is to be wondered at. And also another <lb/>
              thing seems to me even a greater wonder, that is, that folly <lb/>
              and wickedness now reign over all the middle-earth, and <lb/>
              wisdom and also other virtues have no praise nor any honour <lb/>
              in this world, but he despised like dirt on a dunghill: and in <lb/>
              every land wicked men are now honoured, and the good have <lb/>
              manifold punishments. Who can forbear lamenting and won­ <lb/>
              dering at such a marvel, that ever such evil should take place <lb/>
              under the government of Almighty God, when we know that <lb/>
              be sees it, and wills all good. Then said he: If it is as thou <lb/>
              sayest, then is this more dreadful than any other prodigy, and <lb/>
              is endless wonder: most like to this, that in a king's court <lb/>
              gold and silver vessels should be despised, and men should <lb/>
              esteem wooden ones. It is not as thou supposest. But if <lb/>
              thou wilt call to mind all that which we have before said, <lb/>
              then, with the help of God, concerning whom we are now <lb/>
              speaking, thou wilt be able to understand that the good are <lb/>
              always powerful, and the wicked have no power; and that <lb/>
              virtues are never without praise or without reward, nor are <lb/>
              vices ever unpunished; but the good are always happy, and <lb/>
              the wicked unhappy. I can show thee very many examples <lb/>
              of this which may encourage thee, so that thou mayest not <lb/>
              know what thou any longer shouldest lament. But I will <lb/>
              now teach thee the way which will lead thee to the heavenly <lb/>
              city, whence thou formerly earnest, since thou knowest <lb/>
              through ray instruction what the true happiness is, and <lb/>
              where it is. But I must first give wings to thy mind, that <lb/>
              it may the sooner raise itself up, before it begins to fly on <lb/>
              high ; in order that it may, sound and untroubled, By to its <lb/>
              native country, and leave behind it every one of the troubles <pb n="174"/>

              which it now endures. Let it sit in my chariot, and be con­ <lb/>
              ducted in my path; I will be its guide.</p>
          <p>§ II. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began he <lb/>
            again to sing, and said: I have very swift wings, so that I can <lb/>
            fly over the high roof of heaven. But I must furnish thy <lb/>
            mind with wings, that thou mayest fly with me: then mayest <lb/>
            thou look down upon all these earthly things. When thou <lb/>
            art able to fly over the sky, thou mayest behold the clouds <lb/>
            under thee, and mayeat fly over the fire which is between the <lb/>
            aky and the air; and mayest go with the sun between the <lb/>
            stars, and then be in the sky, and afterwards near the cold <lb/>
            star which we call Saturn'a star. It is all icy. It wanders <lb/>
            above other stars, higher than any other heavenly body. <lb/>
            After thou art elevated far above it, then wilt thou be above <lb/>
            the swift sky, and wilt leave behind thee the highest heaven. <lb/>
            After this thou mayeat have thy portion of the true light; <lb/>
            There reigns one king who has power over all other kings. <lb/>
            He regulates the bridle and the rein of all the circuit of <lb/>
            heaven and earth. The only judge is steadfast and bright. <lb/>
            He directs the chariot of all creatures. But if thou ever <lb/>
            comest into the path, and to the place which thou hast now <lb/>
            forgotten, then wilt thou say: This is my proper country: <lb/>
            hence I formerly came, and hence was I born: here I will <lb/>
            now stand fast; I will never go hence! But, I wot, if it ever <lb/>
            happen to thee that thou wilt or must again explore the <lb/>
            darkness of this world, then wilt thou observe unjust kings, <lb/>
            and all the proud rich, to be very feeble, and very wretched <lb/>
            exiles: the same whom this miserable people now most <lb/>
            dreads!</p>
          <p>§ III. Then said 1: 0 Wisdom, great is that and won­ <lb/>
            derful which thou dost promise, and I, moreover, doubt not <lb/>
            that thou canst perform it! But I beseech thee that thou <lb/>
            wouldest not any longer hinder me, but teach me the way, <lb/>
            for thou mayest perceive that I am desirous of the way. Then <lb/>
            said he: Thou must first understand that the good always <lb/>
            have power, and the wicked never have any, nor any ability; <lb/>
            for none of them comprehends that good and evil are always <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXXVI. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_13_fig177.jpg"/></figure><figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              enemies. If, therefore, the good always have power, then the <lb/>
              wicked never have any, because good and evil are very incon­ <lb/>
              gruous. But I would inform thee somewhat more distinctly <lb/>
              concerning each of them, that thou mayest the better believe <lb/>
              what I shall sometimes tell thee concerning the one, and some­ <lb/>
              times concerning the other. There are two things which every <lb/>
              man's intention requires, that is, will and power. If, there­ <lb/>
              fore, there is to any man a deficiency of either of the two, he <lb/>
              cannot with the other effect anything. For no one will un­ <lb/>
              dertake what he is unwilling to do, unless he needs must: and <lb/>
              though be fully wills he cannot perform it, if he has not power <lb/>
              of that thing. Hence thou mayest clearly'know, when thou <lb/>
              seest any man desirous of that which he has not, that to him <lb/>
              power is wanting. Then said I: That is true: I cannot deny <lb/>
              it. Then said he: But if thou seest any one who can do what <lb/>
              he desires to do, then there is no doubt to thee that he has <lb/>
              power. Then said I: I have no doubt of it. Then said he: <lb/>
              Every man is powerful so far as he exercises power: he has <lb/>
              no power when he does not exercise power. Then said I: <lb/>
              Of that I am convinced. Then said he: Canst thou now call <lb/>
              to mind what I before told thee, that is, that the mind of every <lb/>
              man desires to arrive at the true happiness, though they pursue <lb/>
              it differently ? Then said I: That I remember; it is clearly <lb/>
              enough proved to me. Then said he: Dost thou remember <lb/>
              that I before said to thee, that it was all one, good and happi­ <lb/>
              ness ? He who seeks happiness seeks good. Then said I: <lb/>
              I have it sufficiently fixed in my memory. Then said he: All <lb/>
              men, both good and evil, desire to come to good, though they <lb/>
              desire it variously. Then said I: That is true which thou <lb/>
              sayest. Then said he: It is sufficiently evident that good <lb/>
              men are good because they find good. Then said I: It is <lb/>
              evident enough. Then said he: The good obtain the good <lb/>
              which they desire. Then said I: So metbinks. Then said <lb/>
              he: The wicked would not be wicked if they found the good <note type="footnote"> <unclear>T</unclear> </note> <pb n="178"/>
              <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXXVI. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> § IV. V. </note> <lb/>
              which they desire; but they are wicked because they do not <lb/>
              find it, and they do not find it because they do not seek it <lb/>
              rightly. Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said <lb/>
              he: Therefore there is no doubt that the good are always <lb/>
              powerful, and the wicked have no power, because the good, <lb/>
              seek good rightly, and the wicked wrongly. Then said I: <lb/>
              He who thinks that this is not true, then believes be no <lb/>
              truth.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Then said he: Whether dost thou think ? if two men <lb/>
            are going to one place, and have equally great desire to arrive <lb/>
            there, and one has the use of his feet, so that he may go where <lb/>
            he will, as it were natural to all men that they could; and the <lb/>
            other has not the use of his feet that he can go, and yet is <lb/>
            desirous to go, and begins to creep the same way, whether of <lb/>
            the two dost thou think the more powerful ? Then said I: <lb/>
            There is no comparison. He is more powerful who goes than <lb/>
            he who creeps, because he can more easily come whither he <lb/>
            will than the other. Say what else thou wilt, every man <lb/>
            knows that. Then said he: In like manner it is with the <lb/>
            good and with the wicked. Each of them desires naturally <lb/>
            that he may come to the highest good. But the good is able <lb/>
            to come whither he desires, because he desires it rightly, and <lb/>
            the wicked cannot come to that which he desires, because he <lb/>
            seeks it wrongly. I know not but thou mayest think dif­ <lb/>
            ferently. Then said I: I do not think at all differently from <lb/>
            what thou sayest. Then said he: Very rightly thou under­ <lb/>
            standest it: and that is also a token of thy health; as it is <lb/>
            the custom of physicians to say, when they see a sick man, if <lb/>
            they perceive in him any healthy token. Methinks now that <lb/>
            thy nature and thy habit contends very powerfully against <lb/>
            error.</p>
          <p>§ V. I have now found that thou art prompt to understand <lb/>
            my doctrine: therefore I am desirous to collect for thee many <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXXVI. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> § VI. </note> <lb/>
              arguments and many examples, so that thou mayest the more <lb/>
              easily understand what I am about to say. Observe now, how <lb/>
              feeble wicked meo are, when they cannot come thither where <lb/>
              even irrational creatures are desirous to come; and how much, <lb/>
              more feeble they would be if they had no natural inclination <lb/>
              to it. Behold with how heavy a chain of folly and unbappi­ <lb/>
              ness they are bound! Even children, when they can just go, <lb/>
              and also old men, as long as they can go, are desirous of some <lb/>
              honour and some praise. Children ride on their sticks, and <lb/>
              play at various sorts of play, wherein they imitate old men. <lb/>
              But the unwise are not willing to attempt anything from <lb/>
              which they may expect to themselves praise or rewards. But <lb/>
              they do what is worse; they run erring hither and thither <lb/>
              under the roof of all things; and that which irrational crea­ <lb/>
              tures know, unwise men do not know. Therefore the virtues <lb/>
              are better than the vices. For every man must be convinced, <lb/>
              whether he will, or whether he will not, that he is the most <lb/>
              powerful who is able to arrive at the highest roof of all things, <lb/>
              that is God; whom nothing is above, nor anything beneath, <lb/>
              nor about, but all things are in him, iu his power. God is <lb/>
              greatly to be loved. Didst thou not before say, that he was <lb/>
              most powerful in walking who could go, if he would, to the <lb/>
              end of this earth, so that no part of this earth were beyond <lb/>
              it ? The same thou mayest conceive with regard to God, as <lb/>
              we before said, that he is most powerful who can come to him, <lb/>
              because he nowhere beyond that can come!</p>
          <p>§ VI. From all these arguments thou mayest understand <lb/>
            that the good are always powerful, and the wicked are desti­ <lb/>
            tute of all power and all ability. Why, then, dost thou think <lb/>
            they forsake virtues aud follow vices ? But I suppose thou <lb/>
            wilt say, that it is through ignorance that the are not able <lb/>
            to distinguish them. But what wilt thou then say is worse <lb/>
            than this want of reason ? Why do they allow themselves to <lb/>
            be ignorant ? Why will they not inquire after virtues and <lb/>
            after wisdom ? But I know that drowsiness oppresses them, <lb/>
            and overcomes them with sloth, and covetousness blinds them. <lb/>
            We have before said, that nothing was worse than ignorance. <lb/>
            But what shall we now say, if the intelligent have vices, and <pb n="182"/>

              <note type="margin"> § VII. </note> <lb/>
              will not inquire after wisdom and after virtues ? I know, <lb/>
              however, that thou wilt say that luxury and intemperance <lb/>
              oppress them. But what is weaker than the man who is <lb/>
              utterly overcome by the frail flesh, unless he afterwards de­ <lb/>
              sist, and contend against vices as he best may ? But what <lb/>
              wilt thou say if any creature will not contend against them, <lb/>
              but with full will forsakes all good, and does evil, and is <lb/>
              nevertheless intelligent ? I say that he is feeble, and more­ <lb/>
              over altogether nothing! For whosoever forsakes the uni­ <lb/>
              versal good of all goods, without doubt he is nothing. But <lb/>
              whosoever desires that he may be virtuous, desires that he <lb/>
              may be wise. Whosoever, then, is virtuous is wise: and he <lb/>
              who is wise is good; he then who is good is happy; and he <lb/>
              who is happy is blessed; and he who is blessed is a god, so <lb/>
              far as we have before mentioned in this same book. But I <lb/>
              rather think that foolish men will wonder at that which I <lb/>
              have just now said, that is, that wicked men were nothing; <lb/>
              because there is a greater number of them than of the others. <lb/>
              But though they never believe it, yet it is so. We can never <lb/>
              reckon the wicked man pure and sincere, any more than we <lb/>
              can call or esteem a dead man living. Nor indeed is the <lb/>
              living better than the dead, if he repent not of his evil. But <lb/>
              he who lives recklessly, and will not preserve his nature, is <lb/>
              not he nothing ?</p>
          <p>§ VII. I think, however, thou wilt say that this is not <lb/>
            altogether so likely, because the wicked can do evil, though <lb/>
            he cannot do good, and the dead can do neither. But I say <lb/>
            to thee that the power of the wicked does not come from any <lb/>
            virtues, but from vices. But if the evil were always good, <lb/>
            then would they do no evil. It is not from power that any <lb/>
            one is able to do evil, but it is from weakness. If that is true <lb/>
            which one some time ago asserted, that evil is nothing, then <lb/>
            he works nothing who works evil. Then said I: Very true is <lb/>
            that which thou sayest. Then said he: Did we not prove be­ <lb/>
            fore that nothing was more powerful than the highest good ? <lb/>
            Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said he: Yet it <pb n="184"/>

              <note type="margin"> § VII. </note> <lb/>
              cannot do any evil. Then said I: That is true. Then said <lb/>
              he: Does any one think that any man can be so powerful <lb/>
              that he is able to do all that he wills ? Then said I: No man <lb/>
              thinks it who has his senses. Then said he : But wicked men, <lb/>
              nevertheless, can do evil. Then said I: 0 that they were not <lb/>
              able! Then said he: It is evident that they can do evil, and <lb/>
              cannot do any good. That is because evil is nothing. But <lb/>
              the good, if they have full power, are able to do whatsoever <lb/>
              good they will. Therefore full power is to be reckoned among <lb/>
              the highest goods; for both power and the other goods and <lb/>
              excellences, which we long ago mentioned, are fixed in the <lb/>
              highest good. As the wall of every house is fixed both to the <lb/>
              floor and to the roof, so is every good fixed in God, for he is <lb/>
              both the roof and floor of every good. Therefore is the power <lb/>
              that man may do good, ever to be desired: for that is the best <lb/>
              power, that any one is able and willing to do well, whether <lb/>
              with less means or with greater, whichsoever he may have. <lb/>
              For whosoever wills to do good, is desirous to have good, and <lb/>
              to be with good. Therefore is Plato's saying very true, which <lb/>
              he said: The wise alone can do the good which they desire; <lb/>
              the wicked can only attempt what they desire. I know not, <lb/>
              however, but thou wilt say that the good sometimes begin <lb/>
              what they cannot accomplish. But I say that they always <lb/>
              accomplish it. Though they may not perfect the work, they <lb/>
              have nevertheless full will, and the sincere will is to be <lb/>
              reckoned for the perfect work. Therefore they never fail of <lb/>
              rewards either here or there, or both. If the wicked have <lb/>
              will to work what they list, though it is not now perfect, they <lb/>
              lose not also the will, but have its punishment either here or <lb/>
              elsewhere, or both. So greatly does the evil will control <lb/>
              them ! For this reason they cannot obtain the good which <lb/>
              they desire, because they seek it through this will, and not <lb/>
              through the right way. The evil will has no fellowship with <lb/>
              happiness. When Wisdom had finished this speech, then <lb/>
              began he again to sing, and thus said: <pb n="186"/>

          <p>§ I. HEAR now a discourse concerning proud and unjust <lb/>
            kings, whom we see sitting on the highest thrones; who <lb/>
            shine in clothes of many kinds, and are surrounded by a <lb/>
            great company of their thanes, who are adorned with belts <lb/>
            and golden-hilted swords, and with manifold weapons, and <lb/>
            terrify all mankind with their greatness. And he who governs <lb/>
            them regards neither friend nor foe, any more than a mad <lb/>
            hound; but is inconceivably lifted up in his mind, through <lb/>
            unbounded power. But if any man should strip off from <lb/>
            him the clothes, and deprive him of the retinue and the <lb/>
            power, then wouldest thou see that he is very like to any one <lb/>
            of those his thanes who serve him, unless he be worse. And <lb/>
            moreover, if it by chance happen unto him that he at any time <lb/>
            is deprived of the retinue, and of the clothes, and of the power, <lb/>
            then it seems to him that he is brought to prison or to chains. <lb/>
            Because from excess, and from immoderate clothing, and from <lb/>
            dainty food, and from various drinks of the cup, the fury of <lb/>
            lust is excited, and disquiets their minds very greatly: then <lb/>
            increases also arrogance and wickedness; and when they are <lb/>
            offended, then is the mind scourged with the heat of anger, <lb/>
            until they are distracted with unhappiness, and so enslaved! <lb/>
            After this takes place, the hope of revenge begins to deceive <lb/>
            them, and whatsoever his anger wills his recklessness pro­ <lb/>
            mises him. I said to thee long before, in this same book, <lb/>
            that all creatures were naturally desirous of some good: but <lb/>
            unjust kings can do no good, for the reason I have now given­ <lb/>
            thee. That is no wonder, for they subject themselves to all <lb/>
            the vices which I have already named to thee. Every one of <lb/>
            them, therefore, necessarily must submit to the judgment of <lb/>
            the lords, to whom be has already subjected himself; and <lb/>
            what is still worse, that he will not even strive against them. <lb/>
            If he were willing to attempt it, and then were able to per­ <lb/>
            severe in the contest, then would he be free from his guilt.</p>
          <p>§ II. When Wisdom had sung this lay, then began he <lb/>
            again to speak, and thus said: Seest thou in how great, and <pb n="188"/>

              in how deep, and in how dark a sink of vices the evil-willing <lb/>
              are involved, and how the good shine brighter than the sun ? <lb/>
              For the good are never destitute of the rewards of their good, <lb/>
              nor the wicked ever of the punishments which they deserve. <lb/>
              Everything which is done in this world has recompense. Let <lb/>
              any one work what he may, or do what he may, he will ever <lb/>
              have that which he earns. Moreover, it is not unjust, as was <lb/>
              formerly the custom of the Romans, and still is in many na­ <lb/>
              tions, that man should have a golden crown at the end of <lb/>
              some course. Many people then come thereto, and all run <lb/>
              equally, those who have confidence in their running; and <lb/>
              whichsoever first arrives at the crown, then may he have it <lb/>
              to himself. Every one desires that he may first arrive, and <lb/>
              have it; but nevertheless it falls to one. So does all man­ <lb/>
              kind in this present life,-runs and hastens, and is desirous <lb/>
              of the highest good. But it is offered to no one man, but is <lb/>
              offered to all men. Therefore it is needful to every one that <lb/>
              he strive with all his power after the reward. Of the reward <lb/>
              no good man is ever deprived. A man cannot rightly call <lb/>
              himself good if he be destitute of the highest good, for no <lb/>
              good servant is without good rewards. Let the wicked do <lb/>
              what they may, the crown of good reward will always be pos­ <lb/>
              sessed by the good for ever. The evil of the wicked cannot <lb/>
              deprive the good of their good, and of their excellence. But <lb/>
              if they had that good from without them, then might some <lb/>
              one deprive them of it; either he who formerly bestowed it, <lb/>
              or another man. But a good man then loses his rewards <lb/>
              when lie forsakes his good. Understand, then, that to every <lb/>
              man his own good gives good reward; that good which is in <lb/>
              himself. What wise man will say, that any good man is des­ <lb/>
              titute of the highest good? for he always labours after it. <lb/>
              But meditate thou always on the great and the fair reward, <pb n="190"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              for that reward is above all other rewards to be loved: and <lb/>
              add that reward to the before-mentioned goods which I for­ <lb/>
              merly recounted to thee in the third book. When they are <lb/>
              added together, then mayest thou perceive that happiness <lb/>
              and the highest good are all one, and that is G-od. And then <lb/>
              thou mayest also perceive that every good man is happy, <lb/>
              and that all happy men are gods, and have eternal reward of <lb/>
              their good!</p>
          <p>§ III. Therefore no wise man needs to doubt that the evil <lb/>
            have also eternal recompense of their evil, that is, eternal <lb/>
            punishment. Though thou mayest think that any of them is <lb/>
            happy here in respect of the world, he nevertheless has always <lb/>
            his evil with him, and also the recompense of the evil, even. <lb/>
            whilst it gives him pleasure. There is no wise man who is <lb/>
            ignorant that good and evil are always discordant between <lb/>
            themselves, and always are at variance in their wishes. And <lb/>
            as the goodness of the good is his own good, and his own re­ <lb/>
            ward, so is also the evil of the wicked his own evil, and his <lb/>
            reward, and his own punishment. No man if he has punish­ <lb/>
            ment, doubts that lie has evil. What! do the wicked think <lb/>
            that they are exempted from punishments, and yet are full of <lb/>
            all evil? Not only are they foul, but almost brought to <lb/>
            nothing. Understand, therefore, from the good, how great <lb/>
            punishment the wicked always have: and hear, moreover, an <lb/>
            example; and well retain those which I before mentioned to <lb/>
            thee. Whatsoever has unity, that we say exists while it re­ <lb/>
            mains together; and this unity we call good. Thus a man is <lb/>
            a man whilst the soul and the body are together. But when <lb/>
            they are separated, then is he not that which he was before. <lb/>
            The same thou mayest conceive concerning the body, and <lb/>
            concerning its limbs. If any of the limbs is off, then it is <lb/>
            not full man, as it was before. So if any good man depart <lb/>
            from good, then is he not any more fully good, if he at all <lb/>
            depart from good. When it happens that the wicked leave <lb/>
            off what they before did, they are not what they before were. <pb n="192"/>

              But when men forsake good, and become wicked, then are <lb/>
              they nothing but a resemblance; so that one may see that <lb/>
              they formerly were men, but they have lost the best part of <lb/>
              humanity, and kept the worst. They forsake the good of <lb/>
              their nature, that is human manners, and have nevertheless <lb/>
              the likeness of man while they live.</p>
          <p>§ IV. But as the goodness of men raises them above human <lb/>
            nature, so far that they are named gods; so also their wicked­ <lb/>
            ness degrades them below human nature, so far that they <lb/>
            are called evil, which we say is nothing. Therefore if thou <lb/>
            shouldest meet a man so debased that he is turned from good <lb/>
            to evil, thou canst not rightly name him man, but beast. If <lb/>
            then thou observest with respect to any man, that he is a <lb/>
            rapacious man, and a spoiler, thou shouldest not call him a <lb/>
            man, but a wolf. And the fierce man who is a brawler, thou <lb/>
            shouldest call a hound, not a man. And the deceitful, crafty <lb/>
            man, thou shouldest call a fox, not a man. And the immo­ <lb/>
            derately proud and angry man, who has great malice, thou <lb/>
            shalt call a lion, not a man. And the dull man who is too <lb/>
            slow, thou shouldest call an ass more than a man. And the <lb/>
            excessively timid man who is more fearful than he needs, thou <lb/>
            mayest call a hare more than a man. And to the inconstant <lb/>
            and the light, thou mayest say, that they are more like the <lb/>
            wind, or restless birds, than modest men. And to him whom <lb/>
            thou observest that he is lying in the lusts of his body, thou <lb/>
            mayest say, that he is most like to fat swine, which always <lb/>
            desire to lie in foul mire, and will not wash themselves in <lb/>
            pure waters; but if they sometimes rarely are made to swim, <lb/>
            then cast they themselves again into the mire, and wallow <lb/>
            therein. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began <lb/>

          <p>§ I. I CAN relate to thee, from ancient fables, a story very <lb/>
            like to the subject which we have just now spoken about. It <lb/>
            happened formerly in the Trojan war, that there was a king <lb/>
            whose name was Ulysses, who had two countries under the <lb/>
            Cæsar. The countries were called Ithaca and Retia, and the <lb/>
            Cæsar's name was Agamemnon. When Ulysses went with <lb/>
            the Cæsar to the battle, he had some hundred ships. Then <lb/>
            were they some ten years in that war. When the king again <lb/>
            returned homeward from the Cæsar, and they had conquered <lb/>
            the land, he had not more ships than one; but that was a <lb/>
            ship with three rows of oars. Then opposed him a great <lb/>
            tempest and a stormy sea. He was then driven on an island <lb/>
            out in the Wendel sea. Then was there the daughter of <lb/>
            Apollo, the son of Jove. Jove was their king, and pretended <lb/>
            that lie should be the highest god, and that foolish people <lb/>
            believed him because he was of royal lineage, and they knew <lb/>
            not any other God at that time, but worshipped their kings <lb/>
            for gods. Then should the father of Jove be also a god, whose <lb/>
            name was Saturn; and likewise all his kindred they held for <lb/>
            gods. Then was one of them the Apollo whom we before <lb/>
            mentioned. Apollo's daughter should be a goddess, whose <lb/>
            name was Circe. She, they said, should be very skilful in <lb/>
            sorcery; and she dwelt in the island on which the king was <lb/>
            driven, about whom we before spoke. She had then a very <lb/>
            great company of her servants, and also of other maidens. <lb/>
            As soon as she saw the king driven thither, whom we before <lb/>
            mentioned, whose name was Ulysses, then began she to love <lb/>
            him, and each of them the other, beyond measure ; so that he <lb/>
            for love of her neglected all his kingdom, and his family, and <lb/>
            dwelt with her until the time that his thanes would no longer <lb/>
            remain with him ; but for love of their country, and on ac­ <lb/>
            count of exile, determined to leave him. Then began false <lb/>
            men to work spells. And they said that she should by her <lb/>
            sorcery overthrow the men, and cast them into the bodies of <lb/>

            when they should speak then they roared. Some should be <lb/>
            wild boars, and when they should lament their misfortune <lb/>
            then they grunted. Some became wolves. These howled <note type="footnote"> o2 </note> <pb n="196"/>

              when they should speak. Some became that kind of wild <lb/>
              beast that man calls tiger. Thus was all the company turned <lb/>
              to wild beasts of various kinds; each to some beast, except <lb/>
              the king alone. Every meat they refused which men eat, <lb/>
              and were desirous of those which beasts eat. They had no <lb/>
              resemblance of men either in body or in voice, yet every one <lb/>
              knew his mind, as he before knew it. That mind was very <lb/>
              sorrowful through the miseries which they suffered. Indeed, <lb/>
              the men who believed these fictions, nevertheless knew that <lb/>
              she by sorcery could not change the minds of men, though <lb/>
              she changed the bodies. How great an excellence is that of <lb/>
              the mind in comparison of the body! By these things, and <lb/>
              the like thou mayest learn, that the excellence of the body is <lb/>
              in the mind; and that to every man the vices of his mind are <lb/>
              more hurtful. Those of the mind draw all the body to them, <lb/>
              and the infirmity of the body cannot entirely draw the mind <lb/>
              to it.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said I: I am convinced that that is true which <lb/>
            thou before saidst, that is, that it would not be unfit that we <lb/>
            should call evil-willing men cattle, or wild beasts, though they <lb/>
            have the resemblance of man. But if I had such power as <lb/>
            the Almighty God has, then would I not let the wicked injure <lb/>
            the good so much as they now do. Then said he: It is not <lb/>
            permitted to them so long as thou supposest. But thou <lb/>
            mayest be assured that their prosperity will very soon be re­ <lb/>
            moved, as I will shortly inform thee, though I have not leisure <lb/>
            now on account of other discourse. If they had not the vain <lb/>
            power, which they think they have, then would they not have <lb/>
            so great punishment as they shall have. The wicked are much <lb/>
            more unhappy when they are able to accomplish the evil which <lb/>
            they list, than they are when they are unable to do it; though <lb/>
            these foolish men do not believe it. It is very wicked that <lb/>
            any man wills evil, and it is still much worse that he is able <lb/>
            to do it, for the evil will is dispersed like incense before the <lb/>
            fire, if man is not able to accomplish the work. But the <lb/>
            wicked have sometimes three misfortunes: one is, that they <lb/>
            will evil; the second, that they are able to do it; the third, <pb n="198"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              that they accomplish it. For God has decreed to give punish­ <lb/>
              ments and miseries to wicked men for their wicked works. <lb/>
              Then said I: So it is as thou sayest; and yet I would wish, <lb/>
              if I might, that they had not the unhappiness of being able <lb/>
              to do evil. Then said he: I think, however, that that power <lb/>
              will be lost to them sooner than either thou or they would <lb/>
              expect. For nothing is of long duration in this present life, <lb/>
              though it seem to men that it be long. But very frequently <lb/>
              the great power of the wicked falls very suddenly, even as a <lb/>
              great tree in a wood makes a loud crash when men least <lb/>
              expect; and through fear they are always very miserable. <lb/>
              But if their wickedness makes them miserable, is not then <lb/>
              the long evil always worse than the short P Though the <lb/>
              wicked never died, I should still say that they were most <lb/>
              miserable. If the miseries are all true, which we long ago <lb/>
              discoursed about, that the wicked should have in this world, <lb/>
              then is it evident that those miseries are infinite which are <lb/>
              eternal. Then said I: That is wonderful which thou sayest, <lb/>
              and very difficult to be understood by foolish men. But I <lb/>
              nevertheless perceive that it appertains well enough to the <lb/>
              discourse which we were before holding. Then said he: I <lb/>
              am not now speaking to foolish men, but am speaking to <lb/>
              those who desire to understand wisdom; for it is a token of <lb/>
              wisdom that any one is willing to hear and understand it. <lb/>
              But if any of the foolish doubt any of the reasonings which <lb/>
              we have already uttered in this same book, let him show, if <lb/>
              he can, some one of the arguments which is either false, or <lb/>
              inapplicable to the subject about which we are inquiring; or <lb/>
              thirdly, let him turn, understand, and believe that we argue <lb/>
              rightly. If he will do none of these things, then he knows <lb/>
              not what he means.</p>
          <p>§ III. But I can still teach thee another thing, which to <lb/>
            foolish men will seem yet more incredible, and is nevertheless <lb/>
            suitable enough to the argument which we are holding. Then <pb n="200"/>

              said I: What thing is that ? Then said he: It is this, that <lb/>
              those wicked persons are much happier who in this world <lb/>
              have great misery, and manifold punishment for their evil, <lb/>
              than those are who have no suffering nor punishment in this <lb/>
              world for their guilt. Let no one, however, think that I <lb/>
              speak thus merely because I would reprove vices, and praise <lb/>
              virtue, and by the example urge and persuade men to good <lb/>
              conduct through fear of punishment: but I speak it still <lb/>
              more for other reasons. Then said I: For what other reasons <lb/>
              wouldest thou speak it, except what thou hast just mentioned ? <lb/>
              Then said he: Dost thou recollect what we before said, that <lb/>
              is, that the good always had power and happiness, and the <lb/>
              wicked never had either ? Then said I: That I remember. <lb/>
              Then said he: But what thickest thou, if thou seest any man <lb/>
              very unhappy, and yet perceivest something of good in him; <lb/>
              is he as unhappy as the man who has no good in him ? Then <lb/>
              said I: He appears to me happier, who has something of <lb/>
              good. Then said he: But what then dost thou think con­ <lb/>
              cerning him who has no good, if he has some addition of <lb/>
              evil ? He, thou wilt say, is still more unhappy than the <lb/>
              other, through the addition of evil. Then said I: Why should <lb/>
              not I think so ? Then said be: Consider that it so appears <lb/>
              to thee, and understand with inward mind that the wicked <lb/>
              have always something of good among their evil, that is their <lb/>
              punishment, which we may very easily, and justly reckon to <lb/>
              them as good. But those whose evil is all unpunished in this <lb/>
              world, have an evil heavier and more dangerous than any <lb/>
              punishment in this world is; that is,, that their evil is un­ <lb/>
              punished in this world, which is the most evident token of <lb/>
              the greatest evil in this world, and of the worst recompense <pb n="202"/>

              after this world. Then said I: I cannot deny this. Then <lb/>
              said he: Therefore the wicked are more unhappy, because <lb/>
              their wickedness is undeservedly forgiven them, than they <lb/>
              are if their wickedness is recompensed according to their <lb/>
              deserts. Therefore it is right that evil should be inflicted on <lb/>
              the wicked, and it is wrong that they should be suffered to <lb/>
              go unpunished. Then said I: Who denies this ? Then said <lb/>
              be: No man can deny that everything is good which is right, <lb/>
              and everything evil which is wrong. Then said I: I am <lb/>
              very much troubled with this discourse, and wonder why so <lb/>
              righteous a judge should bestow any unjust gift. Then said <lb/>
              he: Wherefore sayest thou that ? Then said 1: Because <lb/>
              thou before saidst that he did wrong, inasmuch as lie left the <lb/>
              wicked unpunished. Then said be: That is his glory, that he <lb/>
              is so bountiful, and bestows so abundantly. It is a great gift <lb/>
              that he waits till the wicked are sensible of their evil and turn <lb/>
              to good. Then said I: Now I understand that it is not an <lb/>
              eternal gift which he gives to the wicked, but is rather the <lb/>
              delay and waiting of the highest judge. On account of his <lb/>
              waiting and forbearance, methinks he is the more despised ; <lb/>
              and yet this argument pleases me well enough, and seems to <lb/>
              me like enough to what thou before saidst.</p>
          <p>§ IV. But I beseech thee, now, that thou wouldest tell me <lb/>
            whether thou thinkest that the wicked have any punishment <lb/>
            after this world; or the good any reward for their goodness ? <lb/>
            Then said he: Did I not say to thee before, that the good <lb/>
            have recompense for their goodness both here and for ever; <lb/>
            and the wicked also have recompense for their evil, both here, <lb/>
            and also for ever ? But I will now divide the wicked from the <lb/>
            wicked in two parts. For one'part of the wicked shall have <lb/>
            eternal punishment, because they have deserved no mercy; <lb/>
            and the other part shall be cleansed and proved iu the <pb n="204"/>

              heavenly fire, as silver here is, because it has some deserving <lb/>
              of some mercy, wherefore it may come after these troubles <lb/>
              to everlasting honour. Still I could instruct thee more both <lb/>
              concerning the good and concerning the evil, if I now had <lb/>
              leisure. But I fear that I should neglect what we were be­ <lb/>
              fore seeking after, that is, that we would argue so that thou <lb/>
              mightest perceive that the wicked have no power, nor any <lb/>
              honour, either in this world or in that to come. For for­ <lb/>
              merly this appeared to thee the worst of all things, that thou <lb/>
              thoughtest they had'too much; and thou always didst lament <lb/>
              that they were not always punished: and I always said to <lb/>
              thee, that they never are without punishment, though it ap­ <lb/>
              pear not so to thee. But I know, however, that thou wilt <lb/>
              lament that they have so long time permission to do evil; <lb/>
              and I have always said to thee, that the time is a very little <lb/>
              while ; and I now say to thee, that the longer it is, the more <lb/>
              unhappy they are, and it would be to them the greatest un­ <lb/>
              happiness of all, that the time continued till doomsday. And <lb/>
              I said to thee also, that they would be more unhappy if their <lb/>
              evil were unjustly passed over, than they would be if their <lb/>
              evil were justly punished. Yet it so happens that thou <lb/>
              thinkest those who have impunity are happier than those <lb/>
              who are punished.</p>
          <p>§ V. Then said I: Nothing ever appears to me so true as <lb/>
            thy arguments appear to me, at the times when I hear them. <lb/>
            But if I turn myself to the judgment of this people, they not <lb/>
            only are unwilling to believe this thy doctrine, but they will <lb/>
            not even hear it. Then said he: That is no wonder. Thou <lb/>
            knowest that the men who have unsound eyes cannot very <lb/>
            easily look at the sun when she shines brightest, nor indeed <lb/>
            do they choose to look on fire, or on anything bright, though <lb/>
            the apple of the eye be left. In like manner the sinful minds <pb n="206"/>

              are blinded by their evil will, so that they are not able to be­ <lb/>
              hold the light of bright truth, which is the highest wisdom. <lb/>
              But it is with them, as with the birds and the beasts which <lb/>
              can see better by night than by day. The day blinds and <lb/>
              darkens their eyes, and the darkness of the night enlightens <lb/>
              them. Therefore the blinded minds think that this is the <lb/>
              greatest happiness, that a man should be permitted to do evil, <lb/>
              and his deed should be unpunished, For they are not desirous <lb/>
              to inquire after every instruction, until they know what is <lb/>
              right, but turn to their evil will, and seek after it. There­ <lb/>
              fore I know not to what purpose thou teachest me to the <lb/>
              foolish men who never inquire after me. I never speak to <lb/>
              them; but I speak to thee, because thou art inclined to seek <lb/>
              after me, and labourest more in the pursuit than they do. I <lb/>
              care not what they judge. I approve thy judgment more <lb/>
              than theirs, for they all look with both eyes, as well with the <lb/>
              eyes of the mind as with those of the body, on these earthly <lb/>
              things, which excessively delight them. But thou alone <lb/>
              sometimes lookest with one eye on the heavenly things, and <lb/>
              with the other thou lookest as yet on these earthly things. <lb/>
              For the foolish think that every man is as blind as they are, <lb/>
              and that no man is able to see what they cannot behold. <lb/>
              Such folly is most like to this; that a child should be born full <lb/>
              sound and full healthy, and so flourishing in all excellences <lb/>
              and virtues, during childhood and afterwards throughout <lb/>
              youth, that he becomes capable of every art; and then a little <lb/>
              before his middle-age, he should become blind in both eyes, <lb/>
              and also the eyes of the mind should become so blinded, that <lb/>
              he remembers nothing which he ever before saw or heard: <lb/>
              and nevertheless he should think that he is as capable of <lb/>
              everything as he ever was when most capable: and should <lb/>
              think that it is with every man as it is with him ; and that it <lb/>
              seems to every man as it seems to him. But though lie were <lb/>
              so foolish as to think so, should we all think as he thinks ? <lb/>
              I think, however, that we should not. But I wish to know <lb/>
              what thou thinkest concerning the men of whom we before <pb n="208"/>

              said, that it appeared to us that they were more like wild <lb/>
              beasts than men ? How much wisdom had they ? Methinks, <lb/>
              however, they have none.</p>
          <p>§ VI. I would now utter to thee a true observation, but I <lb/>
            know that this people will not believe it: that is, that those <lb/>
            persons whom men injure are happier than those are who <lb/>
            injure them. Then wondered I at this, and said: I wish <lb/>
            that thou wouldest explain to me how it can be so. Then <lb/>
            said he: Dost thou understand that every evil-willing man <lb/>
            and every evil-doing man is deserving of punishment ? Then <lb/>
            said I: Clearly enough I understand that. Then said he: <lb/>
            Is he not then evil-willing and evil-doing, who injures the <lb/>
            innocent ? Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. Then said <lb/>
            he: Dost thou think that they are miserable and unhappy, <lb/>
            who are deserving of punishment? Then said I: I not only <lb/>
            think it, but know it very well. Then said he: If thou wert <lb/>
            now to judge, which wouldest thou judge more deserving of <lb/>
            punishment, him who injured the innocent, or him who <lb/>
            suffered the injury ? Then said I: There is no comparison. <lb/>
            I would help him who was innocent, and oppose him who <lb/>
            injured him. Then said he: Then, in thy opinion, he is more <lb/>
            miserable who does the evil, than he who suffers it. Then <lb/>
            said I: This I believe, that every unjust punishment is the <lb/>
            evil of him who inflicts it, not of him who suffers it; there­ <lb/>
            fore his evil makes him miserable. And I perceive that this <lb/>
            is a very just observation which thou now makest, and very <lb/>
            agreeable to those which thou madest before; but I never­ <lb/>

            advocates now-a-days plead for those who have less need of it. <lb/>
            They plead for those who are injured, and do not plead for <lb/>
            those who do the injury. It were more needful to those who <lb/>
            injure others who are innocent, that some one should plead <lb/>
            for them before the magistrates, and pray that as great hurt <lb/>
            might be done to them, as they had done to other innocent <lb/>
            persons. As the sick man has need that some one should <note type="footnote"> r </note> <pb n="210"/>

              lead him to the physician, that he may cure him; so has he <lb/>
              who does evil, that some one should lead him to the magis­ <lb/>
              trates, that they may cut off and burn his vices. I do not <lb/>
              say that it is wrong that men should help the innocent, and <lb/>
              defend him; but I say that it is better that we should accuse <lb/>
              the guilty ; and I say that the defence does no good either to <lb/>
              the guilty or to him who pleads for him, if they wish that <lb/>
              their evil should not he punished in proportion to its guilt. <lb/>
              But I know that if the guilty had any spark of wisdom, and <lb/>
              in any measure knew that they might make amends for their <lb/>
              crimes by punishment, which came upon them here in this <lb/>
              world, then they would not say that it was punishment, but <lb/>
              would say that it was their purification and their amend­ <lb/>
              ment; and would seek no advocate, but they would cheer­ <lb/>
              fully suffer the magistrates to punish them according to their <lb/>
              own will. Hence no wise man ought to hate any one. No <lb/>
              one hates the good, except the most foolish of all. Nor is it <lb/>
              right that we hate the wicked; but it is more right that we <lb/>
              have mercy on him. This then is mercy to them, that we <lb/>
              punish their vices according to their deservings. No, one <lb/>
              ought to afflict a sick person who is troubled; but we should <lb/>
              lead him to a physician, that he may cure him. When Wisdom <lb/>
              had finished this discourse, then began he again to sing, and <lb/>
              thus said:</p>

              no track till he seizes that which he pursues ? Alas! that <lb/>
              unhappy men cannot wait till he comes to them, but antici­ <lb/>
              pate him, as wild beasts wish to destroy each other! But it <lb/>
              would not be right in men, that anyone of them should hate <lb/>
              another. But this would be right, that every one of them <lb/>
              should render to another recompense of every work accord­ <lb/>
              ing to his deserts; that is, that one should love the good, as <lb/>
              it is right that we should do, and should have mercy on the <lb/>
              wicked, as we before said; should love the man, and hate his <lb/>
              vices; and cut them off, as we best may.</p>
          <p>§ II. When he had sung this lay, then was he silent for <lb/>
            some time. Then said I: Now I clearly understand that true <lb/>
            happiness is founded on the deservings of good men, and misery <lb/>
            is founded on the deservings of wicked men. But I will yet <lb/>
            say that methinks the happiness of this present life is no little <lb/>
            good, and its unhappiness no little evil. For I never saw nor <lb/>
            heard of any wise man who would rather be an exile, and <lb/>
            miserable, and foreign, and despised, than wealthy, and honour­ <lb/>
            able, and powerful, and eminent in his own country. For they <lb/>
            say that they can the better fulfil their wisdom, and observe <lb/>
            it, if their power be ample over the people that are under them, <lb/>
            and also in some measure over those who are in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood round about them, because they are able to repress <lb/>
            the wicked, and promote the good. For the good is always <lb/>
            to be honoured, both in this present life and in that to come ; <lb/>
            and the wicked, whom man cannot restrain from his evil, is <lb/>
            always deserving of punishment, both in this world and in <lb/>
            that to come. But I very much wonder why it should so fall <lb/>
            out, as it now often does; that is, that various punishments <lb/>
            and manifold misfortunes come to the good, as they should to <lb/>
            the wicked; and the blessings which should be a reward to <lb/>
            good men for good works, come to wicked men. Therefore I <lb/>
            would now know from thee, how that course of events were <lb/>
            approved by thee. I should wonder at it much less, if I knew <lb/>
            that it happened by chance, without God's will, and without <lb/>
            his knowledge. But the Almighty God has increased my <pb n="214"/>

              fear and my astonishment by these things. For he some­ <lb/>
              times gives felicities to the good, and infelicities to the wicked, <lb/>
              as it were right that he always did. Sometimes again he per­ <lb/>
              mits that the good have infelicities and misfortunes in many <lb/>
              things; and the wicked have happiness, and it frequently <lb/>
              happens to them according to their own desire. Hence I <lb/>
              cannot think otherwise but that it so happens by chance, un­ <lb/>
              less thou still more rationally show me the contrary. Then <lb/>
              answered he, after a long time, and said: It is no wonder if <lb/>
              any one think that something of this kind happens unde­ <lb/>
              signedly, when he cannot understand and explain wherefore <lb/>
              God so permits. But thou oughtest not to doubt that so good <lb/>
              a creator and governor of all things, rightly made all that he <lb/>
              has made, and rightly judges and rules it all, though thou <lb/>
              knowest not why he so and so may do.</p>
          <p>§ III. When he had made this speech, then began he to <lb/>
            sing, and said: Who of the unlearned wonders not at the <lb/>
            course of the sky, and its swiftness; how it every day re­ <lb/>
            volves about all this middle-earth ? Or who wonders not <lb/>
            that some stars have a shorter circuit than others have, as the <lb/>
            stars have which we call the waggon's shafts ? They have so <lb/>
            short a circuit, because they are so near the north end of the <lb/>
            axis, on which all the sky turns. Or who is not astonished <lb/>
            at this, except those only who know it, that some stars have <lb/>
            a longer circuit than others have, and those the longest which <lb/>
            revolve midward about the axis, as Bootes does ? And that <lb/>
            the star Saturn does not come where it before was till about <lb/>
            thirty winters ? Or who wonders not at this, that same stars <lb/>
            depart under the sea, as some men think the sun does when <lb/>
            she sets ? But she nevertheless is not nearer to the sea than <lb/>
            she is at mid-day! Who is not astonished when the full moon <lb/>
            is covered over with darkness ? or again, that the stars shine <lb/>
            before the moon, and do not shine before the sun ? At this <lb/>
            and many a like thing they wonder, and wonder not that men <lb/>
            and all living creatures have continual and useless enmity <lb/>
            with each other. Or why wonder they not at this, that it <lb/>
            sometimes thunders, and sometimes begins not? Or, again, <lb/>
            at the strife of sea and winds, and waves and land ? or why <pb n="216"/>

              ice is formed, and again by the shining of the sun returns to <lb/>
              its own nature ? But the inconstant people wonder at that <lb/>
              which it most seldom sees, though it be less wonderful; and <lb/>
              thinks that that is not the old creation, but has by chance <lb/>
              newly happened. But they who are very inquisitive and en­ <lb/>
              deavour to learn, if God removes from their mind the folly <lb/>
              with which it was before covered, then will they not wonder <lb/>
              at many things which they now wonder at.</p>
          <p>§ IV. When Wisdom had sung this lay, then was he silent <lb/>
            a little while. Then said I: So it is as thou sayest. But I <lb/>
            am still desirous that thou wouldest instruct me somewhat <lb/>
            more distinctly concerning the thing which has chiefly troubled <lb/>
            my mind, that is, what I before asked thee. For it was always <lb/>
            hitherto thy wont that thou wouldest teach every mind ab­ <lb/>
            struse and unknown things. Then began he to smile, and <lb/>
            said to me: Thou urgest me to the greatest argument, and <lb/>
            the most difficult to explain. This explanation all philoso­ <lb/>
            phers have sought, and very diligently laboured about, and <lb/>
            scarcely any one has come to the end of the discussion. For <lb/>
            it is the nature of the discussion and of the inquiry, that <lb/>
            always when there is one doubt removed, then is there an <lb/>
            innumerable multitude raised. So men in old tales say, that <lb/>
            there was a serpent which had nine heads, and whenever any <lb/>
            one of them was cut off, then grew there seven from that one <lb/>
            head. Then happened it that the celebrated Hercules came <lb/>
            there, who was the son of Jove. Then could not he imagine <lb/>
            how he by any art might overcome them, until he surrounded <lb/>
            them with wood, and then burned them with fire. So is this <lb/>
            argument which thou askest about: with difficulty comes any <lb/>
            man out of it, if he enter into it. He never comes to a clear <lb/>
            end, unless he have an understanding as sharp as the fire. <lb/>
            For be who will inquire concerning this ought first to know <lb/>
            what the simple providence of God is, and what fate is, and <lb/>
            what happens by chance, and what the divine knowledge is, <lb/>
            and the divine predestination, and what the freedom of men <lb/>
            is. Now thou mayest perceive how weighty and difficult all <lb/>
            this is to explain. But I will nevertheless endeavour to <pb n="218"/>

              teach thee a little of it, because I have conceived it to be a <lb/>
              very powerful remedy for thy sorrow, if thou learn something <lb/>
              of this, though it be long for me to teach. For it is near the <lb/>
              time when I had intended to begin other work, and I have not <lb/>
              yet finished this: and methinks, too, thou art rather weary, <lb/>
              and these long discourses appear to thee too lengthy, so that <lb/>
              thou art now desirous of my songs. I know, too, that they <lb/>
              give thee pleasure. But thou must nevertheless bear with <lb/>
              me for some time. I cannot so readily sing it, nor have I <lb/>
              leisure, for it is a very long argument. Then said I: Do as <lb/>
              thou wilt.</p>
          <p>§ V. Then began he to speak very far about, as if he <lb/>
            intended not that discourse, and nevertheless approached <lb/>
            thitherward, and said: All creatures visible and invisible, <lb/>
            still and moving, receive from the immovable, and from the <lb/>
            steadfast, and from the singly-existing God, order, and form, <lb/>
            andmeasure; and therefore it was so ordained, because he <lb/>
            knew wherefore he made all that be made. Nothing of that <lb/>
            which he has created is useless to him. God dwells always <lb/>
            in the high city of his unity and simplicity. Thence he dis­ <lb/>
            tributes many and various measures to all his creatures, and <lb/>
            thence he governs them all. But that which we call God's <lb/>
            providence and foreknowledge, is suchwhile it is with him, in <lb/>
            his mind, before it is fulfilled,[ and so long as it is designed; <lb/>
            but after it is fulfilled, then we call it fate.] Hence may every <lb/>
            man know that these are both two names, and two things, <lb/>
            providence and fate. Providence is the divine intelligence <lb/>
            which is fixed in the high Creator, who foreknows all, how it <lb/>
            shall come to pass, before it happens. But that which we <lb/>
            call fate, is God's work which he every day works, both what <lb/>
            we see, and what is invisible to us. But the divine provi­ <lb/>
            dence restrains all creatures, so that they cannot slip from <lb/>
            their order. Fate, then, distributes to all creatures, forms, <lb/>
            and places, and times, and measures. But fate comes from <pb n="220"/>

              the mind, and from the providence of Almighty God. He, <lb/>
              therefore, works after his unspeakable providence, whatsoever <lb/>
              he wills.</p>
          <p>§ VI. As every artificer considers and marks out his work <lb/>
            in his mind before be executes it, and afterwards executes it <lb/>
            all; this varying fortune which we call fate, proceeds after <lb/>
            his providence and after his counsel, as he intends that it <lb/>
            should be. Though it appear to us complicated, partly good, <lb/>
            and partly evil, it is nevertheless to him singly good, because <lb/>
            he brings it all to a good end, and does for good all that which <lb/>
            he does. (Afterwards, when it is wrought, we call it fate; <lb/>
            before, it was God's providence, and his predestination He <lb/>
            therefore directs fortune, either through good angels, or <lb/>
            througt the souls of men, or through the life of other <lb/>
            creatures, or through the stars of heaven, or through the <lb/>
            various deceits of devils; sometimes through one of them, <lb/>
            sometimes through them all. But this is evidently known, <lb/>
            that the divine predestination is simple and unchangeable, <lb/>
            and governs everything according to order, and fashions <lb/>
            everything. Some things, therefore, in this world are sub­ <lb/>
            ject to fate others are not at all subject to it. But fate, and <lb/>
            all the thirigs which are subject to it, are subject to the <lb/>
            divine providence. Concerning this, I can mention to thee <lb/>
            an example, whereby thou mayest the more clearly under­ <lb/>
            stand which men are subject to fate, and which are not. All <lb/>
            this moving and this changeable creation revolves on the <lb/>
            immovable, and on the steadfast, and on the singly-existing <lb/>
            God; and he governs all creatures as he at the beginning <lb/>
            had, and still has determined.</p>
          <p>§ VII. As on the axle-tree of a waggon the wheel turns, <lb/>
            and the axle-tree stands still, and nevertheless supports all <lb/>
            the waggon, and regulates all its progress-the wheel turns <lb/>
            round, and the nave, being nearest to the axle-tree, goes much <lb/>
            more firmly and more securely than the fellies do—so the <lb/>
            axle-tree may be the highest good which we call God, and <pb n="222"/>

              the best men go nearest to God, as the nave goes nearest to <lb/>
              the axle-tree; and the middle class of men as the spokes. <lb/>
              For of every spoke, one end is fixed in the nave, and the <lb/>
              other in the felly. So is it with respect to the middle class <lb/>
              of men. One while he meditates in his mind concerning this <lb/>
              earthly life, another while concerning the heavenly: as if he <lb/>
              should look with one eye to the heavens, and with the other <lb/>
              to the earth. As the spokes stick, one end in the icily, and <lb/>
              the other in the nave, and the spoke is midward, equally near <lb/>
              to both, though one end be fixed in the nave, and the other <lb/>
              in the felly; so are the middle class of men in the middle of <lb/>
              the spokes, and the better nearer to the nave, and the most <lb/>
              numerous class nearer to the fellies. They are nevertheless <lb/>
              fixed in the nave, and the nave on the axle-tree. But the <lb/>
              fellies depend on the spokes, though they wholly roll upon <lb/>
              the earth. So do the most numerous class of men depend on <lb/>
              the middle class, and the middle class on the best, and the <lb/>
              best on God. Though the most numerous class turn all their <lb/>
              love towards this world, they are not able to dwell there, nor <lb/>
              do they come to anything, if they are not in some measure <lb/>
              fastened to God, any more than the fellies of the wheel can <lb/>
              make any progress if they are not fastened to the spokes, and <lb/>
              the spokes to the axle-tree. The fellies are farthest from the <lb/>
              axle-tree, therefore they go the most roughly. The nave goes <lb/>
              nearest the axle-tree, therefore it goes the most securely. So <lb/>
              do the best men. As they place their love nearer to God, and <lb/>
              more despise these earthly things, so are they more free from <lb/>
              care, and areless anxious how fortune may vary, or what it <lb/>
              maybring.Provided the navebe always thus secure, the <lb/>
              fellies may rest on what they will. And yet the nave is in <lb/>
              some measure separated from the axle-tree. As thou mayest <lb/>
              perceive that the waggon is much longer secure, which is less <lb/>
              separated from the axle-tree; so, of all men, those are most <lb/>
              untroubled, with the difficulties either of this present life, or <lb/>
              of that to come, who are fixed in God; but as they are farther <pb n="224"/>

              separated from God, so are they more troubled and afflicted <lb/>
              both in mind and in body. Such is what we call fate....</p>
          <p>§ VIII.... With respect to the divine providence; as <lb/>
            argument and reasoning is, compared with the intellect, and <lb/>
            such the wheel is, compared with the axle-tree. For the <lb/>
            axle-tree regulates all the waggon. In like manner does the <lb/>
            divine providence. It moves the sky and the stars, and makes <lb/>
            the earth immovable, and regulates the four elements, that is, <lb/>
            water, and earth, and fire, and air. These it tempers and <lb/>
            forms, and sometimes again changes their appearance, and <lb/>
            brings them to another form, and afterwards renews them: <lb/>
            and nourishes every production, and again hides and preserves <lb/>
            it when it is grown old and withered, and again discovers <lb/>
            and renews it whensoever he wills. Some philosophers how­ <lb/>
            ever say, that fate rules both the felicities and the infelicities <lb/>
            of every man. But I say, as all Christian men say, that the <lb/>
            divine predestination rules ove him, not fate. And I Know <lb/>
            that it decrees everything very rightly; though to unwise men <lb/>
            it does not appear so. They think that everything which <lb/>
            fulfils their desire, is God. It is no wonder, for they are <lb/>
            blinded by the darkness of their sins. But the divine provi­ <lb/>
            dence understands everything very rightly, though it seems <lb/>
            to us, through our folly, that it goes wrongly; because we <lb/>
            cannot perfectly understand it. He, however, ordains all <lb/>
            very rightly, though to us it sometimes does not appear so.</p>
          <p>§ IX. All men, the good as well as the wicked, seek after <lb/>
            the highest good. But the wicked are unable to come to the <lb/>
            high roof of all goods for this reason, that they do not seek <lb/>
            after it rightly. I know, however, that thou wilt on some <lb/>
            occasion say to me, What injustice can be greater, than that <lb/>
            he should permit it to come to pass, as it sometimes does, that <lb/>
            to the good unmixed evil happens in this world, and to the <lb/>
            wicked unmixed good; and at other times both mixed, as well <lb/>
            to the good as to the wicked ? But I ask thee whether thou <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>

              <note type="margin"> § X. </note> <lb/>
              thinkest that any man is so discerning, that he is able to know <lb/>
              every one aright, what he is, so that he may be neither better <lb/>
              nor worse than he thinks him ? I know, however, that they <lb/>
              cannot. Yet it is very often improperly the custom for some <lb/>
              persons to say that a man is deserving of reward, while others <lb/>
              say that he is deserving of punishment. Though any one may <lb/>
              observe what another does, he cannot know what he thinks. <lb/>
              Though he may know some part of his disposition, yet he <lb/>
              cannot know it all. I can moreover relate to thee an example, <lb/>
              whereby thou mayest more clearly understand this, though un­ <lb/>
              wise men cannot understand it. That is: Why does the good <lb/>
              physician give to this healthy man mild and sweet drink, and <lb/>
              to another healthy man bitter and strong ? And sometimes <lb/>
              also to the sick; to one mild; to another strong; to one <lb/>
              sweet ; to another bitter ? I know that every person who is <lb/>
              unacquainted with the art will wonder at it, why they do so. <lb/>
              But the physicians wonder not at it, because they know what <lb/>
              the others are ignorant of. For they know how to discover <lb/>
              and distinguish the infirmity of each -of them; and also the <lb/>
              arts which should be used with respect to it. What is the <lb/>
              health of souls, but virtue ? or what is their infirmity, but <lb/>
              vices ? Who then is a better physician of the soul, than he <lb/>
              who made it, that is, God ? He honours the good, and <lb/>
              punishes the wicked. He knows what each is deserving of. <lb/>
              It is no wonder, because he from the high roof sees it all; <lb/>
              and thence disposes and metes to each according to his <lb/>
              deserts.</p>
          <p>§ X. This then we call fate; when the wise God, who knows <lb/>
            every man's necessity, does or permits anything which we ex­ <lb/>
            pect Dot. And yet I may give thee some examples, in few <lb/>
            words, so far as human reason is able to understand the <lb/>
            divine nature. That is, then, that we sometimes know man <lb/>
            in one wise, and God knows him in another. Sometimes we <lb/>
            judge that he is the best, and then God knows that it is not <lb/>
            so. When anything comes to any person, either of good or of <lb/>
            evil, more than it appears to thee that he deserves, the in­ <lb/>
            justice is not in God, but the want of skill is in thyself, that <lb/>
            thou canst not rightly understand it. Yet it often happens <lb/>
            that men know a man in the same manner that God knows <lb/>
            him. It often happens that many men are so infirm, both in <lb/>
            mind and in body, that they cannot of their own accord do <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

              <note type="margin"> § XI. </note> <lb/>
              any good, or avoid any evil; and are, moreover, so impatient, <lb/>
              that they cannot with resignation bear any troubles. There­ <lb/>
              fore it often happens that God, through his mercy, wills not <lb/>
              to impose on them any intolerable affliction, lest they should <lb/>
              forsake their innocence, and become worse, if they are moved <lb/>
              and troubled. Some men are full virtuous in all virtue, and <lb/>
              full holy and righteous men. Then seems it to God unjust <lb/>
              that he should afflict such; and moreover death, which is <lb/>
              natural to all men to suffer, he makes more tranquil to them <lb/>
              than to other men : as formerly a certain wise man said, that <lb/>
              the divine power saved his darlings under the shadow of his <lb/>
              wings, and protected them as carefully as man does the apple <lb/>
              of his eye. Many so earnestly endeavour to please God, that <lb/>
              they desire of their own accord to suffer manifold troubles ; <lb/>
              because they desire to have greater honour, and greater fame, <lb/>
              and greater dignity with God, than those have who live more <lb/>
              pleasantly.</p>
          <p>§ XI. Frequently also the power of this world comes to <lb/>
            very good men, in order that the power of the wicked maybe <lb/>
            overthrown. To some men God gives both good and evil <lb/>
            mixed, because they earn both. Some he bereaves of their <lb/>
            wealth very soon, when they first are happy, lest through <lb/>
            long felicities they should too much exalt themselves, and <lb/>
            thence become proud. He permits some to be vexed with <lb/>
            severe trouble, that they may learn the virtue of patience by <lb/>
            the long affliction. Some fear difficulties more than they <lb/>
            need, though they may easily bear them. Some purchase <lb/>
            the honourable fame of this present life by their own death; <lb/>
            because they think that they have no other price worthy of <lb/>
            this fame, except their own life. Some men were formerly <lb/>
            unconquerable, so that no one could overcome them with any <pb n="230"/>

              <note type="margin"> § XII. </note> <lb/>
              torment. These set an example to their successors that they <lb/>
              should not be overcome by torments. In these it was evident <lb/>
              that they, for their good works, had the strength that man <lb/>
              might not overcome them. But the wicked, for their evil <lb/>
              works, have been punished beyond measure, in order that <lb/>
              the punishments might restrain others from daring to do so, <lb/>
              and also might amend those whom they then afflict. It is a <lb/>
              very clear token to the wise, that he ought not to love these <lb/>
              worldly goods immoderately, because they often come to the <lb/>
              worst men. But what shall we say concerning the present <lb/>
              wealth which often comes to the good ? What is it else but <lb/>
              a token of the future wealth, and a beginning of the reward <lb/>
              which God has decreed to him for his good disposition ? I <lb/>
              suppose also that God gives felicities to many wicked men <lb/>
              because he knows their nature and their disposition to be <lb/>
              such, that they would not for any troubles be the better, but <lb/>
              the worse. But the good physician, that is God, heals their <lb/>
              minds with the wealth, until they learn whence the wealth <lb/>
              came to them, and the man submits to him lest he take away <lb/>
              the wealth from him, or him from the wealth, and turns his <lb/>
              manners to good, and forsakes the vices and the evil which <lb/>
              he before through his poverty did. Some indeed are the <lb/>
              worse if they have wealth, because they become proud ou <lb/>
              account of the wealth, and enjoy it without moderation.</p>
          <p>§ XII. To many men also these worldly felicities are there­ <lb/>
            fore given, that they may recompeuse the good for their good, <lb/>
            and the wicked for their evil. For the good and the wicked <lb/>
            are ever at variance with each other, and also sometimes the <lb/>
            wicked are at variance between themselves, and moreover a <lb/>
            wicked man is sometimes at variance with himself. For he <lb/>
            knows that he does amiss, and bethinks himself of the retribu- <pb n="232"/>

              tion, and yet will not cease therefrom, nor indeed suffer him­ <lb/>
              self to repent of it; and therefore through Perpetual fear he <lb/>
              cannot be at peace with himself. Frequently it also happens <lb/>
              that the wicked forsakes his evil for hatred of some other <lb/>
              wicked man; because he would thereby upbraid the other, <lb/>
              by avoiding his manners. He labours then about this as he <lb/>
              best may ; that is, he takes care to be unlike the other; for <lb/>
              it is the custom of the divine power to work good from evil. <lb/>
              But it is permitted to no man that he should be able to know <lb/>
              all that God has decreed, or indeed to recount that which he <lb/>
              has wrought. But in these things they have enough, to un­ <lb/>
              derstand that the creator and the governor of all things, <lb/>
              guides, and rightly made all that he made, and has not <lb/>
              wrought, nor yet works any evil, but drives away every evil <lb/>
              from all his realm. But if thou wilt inquire concerning the <lb/>
              supreme government of the Almighty God,then wilt thou <lb/>
              not perceive evil in anything, though it now seem to thee <lb/>
              that here is much in this middle-earth. Since it is just that <lb/>
              the good have good reward for their good, and the wicked <lb/>
              have punishment for their evil; that is no evil which is just, <lb/>
              but is good. But I perceive that I have wearied thee with <lb/>
              this long discourse, wherefore thou art now desirous of songs. <lb/>
              And now accept them, for it is the medicine and the drink <lb/>
              which thou hast long wished for, that thou mayest more <lb/>
              easily receive the instruction.</p>
          <p>§ XIII. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began <lb/>
            he again to sing, and thus said: If thou desirest with pure <lb/>
            mind to understand the supreme government, behold the <lb/>
            stars of the high heaven. The heavenly bodies preserve the <lb/>
            ancient peace in which they were created; so that the fiery <lb/>
            sun does not touch that part of the heaven in which the moon <lb/>
            moves; nor does the moon touch that part in which the sun <lb/>
            moves, so long as she is therein. Nor does the star which we <lb/>
            call Ursa ever come into the west, though all other stars go <lb/>
            with the sky after the sun to the earth. It is no wonder, for <lb/>
            it is very near to the upper end of the axis. But the star <lb/>
            which we call the evening star, when it is seen westwardly, <lb/>
            then betokens it the evening. It then goes after the sua <pb n="234"/>

              into the earth's shade, till it runs off behind the sun, and <lb/>
              comes up before the sun. Then we call it the morning star, <lb/>
              because it comes up in the east, and announces the sun's ap­ <lb/>
              proach. The sun and the moon have divided the day and the <lb/>
              night very equally between them; and they reign very harmo­ <lb/>
              niously through divine providence, and unceasingly serve the <lb/>
              Almighty God till doomsday, God does not suffer them to <lb/>
              be on one side of the heaven, lest they should destroy other <lb/>
              creatures. But the peace-loving God regulates and adapts <lb/>
              all creatures, when they exist together. Sometimes the wet <lb/>
              flies the dry. Sometimes he mingles the fire with the cold. <lb/>
              Sometimes the light and bright fire goes upwards, and the <lb/>
              heavy earth is stationed beneath by the king's commaud. The <lb/>
              earth brings yearly every fruit, and every production; and the <lb/>
              hot summer dries and prepares seeds and fruits; and the <lb/>
              fruitful harvest brings ripe corn. Hails, and snows, and <lb/>
              frequent rain moisten the earth in winter. Hence the earth <lb/>
              receives the seed, and causes it to grow in spring. But the <lb/>
              creator of all things nourishes in the earth all growing fruits, <lb/>
              and produces them all; and hides when he will, and shows <lb/>
              when he will, and takes away when he will. While the <lb/>
              creatures obey, the supreme creator sits on his throne. <lb/>
              Thence he guides with reins all creatures. It is no wonder; <lb/>
              for he is king, and lord, and fountain, and origin, and law, <lb/>
              and wisdom, and righteous judge. He sends all creatures <lb/>
              on his errands, and be commands them all to come again. If <lb/>
              the only steadfast king did not support all creatures, then <lb/>
              would they all be dissolved and dispersed; and all creatures <lb/>
              would come to nought. But they have in common one love <lb/>
              in serving such a lord, and rejoice because he rules over <lb/>
              them. That is no wonder, for they could not else exist, if <lb/>
              they served not their author. Then ceased Wisdom the <lb/>
              song, and said to me:</p>

            to men, or whether it seem evil to them. Then said I: I <lb/>

              for every fortune, whether it be pleasant, or whether it be <lb/>
              unpleasant, comes to the good for this reason, that it may do <lb/>
              one of two things; that it may either admonish him, in order <lb/>
              that he should do better than he did before; or reward him, <lb/>
              because he before did well. And again, every fortune which <lb/>
              comes to the wicked, comes on account of two things, whether <lb/>
              it be severe or whether it be pleasant. If severe fortune come <lb/>
              to the wicked, then it comes for retribution of his evil, or else <lb/>
              for correction and for admonition, that he should not do so <lb/>
              again. Then began I to wonder, and said : This is a thoroughly <lb/>
              right explanation which thou givest. Then said he: It is as <lb/>
              thou sayest. But I am desirous, if thou art willing, that we <lb/>
              should turn ourselves a little while to this people's speech, <lb/>
              lest they say that we speak above man's comprehension. <lb/>
              Then said I: Speak what thou wilt.</p>
          <p>§ II. Then said he: Dost thou think that that is not good <lb/>
            which is useful ? Then said I: I think that it is. Then said <lb/>
            he: Every fortune is useful which does either of two things; <lb/>
            either instructs or corrects. Then said I: That is true. Then <lb/>
            said he: Adverse fortune is good for those who contend <lb/>
            against vices, and are inclined to good. Then said I: I <lb/>
            cannot deny it. Then said he: What thinkest thou con­ <lb/>
            cerning the good fortune, which often comes to good men in <lb/>
            this world, as if it were a foretoken of eternal blessings ? <lb/>
            Can this people say that it is evil fortune ? Then smiled I, <lb/>
            and said: No man says that, but every one says that it is <lb/>
            very good, as it moreover is. Then said he: What thinkest <lb/>
            thou of the more invisible fortune which often threatens to <lb/>
            punish the wicked ? Does this people think that this is good <lb/>
            fortune ? Then said I: They do not think that this is good <lb/>
            fortune, but think that it is very miserable. Then said he: <lb/>
            Let us beware that we think not as this people think. If we <lb/>
            in this respect think what this people think, then shall we <lb/>
            forsake all wisdom, and all righteousness. Then said I: Why <lb/>
            shall we ever the more forsake them ? Then said he; Be- <pb n="238"/>

              cause vulgar men say that every severe and unpleasant for­ <lb/>
              tune is evil. But we should not believe it, since every fortune <lb/>
              is good, as we before said, whether it be severe, or whether it <lb/>
              be pleasaut. Then was I afraid, and said: That is true which <lb/>
              thou sayest. I know not, however, who dares to mention it <lb/>
              to foolish men, for no foolish man can believe it.</p>
          <p>§ III. Then replied Wisdom sharply, and said: Therefore <lb/>
            no wise man ought to fear or lament, in whatever wise it may <lb/>
            happen to him, or whether severe fortune or agreeable may <lb/>
            come to him; any more than the brave man ought to lament <lb/>
            about this, how often he must fight. His praise is not the <lb/>
            less; but the opinion is, that it is the greater. So is also <lb/>
            the wise man's reward the greater, if more adverse, and <lb/>
            severer fortune comes to him. Therefore no wise man should <lb/>
            be desirous of a soft life, if he makes account of any virtues, <lb/>
            or any honour here in the world, or of eternal life after this <lb/>
            world. But every wise man ought to contend, both against <lb/>
            the severe fortune, and against the pleasant, lest he through <lb/>
            the pleasant fortune should be presumptuous, or through the <lb/>
            severe, despair. But it is necessary for him that he seek the. <lb/>
            middle-way, between the severe fortune and the agreeable: <lb/>
            that he may not desire more agreeable fortune, or greater <lb/>
            security than is fit: nor again too severe fortune; because <lb/>
            be is unable to bear excess of either. But it is in their nwn <lb/>
            power, which of them they will choose. therefore, they <lb/>
            desire to find the middle-way, theu ought they themselves to <lb/>
            moderate to themselves the pleasant and the prosperous for­ <lb/>
            tune. Then will God moderate to them the severe fortune; <lb/>
            both in this world, and in that to come, so that they may <lb/>
            easily bear it.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Well ! 0 wise men, well! Proceed ye all in the way <lb/>
            which the illustrious examples of the good men, and of the <lb/>
            men desirous of honour, who were'before you, point out to <lb/>
            you. 0, ye weak and idle! why are ye so useless, and so <pb n="240"/>

              enervated ? Why will ye not inquire about the wise men, <lb/>
              and about the men desirous of honour, what they were who <lb/>
              were before you ? And why will ye not then, after ye have <lb/>
              found out their manners, imitate them, as ye best may ? For <lb/>
              they strove after honour in this world, and sought good fame <lb/>
              by good works, and set a good example to those who should <lb/>
              be after them. Therefore they now dwell above the stars, iu <lb/>
              everlasting happiness, for their good works. Here ends the <lb/>
              fourth book of Boethius, and begins the fifth.</p>
          <p>§ V. When Wisdom had ended this discourse, then said I: <lb/>
            Very right is thy doctrine. But I would now remind thee <lb/>
            of the manifold instruction which thou before promisedst me, <lb/>
            concerning the predestination of God. But I wish first to <lb/>
            know from thee whether that be aught which we often hear, <lb/>
            that men say concerning some things, that it will happen by <lb/>
            chance. Then said he: I would rather that I hastened <lb/>
            towards this, that I might perform to thee what I before <lb/>
            promised thee, and might teach thee as short a way, as I <lb/>
            shortest might find, to thy native country. * But this is so <lb/>
            far out of our way, out of the way which we intended to <lb/>
            travel, that it would be more expedient to return, and un­ <lb/>
            derstand what thou before askedst me. But I also fear that <lb/>
            I should lead thee hither and thither in paths out of thy way, <lb/>
            so that thou mightest not again find thy way. It is no <lb/>
            wonder if thou shouldest grow weary, if I lead thee beside <lb/>
            the way. Then said I: Thou needest not fear that: but I <lb/>
            shall be very glad if thou leadest me whither I desire thee. <lb/>
            Then said he: I will instruct thee by discourses, as I always <lb/>
            did : and will say to thee, that it is naught that men say, that <lb/>
            anything may happen by chauce. Because everything comes <lb/>
            from certain things, therefore it has not happened by chance: <lb/>
            but if it had come from nothing, then it would have happened <lb/>
            by chance. <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="242"/>

          <p>§ VI. Then said I: But whence came the name first? <lb/>
            Then said he: My beloved Aristotle has explained it in the <lb/>
            book called Physica. Then said I : How has he explained it ? <lb/>
            Then said he: Men said formerly, when anything happened <lb/>
            to them unexpectedly, that it happened by chance: as if any <lb/>
            one should dig the earth, and find there a hoard of gold, and <lb/>
            then say, that it had happened by chance. I know, however, <lb/>
            that if the digger had not dug the earth, or man had not <lb/>
            before hid the gold there, then: he would not have found it. <lb/>
            Therefore it was not found by chance. But the divine pre­ <lb/>
            destination instructed whom he would that he should hide <lb/>
            the gold, and afterwards whom he would, that he should <lb/>
            find it.</p>
          <p>§ VII. Then said I: I perceive that this is as thou sayest: <lb/>
            but I would ask thee whether we have any freedom, or any <lb/>
            power, what we may do, and what we may not do ? or whether <lb/>
            the divine predestination, or fate, compels us to what they <lb/>
            will ? Then said he: We have much power. There is no <lb/>
            rational creature which has not freedom. Whosoever has <lb/>
            reason, is able to judge and discern what he ought to desire, <lb/>
            and what he ought to shun. And every man has this freedom, <lb/>
            that he knows what he wills, andwhat he wills not. And yet <lb/>
            all rational creatures have not equal freedom. Angels have <lb/>
            right judgments and good will; and whatever they desire they <lb/>
            very easily obtain, because they desire nothing wrong. There <lb/>
            is no created being which has freedom and reason except <lb/>
            angels and men. Men have always freedom; the more as <lb/>
            they lead their mind nearer to divine things; and they have <lb/>
            so much the less freedom,as they lead the willof their miud <lb/>
            nearer to this worldly honour. They have not any freedom <lb/>
            when they, of their own accord, subject themselves to vices. <lb/>
            Butas soon as they turn awaytheirmindfrom good, so soon <lb/>
            they -become blind with folly. But one Almighty God <lb/>
            exists in his high city, who sees every man's thought, and <note type="footnote"> B. 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>

              discerns his words and his deeds, and renders to every one <lb/>
              according to his works. When Wisdom had made this speech, <lb/>
              then began he to sing, and thus said:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER XLI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ I. THOUGH Homer the good poet, who with the Greeks <lb/>
            was the best, he was Virgil's master; Virgil was with the <lb/>
            Latin men the best, though Homer in his poems greatly <lb/>
            praised the nature of the sun, and her excellences, and her <lb/>
            brightness ; yet she cannot shine upon all creatures, nor those <lb/>
            creatures which she may shine upon, can she shiue upon all <lb/>
            equally, nor shine through them all within. But it is not so <lb/>
            with the Almighty God, who is the maker of all creatures. <lb/>
            He beholds and sees through all his creatures equally. Him <lb/>
            we may call, without falsehood, the true sun.</p>
          <p>§ II. When Wisdom bad sung this lay, then was he silent <lb/>
            a little while. Then said I: A certain doubt has much troubled <lb/>
            me. Then said he: What is that ? Then said I : It isthis, <lb/>
            that thou sayest that God gives to every one freedom as well <lb/>
            to do good as evil, whichsoever he will: and thou sayest also <lb/>
            that God knows everything before it comes to pass ; and thou <lb/>
            sayest also, that nothing comes to pass unless God wills and <lb/>
            permits it: and thou sayest that it must all proceed as he has <lb/>
            ordained. Now I wonder at this, why he permits that wicked <lb/>
            men have the freedom that they may do either good or evil, <lb/>
            whichsoever they will, since he before knows that they will do <lb/>
            evil. Then said he: I can very easily answer thee this inquiry. <lb/>
            How would it please thee, if there were some very powerful <lb/>
            king, and he had not any free man in all his realm, but all <lb/>
            were slaves ? Then said I: I should not think it at all right, <lb/>
            or moreover suitable, if men in a state of slavery should serve <lb/>
            him. Then said he: How much more unnatural would it be, <lb/>
            if God had not in all his kingdom any free creature under his <lb/>
            power? Therefore he created two rational creatures free, <pb n="246"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              angels and men. To these he gave the great gift of freedom, <lb/>
              that they might do either good or evil, whichsoever they <lb/>
              would. He gave a very sure gift, and a very sure law with <lb/>
              the gift, to every man until his end. That is the freedom, <lb/>
              that man may do what he will; and that is the law, which <lb/>
              renders to every man according to his works, both in this <lb/>
              world, and in that to come, good or evil, whichsoever he does. <lb/>
              And men may attain through this freedom whatsoever they <lb/>
              will, except that they cannot avoid death. But they may by <lb/>
              good works delay it, so that it may come later: and more­ <lb/>
              over, they may sometimes defer it till old age, if they do not <lb/>
              cease to have good will to good works, that is, good. Then <lb/>
              said I: Well hast thou set me right in the doubt, and in the <lb/>
              trouble wherein I before was concerning freedom. But I am <lb/>
              still disquieted with much more trouble, almost to despair. <lb/>
              Then said he : What is this great disquiet ? Then said I: It <lb/>
              is concerning the predestination of God. For we sometimes <lb/>
              hear say, that everything must so come to pass as God at the <lb/>
              beginning had decreed, and that no man can alter it. Now <lb/>
              methinks that he does wrong, when he honours the good, and <lb/>
              also when he punishes the wicked, if it is true that it was so <lb/>
              ordained to them that they could not do otherwise. In vain <lb/>
              we labour when we pray, and when we fast, or give alms, if <lb/>
              we have not therefore more favour than those who in all <lb/>
              things walk according to their own will, and run after their <lb/>
              bodily lust.</p>
          <p>§ III. Then said he: This is the old complaint, which thou <lb/>
            hast long bewailed, and many also before thee: one of whom <lb/>
            was a certain Marcus, by another name Tullius; by a third <lb/>
            name he was called Cicero, who was a consul of the Romans. <lb/>
            He was a philosopher. He was very much occupied with this <lb/>
            same question: but he could not bring it to any end at that <lb/>
            time, because their mind was occupied with the desires of this <lb/>
            world. But I say to thee, if that is true which ye say, it was <lb/>
            a vain command in divine books, which God commanded, that <pb n="248"/>

              <note type="margin"> § III. </note> <lb/>
              man should forsake evil and do good; and again the saying <lb/>
              which he said, that as man labours more, so shall he receive <lb/>
              greater reward. And I wonder why thou shouldest have for­ <lb/>
              gotten all that we before mentioned. We before said that the <lb/>
              divine predestination wrought all good, and no evil: nor de­ <lb/>
              creed to work, nor ever wrought any. Moreover, we proved <lb/>
              that to be good which to vulgar men seemed evil: that is, that <lb/>
              man should afflict or punish any one for his evil. Did we not <lb/>
              also say in this same book, that God had decreed to give <lb/>
              freedom to men, and so did; and if they exercised the freedom <lb/>
              well, that he would greatly honour them with eternal power; <lb/>
              and if they abused the freedom, that lie would then punish <lb/>
              them with death ? He ordained that if they at all sinned <lb/>
              through the freedom, they afterwards through the freedom <lb/>
              should make amends for it by repentance; and that if any <lb/>
              of them were so hard-hearted that he did not repent, he <lb/>
              should have just punishment. All creatures he bad made <lb/>
              servile except angels and meu. Because the other creatures <lb/>
              are servile, they perform their services till doomsday. But <lb/>
              men and angels, who are free, forsake their services. How <lb/>
              can men say that the divine predestination had decreed what <lb/>
              it fulfils not ? Or how can they excuse themselves that they <lb/>
              should not do good, when it is written that God will requite <lb/>
              every man according to his works ? Wherefore, then, should <lb/>
              any man be idle, that he work not? Then said I: Thou hast <lb/>
              sufficiently relieved me from the doubting of my mind by the <lb/>
              questions which I have asked thee. But I would still ask <lb/>
              thee a question, which I am perplexed about. Then said be: <lb/>
              What is that ? Then said I: I am well aware that God <lb/>
              knows everything beforehand, both good and evil, before it <lb/>
              happens, but I know not whether it all shall unchangeably <lb/>
              happen, which he knows and has decreed. Then said he: It <pb n="250"/>

              <note type="margin"> § IV. </note> <lb/>
              need not all happen unchangeably. But some of it shall <lb/>
              happen unchangeably, that is, what shall be our necessity, <lb/>
              and shall be his will. But some of-it is so arranged that it <lb/>
              is not necessary, and yet hurts not if it happen ; nor is there <lb/>
              any harm if itdo not happen. Consider now concerning <lb/>
              thyself, whether thou hast so tirmly designed anything, that <lb/>
              thou thinkest that it never with thy consent may be changed, <lb/>
              nor thou exist without it. Or whether thou again in any <lb/>
              design art so inconsistent, that it aids thee, whether it <lb/>
              happen, or whether it happen not. Many a one is there of <lb/>
              the things which God knows before it may happen, and knows <lb/>
              also that it will hurt his creatures if it happen. He does not <lb/>
              know it, because he wills that it should happen, but because <lb/>
              he wills to provide that it may not happen. Thus a good pilot <lb/>
              perceives a great storm of wind before it happens, aud gives <lb/>
              order to furl the sail, and moreover sometimes to lower the <lb/>
              mast, and let go the cable, if he first restrain the perverse <lb/>
              wind, and so provides against the storm.</p>
          <p>§ IV. Then said I : Very well hast thou assisted me in this <lb/>
            argument; and I wonder why so many wise men have so <lb/>
            greatly laboured with this question, and found so little cer­ <lb/>
            tain. Then said he : What dost thou so greatly wonder at, <lb/>
            so easy as it is to understand? Dost thou not know that <lb/>
            many a thing is not understood according as it is, but ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the measure of the understanding which inquires <lb/>
            after it ? Such is wisdom, that no man in this world can com­ <lb/>
            prehend it such as it is. But every one strives, according to <lb/>
            the measure of his understanding, that he might comprehend <lb/>
            it if he could. But wisdom is able to entirely comprehend us <lb/>
            such as we are, though we cannot entirely comprehend it <pb n="252"/>

              <note type="margin"> § v. </note> <lb/>
              such as it is. For wisdom ia God. He sees all our works, <lb/>
              both good and evil, before they are done, or even thought of. <lb/>
              But he does not compel us the more, so that we necessarily <lb/>
              must do good, nor prevent us from doing evil; because he <lb/>
              has given us freedom. I can also show thee some examples, <lb/>
              whereby thou mayest more easily understand this discourse. <lb/>
              Thou knowest that sight, and hearing, and feeling, perceive <lb/>
              the body of a man, and yet they perceive it not alike. The <lb/>
              ears perceive that which they hear, and yet they perceive not <lb/>
              the body altogether such as it is. The feeling may touch it, <lb/>
              and feel that it is a body, but cannot feel whether it be black <lb/>
              or white, fair or not fair. But the sight in the first instance, <lb/>
              as the eyes look thereon, perceives all the form of the body. <lb/>
              But I would still give some explanation, that thou mayest <lb/>
              understand that which thou wast wondering at.</p>
          <p>§ V. Then said I: What is that ? Then said be; It is that <lb/>
            the same man perceives in separate ways what he perceives in <lb/>
            others. He perceives it through the eyes separately; through <lb/>
            the ears separately; through his imagination separately; <lb/>
            through reason separately, through intelligence. Many living <lb/>
            creatures are unmoving, as, for instance, shell-fishes are, and <lb/>
            have, nevertheless, some portion of sense, for they could not <lb/>
            otherwise live, if they bad no particle of sense. Some can <lb/>
            see; some can hear; some can feel; some can amell. But <lb/>
            the moving beasts are more like to men, because they have <lb/>
            all which the unmoving have, and also more; that is, that <lb/>
            they imitate men : love what they love, and hate what they <lb/>
            hate; and fly from what they hate, and seek what they love. <lb/>
            But men have all that we before mentioned, and also, in ad­ <lb/>
            dition thereto, the great gift of reason. But angels have in­ <lb/>
            telligence. On this account are the creatures thus formed, <lb/>
            that the unmoving may not exalt themselves above the <pb n="254"/>

              moving, or strive with them: nor the moving, above men; <lb/>
              nor men above the angels; nor the angels against God. But <lb/>
              it is wretched that the greatest part of men do not look on <lb/>
              that which is given them, that is reason: nor regard that <lb/>
              which is above them, that is, what angels and wise men have, <lb/>
              namely, intelligence. But most men imitate cattle, inasmuch <lb/>
              as they follow worldly lusts, like cattle. But if we had any <lb/>
              portion of undoubting intelligence, as angels have, then might <lb/>
              we perceive that that intelligence is much better than our <lb/>
              reason. Though we contemplate many things, we have little <lb/>
              understanding free from doubt But to the angels there is <lb/>
              no doubt of any of the things which they know ; therefore is <lb/>
              their understanding as much better than our reason, as our <lb/>
              reason is better than the understanding of cattle is, or any <lb/>
              portion of that intellect which is given them, either to prone <lb/>
              cattle, or to those not prone. But let us now elevate our <lb/>
              minds, as we highest may, towards the high roof of the <lb/>
              supreme intelligence, that thou mayest most readily and <lb/>
              most easily come to thine own country, whence thou before <lb/>
              earnest. There may thy mind and thy reason see plainly that <lb/>
              which it now doubts about in everything, both concerning the <lb/>
              divine foreknowledge, which we have often discoursed about; <lb/>
              and concerning our freedom ; and concerning all things.</p>
          <p>§ VI. When Wisdom had ended this speech, then began he <lb/>
            to sing, and thus said: Thou mayest perceive that many an <lb/>
            animal moves variously upon the earth, and they are of very <lb/>
            dissimilar form, and go differently. Some lie with the whole <lb/>
            body on the earth, and so go creeping, because neither feet <lb/>
            nor wings support them: and some are two-footed; some <lb/>
            four-footed; some flying; and all, nevertheless, are inclined <lb/>
            downwards towards the earth, and then seek either what they <lb/>
            list, or what is needful for them. But man alone goes up­ <lb/>
            right. This betokens that he ought more to direct his thought <lb/>
            upwards than downwards, lest the mind should be inferior to <lb/>
            the body. When Wisdom had sung this lay, then said he: <pb n="256"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THEREFORE we ought with all our power to inquire con­ <lb/>
            cerning God, that we may know what he is. Though it may <lb/>
            not be our lot that we should know what he is, we ought <lb/>
            nevertheless, according to the measure of understanding <lb/>
            which he gives us, to strive after it: for, as we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, man must know everything according to the <lb/>
            measure of his understanding, since we are not able to know <lb/>
            everything such as it is. Every creature, however, whether <lb/>
            rational or irrational, testifies this, that God is eternal. For <lb/>
            never would so many creatures, and so great and so fair, <lb/>
            submit themselves to an inferior being, and to less power <lb/>
            than they all are, nor indeed to equally great. Then said I: <lb/>
            What is eternity ? Then said he: Thou askest me about a <lb/>
            great thing, and difficult to understand. If thou wouldest <lb/>
            understand it, thou must first have the eyes of thy mind <lb/>
            clean and clear. I cannot conceal from thee anything which <lb/>
            I know. Knowest thou that there are three things in this <lb/>
            middle-earth ? One is temporary, which has both beginning <lb/>
            and end; and I nevertheless know nothing of that which is <lb/>
            temporary, neither its beginning nor its end. Another thing <lb/>
            is eternal, and has beginning, and has no end; and I know <lb/>
            when it begins, and I know that it never will end: that is, <lb/>
            angels and men's souls. The third thing is eternal, without <lb/>
            end, and without beginning, that is, God. Among the three <lb/>
            is a very great difference. If we should inquire into the <lb/>
            whole of it, then should we come late to the end of this book, <lb/>
            or never! But one thing thou must necessarily first know, <lb/>
            why God is called the highest eternity. Then said I: Why ? <lb/>
            Then said he: Because we know very little of that which was <lb/>
            before us, except by memory, and by inquiry; and still less <lb/>
            of that which shall be after us. That alone is truly present <lb/>
            to us, which at the time is: but to him all is present, both <lb/>
            what was before, and what now is, and what after us shall <lb/>
            be; it is all present to him. His riches increase not, nor, <lb/>
            moreover, do they ever diminish. He never recollects any­ <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="258"/>

              thing, because he never forgets anything. He neither seeks <lb/>
              nor inquires after anything, because he knows it all. He <lb/>
              searches for nothing, because he has lost nothing. He pur­ <lb/>
              sues not anything, because nothing can fly from him. He <lb/>
              fears nothing, because he has none more powerful, nor indeed <lb/>
              any like him. He is always giving, and nothing of his ever <lb/>
              decreases. He is always Almighty, because he always wills <lb/>
              good and never any evil. There is not need to him of any­ <lb/>
              thing. He is always seeing, he never sleeps. He is always <lb/>
              equally gracious. He is always eternal, for the time never <lb/>
              was when he was not, nor ever will be. He is always free; <lb/>
              nor is he compelled to any work. By his divine power he is <lb/>
              everywhere present. His greatness no man can measure; <lb/>
              yet this is not to be understood bodily, but spiritually, even <lb/>
              as wisdom is, and righteousness, for he is that himself. But <lb/>
              what are ye then proud of, or why lift ye up yourselves <lb/>
              against so high power ? For ye can do nothing against him. <lb/>
              For the Eternal and the Almighty always sits on the throne <lb/>
              of his power. Thence he is able to see all, and renders to <lb/>
              every one with justice, according to his works. Therefore it <lb/>
              is not in vain that we have hope in God; for he changes <lb/>
              not as we do. But pray ye to him humbly, for he is very <lb/>
              bountiful and very merciful. Lift up your minds to him <lb/>
              with your hands, and pray for that which is right, and is <lb/>
              needful to you, for he will not refuse you. Hate, and fly <lb/>
              from evil as ye best may. Love virtues and follow them. <lb/>
              Ye have great need that ye always do well, for ye always in <lb/>
              the presence of the Eternal and Almighty God do all that ye <lb/>
              do. I He beholds it all, and he will recompense it all. AMEN <note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            I beseech thee by thy great mercy, and by the sign of the <lb/>
            holy cross, and by the virginity of Saint Mary, and by the <lb/>
            obedience of Saint Michael, and by the love of all thy saints, <lb/>
            and by their merits; that thou wouldest direct me better than <lb/>
            I have done towards thee: and direct me to thy will, and <lb/>
            to my soul's need, better than I myself know: and make <lb/>
            steadfast my mind to thy will, and to my soul's need: and <lb/>
            strengthen me against the temptations of the devil; and re­ <lb/>
            move from me impure lust, and all unrighteousness; and <lb/>
            defend me against mine enemies visible and invisible; and <lb/>
            teach me to do thy will; that I may inwardly love thee <lb/>
            before all things, with pure mind, and with pure body; for <lb/>
            thou art my Creator, and my Redeemer, my Help, my Com­ <lb/>
            fort, my Trust, and my Hope. To thee be praise, and glory <lb/>

            Alfred was translator of this book."—Although this preface is written in <lb/>
            the third person, yet there is no doubt that Alfred himself was the writer, <lb/>
            for he explains his method of translating, alludes to "the various and <lb/>
            manifold occupations which often busied him both in mind and body," <lb/>
            beseeches the reader to " pray for him, and not to blame him if he should <lb/>
            more rightly understand it than he could;" and finally, offers the apology <lb/>
            that " every man must, according to the measure of his understanding, <lb/>
            and according to his leisure, speak that which he speaks, and do that <lb/>
            which he does." The style of this preface is very similar to the one which <lb/>
            Alfred prefixed to his version of Pope Gregory's Pastoral, and also to that <lb/>

          <p>Note 2, p. 2, 1. 2.—"<unclear>Ræbgofca</unclear> anb <unclear>allepica</unclear>."—The invasions of <lb/>
            Radagaisus and Alaric took place early in the fifth century, and, after <lb/>
            many years of desolating wars, Theodoric, an Ostrogoth, said to he the <lb/>
            fourteenth in lineal descent of the royal line of Amala, acquired possession <lb/>
            of Rome. Theodoric was a Christian, but had been educated in the tenets <lb/>
            of Arins. For many years he gave the fullest toleration to the profession <lb/>
            of the Catholic Faith, and went so far as to behead one of his officers for <lb/>
            becoming an Arian, saying, " If thou couldst not continue true to thy God, <lb/>
            how canst thou prove faithful to me who am but a man ?" At length, <lb/>
            however, apprehending danger to his throne, and suspecting the Catholics <lb/>
            to be in league with his enemies, he withheld the toleration he had <lb/>
            granted, and became a persecutor of the orthodox faith. The oppressions <lb/>
            which he beheld, roused the patriotism of Boethius, a noble Roman, distin­ <lb/>
            guished for his many and varied accomplishments. He entered into a cor­ <lb/>
            respondence with the Emperor Justin, at Constantinople, and this being <lb/>
            discovered, Theodoric caused him to be imprisoned in Ticinum, and while <lb/>
            there, he composed this treatise.</p>
          <p>Note 3, p. 2, 1. 8.—Literally, "that they might be worthy of their <lb/>
            ancient rights;" " <unclear>heojia</unclear> <unclear>ealbJuhta</unclear> <unclear>pyp)</unclear>&gt;e beon."—It may here be ob­ <lb/>
            served that the compound words which occur so frequently in Anglo-Saxon <lb/>
            are, for the most part, compounded from substantives and adjectives. The <lb/>
            adjective is frequently found in composition with its substantive, and <lb/>
            remains uninflected through all its cases. Thus the adjective " ealb," in <lb/>
            composition with the substantive " <unclear>Plht:</unclear>," makes " <unclear>ealhplh</unclear>'r:a," and <unclear/> <lb/>
            "ealbmhtum" in the genitive and dative and ablative plural; and in <note type="footnote"> 2 A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            composition with the substantive " <unclear>blaropb</unclear>," makes " <unclear>ealbhlajopb</unclear>,' and <lb/>
            " <unclear>ealbhlapopbum</unclear>" in the dative and ablative plural. Two substantives <lb/>
            are often compounded, the first having an adjective power. Thus " populb" <lb/>
            compounded with the substantives " <unclear>beap</unclear>" and " <unclear>ræl</unclear>'lS," respectively <lb/>
            makes " populb <unclear>beapum</unclear>" and " populb <unclear>paeljmm</unclear>" in, the dative and ablative <lb/>
            plural. This kind of composition is not limited to two words. The com­ <lb/>
            pound " <unclear>ealb</unclear>-hla¡opb," considered as one word, may again be com­ <lb/>
            pounded, as in the present chapter, with the substantive " cyn." The <lb/>
            latter word " <unclear>cyn</unclear>" only is then subject to inflection, " ealb" and " <unclear>hlaropb</unclear>" <lb/>
            remaining invariable. Accordingly we find " <unclear>ealb</unclear>-hla¡opb-cÿnner" in <lb/>
            the genitive singular; and a similar inflection will be found in many other <lb/>
            words.</p>
          <p>Note 4, p. 2, 1. 11.—John, the first Pope who bore that name, was sent <lb/>
            on an embassy by Theodoric to the Emperor Justin, at Constantinople, <lb/>
            and on his return, Theodoric confined him in a dungeon at Ravenna, where <lb/>
            he died of want.</p>
          <p>Note 5, p. 2,1. 20.—"<unclear>Senbe</unclear> a<unclear>bigellice</unclear> <unclear>æpenbgeppifcu</unclear>.'* "He there­ <lb/>
            fore privately sent letters."—The verb Senbe is here used without a <lb/>
            nominative case being expressed, which, however, is to be understood, and <lb/>
            sought for in the preceding sentence.</p>
          <p>Note 6, p. 4, 1. 22.—" Se <unclear>pipbom</unclear>."—In several parts of this work the <lb/>
            reader will meet with inconsistencies resulting from the grammatical acci­ <lb/>
            dent of gender. In Anglo-Saxon many substantives are neuter, but the <lb/>
            far greater number, though denoting objects undistinguished by sex, are <lb/>
            considered, grammatically, as either masculine or feminine. These distinc­ <lb/>
            tions are for the most part regulated by tetminations, but are occasionally <lb/>
            arbitrary. As a rule, words ending in a are masculine, and those ending <lb/>
            in e are feminine; thus <unclear>ona</unclear>, the moon, is masculine; and Sunne, ths <lb/>
            sun, is feminine; while <unclear>Plf</unclear>, wife, or woman, is neuter. In the Latin <lb/>
            version of Boethius, Philosophy is described as a female, the word Philo­ <lb/>
            sophia being grammatically of the feminine gender, but Alfred generally <lb/>
            translates it by <unclear>plrbom</unclear>, which is invariably masculine. Hence we find <lb/>
            him applying masculine articles, pronouns and adjectives, to <unclear>plrbom</unclear>, who <lb/>
            is perhaps in the same page described as the <unclear>popfcep</unclear> <unclear>mobop</unclear> of Boethius. <lb/>
            In a few places Philosophia is rendered by <unclear>Lerceab¡nrner</unclear>, Reason, and is <lb/>
            then feminine. In one instance, c. iii. § 3, the words <unclear>pipbom</unclear> and <unclear/> <lb/>
            Ijepceabpij-nep are used conjointly to designate Philosophy, with a verb in <lb/>
            the plural number ; and yet the author immediately reverts to the singular, <lb/>
            and says, <unclear>pa</unclear> <unclear>ongan</unclear> be <unclear>eye</unclear> <unclear>TPpecan</unclear> <unclear>1</unclear> <unclear>cpse</unclear>'S.—Although the dialogue <lb/>
            should properly be carried on between Philosophy and Boethius, yet <lb/>
            Alfred frequently makes " the mind"—i.e. the mind of Boethius—one of <lb/>
            the interlocutors, instead of Boethius himself; and <unclear>CDob</unclear>, the mind, is a <lb/>
            substantive of the neuter gender.</p>
          <p>Note 7, p. 7,1. 23.—This opinion of Plato was powerfully enforced by <lb/>
            him in his dialogue De Republica, and it is a truth which will find an <lb/>

            word " unclænan;" the preceding portion being too much injured to <unclear>be</unclear> <lb/>
            deciphered. The variations in the readings of the Cottonian MS., which <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            occur before this word, were observed by Junius before the MS. was in­ <lb/>

            Anaxarchus, a philosopher of Abdera. Nicocreon, King of Salamis, in <lb/>
            Cyprus, having been offended by the philosopher's freedom, caused him to <lb/>
            be cruelly tormented; and when at length the tyrant, finding he could not <lb/>
            subdue the spirit of his victim, threatened to cut off his tongue, Anaxarcbus <lb/>
            bit it off, and spit it into the tyrant's face.—Cic. in Tusc. ii. 21.</p>

            caused him to be bound and laid upon the altar. Hercules, however, soon <lb/>
            disentangled himself, and sacrificed the tyrant and his son on the altar, <lb/>
            where he had slain his victims. The whole statement, however, is contra. <lb/>
            dieted by Herodotus.</p>

            was at length overcome by Xanthippus, and taken prisoner. He was sent <lb/>
            to Rome by the Carthaginiaus to sue for peace, but so far was he from de­ <lb/>
            siring peace, that he exhorted his countrymen to persevere in the war, as <lb/>
            it would be greatly for their advantage; and on his return to Carthage he <lb/>

            ability, power, strength, faculty, virtue, excellence, endowment, and many <lb/>

          <p>In c. xvi. § 2, Alfred mistook an epithet for a proper name, and here, in­ <lb/>
            stead of mentioning the name of Fabricius, the opponent of Pyrrhns, he <lb/>

            Latin of Boethius is, Id autem est bonum. That God is the supreme good <lb/>
            is not formally stated by Boethius until after a long train of reasoning, <lb/>
            which is followed by his address to the Deity. It first occurs in the part <lb/>
            of lib. iii. prosa 10, which corresponds with c. xxxiv. § 2, of the present <lb/>
            work. But in this, and some other passages, the construction showa that <lb/>
            Alfred meant to put God, instead of good. In Anglo-Saxon the word <unclear>gob</unclear> <lb/>
            denotes both God and good, so that there can be no other guide to its <lb/>
            meaning, independently of the context, than the introduction of a capital <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            letter. It may be remarked, however, that in the Cottonian MS. of this <lb/>

            opbælpe, in which he was followed by Mr. Cardale, and the Editor's <lb/>
            opinion coincides with their view.-See Rawlinson's Boethius, p. 167.</p>

            Papinian. But soon after his father's death, Caracalla dismissed Papinian <lb/>
            from his office, murdered his brother Geta, and then gave orders for the <lb/>
            execution of his former guardian, which was shortly afterwards carried <lb/>
            into effect. Boethius could scarcely have selected two more fitting <lb/>

            evidently a mistake, and unfortunately there is no other MS. to correct it, <lb/>
            inasmuch as those portions of Boethius which are metrical are entirely dif­ <lb/>
            ferent in the Bodleian and Cottonian MSS. The Bodleian contains the <lb/>
            metres in a prosaic form, and the Cottonian has them in verse. E. Thom­ <lb/>
            son, Esq., has kindly suggested to the Editor that <unclear>hæp</unclear> æp ner should be <unclear/> <lb/>
            tsej'fcsepnej', or rather feoj-fcaepnej1, darkness; and this alteration is in <lb/>
            some measure confirmed by the parallel passage in the metrical version, <lb/>
            viz.-: <unclear/> <lb/>
            bonne pile he reczan, <unclear/> <lb/>
            bæt hæpe runnan Tie, <lb/>

          <p>There can, therefore, be no impropriety in thus altering the reading of the <lb/>
            Bod. MS., and substituting for it a word which, while it gives clearness to <lb/>
            the passage, is in harmony with the Cott. MS.</p>
          <p>Note 45, p. 160, 1. 22.—The word "he" is redundant here, and makes <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>Note 66, p. 263, 1. 1.—-Ður Ælppeb <unclear>up</unclear>.—This introduction, which was <lb/>
            prefixed to the Cottonian MS., was scarcely the production of King Alfred <lb/>
            himself, although it is an additional proof, if any were wanting, that he <lb/>
            was the translator of Boethius, and the author of the metrical version. <lb/>
            What is usually called the prose version of Boethius, contains the metres, <lb/>
            but the translation is not in verse, although from the nature of the subject <lb/>
            it nearly approaches poetry. King Alfred, it is supposed, wrote the prose <lb/>
            when harassed with those “various and manifold worldly occupations <lb/>
            which often busied him both in mind and in body," of which he so feel­ <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            ingly complains; and when he had overcome the difficulties which beset <lb/>
            him, he reduced the translation of the metres to that form in which they <lb/>
            have been handed down to us, being at once a monument of royal industry, <lb/>
            and a pure specimen of the poetry of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
          <p>Note 67, p. 264.—Metre I.—What is here termed Metre I. is rather an <lb/>
            original introduction of King Alfred to the aubsequent poem. The work of <lb/>
            Boethius commences with a metre relative to his misfortunes, without <lb/>
            alluding to the cause of them: <lb/>
            " Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi, <lb/>
            Flebilis, heu, mæstos cogor inire modos."</p>
          <p>As the whole of the Anglo-Saxon metres are too paraphrastic to be strictly <lb/>
            called translations, it appears to be the simplest arrangement to number <lb/>
            them from this.</p>
          <p>Note 68, p. 264,1. <unclear>25</unclear>.—Lind-pigenbe.—Literally, fighting under shields <lb/>
            made of the linden, or lime-tree. Limb in its primary signification ia the <lb/>
            linden, or lime-tree, Tilia arbor; and in its secondary, or metaphorical <lb/>
            sense, it is a standard, or banner, as well as a shield. A similar meta­ <lb/>
            phorical use is made of the word ærc, an ash-tree. It often signifies a <lb/>
            apear or javelin; i.e. a weapon made of ash.</p>
          <p>Note 69, p. 270, I. 1.—Æala bu rc<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign>ppenb.—This metre, which contains <lb/>
            an address to the Deity, is a happy production of King Alfred'a muse. <lb/>
            With regard to Mr. Turner'a observation, that King Alfred'a prose transla­ <lb/>
            tion of the metres of Boethius haa more intellectual energy than his verse, <lb/>
            it may be remarked, that this is not singular. We uanally find much <lb/>
            greater energy in blank verse than in poetry, which is fettered with <lb/>
            rhyme. This may be exemplified by taking one of the poems ascribed to <lb/>
            Oasian, and reducing it to the regular laws of verse. Mr. Turner, however, <lb/>
            does justice to our author, by saying, “ There is an infusion of moral mind <lb/>
            and a graceful ease of diction in the writings of Alfred, which we shall <lb/>
            look for in vain to the same degree and effect among the other remains of <lb/>
            Anglo-Saxon poetry.”—History of the Anglo-Saxons, h. v. ch. iv.</p>
          <p>Note 70, p. 307, 1. 1.—Gala mm Dpihren,—This metre contains an­ <lb/>
            other address to the Deity, which, like the former one, is extremely beau­ <lb/>
            tiful. The Latin metre, beginning, 0 qui perpetuâ mundum ratione <lb/>
            gubernas, is so amplified, that the Anglo-Saxon version of it may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered an original composition.</p>

            day signifies the day of judgment: being derived from beman, to judge. <lb/>
            From hence also is derived our English verb, to deem, i.e. to form a judg­ <lb/>
            ment or opinion.</p><pb n="361"/>
