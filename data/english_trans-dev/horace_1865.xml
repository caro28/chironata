          <p><lb/>
            SCARCELY know what excuse I <lb/>
            can offer for making public this <lb/>
            attempt to "translate the untrans- <lb/>
            latable." No one can be more con- <lb/>
            vinced than I am that a really successful translator <lb/>
            must be himself an original poet; and where the <lb/>
            author translated happens to be one whose special <lb/>
            characteristic is incommunicable grace of expression, <lb/>
            the demand on the translator's powers would seem <lb/>
            to be indefinitely increased. Yet the time appears <lb/>
            to be gone by when men of great original gifts <lb/>
            could find satisfaction in reproducing the thoughts <lb/>
            and words of others ; and the work, if done at all, <lb/>
            must now be done by writers of inferior pretension. <lb/>
            Among these, however, there are still degrees; and <lb/>
            the experience which I have gained since I first <lb/>
            adventured as a poetical translator has made me <lb/>
            doubt whether I may not be ill-advised in resuming <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            the experiment under any circumstances. Still, an <lb/>
            experiment of this kind may have an advantage of <lb/>
            its own, even when it is unsuccessful; it may serve <lb/>
            as a piece of embodied criticism, showing what the <lb/>
            experimenter conceived to be the conditions of suc- <lb/>
            cess, and may thus, to borrow Horace's own meta- <lb/>
            phor of the whetstone, impart to others a quality <lb/>
            which it is itself without. Perhaps I may be allowed, <lb/>
            for a few moments, to combine precept with ex- <lb/>
            ample, and imitate my distinguished friend and <lb/>
            colleague, Professor Arnold, in offering some coun- <lb/>
            sels to the future translator of Horace's Odes, <lb/>
            referring, at the same time, by way of illustration, <lb/>
            to my own attempt.</p>
          <p>The first thing at which, as it seems to me, a <lb/>
            Horatian translator ought to aim, is some kind of <lb/>
            metrical conformity to his original. Without this <lb/>
            we are in danger of losing not only the metrical, but <lb/>
            the general effect of the Latin; we express ourselves <lb/>
            in a different compass, and the character of the <lb/>
            expression is altered accordingly. For instance, one <lb/>
            of Horace's leading features is his occasional sen- <lb/>
            tentiousness. It is this, perhaps more than any- <lb/>
            thing else, that has made him a storehouse of quo- <lb/>
            tations. He condenses a general truth in a few <lb/>
            words, and thus makes his wisdom portable. 11 Non, <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            si male nunc, et olim sic erit;” “ Nihil est ab omni <lb/>
            parte beatum;" " Omnes eodem cogimur,”—these <lb/>
            and similar expressions remain in the memory when <lb/>
            other features of Horace's style, equally charac- <lb/>
            teristic, but less obvious, are forgotten. It is almost <lb/>
            impossible for a translator to do justice to this sen- <lb/>
            tentious brevity unless the stanza in which he writes <lb/>
            is in some sort analogous to the metre of Horace. <lb/>
            If he chooses a longer and more diffuse measure, he <lb/>
            will be apt to spoil the proverb by expansion ; not <lb/>
            to mention that much will often depend on the very <lb/>
            position of the sentence in the stanza. Perhaps, in <lb/>
            order to preserve these external peculiarities, it may <lb/>
            be necessary to recast the expression, to substitute, <lb/>
            in fact, one form of proverb for another; but this is <lb/>
            far preferable to retaining the words in a diluted <lb/>
            form, and so losing what gives them their character. <lb/>
            I cannot doubt, then, that it is necessary in trans- <lb/>
            lating an Ode of Horace to choose some analogous <lb/>
            metre ; as little can I doubt that a translator of the <lb/>
            Odes should appropriate to each Ode some parti- <lb/>
            cular metre as its own. It may be true that Horace <lb/>
            himself does not invariably suit his metre to his <lb/>
            subject; the solemn Alcaic is used for a poem in <lb/>
            dispraise of serious thought and praise of wine; the <lb/>
            Asclepiad stanza in which Quintilius is lamented is <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            employed to describe the loves of Maecenas and <lb/>
            Licymnia. But though this consideration may in- <lb/>
            fluence us in our choice of an English metre, it is <lb/>
            no reason for not adhering to the one which we may <lb/>
            have chosen. If we translate an Alcaic and a <lb/>
            Sapphic Ode into the same English measure, be- <lb/>
            cause the feeling in both appears to be the same, <lb/>
            we are sure to sacrifice some important charac- <lb/>
            teristic of the original in the case of one or the <lb/>
            other, perhaps of both. It is better to try to make <lb/>
            an English metre more flexible than to use two dif- <lb/>
            ferent English metres to represent two different <lb/>
            aspects of one measure in Latin. I am sorry to say <lb/>
            that I have myself deviated from this rule occasion- <lb/>
            ally, under circumstances which I shall soon have <lb/>
            to explain; but though I may perhaps succeed in <lb/>
            showing that my offences have not been serious, I <lb/>
            believe the rule itself to be one of universal applica- <lb/>
            tion, always honoured in the observance, if not <lb/>
            always equally dishonoured in the breach.</p>
          <p>The question, what metres should be selected, is <lb/>
            of course one of very great difficulty. I can only <lb/>
            explain what my own practice has been, with some <lb/>
            of the reasons which have influenced me in parti- <lb/>
            cular cases. Perhaps we may take Milton's cele- <lb/>
            brated translation of the Ode to Pyrrha as a starting <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            point. There can be no doubt that to an English <lb/>
            reader the metre chosen does give much of the effect <lb/>
            of the original; yet the resemblance depends rather <lb/>
            on the length of the respective lines than on any <lb/>
            similarity in the cadences. But it is evident that <lb/>
            he chose the iambic movement as the ordinary <lb/>
            movement of English poetry; and it is evident, I <lb/>
            think, that in translating Horace we shall be right <lb/>
            in doing the same, as a general rule. Anapæstic <lb/>
            and other rhythms maybe beautiful and appropriate <lb/>
            in themselves, but they cannot be manipulated so <lb/>
            easily; the stanzas with which they are associated <lb/>
            bear no resemblance, as stanzas, to the stanzas of <lb/>
            Horace's Odes. I have then followed Milton in <lb/>
            appropriating the measure in question to the Latin <lb/>
            metre, technically called the fourth Asclepiad, at <lb/>
            the same time that I have substituted rhyme for <lb/>
            blank verse, believing rhyme to be an inferior <lb/>
            artist's only chance of giving pleasure. There still <lb/>
            remains a question about the distribution of the <lb/>
            rhymes, which here, as in most other cases, I have <lb/>
            chosen to make alternate. Successive rhymes have <lb/>
            their advantages, but they do not give the effect of <lb/>
            interlinking, which is so natural in a stanza; the <lb/>
            quatrain is reduced to two couplets, and its unity is <lb/>
            gone. From the fourth to the third Asclepiad the <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            step is easy. Taking an English iambic line of ten <lb/>
            syllables to represent the longer lines of the Latin, <lb/>
            an English iambic line of six syllables to represent <lb/>
            the shorter, we see that the metre of Horace's <lb/>
            " Scriberis Vario ” finds its representative in the <lb/>
            metre of Mr. Tennyson's 11 Dream of Fair Women." <lb/>
            My experience would lead me to believe the English <lb/>
            metre to be quite capable, in really skilful hands, of <lb/>
            preserving the effect of the Latin, though, as I have <lb/>
            said above, the Latin measure is employed by <lb/>
            Horace both for a threnody and for a love-song.</p>
          <p>The Sapphic and the Alcaic involve more difficult <lb/>
            questions. Here, however, as in the Asclepiad, I <lb/>
            believe we must be guided, to some extent, by ex- <lb/>
            ternal similarity. We must choose the iambic move- <lb/>
            ment as being most congenial to English ; we must <lb/>
            avoid the ten-syllable iambic as already appropriated <lb/>
            to the longer Asclepiad line. This leads me to <lb/>
            conclude that the staple of each stanza should be the <lb/>
            eight-syllable iambic, a measure more familiar to <lb/>
            English lyric poetry than any other, and as such <lb/>
            well adapted to represent the most familiar lyric <lb/>
            measures of Horace. With regard to the Sapphic, <lb/>
            it seems desirable that it should be represented by <lb/>
            a measure of which the three first lines are eight- <lb/>
            syllable iambics, the fourth some shorter, variety. <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            Of this stanza there are at least two kinds for which <lb/>
            something might be said. It might be constructed <lb/>
            so that the three first lines should rhyme with each <lb/>
            other, the fourth being otherwise dealt with; or it <lb/>
            might be framed on the plan of alternate rhymes, <lb/>
            the fourth line still being shorter than the rest. Of <lb/>
            the former kind two or three specimens are to be <lb/>
            . found in Francis' translation of Horace. In these <lb/>
            the fourth line consists of but three syllables, the <lb/>
            two last of which rhyme with the two last syllables <lb/>
            of the fourth line of the next succeeding stanza, as <lb/>
            for instance :- <lb/>
            You shoot; she whets her tusks to bite; <lb/>
            While he who sits to judge the fight <lb/>
            Treads on the palm with foot so white, <lb/>
            Disdainful, <lb/>
            And sweetly floating in the air <lb/>
            Wanton he spreads his fragrant hair, <lb/>
            Like Ganymede or Nireus fair, <lb/>
            And vainful.</p>
          <p>It would be possible, no doubt, to produce verses <lb/>
            better adapted to recommend the measure than these <lb/>
            stanzas, which are, however, the best that can be <lb/>
            quoted from Francis; it might be possible, too, to <lb/>
            suggest some improvement in the structure of the <lb/>
            fourth line. But, however managed, this stanza <lb/>
            would, I think, be open to two serious objections; <lb/>
             <pb n="xiv"/>
            the difficulty of finding three suitable rhymes for <lb/>
            each stanza, and the difficulty of disposing of the <lb/>
            fourth line, which, if made to rhyme with the fourth <lb/>
            line of the next stanza, produces an awkwardness in <lb/>
            the case of those Odes which consist of an odd num- <lb/>
            ber of stanzas (a large proportion of the whole <lb/>
            amount), if left unrhymed, creates an obviously dis- <lb/>
            agreeable effect. We come then to the other alter- <lb/>
            native, the stanza with alternate rhymes. Here the <lb/>
            question is about the fourth line, which may either <lb/>
            consist of six syllables, like Coleridge's Fragment, <lb/>
            11 0 leave the lily on its stem," or of four, as in <lb/>
            Pope's youthful 11 Ode on Solitude," these types <lb/>
            being further varied by the addition of an extra <lb/>
            syllable to form a double rhyme. Of these the <lb/>
            four-syllable type seems to me the one to be pre- <lb/>
            ferred, as giving the effect of the Adonic better than <lb/>
            if it had been two syllables longer. The double <lb/>
            rhyme has, I think, an advantage over the single, <lb/>
            were it not for its greater difficulty. Much as <lb/>
            English lyric poetry owes to double rhymes, a re- <lb/>
            gular supply of them is not easy to procure; some <lb/>
            of them are apt to be cumbrous, such as words in <lb/>
            -ation; others, such as the participial -ing (dying, <lb/>
            flying, &amp;c.), spoil the language of poetry, leading <lb/>
            to the employment of participles where participles <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            are not wanted, and of verbal substantives that exist <lb/>
            nowhere else. My first intention was to adopt the <lb/>
            double rhyme in this measure, and I accordingly <lb/>
            executed three Odes on that plan (Book I. Odes <lb/>
            22, 38; Book II. Ode 16); afterwards I aban- <lb/>
            doned it, and contented myself with the single <lb/>
            rhyme. On the whole, I certainly think this <lb/>
            measure answers sufficiently well to the Latin Sap- <lb/>
            phic ; but I have felt its brevity painfully in almost <lb/>
            every Ode that I have attempted, being constantly <lb/>
            obliged to omit some part of the Latin which I would <lb/>
            gladly have preserved. The great number of mono- <lb/>
            syllables in English is of course a reason for ac- <lb/>
            quiescing in lines shorter than the corresponding <lb/>
            lines in Latin; but even in English polysyllables <lb/>
            are often necessary, and still oftener desirable on <lb/>
            grounds of harmony; and an allowance of twenty- <lb/>
            eight syllables of English for thirty-eight of Latin <lb/>
            is, after all, rather short.</p>
          <p>For the place of the Alcaic there are various can- <lb/>
            didates. Mr. Tennyson has recently invented a <lb/>
            measure which, if not intended to reproduce the <lb/>
            Alcaic, was doubtless suggested by it, that which <lb/>
            appears in his poem of " The Daisy," and, in a <lb/>
            slightly different form, in the 11 Lines to Air. <lb/>
            Maurice." The two last lines of the latter form of <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            the stanza are indeed evidently copied from the <lb/>
            Alcaic, with the simple omission of the last syllable <lb/>
            of the last line of the original. Still, as a whole, I <lb/>
            doubt whether this form would be as suitable, at <lb/>
            least for a dignified Ode, as the other, where the <lb/>
            initial iambic in the last line, substituted for a <lb/>
            trochee, makes the movement different. I was de- <lb/>
            terred, however, from attempting either, partly by <lb/>
            a doubt whether either had been sufficiently natu- <lb/>
            raked in English to be safely practised by an un- <lb/>
            skilful hand, partly by the obvious difficulty of <lb/>
            having to provide three rhymes per stanza, against <lb/>
            which the occurrence of one line in each without a <lb/>
            rhyme at all was but a poor set-off. A second <lb/>
            metre which occurred to me is that of Andrew <lb/>
            Marvel's Horatian Ode, a variety of which is found <lb/>
            twice in Mr. Keble's Christian Year. Here two <lb/>
            lines of eight syllables are followed by two of six, <lb/>
            the difference between the types being that in Mar- <lb/>
            vel's Ode the rhymes are successive, in Mr. Keble's <lb/>
            alternate. The external correspondence between <lb/>
            this and the Alcaic is considerable; but the brevity <lb/>
            of the English measure struck me at once as a fatal <lb/>
            obstacle, and I did not try to encounter it. A third <lb/>
            possibility is the stanza of " In Memoriam," which <lb/>
            has been adopted by the clever author of 11 Poems <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            and Translations, by C. S. C.," in his version of <lb/>
            it Justum et tenacem." I think it very probable <lb/>
            that this will be found eventually to be the best <lb/>
            representation of the Alcaic in English, especially <lb/>
            as it appears to afford facilities for that linking of <lb/>
            stanza to stanza which one who wishes to adhere <lb/>
            closely to the logical and rhythmical structure of the <lb/>
            Latin soon learns to desire. But I have not adopted <lb/>
            it; and I believe there is good reason for not doing <lb/>
            so. With all its advantages, it has the patent dis- <lb/>
            advantage of having been brought into notice by a <lb/>
            poet who is influencing the present generation as <lb/>
            only a great living poet can. A great writer now, <lb/>
            an inferior writer hereafter, may be able to handle <lb/>
            it with some degree of independence; but the ma- <lb/>
            jority of those who use it at present are sure in <lb/>
            adopting Mr. Tennyson's metre to adopt his man- <lb/>
            ner. It is no reproach to " C. S. C." that his Ode <lb/>
            reminds us of Mr. Tennyson; it is a praise to him <lb/>
            that the recollection is a pleasant one. But Mr. <lb/>
            Tennyson's manner is not the manner of Horace, <lb/>
            and it is the manner of a contemporary; the ex- <lb/>
            pression-a most powerful and beautiful expression <lb/>
            -of influences to which a translator of an ancient <lb/>
            classic feels himself to be too much subjected al- <lb/>
            ready. What is wanted is a metre which shall have <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            other associations than those of the nineteenth cen- <lb/>
            tury, which shall be the growth of various periods <lb/>
            of English poetry, and so be independent of any. <lb/>
            Such a metre is that which I have been led to <lb/>
            choose, the eight-syllable iambic with alternate <lb/>
            rhymes. It is one of the commonest metres in the <lb/>
            language, and for that reason it is adapted to more <lb/>
            than one class of subjects, to the gay as well as to <lb/>
            the grave. But I am mistaken if it is not peculiarly <lb/>
            suited to express that concentrated grandeur, that <lb/>
            majestic combination of high eloquence with high <lb/>
            poetry, which make the early Alcaic Odes of <lb/>
            Horace's Third Book what they are to us. The main <lb/>
            difficulty is in accommodating its structure to that of <lb/>
            the Latin, of varying the pauses, and of linking stanza <lb/>
            to stanza. It is a difficulty before which I have felt <lb/>
            myself almost powerless, and I have in consequence <lb/>
            been driven to the natural expedient of weakness, <lb/>
            compromise, sometimes evading it, sometimes coping <lb/>
            with it unsuccessfully. In other respects I may be <lb/>
            allowed to say that I have found the metre pleasant- <lb/>
            er to handle than any of the others that I have <lb/>
            attempted, except, perhaps, that of " The Dream of <lb/>
            Fair Women." The proportion of syllables in each <lb/>
            stanza of English to each stanza of Latin is not much <lb/>
            greater than in the case of the Sapphic, thirty-two <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            against forty-one; yet, except in a few passages, <lb/>
            chiefly those containing proper names, I have had <lb/>
            no disagreeable sense of confinement. I believe the <lb/>
            reason of this to be that the Latin Alcaic generally <lb/>
            contains fewer words in proportion than the Latin <lb/>
            Sapphic, the former being favourable to long words, <lb/>
            the latter to short ones, as may be seen by contrast- <lb/>
            ing such lines as " Dissentientis conditionibus" <lb/>
            with such as "Dona prœsentis rape lœtus horce ac." <lb/>
            This, no doubt, shows that there is an inconvenience <lb/>
            in applying the same English iambic measure to two <lb/>
            metres which differ so greatly in their practical re- <lb/>
            sult ; but so far as I can see at present, the evil <lb/>
            appears to be one of those which it is wiser to sub- <lb/>
            mit to than to attempt to cure.</p>
          <p>The problem of finding English representatives <lb/>
            for the other Horatian metres, if a more difficult, is <lb/>
            a less important one. The most pressing case is, <lb/>
            that of the metre known as the second Asclepiad, <lb/>
            the Sic te diva potens Cypri." With this, I fear, <lb/>
            I shall be thought to have dealt rather capriciously, <lb/>
            having rendered it by four different measures, three <lb/>
            of them, however, varieties of the same general <lb/>
            type. It so happens that the first Ode which I <lb/>
            translated was the celebrated Amœbean Poem, the <lb/>
            dialogue between Horace and Lydia. I had had at <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            that time not the most distant notion of translating <lb/>
            the whole of the Odes, or even any considerable <lb/>
            number of them, so that in choosing a metre I <lb/>
            thought simply of the requirements of the Ode in <lb/>
            question, not of those of the rest of its class. In- <lb/>
            deed, I may say that it was the thought of the metre <lb/>
            which led me to try if I could translate the Ode. <lb/>
            Having accomplished my attempt, I turned to an- <lb/>
            other Ode of the same class, the scarcely less cele- <lb/>
            brated " Quem tu, Melpomene." For this I took a <lb/>
            different metre, which happens to be identical with <lb/>
            that of a solitary Ode in the Second Book, " Non <lb/>
            ebur neque aureum,” being guided still by my feel- <lb/>
            ing about the individual Ode, not by any more <lb/>
            general considerations. I did not attempt a third <lb/>
            until I had proceeded sufficiently far in my under- <lb/>
            taking to see that I should probably continue to the <lb/>
            end. Then I had to consider the question of a <lb/>
            uniform metre to answer to the Latin. Both of <lb/>
            those which I had already tried were rendered im- <lb/>
            practicable by a double rhyme, which, however <lb/>
            manageable in one or two Odes, is unmanageable, <lb/>
            as I have before intimated, in the case of a large <lb/>
            number. The former of the two measures, divested <lb/>
            of the double rhyme, would, I think, lose most of its <lb/>
            attractiveness; the latter suffers much less from the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            privation: the latter accordingly I chose. The <lb/>
            trochaic character of the first line seems to me to <lb/>
            give it an advantage over any metre composed of <lb/>
            pure iambics, if it were only that it discriminates it <lb/>
            from those alternate ten-syllable and eight-syllable <lb/>
            iambics into which it would be natural to render <lb/>
            many of the Epodes. At the same time, it did not <lb/>
            appear worth while to rewrite the two Odes already <lb/>
            translated, merely for the sake of uniformity, as the <lb/>
            principle of correspondence to the Latin, the alterna- <lb/>
            tion of longer and shorter lines, is really the same <lb/>
            in all three cases. Nay, so tentative has been my <lb/>
            treatment of the whole matter, that I have even <lb/>
            translated one Ode, the third of Book I, into suc- <lb/>
            cessive rather than into alternate rhymes, so that <lb/>
            readers may judge of the comparative effect of the <lb/>
            two varieties. After this confession of irregularity, <lb/>
            I need scarcely mention that on coming to the Ode <lb/>
            which had suggested the metre in its unmutilated <lb/>
            state, I translated it into the mutilated form, not <lb/>
            caring either to encounter the inconvenience of the <lb/>
            double rhymes, or to make confusion worse con- <lb/>
            founded by giving it, what it has in the Latin, a <lb/>
            separate form of its own.</p>
          <p>The remaining metres may be dismissed in a <lb/>
            very few words. As a general rule, I have avoided <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            couplets of any sort, and chosen some kind of stanza. <lb/>
            As a German critic has pointed out, all the Odes of <lb/>
            Horace, with one doubtful exception, may be re- <lb/>
            duced to quatrains ; and though this peculiarity <lb/>
            does not, so far as we can see, affect the character <lb/>
            of any of the Horatian metres (except, of course, <lb/>
            those that are written in stanzas), or influence the <lb/>
            structure of the Latin, it must be considered as a <lb/>
            happy circumstance for those who wish to render <lb/>
            Horace into English. In respect of restraint, in- <lb/>
            deed, the English couplet may sometimes be less <lb/>
            inconvenient than the quatrain, as it is, on the whole, <lb/>
            easier to run couplet into couplet than to run quat- <lb/>
            rain into quatrain; but the couplet seems hardly <lb/>
            suitable for an English lyrical poem of any length, <lb/>
            the very notion of lyrical poetry apparently involv- <lb/>
            ing a complexity which can only be represented by <lb/>
            rhymes recurring at intervals. In the case of one <lb/>
            of the three poems written by Horace in the measure <lb/>
            called the greater Asclepiad, (" Tu ne quœsieris,”) <lb/>
            I have adopted the couplet; in another ("Nullam, <lb/>
            Vare,") the quatrain, the determining reason in the <lb/>
            two cases being the length of the two Odes, the <lb/>
            former of which consists but of eight lines, the latter <lb/>
            of sixteen. The metre which I selected for each is <lb/>
            the thirteen-syllable trochaic of " Locksley Hall;" <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            and it is curious to observe the different effect of the <lb/>
            metre according as it is written in two lines or in <lb/>
            four. In the " Locksley Hall" couplet its move- <lb/>
            ment is undoubtedly trochaic; but when it is ex- <lb/>
            panded into a quatrain, as in Mrs. Browning's poem <lb/>
            of " Lady Geraldine's Courtship,” the movement <lb/>
            changes, and instead of a more or less equal stress <lb/>
            on the alternate syllables, the full ictus is only felt <lb/>
            in one syllable out of every four; in ancient metrical <lb/>
            language the metre becomes Ionic a minore. This <lb/>
            very Ionic a minore is itself, I need not say, the <lb/>
            metre of a single Ode in the Third Book, the <lb/>
            " Miserarum est," and I have devised a stanza for <lb/>
            it, taking much more pains with the apportionment <lb/>
            of the ictus than in the case of the trochaic quatrain, <lb/>
            which is better able to modulate itself. I have also <lb/>
            ventured to invent a metre for that technically <lb/>
            known as the Fourth Archilochian, the " Solvitur <lb/>
            acris hiems," by combining the fourteen-syllable <lb/>
            with the ten-syllable iambic in an alternately rhym- <lb/>
            ing stanza.. The First Archilochian, " Diffugere <lb/>
            nives," I have represented by a combination of the <note type="footnote"> * I may be permitted to mention that Lord Derby, in a <lb/>
            volume of Translations printed privately before the appear- <lb/>
            ance of this work, has employed the same measure in render- <lb/>
            ing the same Ode, the only difference being that his rhymes <lb/>
            are not alternate, but successive. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            ten-syllable with the four-syllable iambic. For the <lb/>
            so-called greater Sapphic, the " Lydia, die per <lb/>
            omnes," I have made another iambic combination, <lb/>
            the six-syllable with the fourteen-syllable, arranged <lb/>
            as a couplet. The choriambic I thought might be <lb/>
            exchanged for a heroic stanza, in which the first <lb/>
            line should rhyme with the fourth, the second with <lb/>
            the third, a kind of 11 In Memoriam" elongated. <lb/>
            Lastly, I have chosen the heroic quatrain proper, <lb/>
            the metre of Gray's " Elegy," for the two Odes in <lb/>
            the First Book written in what is called the Metrum <lb/>
            Alcmanium, " Laudabunt alii," and “ Te maris et <lb/>
            terrce," rather from a vague notion of the dignity of <lb/>
            the measure than from any distinct sense of special <lb/>
            appropriateness.</p>
          <p>From this enumeration, which I fear has been <lb/>
            somewhat tedious, it will be seen that I have been <lb/>
            guided throughout not by any systematic principles, <lb/>
            but by a multitude of minor considerations, some <lb/>
            operating more strongly in one case, and some in <lb/>
            another. I trust, however, that in all this diversity <lb/>
            I shall be found to have kept in view the object on <lb/>
            which I have been insisting, a metrical corres- <lb/>
            pondence with the original. Even where I have <lb/>
            been most inconsistent, I have still adhered to the <lb/>
            rule of comprising the English within the same <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            number. of lines as the Latin. I believe this to be <lb/>
            almost essential to the preservation of the character <lb/>
            of the Horatian lyric, which always retains a certain <lb/>
            severity, and never loses itself in modern exube- <lb/>
            rance ; and though I am well aware that the result <lb/>
            in my case has frequently, perhaps generally, been <lb/>
            a most un-Horatian stiffness, I am convinced from <lb/>
            my own experience that a really accomplished artist <lb/>
            would find the task of composing under these condi- <lb/>
            tions far more hopeful than he had previously ima- <lb/>
            gined it to be. Yet it is a restraint to which scarcely <lb/>
            any of the previous translators of the Odes have <lb/>
            been willing to submit. Perhaps Professor Newman <lb/>
            is the only one who has carried it through the whole <lb/>
            of the Four Books; most of my predecessors have <lb/>
            ignored it altogether. It is this which, in my judg- <lb/>
            ment, is the chief drawback to the success of the <lb/>
            most distinguished of them, Mr. Theodore Martin. <lb/>
            He has brought to his work a grace and delicacy of <lb/>
            expression and a happy flow of musical verse which <lb/>
            are beyond my praise, and which render many of <lb/>
            his Odes most pleasing to read as poems. I wish <lb/>
            he had combined with these qualities that terseness <lb/>
            and condensation which remind us that a Roman, <lb/>
            even when writing " songs of love and wine," was a <lb/>
            Roman still.</p><pb n="xxvi"/>
            
          <p>Some may consider it extraordinary that in dis- <lb/>
            cussing the different ways of representing Horatian <lb/>
            metres I have said nothing of transplanting those <lb/>
            metres themselves into English. I think, however, <lb/>
            that an apology for my silence may be found in the <lb/>
            present state of the controversy about the English <lb/>
            hexameter. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of <lb/>
            that struggling alien-and I confess myself to be <lb/>
            one of those who doubt whether he can ever be <lb/>
            naturalized-most judges will, I believe, agree that <lb/>
            for the present at any rate his case is sufficient to <lb/>
            occupy the literary tribunals, and that to raise any <lb/>
            discussion on the rights of others of his class would <lb/>
            be premature. Practice, after all, is more powerful <lb/>
            in such matters than theory; and hardly at any <lb/>
            time in the three hundred years during which we <lb/>
            have had a formed literature has the introduction of <lb/>
            classical lyric measures into English been a practical <lb/>
            question. Stanihurst has had many successors in the <lb/>
            hexameter; probably he has not had more than one <lb/>
            or two in the Asclepiad. The Sapphic, indeed, has <lb/>
            been tried repeatedly; but it is an exception which <lb/>
            is no exception, the metre thus intruded into our lan- <lb/>
            guage not being really the Latin Sapphic, but a metre <lb/>
            of a different kind, founded on a mistake in the manner <lb/>
            of reading the Latin, into which Englishmen natu- <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            rally fall, and in which, for convenience' sake, they as <lb/>
            naturally persist. The late Mr. Clough, whose efforts <lb/>
            in literature were essentially tentative, in form as well <lb/>
            as in spirit, and whose loss for that very reason is <lb/>
            perhaps of more serious import to English poetry <lb/>
            than if, with equal genius, he had possessed a more <lb/>
            conservative habit of mind, once attempted repro- <lb/>
            ductions of nearly all the different varieties of Hora- <lb/>
            tian metres. They may be found in a paper which <lb/>
            he contributed to the fourth volume of the " Classical <lb/>
            Museum;" and a perusal of them will, I think, be <lb/>
            likely to convince the reader that the task is one in <lb/>
            which even great rhythmical power and mastery of <lb/>
            language would be far from certain of succeeding. <lb/>
            Even the Alcaic fragment which he has inserted in <lb/>
            his " Amours de Voyage,"- <lb/>
            " Eager for battle here <lb/>
            Stood Vulcan, here matronal Juno, <lb/>
            And with the bow to his shoulder faithful <lb/>
            He who with pure dew laveth of Castaly <lb/>
            His flowing locks, who holdeth of Lycia <lb/>
            The oak forest and the wood that bore him, <lb/>
            Delos' and Patara's own Apollo,”— <lb/>
            admirably finished as it is, and highly pleasing as a <lb/>
            fragment, scarcely persuades us that twenty stanzas <lb/>
            of the same workmanship would be read with <lb/>
            adequate pleasure, still less that the same satis- <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            faction would be felt through six-and-thirty Odes. <lb/>
            After all, however, a sober critic will be disposed <lb/>
            rather to pass judgment on the past than to predict <lb/>
            the future, knowing, as he must, how easily the <lb/>
            " solvitur ambulando" of an artist like Mr. Tenny- <lb/>
            son may disturb a whole chain of ingenious reason- <lb/>
            ing on the possibilities of things.</p>
          <p>The question of the language into which Horace <lb/>
            should be translated is not less important than that of <lb/>
            the metre; but it involves far less discussion of points <lb/>
            of detail, and may, in fact, be very soon dismissed. I <lb/>
            believe that the chief danger which a translator has <lb/>
            to avoid is that of subjection to the influences of his <lb/>
            own period. Whether or no Mr. Merivale is right <lb/>
            in supposing that an analogy exists between the <lb/>
            literature of the present day and that of post- <lb/>
            Augustan Rome, it will not, I think, be disputed <lb/>
            that between our period and the Augustan period <lb/>
            the resemblances are very few, perhaps not more <lb/>
            than must necessarily exist between two periods of <lb/>
            high cultivation. It is the fashion to say that the <lb/>
            characteristic of the literature of the last century <lb/>
            was shallow clearness, the expression of obvious <lb/>
            thoughts in obvious, though highly finished lan- <lb/>
            guage; it is the fashion to retort upon our own <lb/>
            generation that its tendency is to over-thinking and <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            over-expression, a constant search for thoughts <lb/>
            which shall not be obvious and words which shall be <lb/>
            above the level of received conventionality. Accept- <lb/>
            ing these as descriptions, however imperfect, of <lb/>
            two different types of literature, we can have no <lb/>
            doubt to which division to refer the literary remains <lb/>
            of Augustan Rome. The Odes of Horace, in parti- <lb/>
            cular, will, I think, strike a reader who comes back <lb/>
            to them after reading other books, as distinguished <lb/>
            by a simplicity, monotony, and almost poverty of <lb/>
            sentiment, and as depending for the charm of their <lb/>
            external form not so much on novel and ingenious <lb/>
            images as on musical words aptly chosen and aptly <lb/>
            combined. We are always hearing of wine-jars and <lb/>
            Thracian convivialities, of parsley wreaths and <lb/>
            Syrian nard; the graver topics, which it is the poet's <lb/>
            wisdom to forget, are constantly typified by the <lb/>
            terrors of quivered Medes and painted Gelonians; <lb/>
            there is the perpetual antithesis between youth and <lb/>
            age, there is the ever-recurring image of green and <lb/>
            withered trees, and it is only the attractiveness of <lb/>
            the Latin, half real, half perhaps arising from asso- <lb/>
            ciation and the romance of a language not one's <lb/>
            own, that makes us feel this " lyrical common- <lb/>
            place" more supportable than common-place is <lb/>
            usually found to be. It is this, indeed, which con- <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            stitutes the grand difficulty of the translator, who <lb/>
            may well despair when he undertakes to reproduce <lb/>
            beauties depending on expression by a process in <lb/>
            which expression is sure to be sacrificed. But it <lb/>
            would, I think, be a mistake to attempt to get rid <lb/>
            of this monotony by calling in the aid of that variety <lb/>
            of images and forms of language which modem <lb/>
            poetry presents. Here, as in the case of metres, it <lb/>
            seems to me that to exceed the bounds of what may <lb/>
            be called classical parsimony would be to abandon <lb/>
            the one chance, faint as it may be, of producing on <lb/>
            the reader's mind something like the impression <lb/>
            produced by Horace. I do not say that I have <lb/>
            always been as abstinent as I think a translator <lb/>
            ought to be; here, as in all matters connected with <lb/>
            this most difficult work, weakness may claim a <lb/>
            licence of which strength would disdain to avail <lb/>
            itself; I only say that I have not surrendered <lb/>
            myself to the temptation habitually and without a <lb/>
            struggle. As a general rule, while not unfrequently <lb/>
            compelled to vary the precise image Horace has <lb/>
            chosen, I have substituted one which he has used <lb/>
            elsewhere ; where he has talked of triumphs, mean- <lb/>
            ing no more than victories, I have talked of bays; <lb/>
            where he gives the picture of the luxuriant harvests <lb/>
            of Sardinia, I have spoken of the wheat on the <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            threshing-floors. On the whole I have tried, so far <lb/>
            as my powers would allow me, to give my translation <lb/>
            something of the colour of our eighteenth-century <lb/>
            poetry, believing the poetry of that time to be the <lb/>
            nearest analogue of the poetry of Augustus' court <lb/>
            that England has produced, and feeling quite sure <lb/>
            that a writer will bear traces enough of the language <lb/>
            and manner of his own time to redeem him from the <lb/>
            charge of having forgotten what is after all his <lb/>
            native tongue. As one instance out of many, I may <lb/>
            mention the use of compound epithets as a tempta- <lb/>
            tion to which the translator of Horace is sure to be <lb/>
            exposed, and which, in my judgment, he ought in <lb/>
            general to resist. Their power of condensation <lb/>
            naturally recommends them to a writer who has to <lb/>
            deal with inconvenient clauses, threatening to swallow <lb/>
            up the greater part of a line ; but there is no doubt <lb/>
            that in the Augustan poets, as compared with the <lb/>
            poets of the republic, they are chiefly conspicuous <lb/>
            for their absence, and it is equally certain, I think, <lb/>
            that a translator of an Augustan poet ought not to <lb/>
            suffer them to be a prominent feature of his style. I <lb/>
            have, perhaps, indulged in them too often myself to <lb/>
            note them as a defect in others; but it seems to me <lb/>
            that they contribute, along with the Tennysonian <lb/>
            metre, to diminish the pleasure with which we read <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            such a version as that of which I have already <lb/>
            spoken by " C. S. C." of " Justum et tenacem.”I <lb/>
            may add, too, that I have occasionally allowed the <lb/>
            desire of brevity to lead me into an omission of the <lb/>
            definite article, which, though perhaps in keeping <lb/>
            with the style of Milton, is certainly out of keeping <lb/>
            with that of the eighteenth century. It is one of a <lb/>
            translator's many refuges, and has been conceded <lb/>
            so long that it can hardly be denied him with justice, <lb/>
            however it may remind the reader of a bald verbal <lb/>
            rendering.</p>
          <p>A very few words will serve to conclude this some- <lb/>
            what protracted Preface. I have not sought to in- <lb/>
            terpret Horace with the minute accuracy which I <lb/>
            should think necessary in writing a commentary; <lb/>
            and in general I have been satisfied to consult two <lb/>
            of the latest editions, those by Orelli and Bitter. <lb/>
            In a few instances I have preferred the views of the <lb/>
            latter; but his edition will not supersede that of the <lb/>
            former, whose commentary is one of the most judi- <lb/>
            cious ever produced, within a moderate compass, <lb/>
            upon a classical author. In the few notes which I <lb/>
            have added at the end of this volume, I have noticed <lb/>
            chiefly the instances in which I have differed from <lb/>
            him, in favour either of Ritter's interpretation, or of <lb/>
            some view of my own. At the same time it must <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            be said that my translation is not to be understood <lb/>
            as always indicating the interpretation I prefer. <lb/>
            Sometimes, where the general effect of two views of <lb/>
            the construction of a passage has been the same, I <lb/>
            have followed that which I believed to be less cor- <lb/>
            rect, for reasons of convenience. I have of course <lb/>
            held myself free to deviate in a thousand instances <lb/>
            from the exact form of the Latin sentence; and it <lb/>
            did not seem reasonable to debar myself from a <lb/>
            mode of expression which appeared generally con- <lb/>
            sistent with the original, because it happened to be <lb/>
            verbally consistent with a mistaken view. of the <lb/>
            Latin words. To take an example mentioned in <lb/>
            my notes, it may be better in Book III. Ode 3, <lb/>
            line 25, to make " adulterce " the genitive case after <lb/>
            " hospes " than the dative after " splendet; " but <lb/>
            for practical purposes the two come to the same <lb/>
            thing, both being included in the full development <lb/>
            of the thought; and a translation which represents <lb/>
            either is substantially a true translation. I have <lb/>
            omitted four Odes altogether, one in each Book, <lb/>
            and some stanzas of a fifth; and in some other in- <lb/>
            stances I have been studiously paraphrastic. Nor <lb/>
            have I thought it worth while to extend my trans- <lb/>
            lation from the Odes to the Epodes. The Epodes <lb/>
            were the production of Horace's youth, and pro- <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            bably would not have been much cared for by pos- <lb/>
            terity if they had constituted his only title to fame. <lb/>
            A few of them are beautiful, but some are revolting, <lb/>
            and the rest, as pictures of a roving and sensual <lb/>
            passion, remind us of the least attractive portion of <lb/>
            the Odes. In the case of a writer like Horace it is <lb/>
            not easy to draw an exact line; but though in <lb/>
            the Odes our admiration of much that is graceful <lb/>
            and tender and even true may balance our moral <lb/>
            repugnance to many parts of the poet's philosophy <lb/>
            of life, it does not seem equally desirable to dwell <lb/>
            minutely on a class of compositions where the beau- <lb/>
            ties are fewer and the deformities more numerous <lb/>
            and more undisguised.</p>
          <p>I should add that any coincidences that may be <lb/>
            noticed between my version and those of my prede- <lb/>
            cessors are, for the most part, merely coincidences. <lb/>
            In some cases I may have knowingly borrowed a <lb/>
            rhyme, but only where the rhyme was too common <lb/>
            to have created a right of property.</p><pb n="xxxv"/>

          <p><lb/>
            AM very sensible of the favour which <lb/>
            has carried this translation from a first <lb/>
            edition into a second. The interval <lb/>
            between the two has been too short <lb/>
            to admit of my altering my judgment in any <lb/>
            large number of instances; but I have been glad to <lb/>
            employ the present opportunity in amending, as I <lb/>
            hope, an occasional word or expression, and, in one <lb/>
            or two cases, recasting a stanza. The notices which <lb/>
            my book has received, and the opinions communi- <lb/>
            cated by the kindness of friends, have been gratify- <lb/>
            ing to me, both in themselves, and as showing the <lb/>
            interest which is being felt in the subject of Horatian <lb/>
            translation. It is not surprising that there should <lb/>
            be considerable differences of opinion about the <lb/>
            manner in which Horace is to be rendered, and also <lb/>
            about the metre appropriate to particular Odes; but <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            I need not say that it is through such discussion <lb/>
            that questions like these advance towards settlement. <lb/>
            It would indeed be a satisfaction to me to think that <lb/>
            the question of translating Horace had been brought <lb/>
            a step nearer to its solution by the experiment which <lb/>
            I again venture to submit to the public.</p>

            that the attempt would be presumptuous in itself, and <lb/>
            likely to create a sense of incongruity with the style of the <lb/>

          <p>If I have slurred over the Latin, my excuse must be <lb/>
            that the precise meaning of the Latin is difficult to catch. <lb/>
            Is Teucer called auspex, as taking the auspices, like an <lb/>
            augur, or as giving the auspices, like a god ? There are <lb/>
            objections to both interpretations; a Roman imperator <lb/>
            was not called auspex, though he was attended by an au. <lb/>
            spex, and was said to have the auspicia; auspex is frequently <lb/>
            used of one who, as we should say, inaugurates an under- <lb/>
            taking, but only if he is a god or a deified mortal Per- <lb/>
            haps Horace himself oscillated between the two meanings; <lb/>

          <p>SINCE this Ode was printed off, I find that my last stanza <lb/>
            bears a suspicious likeness to the version by " C. S. C." I <lb/>
            cannot say whether it is a case of mere coincidence, or of <lb/>
            unconscious recollection; it certainly is not one of de- <lb/>
            liberate appropriation. I have only had the opportunity <lb/>
            of seeing his book at distant intervals ; and now, on finally <lb/>
            comparing his translations with my own, I find that, while <lb/>
            there are a few resemblances, there are several marked <lb/>
            instances of dissimilarity, where, though we have adopted <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE translated this Ode as it stands, without attempt- <lb/>

            haps the opinion which supposes it to be spoken by Horace <lb/>
            in his own person, as if he had actually perished in the <lb/>
            shipwreck alluded to in Book III, Ode 4, v. 27, "Me ... <lb/>

          <p>HORA.CE supposes himself to hear not the leaders them- <lb/>
            selves, but Pollio's recitation of their exploits. There is <lb/>
            nothing weak in this, as Orelli thinks. Horace has not <lb/>
            seen Pollio's work, but compliments him by saying that <lb/>
            he can imagine what its finest passages will be like—“ I <lb/>
            can fancy how you will glow in your description of the <lb/>
            great generals, and of Cato." Possibly " Non indecoro <lb/>
            pulvere sordidos " may refer to the deaths of the republican <lb/>
            generals, whom old recollections would lead Horace to ad- <lb/>
            mire. We may then compare Ode 7 of this Book, v. 11- <lb/>
            " Cumfracta virtus, et minace8 <lb/>
            Turpe solum tetigere mento," <lb/>
            where, as will be seen, I agree with Ritter, against Orelli, <lb/>
            in supposing death in battle rather than submission to be <lb/>
            meant, though Horace, writing from a somewhat different <lb/>
            point of view, has chosen there to speak of the vanquished <lb/>
            as dying ingloriously.</p>

          <p>I HAVE followed Horace's sense, not his words. I believe, <lb/>
            with Bitter, that the alternative is between the pipe as <lb/>
            accompanying the vox acuta, and the cithara or lyre as ac- <lb/>
            companying the vox gram.. Horace has specified the vox <lb/>
            acuta, and left the vox gravis to be inferred; I have done <lb/>
            just the reverse.</p>
          <p>Me, as I lay on Vultur's steep.</p>
          <p>In this and the two following stanzas I have paraphrased <lb/>
            Horace, with a view to bring out what appears to be his <lb/>
            sense. There is, I think, a peculiar force in the word <lb/>
            fabulosœ, standing as it does at the very opening of the <lb/>
            stanza, in close connection with me, and thus bearing the <lb/>
            weight of all the intervening words till the very end, <lb/>
            where its noun, palumbes, is introduced at last. Horace <lb/>
            says in effect, " I, too, like other poets, have a legend of <lb/>
            my infancy." Accordingly I have thrown the gossip of <lb/>
            the country-side into the form of an actual speech. Whe- <lb/>
            ther I am justified in heightening the marvellous by make <lb/>
            ing the stock-doves actually crown the child, instead of <lb/>
            merely laying branches upon him, I am not so sure; but <lb/>
            something more seems to be meant than the covering of <lb/>
            leaves, which the Children in the Wood, in our own legend, <lb/>
            receive from the robin.</p>
          <p>Loves the leafy growth <lb/>

            Apollo's attachment to both of which warrants the two <lb/>

            vate fields that Rome has ravaged than by the statement <lb/>
            that Roman captives have been employed to cultivate the <lb/>
            fields they had ravaged as invaders. The latter proposi. <lb/>
            tion, it is true, includes the former; but the new matter <lb/>
            draws off attention from the old, and so weakens it.</p>

          <p>BUTTMANN complains of the editors for specifying the in- <lb/>

            just as affects the Latin, though Ode 19 of the present <lb/>
            Book, and Odes 33 and 36 of Book I, might be adduced to <lb/>
            show that Horace does not object to mixing Latin and <lb/>
            Greek names in the same poem; but it does not apply to <lb/>
            a translation, where to the English reader's apprehension <lb/>
            Horace and Lydia will seem equally real, equally fanciful.</p>

          <p>THERE is something harsh in the expression of the fourth <lb/>
            stanza of this Ode in the Latin. Tentare cannot stand <lb/>
            without an object, and to connect it, as the commentators <lb/>
            do, with deos is awkward. I was going to remark that <lb/>
            possibly some future Bentley would conjecture certare, or <lb/>
            litare, when I found that certare had been anticipated by <lb/>
            Peerlkamp, who, if not a Bentley, was a Bentleian. But it <lb/>
            would not be easy to account for the corruption, as the <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            fact that the previous line begins with cervice would rather <lb/>
            have led to the change of tentare into certare than vice versâ.</p>

          <p>Let Necessity but drive <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE translated this difficult passage nearly as it stands, <lb/>
            not professing to decide whether tops of buildings or <lb/>
            human heads are meant. Either is strange till explained; <lb/>
            neither seems at present to be supported by any exact <lb/>
            parallel in ancient literature or ancient art. Necessity <lb/>
            with her nails has met us before in Ode 35 of Book I, and <lb/>
            Orelli describes an Etruscan work of art where she is re- <lb/>
            presented with that cognizance ; but though the nail is an <lb/>
            appropriate emblem of fixity, we are apparently not told <lb/>
            where it is to be driven. The difficulty here is further <lb/>
            complicated by the following metaphor of the noose, which <lb/>
            seems to be a new and inconsistent image.</p>

          <p>I have hardly brought out the sense of the Latin with <lb/>

            upon him he shall accept it, and be thankful for what is <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE deranged the symmetry of the two opening similes, <lb/>
            making the eagle the subject of the sentence in the first, <lb/>
            the kid in the second, an awkwardness which the Latin is <lb/>
            able to avoid by its power of distinguishing cases by in. <lb/>
            flexion. I trust, however, that it will not offend an Eng. <lb/>
            lish reader.</p>
          <p>Whence in every field <lb/>
            They learned.</p>
          <p>Horace seems to allude jokingly to some unseasonable <lb/>
            inquiry into the antiquity of the armour of these Alpine <lb/>
            tribes, which had perhaps been started by some less skil. <lb/>
            ful celebrator of the victory; at the same tilae that he <lb/>
            gratifies his love of lyrical commonplace by a parenthetical <lb/>
            digression in the style of Pindar.</p>
          <p>And watchful potencies unweave <lb/>
            For them the tangled paths of war.</p>
          <p>On the whole, Hitter seems right, after Acron, in un- <lb/>
            derstanding curœ solaces of the counsels of Augustus, whom <lb/>
            Horace compliments similarly in the Fourteenth Ode of <lb/>
            this Book, as the real author of his step-son's victories. <lb/>
            He is certainly right in giving the stanza to Horace, not <lb/>
            to Hannibal. Even a courtly or patriotic Roman would <lb/>
            have shrunk from the bad taste of making the great his- <lb/>
            torical enemy of Italy conclude his lamentation over his <lb/>
            own and his country's deep sorrow by a flattering pro. <lb/>

          <p>' Twixt worth and baseness, lapp'd in death, <lb/>
            What difference ?</p>
          <p>I BELIEVE I have expressed Horace's meaning, though be <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            has chosen to express himself as if the two things com- <lb/>
            pared were dead worthlessness and uncelebrated worth. <lb/>
            By fixing the epithet sepultœ to inertia he doubtless meant <lb/>
            to express that the natural and appropriate fate of worth- <lb/>
            lessness was to be dead, buried, and forgotten. But the <lb/>
            context shows that he was thinking of the effect of death <lb/>
            and its consequent oblivion on worth and worthlessness <lb/>
            alike, and contending that the poet alone could remedy <lb/>
            the undiscriminating and unjust award of destiny. <lb/>
            Throughout the first half of the Ode, however, Horace has . <lb/>
            rather failed to mark the transitions of thought. He be- <lb/>
            gins by assuring himself and, by implication, those whom <lb/>
            he celebrates, of immortality, on the ground that the <lb/>
            greatest poets are not the only poets ; be then exchanges <lb/>
            this thougift for another, doubtless suggested by it, that <lb/>
            the heroes of poetry are not the only heroes, though the <lb/>
            very fact that there have been uncelebrated heroes is used <lb/>
            to show that celebration by a poet is everything.</p>
          <p>Or bear your banners through the fight, <lb/>
            Scattering the foeman's firm array.</p>
          <p>It seems, on the whole, simpler to understand this of <lb/>
            actual victories obtained by Lollius as a commander, than <lb/>
            of moral victories obtained by him as a judge. There is <lb/>
            harshness in passing abruptly from the judgment-seat to <lb/>
            the battle-field; but to speak of the judgment-seat as itself <lb/>
            the battle-field would, I think, be harsher still.</p>
