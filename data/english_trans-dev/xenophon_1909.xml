          </head>
          <p>XENOPHON was horn at Athens, in the demos 01 borough, called <lb/>
            Erchia. His father's name was Gryllus.1</p>
          <p>The year of his birth is nowhere mentioned; but as he was up­ <lb/>
            wards of ninety when he died,2 and was alive B. C. 357, the year in <lb/>
            which the assassination of Alexander of Pheræ, which he mentions,3 <lb/>
            took place, Kruger,4 who has examined the subject with much atten­ <lb/>
            tion, is inclined to place his birth about B. c. 444. If this date be <lb/>
            correct, he was twenty years of age at the time of the battle be­ <lb/>
            tween the Athenians and Bœotians at Delium, B. c. 424, in which <lb/>
            he was present, and would probably have lost his life in the flight <lb/>
            of the Athenians, had he not been rescued by Socrates, who, seeing <lb/>
            him fall from his horse, took him upon his shoulders, and carried <lb/>
            him for several stadia.5</p>
          <p>What were the circumstances or rank of his father, we are not <lb/>
            informed, but it may be reasonably conjectured, from his intimacy <lb/>
            with Proxenus,6 a man of consideration in Bœotia, and from the <lb/>
            position which he held among the Greeks that followed C3 rus, that <lb/>
            he was not of mean or poor parentage.</p>
          <p>He had at an early age become acquainted with Socrates. Their <lb/>
            first meeting is thus described by Laertius.7 Socrates met him in a <lb/>
            narrow passage, and being pleased with the modesty and beauty of <lb/>
            his countenance, playfully put out his stick to prevent him from <lb/>
            passing, and asked him, at the same time, where people could pur­ <lb/>
            chase provisions. Xenophon having given him an answer, he again <lb/>
            asked where people might learn virtue and honour. Xenophon <lb/>
            hesitating how to reply, Socrates said, " Follow me, then, and be <lb/>
            taught." From that time he became firmly attached to Socrates. <note type="footnote"> 1 Diog.

          <p>It is said by Philostratus,l that he was taken by the Bœotians, <lb/>
            and lived for some time as a prisoner among them. If this be true, <lb/>
            he must have been captured, as Krüger thinks, when the Bœotians <lb/>
            treacherously recovered Oropus from the Athenian garrison left to <lb/>
            defend it, B. c. 412. At this period he may have commenced his <lb/>
            acquaintance with Proxenus, a man of cultivated mind and of some <lb/>
            ambition. Philostratus relates that Xenophon and Proxenus at­ <lb/>
            tended the lectures of Prodicus the sophist together. Photius2 also <lb/>
            says that he was a pupil of Isocrates, who, however, if Xenophon <lb/>
            was born B. c. 444, was eight years his junior.</p>
          <p>It was by the persuasion of Proxenus3 that Xenophon joined <lb/>
            Cyrus in his expedition against Artaxerxes. Proxenus had engaged <lb/>
            in the enterprise with the expectation of gaining honour and <lb/>
            wealth, and, while the army was staying at Sardes, wrote to Xe­ <lb/>
            nophon to say that if he would come thither, he would introduce <lb/>
            him to Cyrus. Xenophon showed the letter to Socrates, who ad­ <lb/>
            vised him to consult the Delphic oracle, as it was a matter not to be <lb/>
            hastily decided, since Cyrus was regarded as an enemy to Athens. <lb/>
            Xenophon accordingly went to Delphi, but did not ask the god <lb/>
            whether he ought to go or not, for he was probably too much in­ <lb/>
            clined to go, but merely inquired to what gods he should sacrifice <lb/>
            in order to commence and accomplish in safety the journey which <lb/>
            he was contemplating. Apollo replied that he should sacrifice to <lb/>
            the gods to whom he ought to sacrifice. Socrates, at his return, <lb/>
            blamed him for having consulted the oracle in such a manner, but <lb/>
            told him that, as he had received an answer, he had better go. <lb/>
            Xenophon in consequence joined Cyrus at Sardes, and accompanied <lb/>
            him in his expedition, but, as it appears, without any military or <lb/>
            other rank.4</p>
          <p>After Cyrus was killed, however, in the affair at Cunaxa, and the <lb/>
            generals were cut off by the perfidy of Tissaphernes, he soon showed <lb/>
            himself capable or exercising command. He stood forward to <lb/>
            answer Phalinus, who came from the king to demand the arms of <lb/>
            the Greeks; he was chosen general by the captains that had served <lb/>
            under Proxenus; and he was quickly found able to take charge of <lb/>
            the whole army. With what ability and success he conducted th( <lb/>
            Ten Thousand in their retreat through deserts and Barbarians, a <lb/>
            march of many hundred miles, is fully related in the Anabasis.</p>
          <p>The kind of connexion that subsisted between Xenophon and <lb/>
            Proxenus might lead us to suppose that they were nearly of the <lb/>
            same age. But Proxenus was only thirty when he was put to death; <lb/>
            and Xenophon, by Krüger's computation, must have been forty- <lb/>
            three or forty-four, not much younger than Clearchus, who was <lb/>
            put to death at fifty. Yet Xenophon seems to speak of himself in <note type="footnote"> 1 12. Krüger, Quæstt. p. 17 </note><note type="footnote">2 Biblioth. ccllx. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A ab. iLi. 1. 4 Anab. iii. 1.</note> <note type="footnote">4 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            the Anabasis as young, so young that his offer to take a command <lb/>
            required an apology;1 he is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign>, according to some <lb/>
            manuscripts, by Phalinus;2 he says that himself and Timasion were <lb/>
            the two youngest of the generals;3 he takes, on every occasion, the <lb/>
            more active duty, as being more appropriate to the young; and a <lb/>
            general impression is certainly left upon the reader that he could <lb/>
            not have reached middle age. Hence Mitfoyd4 concludes that he <lb/>
            must have been between twenty-five and thirty at the time of the <lb/>
            Anabasis. But if we suppose him to have been only twenty years <lb/>
            old at the battle of Delium, he must have been at least forty-three <lb/>
            when he joined Cyrus; and Seuthes addresses him5 as a man ap­ <lb/>
            parently old enough to have a marriageable daughter. On the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign>, even if applied to Xenophon, we may observe that much <lb/>
            stress cannot be laid; for it was used, as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεος</foreign>, with regard to <lb/>
            men even of forty;6 Xenophon, as Sturz observes, says that Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus became king <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι νέος ὤν</foreign>, when it appears from Plutarch that he <lb/>
            was forty-three; and Phavorinus says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign> might be ap­ <lb/>
            plied to a man of any age from twenty-three to forty-one. Besides, <lb/>
            the best manuscripts, in the passage where <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign> is used, read <lb/>
            " Theopompus " instead of " Xenophon," and the mode in which he <lb/>
            introduces himself in the first chapter of the third book, would <lb/>
            almost lead to the conclusion, as has been observed, that his name <lb/>
            ought not to occur in the first two books.</p>
          <p>But whatever attempts we make, it is impossible to come to any <lb/>
            satisfactory decision with regard to the age at which Xenophon <lb/>
            joined Cyrus. Unless we set aside the anecdote of the battle of <lb/>
            Delium, we must believe, with Krüger, that he was not under forty ; <lb/>
            yet from the way in which he speaks of himself, we can hardly help <lb/>
            fancying him younger, and surmising that there must be more in <lb/>
            favour of the arguments for his youth than we can substantiate.</p>
          <p>An argument offered by Schneider,7 to prove that Xenophon was <lb/>
            more than forty at the time of the Anabasis, should not be left un­ <lb/>
            noticed. The entertainment given by Callias, which was the basis <lb/>
            of Xenophon's " Symposium," occurred B. c. 421; and an allusion is <lb/>
            made in the " Symposium"8 to some familiarities of Critobulus with <lb/>
            Cleinias, which, as appears from the "Memorabilia,"9 must have <lb/>
            taken place when Xenophon was a young man. If, accordingly, <lb/>
            we suppose that Xenophon was somewhat more than forty at the <lb/>
            time of the Anabasis, we make him somewhat more than twenty <lb/>
            at the time of Callias's entertainment; a computation satisfactory <lb/>
            enough; but if we consider him, with Mitford, to have been under <lb/>
            thirty at the time of the Anabasis, we unfortunately make him <lb/>
            under ten at the time of the entertainment.10 <note type="footnote"> 1 Anab. ii. 1. 16. </note><note type="footnote">2 Anab. ii. i. 13. </note><note type="footnote">3 iii. 2. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Vol. v. p. 329, seqq. </note><note type="footnote">a Anab. vii. 2. 8. </note><note type="footnote">6 Krüger, p. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Ad Sympos. iv. 25. </note><note type="footnote">8 iv. 25; ibique Schneider. </note><note type="footnote">9 i. 3. 10 </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See the Philological Museum vol i. p 510. </note></p><pb n="viii"/>
            
          <p>Mitford says that the anecdote respecting the battle of Delium is <lb/>
            overthrown by a passage in Athenæus, and that Xenophon is more <lb/>
            than once called <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign> in the Anabasis, but is wrong, <lb/>
            as Mr. Clinton1 observes, in both assertions; for there is nothing <lb/>
            in Athenæus subversive of the evidence as to Delium, and the term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέος</foreign> is not applied to Xenophon in the Anabasis. About <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίσκος</foreign> <lb/>
            we have already settled. Mr. Clinton says that Xenophon was pro­ <lb/>
            bably about forty-two when lie joined Cyrus.</p>
          <p>After the Greeks, on their return, had arrived at Trapezus or <lb/>
            Trebisond, they were conducted from thence to Chrysopolis, op­ <lb/>
            posite Byzantium, and some of them entered the service of Seuthes, <lb/>
            a prince of Thrace, from whom, after performing what they had <lb/>
            undertaken for him, they could with difficulty obtain a portion <lb/>
            of the pay which he had promised them. Soon after they had <lb/>
            settled matters with him, however, they were invited by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to join Thibron, a Spartan general, who was main­ <lb/>
            taining a contest with Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus, and under <lb/>
            whose command Xenophon left almost all that survived of the Ten <lb/>
            Thousand, B. c. 399. But previously, as his finances were exhausted, <lb/>
            he made an expedition, in order to recruit them, into the plain of <lb/>
            the Caicus, where he stormed the residence of a Persian, named <lb/>
            Asidates, and captured Asidates himself, his women, and all his <lb/>
            treasures. Such a foray seems to have been scarcely creditable to <lb/>
            Xenophon, but in his account of it he testifies no concern or shamed <lb/>
            As he had joined the Lacedæmonians, who were at war with Persia, <lb/>
            he probably thought himself justified in treating any Persian as an <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>During Xenophon's absence from Athens Socrates was put to <lb/>
            death, B. c. 399.</p>
          <p>Soon after his return from Asia, and when he was intending to <lb/>
            go to Athens, he learned that sentence of banishment had been <lb/>
            passed against him by his countrymen, for the support which he <lb/>
            had given to Cyrus, the friend of the Lacedæmonians, during the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war.3 In consequence, it has been supposed that <lb/>
            he remained in Asia, with Thibron and his successor Dercyllidas, <lb/>
            and perhaps acted as leader of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυρει̃</foreign>.4 It is certain that in <lb/>
            B. c. 396 he was in Asia with Agesilaus, in his campaign against <lb/>
            the Persians, and that, when Agesilaus was recalled to defend his <lb/>
            country, he accompanied him to the battle of Coroneia, in which <lb/>
            the Thebans and Athenians were defeated by the Spartans, B. c. <lb/>
            394.5 " How he is to be excused for siding with the enemies of <lb/>
            his country," says Kühner, " is shown by H. AVeilius in Zimmer­ <lb/>
            manni Annal. antiq. discip. 1842, p. 144." <note type="footnote"> 1 Fasti Hellenic!, B. c. 401. </note><note type="footnote">2 Anab. vii. 8. 23. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Anab. vii. 7. 57; Pausan. v. 6. 4; Diog.

          <p>After this battle, the Lacedæmonians, perhaps at the instance of <lb/>
            Agesilaus, presented Xenophon with a house and estate at Scillus,1 <lb/>
            a. town of Elis near Olympia, where he was joined by his wife Phi­ <lb/>
            lesia,2 and his two sons, Gryllus and Diodorus, who, by the advice <lb/>
            of Agesilaus, had been educated at Sparta.3 Philesia is said to have <lb/>
            been his second wife, but when or where he married her is un­ <lb/>
            known. Of his residence and grounds he has given a description in <lb/>
            the Anabasis. Here he built a temple to Diana from the proceeds <lb/>
            of some spoil which he had deposited at Ephesus when he accom­ <lb/>
            panied Agesilaus from Asia to Bœotia.</p>
          <p>He appears to have continued to reside here for more than <lb/>
            twenty years, till B. C. 371, when, after the defeat of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians at the battle of Leuctra, the Eleians regained possession of <lb/>
            Scyllus, which had been wrested from them by that people some <lb/>
            time before Xenophon settled there. Xenophon escaped with his <lb/>
            sons, first to Lepreum, and afterwards to Corinth, where he fixed <lb/>
            his abode for the remainder of his life.4</p>
          <p>In B. c. 369, when the Athenians had resolved to assist the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans, whose territories had been invaded by the Thebans, Xenophon, <lb/>
            says Laertius, sent his two sons to fight on the Spartan side. Gryllus <lb/>
            was killed seven years after, at the battle of Mantineia, after having, <lb/>
            as Pausanias relates, killed Epaminondas with his own hand. Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon received the news of his death as he was going to offer sacrifice, <lb/>
            and immediately took the chaplet from his head; but on hearing <lb/>
            that he had died fighting bravely, replaced it. Some relate that he <lb/>
            did not shed a tear, but merely observed that he knew he had be­ <lb/>
            gotten him mortal.5</p>
          <p>The decree for his banishment was repealed, it is said, on the <lb/>
            motion of the same Eubulus by whom it had been proposed; but <lb/>
            in what year is uncertain. Krüger6 thinks that it was about B. c. <lb/>
            369. But it does not appear that he ever returned to Athens. <lb/>
            Diogenes Laertius says that he died at Corinth. The only allusion, <lb/>
            among the writers of antiquity, to the time of his death, is that in <lb/>
            Diogenes Laertius, who cites Stesicleides as saying that he died in <lb/>
            the first year of the hundred and fifth Olympiad, or B. C. 360; but as <lb/>
            it is certain that he was alive three years later, B. c. 357, Kriiger <lb/>
            conjectures that he may have died about B. C. 355.</p>
          <p>From a passage in Athenjeus,7 it appears that he paid a visit to <lb/>
            the elder Dionysius in Sicily. A trifling remark is recorded by <lb/>
            Athenseus which Xenophon made at the tyrant's table.</p>
          <p>It is mentioned by Laertius, as a report, that he edited or pub­ <lb/>
            lished the History of Thucydides, when he might have suppressed <note type="footnote"> 1 Anab. v. 3. 7; Diog. Laert. 1. d. </note><note type="footnote">2 Diog.

            it. Such publication is nowhere else mentioned; and that Xeno <lb/>
            phon could have suppressed the work of Thucydides seems in­ <lb/>
            credible.</p>
          <p>It was during his quiet residence at Scillus that most if not all of <lb/>
            his works were written. Letronne, in the Biographie Universelle, <lb/>
            endeavours to prove that he wrote the Symposium and the Hiero <lb/>
            before he went into Asia to Cyrus, but his arguments are of very <lb/>
            little weight.</p>
          <p>Diogenes Laertius says that Xenophon wrote about forty books; <lb/>
            an expression by which he does not mean forty works, but com­ <lb/>
            prehends in that number the several books or divisions of the larger <lb/>
            works, and the treatises that consist of a single book. By this <lb/>
            mode of computation the number of books is thirty-seven.</p>
          <p>Of all his works the Anabasis has been the most popular. It <lb/>
            narrates in a clear, animated, but unpretending style, the march of <lb/>
            the Ten Thousand up the country under the conduct of Cyrus, and <lb/>
            the difficulties which they surmounted in their retreat after Cyrus's <lb/>
            death. It showed Greece the weakness of the Persian empire, and <lb/>
            the inefficiency alike of its troops and their officers; and fully justi­ <lb/>
            fied the remark of Cyrus before the battle of Cunaxa, that he was <lb/>
            ashamed to say how little resistance the Greeks would find in the <lb/>
            immense numbers of his countrymen. This notion, that Persia <lb/>
            might easily be subjugated by Greeks, continued to prevail, and <lb/>
            was at length amply proved by Alexander to be no mere fancy.</p>
          <p>Of the descriptions of the military movements of the Greeks in <lb/>
            their retreat, it has been justly remarked that they are not always <lb/>
            clear. On the authorship of the Anabasis, and its ascription to The­ <lb/>
            mistogenes, some remarks have been already given. The proba­ <lb/>
            bility is, that Xenophon published it, or part of it, for some reasons <lb/>
            of his own, under the name of Themistogenes.1 " Xenophon and <lb/>
            Cæsar," says Ascham,2 " wrote their own acts so wisely, and so with­ <lb/>
            out all suspicion of partiality, as no man hitherto by mine opinion <lb/>
            hath borne himself so uprightly in writing the histories of others."</p>
          <p>The Hellenics is a history of affairs in Greece from B. c. 410, the <lb/>
            twenty-first of the Peloponnesian War, to the battle of Mantineia, <lb/>
            3. C. 362, a period of forty-eight years, commencing at the point <lb/>
            where the History of Thucydides terminates. One event is men­ <lb/>
            tioned in it, however, as we have noticed, that occurred five years <lb/>
            later, B. C. 357. Niebuhr supposed that the Hellenics consists of two <lb/>
            works, the second commencing with the third section of the third <lb/>
            book, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επει μένοι Τισσαφέρνης</foreign>, &amp;c.; and his opinion is perhaps just. <lb/>
            The point is discussed by Breitenbach in his Prolegomena to the <lb/>
            Hellenics,3 who thinks that the work should certainly be divided <lb/>
            into two parts; that the first, consisting of the first two books, is a <note type="footnote"> 1 Breitenbach, Prolegom. in Hellen. p. xxiv </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Letter to Astely, Works, p. 6, ed. Bennet. </note><note type="footnote"> Gothæ. 1853. in Biblioth. Gr </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            continuation of Thucydides; and that the latter, of a more miscel­ <lb/>
            laneous character, and composed with less regard to chronology, <lb/>
            narrating events that occurred subsequently in Xenophon's own <lb/>
            time, is intended to show how much more successful are acts con­ <lb/>
            sistent with prudence and piety, than those which are the offspring of <lb/>
            presumption, dishonesty, or contempt of religion. This notion, <lb/>
            with respect to the latter portion, may perhaps be thought fanciful; <lb/>
            yet it receives some confirmation from the remarks with which <lb/>
            Xenophon commences the fourth chapter of the fifth book. It is <lb/>
            however of little moment whether we read the Hellenics as one work <lb/>
            or as two. It has been censured as a dry narrative: it is indeed <lb/>
            plain and simple, and destitute of the animation of Thucydides ; <lb/>
            but is nevertheless not without merit. It is much to the credit of <lb/>
            Xenophon that he did not attempt, with inferior force, to rival the <lb/>
            more vigorous and ambitious narration of his predecessor.</p>
          <p>The Cyropædia, says Cicero,1 was written non ad historiesfidem, sed <lb/>
            ad effigiem justi imperii, not in conformity with the truth of history, <lb/>
            but to exhibit a representation of an excellent government. That <lb/>
            it does not adhere to the truth of history is eminently true ; scarcely <lb/>
            any historical romance has departed farther from it; time is set at <lb/>
            utter defiance, and things are often, apparently, done in a few days, <lb/>
            which it must have taken months or years to accomplish. It is <lb/>
            strange that Xenophon should have ventured to make Cyrus die in <lb/>
            his bed, when the true account of his death was before the public <lb/>
            in the pages of Herodotus. The speech given to Cyrus on his death­ <lb/>
            bed, however, is one of the finest parts of the book; Cicero has <lb/>
            shown his estimation of it by adopting much of it in his De Senectute, <lb/>
            and Sallust has borrowed from it. His picture of Persian manners <lb/>
            and education is imaginary, or based on the discipline of Sparta, <lb/>
            which he so greatly admired. The title of the work is often re­ <lb/>
            garded as applicable only to the first book, which relates the edu­ <lb/>
            cation of Cyrus himself, but Fischer2 extends it to signify the <lb/>
            whole discipline and order of things which Cyrus instituted through­ <lb/>
            out his dominions when he became a ruler. The work is less in­ <lb/>
            teresting than the Anabasis, inasmuch as fiction must always be less <lb/>
            interesting than truth. That the last chapter is probably spurious <lb/>
            I have remarked in a note upon it.</p>
          <p>The Memorabilia of Socrates defends the character of the phi­ <lb/>
            losopher against the two charges on which he had been condemned, <lb/>
            that of rejecting the gods of his country, and that of corrupting <lb/>
            the youth. It exhibits Socrates as he appeared to the Athenian <lb/>
            public, and makes it evident that the accusations brought against <lb/>
            him were utterly unfounded. Socrates is shown to have been a <lb/>
            philosopher who retained, to all appearance, his belief in the exist <lb/>
            ence of the gods worshipped by his country, and who paid them <note type="footnote"> Fratr. i. 1. 8. </note><note type="footnote">2 Præfat. ad Comment, in Cyrop. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            respect, and looked to them for guidance in difficult circum­ <lb/>
            stances.</p>
          <p>Socrates at an early period felt convinced that his business in <lb/>
            life was to acquire knowledge, and to instruct others ; to ascertain <lb/>
            what, in human affairs, was to be esteemed and pursued, and what <lb/>
            to be despised and avoided ; and to stimulate men to practise the <lb/>
            good and to shim the evil. But first he proceeded to ascertain <lb/>
            how far he was qualified for the task which he meditated. He <lb/>
            began, accordingly, by questioning some who had the highest re­ <lb/>
            putation for wisdom, and found that, however knowing they might <lb/>
            be in particular departments, they were not superior to himself, <lb/>
            but rather inferior in general power and compass of intellect; and <lb/>
            hence it was that the oracle, perhaps at the instigation of his friend <lb/>
            Chærephon, declared him the wisest of men ; he could see the way <lb/>
            in which others ought to walk, better than they saw it themselves. <lb/>
            He made it his object to overthrow all false conceit of knowledge; <lb/>
            to awaken a consciousness of ignorance where ignorance existed; <lb/>
            and to inculcate the Delphic admonition, "Know thyself." He <lb/>
            endeavoured to draw men's attention from mathematical and phy­ <lb/>
            sical studies, as they were then pursued, directed to vain inquiries <lb/>
            and speculations, ending in no useful result, to the contemplation of <lb/>
            what was good or evil in human life and conduct; and was accord­ <lb/>
            ingly said to have brought philosophy from heaven down to earth. <lb/>
            He interrogated men as to what they were doing, and excited them <lb/>
            tv think, of what they ought to do. He said that men should have <lb/>
            as exact a knowledge of ethics, and of the great duties of human <lb/>
            life, as that which artists or mechanics possessed in their respective <lb/>
            crafts. It was from him that induction, and the careful definition <lb/>
            of general terms, had their origin.1 For the objects which he <lb/>
            pursued, he was qualified, not only intellectually, but physically ; <lb/>
            he had, though of a physiognomy that people were obliged to call <lb/>
            ugly, a winning address; he had a strong frame, not to be ex­ <lb/>
            hausted by the longest discussion ; he could control his natural <lb/>
            wants, and content himself with such humble clothing and fare as <lb/>
            showed him proof against ridicule. He sought no share in political <lb/>
            occupations ; for he said that he was divinely dissuaded from doing <lb/>
            so. He talked with all kinds of persons; he asked no money for <lb/>
            the instruction which he gave; he had no disciples, but all who <lb/>
            would might profit by his conversation. By such as were able to <lb/>
            profit by it he was followed and honoured; of such as were unable <lb/>
            to value it, some quietly deserted him, while others, by his confuta­ <lb/>
            tions or admonitions, were humiliated or exasperated, and became <lb/>
            his enemies. Some of these accused him of corrupting the youth, <lb/>
            because he made them wiser than their fathers; and of introducing <lb/>
            strange gods, because he said that he had within him a dæmo- <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristot. Metaphys. i. 6. 3; xiii. 4, 6—8; Grote's Hist. of Greece, ch <lb/>

            mum, or divine influence, which restrained him from doing what <lb/>
            was wrong or inexpedient; and he was put to death because he <lb/>
            refused to make undue submission, or to acknowledge himself in <lb/>
            error, before his judges.1 He left a name to be venerated ; and his <lb/>
            influence upon human reasoning has been greater, perhaps, than <lb/>
            that of any man who ever lived; an influence wonderful as pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from one who left nothing written.</p>
          <p>The picture of Socrates given by Xenophon represents him as <lb/>
            discoursing chiefly on those plain topics of every-day life, which, <lb/>
            as it would appear, he was generally inclined to discuss; that given <lb/>
            of him by Plato exhibits him descanting on sublimer and more <lb/>
            speculative subjects, in the contemplation of which he was doubt­ <lb/>
            less accustomed at times to indulge.</p>
          <p>The Œconomicus has been called by Weiske a fifth book of the <lb/>
            Memorabilia ; but without the least reason ; for a conclusion is put <lb/>
            to the Memorabilia at the end of the fourth book; and the Œcono­ <lb/>
            micus is not similar in character to the books of that work. It <lb/>
            contains instruction on agriculture, on the management of farms, <lb/>
            and on the duties and value of a wife in the conduct of a house­ <lb/>
            hold. The observations made in it on this last point refute, as Mr. <lb/>
            Long2 justly observes, the notion that the attachment of husband <lb/>
            and wife, independent of the sexual passion, and their permanent <lb/>
            love after both have grown old, is a characteristic of modern society, <lb/>
            and that the men of Greece and Rome were not susceptible of that <lb/>
            affection which survives the decay of a woman's youth and beauty." <lb/>
            The translation of this treatise by R. Bradley, F. R. S., Professor <lb/>
            of Botany at Cambridge, 1727, 8vo, is ridiculously unfaithful, full <lb/>
            of wanton insertions, omissions, and falsifications of every kind; <lb/>
            and the reader who compares it with the original must feel astonish­ <lb/>
            ed that such perversions of Xenophon's matter could have proceeded <lb/>
            from a man in such a position.</p>
          <p>The Symposium, or Banquet, shows the humours of an entertain­ <lb/>
            ment at the house of Callias, a rich Athenian, Socrates, Critobulus, <lb/>
            Charmides, Antisthenes, and others, being the speakers, and love and <lb/>
            friendship being the subjects of discussion. It is said to have been <lb/>
            written after the Symposium of Plato.3 It has been translated <lb/>
            into English by Dr. Welwood, but with variations, in many pas­ <lb/>
            sages, from the original.</p>
          <p>The Hiero is a short dialogue between Hiero, king of Syracuse, <lb/>
            and the poet Simonides, in which Hiero states the disadvantages <lb/>
            of an exalted station, and Simonides specifies its blessings, adding <lb/>
            some suggestions as to the best mode of employing power for the <lb/>
            public good. It is thought by Letronne that Xenophon may have <lb/>
            been induced to write this piece by what he saw at the court of <lb/>
            Dionysius. It has been very well translated by Graves. <note type="footnote"> 1 Arrian, Ep. Diss. ii. 2. 18, </note><note type="footnote">2 Smith's Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Biog. art. Xenophon. </note><note type="footnote">3 Smith's Diet. ibid-</note></p><pb n="xiv"/>
            
          <p>The Agesilaus is a panegyric on tne great Agesilaus, king of <lb/>
            Srarta, Xenophon's friend. Cicero speaks of him as the instructor <lb/>
            of Agesilaus, and says, "The single little book of Xenophon," "in <lb/>
            praise of that king, is worth all the pictures and statues in honour of <lb/>
            all other princes."1 Modern readers are apt to make the same <lb/>
            complaint of it that Charles II. made of the praises offered him by <lb/>
            Cowley, that it is rather tame and insipid.</p>
          <p>The two treatises On the Athenian and Lacedæmonian Common­ <lb/>
            wealths, which, though not always regarded, even by the ancients, as <lb/>
            genuine works of Xenophon, have nothing in their matter or style <lb/>
            to prove that he was not the author of them, show that the writer <lb/>
            evidently preferred the polity of Sparta to that of Athens. The <lb/>
            treatise on the Republic of Athens has been translated into English <lb/>
            by James Morris, 1794. Of that on the State of Sparta there is, I <lb/>
            believe, no English translation.</p>
          <p>The little work On the Revenues of Athens, is intended to show <lb/>
            how the public revenues of Athens might be improved. Its matter <lb/>
            and merits are fully discussed in Boeckh's " Public Economy of <lb/>
            Athens." It was translated into English by Walter Moyle, Esq., <lb/>
            1697.</p>
          <p>The Hipparchicus is a treatise on the duties of a cavalry officer. <lb/>
            It contains a variety of directions on the equipment, evolutions, and <lb/>

          <p>The treatise On Horsemanship, though placed by Schneider before <lb/>
            the Hipparchicus, was written after it, there being a reference to <lb/>
            the latter at the end of the former. It gives a number of precepts <lb/>
            on the management, choice, and training of horses ; precepts which <lb/>
            the writer considers that from long experience in horses he is well <lb/>

          <p>The Cynegeticus is a little work on hunting, the breeding and <lb/>
            qualities of dogs, and the various modes of taking hares, foxes, boars, <lb/>
            and other game. The last chapter contains some strictures on the <lb/>
            sophists, as distinguished from the philosophers, which have little <lb/>
            to do with the subject.</p>
          <p>The Nine Epistles printed with the works of Xenophon were not <lb/>
            written by him, but are mere forgeries or scholastic essays.2</p>
          <p>Of Xenophon's style his own countrymen must be allowed to be <lb/>
            the best judges ; and they found such charms in it that they called <lb/>
            him the Athenian Muse,3 and the Attic Bee.4 Dionysius of Hali­ <lb/>

            affectation could attain," and says that " what Pericles observed of <lb/>
            the ancient comedy may be justly transferred to him, that the god­ <lb/>
            dess of persuasion dwelt upon his lips;" and Cicero 1 says that " his <lb/>
            language is sweeter than honey," and "that the Muses spoke with <lb/>
            his mouth." His style is indeed simple, perspicuous, and agreeable. <lb/>
            He never rises above a certain level, but beneath that level is always <lb/>
            pleasing, elegant, and consistent with himself. He sometimes bor­ <lb/>
            rows a poetical expression, but never disfigures his page with pur­ <lb/>
            ple patches. The piece in which he displays most animation of style <lb/>
            is the Anabasis; in the Cyropædia, the sentences, though far more <lb/>
            laboured, are sometimes long and heavy. In the Hellenics, Kühner2 <lb/>
            charges him with being often dry and jejune. His brevity, in many <lb/>
            passages of that work, certainly renders him obscure, and leaves <lb/>
            his reader dissatisfied.</p>
          <p>It is said by Lord Monboddo3 that the language of Cæsar's Com­ <lb/>
            mentaries is perhaps the best" memoir-style " that ever was written. <lb/>
            I know not why it should be preferred to that of Xenophon in the <lb/>
            Anabasis.</p>
          <p>Dr. Johnson has justly observed, that the characters of the de­ <lb/>
            ceased generals drawn in the second book of the Anabasis are the <lb/>
            earliest specimens of that kind of portraiture.</p>
          <p>Xenophon, as a man, if we form our opinion of him from his <lb/>
            writings and the voice of antiquity, was of a highly honourable <lb/>
            character; just, generous, and humane. In paying reverence to <lb/>
            the gods, as worshipped by his countrymen, he was a disciple of <lb/>
            Socrates, and went beyond his master, apparently, in what was to <lb/>
            him a religious respect, but what we are inclined to call a super­ <lb/>
            stitious fondness, for omens, dreams, and other supposed signs <lb/>
            from heaven. He shows this propensity through all his works, <lb/>
            and is ready to admit the providence and agency of the gods on <lb/>
            every occasion. Hume4 has noticed many instances of his super­ <lb/>
            stition. He could tell a plain story, or discuss ordinary topics, <lb/>
            with fluency and clearness, but had not an intellect, like that of <lb/>
            Plato, for the consideration of abstruse or sublime metaphysical <lb/>
            questions. He encourages his readers to the cultivation of virtue, <lb/>
            and the study of what he thought useful and likely to contribute to <lb/>
            their happiness. He has been censured for his approbation of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian polity, and his dislike and depreciation of that of his <lb/>
            country ; but he was certainly at liberty, like any other man, to <lb/>
            form a judgment on a comparison of the two, and, if he preferred <lb/>
            the ancient Spartan severity to the disorder, corruption, and laxity <lb/>
            of morals, which in his time prevailed in Athens, to express his <lb/>
            opinion to that effect. Though the ground for his banishment <lb/>
            seems hardly just, it does not appear that, while he was in exile, he <lb/>
            took any part in hostilities against his country; if he was present <note type="footnote"> I Orat. c. 19. </note><note type="footnote">a Prolegom. in Anab. p. x. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Or. and Pr. of Language, vol iv. p. 293. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Essays, vol. ii. note DDD, </note><note type="footnote">5 Prolegom. in Anab. p. xvii </note> <lb/>

            at the battle of Coroneia, there is no proof that he gave the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians any assistance in it. The attack upon the Persian <lb/>
            Asidates is the only known act of his life in which we can charge <lb/>
            him with having deviated from strict morality. In drawing the <lb/>
            character of Menon, it is thought that he must have been unjust, as <lb/>
            it could hardly have been so black as it is painted; since Menon is <lb/>
            represented by Plato, in the Dialogue which bears his name, as a <lb/>
            man ol better character; but "Xenophon," as Kühner1 observes, <lb/>
            " might have known his morals better than Plato; Plato introduces <lb/>
            him as a young man, and he had plenty of time to grow worse <lb/>
            before be joined Cyrus; and even from Plato himself it appears <lb/>
            that he was of a proud and insolent temper."</p>
          <p>A notion was in early times more or less prevalent among the <lb/>
            learned, that there was great rivalry and enmity between Xenophon <lb/>
            and Plato.2 The chief arguments for that supposition, as given by <lb/>
            Aulus Gellius, are, that Plato, in all his works, makes no mention of <lb/>
            Xenophon, and Xenophon in his makes no mention of Plato,3 though <lb/>
            each had ample opportunities of alluding to the other ; that Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, on reading the first two books of Plato's Republic, proceeded <lb/>
            to write the Cyropædia in opposition to it, and that Plato, annoyed <lb/>
            at Xenophon's conduct, took occasion to observe, in speaking of <lb/>
            Cyrus, that he was a brave and active man, but had not been happy <lb/>
            in his discipline and government; and that Xenophon, in his Me­ <lb/>
            morabilia, represents Socrates as discountenancing physical specula­ <lb/>
            tions, in order to throw discredit on Plato, who was inclined to in­ <lb/>
            dulge in them. But Gellius himself thinks that these arguments <lb/>
            are not sufficient to establish the fact of their enmity, and inclines <lb/>
            to suppose that the report of it arose from the subsequent disputes <lb/>
            between their partisans, as to which of the two was the wiser or <lb/>
            greater philosopher, from which disputes it came to be believed <lb/>
            that there had existed jealousy and ill-feeling between the two <lb/>
            philosophers themselves. Athenæus and Laertius observe that one <lb/>
            of them wrote a Symposium in emulation of the other, but do not <lb/>
            say which of the two wrote first; it is generally supposed, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the Symposium of Plato was the first to make its appear­ <lb/>
            ance.4 Menage5 thinks that Gellius was deceived, and that <lb/>
            jealousy did exist between the two; Heusde6 and Ast,7 the com­ <lb/>
            mentators on Plato, are of the same opinion. On the whole, the <lb/>
            general voice seems to be too strong against Gellius. But whence <lb/>
            the enmity, if it existed, arose, there is among the ancients neither <lb/>
            account nor conjecture. <lb/>

          <p>Remarks on the several forms of government. On the government of in­ <lb/>
            ferior animals, and the difficulty of governing men. The great power of <lb/>
            Cyrus, and his excellence as a ruler.</p>
          <p>i. THE reflection once occurred to me, how many democra­ <lb/>
            cies have been dissolved by men who chose to live under some <lb/>
            other government rather than a democracy; how many mon­ <lb/>
            archies, and how many oligarchies, have been overthrown by the <lb/>
            people; and how many individuals, who have tried to estab­ <lb/>
            lish tyrannies, have, some of them, been at once entirely de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, while others, if they have continued to reign for any <lb/>
            length of time, have been admired as wise and fortunate men. <lb/>
            I had observed, too, I thought, many masters, in their own <lb/>
            private houses, some indeed having many servants, but some <lb/>
            only very few, and yet utterly unable to keep those few entire­ <lb/>
            ly obedient to their commands. 2. I considered also that herds­ <lb/>
            men are the rulers of oxen, and horse-feeders of horses ; and <lb/>
            that, in general, all those called overseers of animals may <lb/>
            properly be accounted the rulers of the animals of which they <lb/>
            have the charge. I thought that I perceived all these herds <lb/>
            more willing to obey their keepers than men their governors; <lb/>
            for the herds go the way that their keepers direct them ; they <lb/>
            feed on those lands to which their keepers drive them, and <note type="footnote"> VOL. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. 1. </note> <lb/>
            abstain from those from which they repel them; and they <lb/>
            suffer their keepers to make what use they please of the pro­ <lb/>
            fits1 that arise from them. Besides, I never saw a herd con­ <lb/>
            spiring against its keeper, either with a view of not obeying <lb/>
            him, or of not allowing him to enjoy the advantages arising <lb/>
            from them ; for herds are more refractory towards strangers <lb/>
            than they are towards their keepers, and those who make pro­ <lb/>
            fit of them ; but men conspire against none sooner than against <lb/>
            those whom they perceive attempting to rule them. 3. While <lb/>
            I was reflecting upon these things, I came to this judgment <lb/>
            upon them; that to man, such is his nature, it was easier to <lb/>
            rule every other sort of creature than to rule man. But when <lb/>
            I considered that there was Cyrus the Persian, who had ren­ <lb/>
            dered many men, many cities, and many nations, obedient to <lb/>
            him, I was then necessitated to change my opinion, and to <lb/>
            think that to rule men is not among the things that are im­ <lb/>
            possible, or even difficult, if a person undertakes it with under­ <lb/>
            standing and skill. I knew that there were some who will­ <lb/>
            ingly obeyed Cyrus, that were many days' journey, and others <lb/>
            that were even some months' journey, distant from him ; some, <lb/>
            too, who had never seen him, and some who knew very well <lb/>
            that they never should see him ; and yet they readily submit­ <lb/>
            ted to his government; 4. for he so far excelled all other kings, <lb/>
            as well those that had received their dominion from their <lb/>
            forefathers, as those that had acquired it by their own efforts, <lb/>
            that the Scythian, for example, though his people be very <lb/>
            numerous, is unable to obtain the dominion over any other na­ <lb/>
            tion, but rests satisfied if he can but continue to rule his own ; <lb/>
            so it is with the Thracian king in regard to the Thracians, <lb/>
            and with the Illyrian king in regard to the Illyrians; and so <lb/>
            it is with other nations, as many as I have heard of; for the <lb/>
            nations of Europe, at least, are said to be independent and de­ <lb/>
            tached from each other. But Cyrus, finding, in like manner, the <lb/>
            nations of Asia independent, and setting out with a little army <lb/>
            of Persians, obtained the dominion over the Medes by their <lb/>
            own choice, and over the Hyrcanians in a similar manner; <lb/>
            he subdued the Syrians, Assyrians, Arabians, Cappadocians, <lb/>
            both the Phrygians, the Lydians, Carians, Phœnicians, and <lb/>
            Babylonians; he had under his rule the Bactrians, Indians, <note type="footnote"> Milk, wool, labour in the plough, and any other profits that <lb/>
            men cap derive from them. </note> <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2. ]</note> <lb/>
            and Cilicians, as well as the Sacians, Paphlagonians, and Ma­ <lb/>
            gadidians, and many other nations of whom we cannot enu­ <lb/>
            merate even the names. He had dominion over the Greeks <lb/>
            that were settled in Asia ; and, going down to the sea, over <lb/>
            the Cyprians and Egyptians, 5. These nations he ruled, <lb/>
            though they spoke neither the same language with himself <lb/>
            nor with one another; yet he was able to extend the fear of <lb/>
            himself over so great a part of the world that he astonished <lb/>
            all, and no one attempted anything against him. He was <lb/>
            able to inspire all with so great a desire of pleasing him, that <lb/>
            they ever desired to be governed by his opinion; and he at­ <lb/>
            tached to himself so many nations as it would be a labour to <lb/>
            enumerate, which way soever we should commence our course <lb/>
            from his palace, whether towards the east, west, north, or south. <lb/>
            6. With respect to this man, therefore, as worthy of admira­ <lb/>
            tion, I have inquired what he was by birth, what qualities he <lb/>
            possessed from nature, and with what education he was brought <lb/>
            up, that he so eminently excelled in governing men. What­ <lb/>
            ever, accordingly, I have ascertained, or think that I under­ <lb/>
            stand, concerning him, I shall endeavour to relate.</p>

          <p>Birth of Cyrus. His excellent qualities of mind and body. His education <lb/>
            among the Persians. Account of their laws and institutions, and mode <lb/>
            of training youth.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS is said to have had for his father Cambyses, king <lb/>
            of the Persians. Cambyses was of the race of the Perseidæ, <lb/>
            who were so called from Perseus. It is agreed that he was <lb/>
            born of a mother named Mandane ; and Mandane was the <lb/>
            daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. Cyrus is described, <lb/>
            and is still celebrated by the Barbarians, as having been most <lb/>
            handsome in person, most humane in disposition, most eager <lb/>
            for knowledge, and most ambitious of honour; so that he <lb/>
            would undergo any labour and face any danger for the sake of <lb/>
            obtaining praise. 2. Such is the constitution of mind and body <lb/>
            that he is recorded to have had; and he was educated in con­ <lb/>
            formity with the laws of the Persians. <note type="footnote">B 2 </note></p><pb n="4"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. I. </note>These laws seem to begin with a provident care for the <lb/>
            common good; not where they begin in most other govern­ <lb/>
            ments ; for most governments, leaving each individual to edu­ <lb/>
            cate his children as he pleases, and the advanced in age to live <lb/>
            as they please, enjoin their people not to steal, not to plunder, <lb/>
            not to enter a house by violence, not to strike any one whom <lb/>
            it is wrong to strike, not to be adulterous, not to disobey <lb/>
            the magistrates, and other such things in like manner ; and, if <lb/>
            people transgress any of these precepts, they impose punish­ <lb/>
            ments upon them. 3. But the Persian laws, by anticipation, <lb/>
            are careful to provide from the beginning, that their citizens <lb/>
            shall not be such as to be inclined to any action that is bad <lb/>
            and mean. This care they take in the following manner. They <lb/>
            have an Agora,1 called The Free, where the king's palace <lb/>
            and other houses for magistrates are built; all things for sale, <lb/>
            and the dealers in them, their cries and coarsenesses, are ban­ <lb/>
            ished from hence to some other place; that the disorder of <lb/>
            these may not interfere with the regularity of those who are <lb/>
            under instruction. 4. This Agora, round the public courts, <lb/>
            is divided into four parts; of these, one is for the boys, one <lb/>
            for the youth, one for the full-grown men, and one for those <lb/>
            who are beyond the years for military service. Each of these <lb/>
            divisions, according to the law, attend in their several quarters; <lb/>
            the boys and full-grown men as soon as it is day; the elders <lb/>
            when they think convenient, except upon appointed days, <lb/>
            when they are obliged to be present. The youth pass the <lb/>
            night round the courts, in their light arms, except such as are <lb/>
            married; for these are not required to do so, unless orders <lb/>
            have been previously given them ; nor is it becoming in them <lb/>
            to be often absent. 5. Over each of the classes there are <lb/>
            twelve presidents, for there are twelve distinct tribes of the <lb/>
            Persians. Those over the boys are chosen from amongst the <lb/>
            elders, and are such as are thought likely to make them the best <lb/>
            boys ; those over the youth are chosen from amongst the full- <lb/>
            grown men, and are such as are thought likely to make them <lb/>
            the best youth; and over the full-grown men, such as are <note type="footnote"> 1 An open forum or square, free from buyers and sellers. Aris­ <lb/>

            their appointed duties, and in executing the orders given by <lb/>
            the chief magistrate. There are likewise chosen presidents <lb/>
            over the elders, who take care that these also perform their <lb/>
            duties. What it is prescribed to each age to do, we shall re­ <lb/>
            late, that it may be the better understood how the Persian <lb/>
            take precautions that excellent citizens may be produced.</p>
          <p>6. The boys attending the public schools, pass their time in <lb/>
            learning justice; and say that they go for this purpose, as <lb/>
            those with us say who go to learn to read. Their presidents <lb/>
            spend the most part of the day in dispensing justice amongst <lb/>
            them; for there are among the boys, as among the men, ac­ <lb/>
            cusations for theft, robbery, violence, deceit, calumny, and <lb/>
            other such things as naturally occur; and such as they con­ <lb/>
            vict of doing wrong, in any of these respects, they punish ; 7. <lb/>
            they punish likewise such as they find guilty of false accusa­ <lb/>
            tion ; they appeal to justice also in the case of a crime for <lb/>
            which men hate one another excessively, but for which they <lb/>
            never go to law, that is, ingratitude; and whomsoever they <lb/>
            find able to return a benefit, and not returning it, they punish <lb/>
            severely. For they think that the ungrateful are careless with <lb/>
            regard to the gods, their parents, their country, and their <lb/>
            friends ; and upon ingratitude seems closely to follow shame­ <lb/>
            lessness, which appears to be the principal conductor of mail­ <lb/>
            kind into all that is dishonourable.</p>
          <p>8. They also teach the boys self-control; and it contributes <lb/>
            much towards their learning to control themselves, that they <lb/>
            see every day their elders behaving themselves with discre­ <lb/>
            tion. They teach them also to obey their officers; and it <lb/>
            contributes much to this end, that they see their elders coil <lb/>
            stantly obedient to their officers. They teach them temper <lb/>
            ance with respect to eating and drinking; and it contributes <lb/>
            much to this object, that they see that their elders do not quit <lb/>
            their stations to satisfy their appetites, until their officers dis­ <lb/>
            miss them, and that the boys themselves do not eat with their <lb/>
            mothers, but with their teachers, and when the officers give <lb/>
            the signal. They bring from home with them bread, and a <lb/>
            sort of cresses to eat with it; and a cup to drink from, that, <note type="footnote"> ‟<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οψον δἑ</foreign> ĸ<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρδαμον</foreign>. ״<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οψον</foreign> signifies anything that was eaten with <lb/>

            if any are thirsty, they may take water from the river.1 They <lb/>
            learn, besides, to shoot with the bow, and to throw the jave­ <lb/>
            lin. These exercises the boys practise till they are sixteen <lb/>
            or seventeen years of age, when they enter the class of young <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>9. The young men pass their time thus: For ten years <lb/>
            after they go from the class of boys, they pass the night <lb/>
            round the courts, as I have said before, both for the secur­ <lb/>
            aty and guard of the city, and for the sake of practising self­ <lb/>
            restraint ; for this age seems most to need superintendence. <lb/>
            During the day they keep themselves at the command of their <lb/>
            officers, in case they want them for any public service; and <lb/>
            when it is necessary they all wait at the courts. But when­ <lb/>
            ever the king goes out to hunt, he takes half the guard out <lb/>
            with him, and leaves half of it behind ; and this he does several <lb/>
            times every month. Those that go out must have their bow, <lb/>
            with a quiver, a bill or small sword in a sheath, a light shield, <lb/>
            and two javelins, one to throw, and the other, if necessary, <lb/>
            to use at hand. 10. They attend to hunting as a matter of <lb/>
            public interest, and the king, as in war, is their leader, hunt­ <lb/>
            ing himself, and seeing that others do so ; because it seems to <lb/>
            them to be the most efficient exercise for all such things as re­ <lb/>
            late to war. It accustoms them to rise early in the morning, <lb/>
            and to bear heat and cold ; it exercises them in long marches, <lb/>
            and in running; it necessitates them to use their bow against <lb/>
            the beast that they hunt, and to throw their javelin, wherever he <lb/>
            falls in their way, their courage must, of necessity, be often <lb/>
            sharpened in the hunt, when any of the strong and vigorous <lb/>
            beasts present themselves ; for they must come to blows with <lb/>
            the animal if he comes up to them, and must be upon their <lb/>
            guard as he approaches; so that it is not easy to find what <lb/>
            single thing, of all that is practised in war, is not to be found <lb/>
            in hunting. 11. They go out to hunt provided with a dinner, <lb/>
            larger, indeed, as is but right, than that of the boys, but in <lb/>
            other respects the same ; and during the hunt perhaps they <lb/>
            may not eat it; but if it be necessary to remain on the ground <lb/>
            to watch for the beast, or if for any other reason they wish to <lb/>
            spend more time in the hunt, they sup upon this dinner, and <note type="footnote"> very similar to it; the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάρδαμον βλἑπειν</foreign> signified to look <lb/>
            sharp or malicious. </note><note type="footnote"> The Araxes, on which Persepolis stood. Cellar. Geog. ii. 680. </note> <pb n="7"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2. ]</note> <lb/>
            hunt again the next day till supper-time, and reckon these two <lb/>
            days as but one, because they eat the food of but one day. <lb/>
            This abstinence they practise to accustom themselves to it, so <lb/>
            that, should it be necessary in war, they may be able to ob­ <lb/>
            serve it. Those of this age have what they catch for meat <lb/>
            with their bread ; or, if they catch nothing, their cresses. And, <lb/>
            if any one think that they eat with out pleasure when they have <lb/>
            cresses only with their bread, and that they drink without <lb/>
            pleasure when they drink only water, let him recollect how <lb/>
            pleasant barley cake or bread is to eat to one who is hungry, <lb/>
            and how pleasant water is to drink to one who is thirsty.</p>
          <p>12. The parties that remain at home pass their time in <lb/>
            practising what they learned while they were boys, as well as <lb/>
            other things, such as using the bow and throwing the jave­ <lb/>
            lin ; and they pursue these exercises with mutual emulation, <lb/>
            as there are public contests in their several accomplishments, <lb/>
            and prizes offered; and in whichsoever of the tribes there are <lb/>
            found the most who excel in skill, in courage, and in obedi­ <lb/>
            ence, the citizens applaud and honour, not only the present <lb/>
            commander of them, but also the person who had the instruc­ <lb/>
            tion of them when they were boys. The magistrates likewise <lb/>
            make use of the youth that remain at home, if they want them, <lb/>
            to keep guard upon any occasion, to search for malefactors, to <lb/>
            pursue robbers, or for any other business that requires strength <lb/>
            and agility. In these occupations the youth are exercised.</p>
          <p>But when they have completed their ten years, they enter <lb/>
            into the class of full-grown men ; 13. who, from the time they <lb/>
            leave the class of youth, pass five and twenty years in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing manner. First, like the youth, they keep themselves <lb/>
            at the command of the magistrates, that they may use their <lb/>
            services, if it should be necessary, for the public good, in what­ <lb/>
            ever employments require the exertions of such as have dis­ <lb/>
            cretion, and are yet in vigour. If it be necessary to undertake <lb/>
            any military expedition, they who are in this state of disci­ <lb/>
            pline do not march out with bows and javelins, but with <lb/>
            what are called arms for close fight, a corslet over the breast, <lb/>
            a shield in the left hand, such as that with which the Persians <lb/>
            are painted, and, in the right, a large sword or bill. All the <lb/>
            magistrates are chosen from this class, except the teachers of <lb/>
            the boys; and, when they have completed five and twenty <lb/>
            years in this class, they will then be something more than <pb n="8"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. 1. </note> <lb/>
            fifty years of age, and pass into the class of such as are elders <lb/>
            and are so called. 14. These elders no longer go on any <lb/>
            military service abroad, but, remaining at home, have the dis­ <lb/>
            pensation of public and private justice; they take cognizance <lb/>
            of matters of life and death, and have the choice of all magis­ <lb/>
            trates ; and, if any of the youth or full-grown men fail in <lb/>
            anything enjoined by the laws, the several magistrates of <lb/>
            the tribes, or any one that chooses, gives information of it, <lb/>
            when the elders hear the cause, and pass sentence upon it; <lb/>
            and the person that is condemned remains infamous for the <lb/>
            rest of his life.</p>
          <p>15. But that the whole Persian form of government may be <lb/>
            shown more clearly, I shall go back a little ; for, from what <lb/>
            has been already said, it may now be set forth in a very few <lb/>
            words. The Persians are said to be in number about a hun­ <lb/>
            dred and twenty thousand ;1 of these no individual is excluded <lb/>
            by law from honours and magistracies, but all are at liberty <lb/>
            to send their boys to the public schools of justice. Those <lb/>
            who are able to maintain their children without putting them <lb/>
            to work, send them to these schools; they who are unable, do <lb/>
            not send them. Those who are thus educated under the pub­ <lb/>
            lic teachers, are at liberty to pass their youth in the class of <lb/>
            young men ; they who are not so educated, have not that <lb/>
            liberty. They who pass their term among the young men, <lb/>
            discharging all things enjoined by the law, are allowed to be <lb/>
            incorporated amongst the full-grown men, and to partake of <lb/>
            all honours and magistracies; but they who do not complete <lb/>
            their course in the class of youth, do not pass into that of the <lb/>
            full-grown men. Those who make their progress through the <lb/>
            order of full-grown men unexceptionably, are then enrolled <lb/>
            among the elders ; so that the order of elders stands composed <lb/>
            of men who have pursued their course through all things good <lb/>
            and excellent. Such is the form of government among the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, and such the care bestowed upon it, by the observance of <lb/>
            which they think that they become the best citizens. 16. <lb/>
            There remain to the present day proofs of the spare diet used <lb/>
            among them, and of their carrying it off by exercise ; for it is <lb/>
            yet unbecoming among them to spit or to blow the nose, or to <lb/>
            appear troubled with flatulency; it is unbecoming for any one <note type="footnote"> Xenophon means that this was the number of those of the bet­ <lb/>
            ter class, educated in the way here described. </note> <pb n="9"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            to be seen going aside to make water, or for any similar cause ; <lb/>
            and to these habits they could not possibly adhere, unless <lb/>
            they used a very temperate diet, and exhausted their moisture <lb/>
            by exercise, so that it may pass off some other way.</p>
          <p>These particulars I had to state concerning the Persians in <lb/>
            general. I will now relate the actions of Cyrus, upon whose <lb/>
            account this narrative was undertaken, beginning from his <lb/>
            boyhood.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Cyrus, when he is twelve years old, accompanies his mother on a visit to his <lb/>
            grandfather Astyages. His behaviour and conversation with his grand­ <lb/>
            father. His erroneous decision in a cause. His discourse with his mother <lb/>
            on justice.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS, till twelve years of age, or a little more, was <lb/>
            educated under this discipline, and evidently excelled all his <lb/>
            equals, both in quickly learning what was necessary, and in <lb/>
            doing everything in a becoming and manly way. At that <lb/>
            time Astyages sent for his daughter and her son ; for he was <lb/>
            desirous to see him, having heard that he was a handsome and <lb/>
            excellent child. Accordingly Mandane went to her fathe. <lb/>
            and took her son Cyrus with her. 2. As soon as she arrived, <lb/>
            and Cyrus knew Astyages to be his mother's father, he in­ <lb/>
            stantly, as being a boy naturally affectionate, embraced him. <lb/>
            just as if he had been previously brought up with him, and <lb/>
            had long loved him ; and, observing him adorned with paint <lb/>
            about his eyes1 and colour 2 applied to his face, and with arti­ <lb/>
            ficial hair, things that are customary amongst the Medes, (for <lb/>
            purple coats, cloaks, collars about the neck, and bracelets on <lb/>
            the wrists, are all Median decorations; but amongst the Per- <note type="footnote">1 The Medes used to tinge the lower part of the eye-lids (hence <lb/>

            had an astringent and contracting quality, and thus made the <lb/>
            eyes seem larger than they would naturally have appeared; and <lb/>
            large full eyes were accounted a beauty. Fischer. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cerussa, white lead, to give whiteness to the skin, Plin. H. N. <lb/>

            sians at home, even at this day, their habits are much coarser, <lb/>
            and their diet more simple,) observing this dress of his grand­ <lb/>
            father, and fixing his eyes on him, he said, “ 0 mother, how <lb/>
            handsome my grandfather is !" His mother then asking him <lb/>
            which he thought the more handsome, his father or his grand­ <lb/>
            father, Cyrus answered, “ Of the Persians, mother, my lather <lb/>
            is much the most handsome ; but of all the Modes that I have <lb/>
            seen, either upon the road or at the gates of the palace, my <lb/>
            grandfather is far the most handsome." 3. Astyages, then, <lb/>
            embracing Cyrus in return, put on him a fine robe, did him <lb/>
            honour, and decorated him with collars and bracelets ; and, <lb/>
            whenever he went abroad, took him with him on a horse with <lb/>
            a bridle of gold, just as he himself used to go about. Cyrus, <lb/>
            being a boy fond of what was fine and honourable, was pleased <lb/>
            with the robe, and extremely delighted at learning to ride; <lb/>
            for, amongst the Persians, from its being difficult to breed <lb/>
            horses, and difficult even to ride in a country so mountainous, <lb/>
            it is a rare thing to see a horse.</p>
          <p>4. Astyages, when he was supping with his daughter and <lb/>
            Cyrus, and wished the boy to sup as agreeably as possible, <lb/>
            that he might the less regret what he had left at home, had <lb/>
            several dishes set before him, with sauces and meats of all <lb/>
            kinds ; when, as they relate, Cyrus said, " How much trouble, <lb/>
            grandfather, you have at your meals, if you must stretch out <lb/>
            your hands to all these dishes, and taste of all these kinds of <lb/>
            meat!" “What, then," said Astyages, "do you not think <lb/>
            this entertainment much finer than what you have in Persia ?" <lb/>
            To this question Cyrus is said to have replied, " No, grand­ <lb/>
            father ; for with us the way to be satisfied is much plainer <lb/>
            and straighter than with you ; since among us plain bread and <lb/>
            meat conduct us to that object; you indeed pursue the same <lb/>
            object with us, but, after rambling in many windings up and <lb/>
            down, you at last scarcely reach the point at which we have <lb/>
            arrived long before you." 5. But., child," said Astyages, <lb/>
            " it is not with pain that “We ramble through these windings; <lb/>
            if you taste," said he, " you will find that these things are <lb/>
            pleasant." “ But, grandfather," said Cyrus, " I observe you <note type="footnote"> 1 The men of the court were accustomed to attend at the gates, <lb/>
            that they might be ready, if the king wished to use their services in <lb/>
            any way. So Mordecai sat at the king's gate, Esth. ii. 19. Hutch­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            yourself show an aversion to these dishes." " From what do <lb/>
            you guess," inquired Astyages, " that you express such an <lb/>
            opinion?" "Because I remark," said he, "that when you <lb/>
            touch your bread, you do not wipe your hand upon anything, <lb/>
            but, when you touch anyone of these dishes, you immediately <lb/>
            wipe your hand upon your napkin, as if you were quite un­ <lb/>
            easy that it had touched them.” 1 6. On receiving this answer <lb/>
            Astyages said, " If you think so, then, at least eat heartily of <lb/>
            plain meat, that you may return home a stout youth;" and as <lb/>
            he said this, he directed various kinds of flesh, both of tame <lb/>
            and wild animals, to be presented to him. Cyrus, when he <lb/>
            saw this variety of meats, is reported to have said, " And do <lb/>
            you give me all these meats, grandfather, to do with them <lb/>
            what I please?" 7. "Yes, indeed," said Astyages; "I <lb/>
            make you a present of them." Then Cyrus, taking of the <lb/>
            several meats, is said to have distributed them to the servants <lb/>
            about his grandfather, saying to each, " I give this to you, <lb/>
            because you take pleasure in teaching me to ride; this to you, <lb/>
            because you gave me a javelin, for I have it still; this to you, <lb/>
            because you serve my grandfather well; this to you, because <lb/>
            you honour my mother ;” and to have proceeded thus, till he <lb/>
            had distributed all the meat that he had received. 8. Asty­ <lb/>
            ages then said, " And do you give nothing to this Sacian, my <lb/>
            cup-bearer, whom I value above all?" This Sacian was a <lb/>
            handsome person, and had the honour to introduce to Astyages <lb/>
            any that wanted to see him, and to exclude such as he did not <lb/>
            think it seasonable to admit. Cyrus upon this is said to have <lb/>
            answered rather flippantly, as a boy not yet grown bashful, <lb/>
            " For what reason is it, grandfather, that you value this <lb/>
            Sacian so much?” Astyages replied, jestingly, " Do you not <lb/>
            see," said he, " how properly and gracefully he pours out my <lb/>
            wine?" For these cup-bearers to kings perform their business <lb/>
            very cleverly; they pour in the wine without spilling, and <lb/>
            give the cup, holding it on three fingers, and presenting it in <lb/>
            such a manner as to put it most conveniently into the hand of <lb/>
            the person who is to drink. 9. “ Bid the Sacian give me the <lb/>
            cup, grandfather," said Cyrus, "that I also, by gracefully <lb/>
            pouring in wine for you to drink, may gain your favour if I <lb/>
            can." Astyages bade the Sacian give him the cup; and <note type="footnote"> 1 "On <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλέα ϭοι άπ' αύτ</foreign>ѽ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν έγένετο</foreign>.] "That it was full for you from <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            Cyrus, taking it, rinsed the cup so well, as he had observed <lb/>
            the Sacian to do, settled his countenance so gravely, and <lb/>
            brought and presented the cup to his grandfather so prettily, <lb/>
            as to afford much laughter to his mother and Astyages. <lb/>
            Cyrus then, laughing out, leaped up to his grandfather, and, <lb/>
            kissing him, cried out, " 0 Sacian, you are undone; I will <lb/>
            turn you out of your office ; for I will pour out wine better <lb/>
            than you in other respects, and I will not drink the wine my­ <lb/>
            self." For these cup-bearers to kings, when they give the <lb/>
            cup, dip a little out with a smaller cup, which they pour into <lb/>
            their left hand and swallow; so that, in case they mix poison <lb/>
            in the cup, it may be of no profit to them. 10. Upon this, <lb/>
            Astyages said, joking, "And why, Cyrus, when you imitated <lb/>
            the Sacian in everything else, did not you swallow some of <lb/>
            the wine "Because, to say the truth,” said he, "I was <lb/>
            afraid there might have been poison mixed in the cup ; for, <lb/>
            when you entertained your friends upon your birth-day, I <lb/>
            plainly perceived that he had poured in poison for you all.:­ <lb/>
            "And how, child," said he, "did you know this?" " Be­ <lb/>
            cause," said he, " I saw you all disordered both in mind and <lb/>
            body ; for, in the first place, what you do not allow us boys to <lb/>
            do, that you did yourselves ; for you all cried out together, <lb/>
            and yet could not understand each other; next you fell to <lb/>
            singing very ridiculously ; and, without attending to the <lb/>
            singer, you swore that he sung admirably; then, though each <lb/>
            told stories of his own strength, when you rose up and fell <lb/>
            to dancing, you were not only unable to dance properly, but <lb/>
            were unable even to stand upright; at length, you all entirely <lb/>
            forgot yourselves, you, that you were king, and they, that you <lb/>
            were their ruler; and then, for the first time, I discovered <lb/>
            that it was equal liberty of speech that you were practising ; <lb/>
            for you never ceased to speak." 11. Astyages then said, <lb/>
            “ Is your father, child, never intoxicated when he drinks ?” <lb/>
            " No, indeed," said he. " What does he, then ?" “ Why, he <lb/>
            quenches his thirst, and suffers no further harm; for I believe, <lb/>
            grandfather," says he, " it is not a Sacian that pours out wine <lb/>
            for him." His mother then said, " But why, child, do you <lb/>
            thus make war upon the Sacian ? " Cyrus is said to have re­ <lb/>
            plied, " Why, indeed, because I hate him; for, very often, <lb/>
            when I am desirous to run to my grandfather, this disagree­ <lb/>
            able fellow hinders me. But pray, grandfather," said he, <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            "allow me to have the government of him for three days." <lb/>
            “ How would you govern him ? " said Astyages. Cyrus re­ <lb/>
            plied, " Why, standing as he does, just at the entrance, when <lb/>
            he had a mind to go in to dinner, I would tell him that it is <lb/>
            not yet possible for him to get his dinner, because ‛ he was <lb/>
            busy with certain people:' then, when he came to supper, I <lb/>
            would tell him that ‛ he was bathing:' and, if he was very <lb/>
            eager to eat, I would tell him that ‛ he was with the women <lb/>
            and so on, till I had tormented him as he torments me when <lb/>
            he keeps me from you." 12. Such amusement did he afford <lb/>
            them at meals ; at other times of the day, if he perceived his <lb/>
            grandfather or his mother's brother in want of anything, it <lb/>
            was difficult for any one to be beforehand with him in doing <lb/>
            it; for Cyrus was extremely delighted to gratify them in <lb/>
            anything that lay in his power.</p>
          <p>is. But when Mandane was preparing to return home to <lb/>
            her husband, Astyages requested her to leave Cyrus with <lb/>
            him. She made answer, that she was willing to gratify her <lb/>
            father in everything; but that she should think it unkind to <lb/>
            leave the child against his will. 14. Upon this Astyages said <lb/>
            to Cyrus, " Child, if you will stay with me, in the first place, <lb/>
            the Sacian shall not have the command of your access to me; <lb/>
            but, whenever you wish to come in, it shall be in your own <lb/>
            power to do so ; and the oftener you come," said he, “ the <lb/>
            more I shall think myself obliged to you. You shall also have <lb/>
            the use of all my horses, and of as many more as you please; <lb/>
            and, when you go away, you shall take as many of them as you <lb/>
            please with you. At meals, too, you shall take whatever way <lb/>
            you please to what appears to you to be sufficient. As for the <lb/>
            animals that are now in the park, I give them to you ; and <lb/>
            will collect others of all kinds, which you shall hunt when <lb/>
            you have learned to ride, and shall strike them down with <lb/>
            your bow and javelin, as grown men do. Boys I will find <lb/>
            you for playfellows ; and, whatever else you may desire, if <lb/>
            you tell me of it, you shall not fail to have it." 15. When <lb/>
            Astyages had said this, Cyrus's mother asked him whether he <lb/>
            would stay or go. He did not at all hesitate, but at once <lb/>
            said that he would stay. And being asked by his mother for <lb/>
            what reason, it is said that he answered, " Because, mother, <lb/>
            at home, I am, and am accounted, superior to my equals in <lb/>
            age both in throwing the javelin and in shooting with the <pb n="14"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            bow; but here, I well know that, in horsemanship, I am in­ <lb/>
            ferior to the boys of my age; and be assured, mother, this <lb/>
            grieves me very much. But if you leave me here, and I <lb/>
            learn to be a horseman, I conceive that when I am in Persia, <lb/>
            I shall easily master them there, who are so good at all exer­ <lb/>
            cises on foot; and, when I come amongst the Medes, I shall <lb/>
            endeavour, by becoming the best of good horsemen for my <lb/>
            grandfather's sake, to be a support to him."</p>
          <p>16. His mother is then reported to have said, "But how, <lb/>
            child, will you be instructed here in the knowledge of justice, <lb/>
            when your masters are there?" “Oh, mother," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            " I understand that accurately already." “ How do you know <lb/>
            that?" said Mandane. "Because my teacher," said he, <lb/>
            "appointed me to give judgment to others, as being very <lb/>
            exact in the knowledge of justice myself. But yet," added <lb/>
            he, " for not having decided rightly, in one case, I re­ <lb/>
            ceived some stripes. 17. The case was this: A bigger boy, <lb/>
            who had a little coat, taking the coat off a little boy, that <lb/>
            had a larger one, put on him his own coat, and put on him­ <lb/>
            self the little boy's coat. I, therefore, giving judgment be­ <lb/>
            tween them, decided that it was best that each should keep <lb/>
            the coat that best fitted him. Upon this, the master beat me, <lb/>
            telling me that, when I should be constituted judge of what <lb/>
            fitted best, I might determine in this manner; but that when <lb/>
            I was to j-idge whose the coat was, I must consider what just <lb/>
            possession is; whether he that took a thing from another by <lb/>
            force should have it, or he who made it or purchased it should <lb/>
            possess it; and then he told me what was according to law <lb/>
            was just, and that what was contrary to law was an act of <lb/>
            violence ; and impressed upon me accordingly, that a judge <lb/>
            ought to give his opinion in conformity with the law. So, <lb/>
            mother," said he, " I understand what is just in all cases very <lb/>
            exactly; or, if I am at all deficient, my grandfather here will <lb/>
            teach it me." is. But, child, says she, the same things <lb/>
            are not accounted just with your grandfather here, and yonder <lb/>
            in Persia; for among the Medes, your grandfather has made <lb/>
            himself master of all; but amongst the Persians, it is ac­ <lb/>
            counted just that each should have equal rights with his <lb/>
            neighbours. Your father is the first to execute what is ap <lb/>
            pointed by the whole state, and submits to what is appointed ; <lb/>
            his own inclination is not his standard of action, but the law <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            Take care, then, that you are not beaten to death at home, if <lb/>
            you come thither having learned from your grandfather not <lb/>
            what belongs to a king, but what belongs to a tyrant; an in­ <lb/>
            gredient in which is, to think that you yourself ought to have <lb/>
            more than all others." " Oh, mother, said Cyrus, " your <lb/>
            father is much better able to teach one to have less than to <lb/>
            have more. Do you not see," said he, “ that he has taught <lb/>
            all the Modes to have less than himself ? Be well assured, <lb/>
            therefore, that your father will not dismiss me, nor any one, <lb/>
            from about him, instructed to encroach upon others."</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Cyrus remains with Astyages. His conduct, and discourses and exercises. <lb/>
            His ardour in hunting. His fear of displeasing his grandfather. His free­ <lb/>
            dom from envy. He assumes arms for the first time. His sagacity in the <lb/>
            field when the king of Assyria's son was ravaging the country. He is <lb/>
            recalled to Persia. His concern at leaving his grandfather and his other <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>1. MANY remarks of this kind did Cyrus utter. At last, <lb/>
            his mother went away; while he stayed, and was there <lb/>
            brought up. He soon began to associate with those that <lb/>
            were his equals in age, so as to be upon very familiar terms <lb/>
            with them; and he quickly attached their fathers to him, <lb/>
            both by visiting them, and by giving evidence that he loved <lb/>
            their children ; so that, if they wanted any favour of the <lb/>
            king, they desired their boys to ask Cyrus to obtain it for <lb/>
            them; and Cyrus, from his benignity and love of esteem, <lb/>
            did his utmost to effect their object. 2. Astyages, also, <lb/>
            whatever Cyrus asked, was unable to refuse to gratify him ; <lb/>
            for Cyrus, when his grandfather fell ill, never quitted him, <lb/>
            nor ever ceased from tears ; and it was clearly seen by all, <lb/>
            that he was in the utmost fear lest he. should die. In the <lb/>
            night, if Astyages wanted anything, Cyrus was the first to <lb/>
            perceive it, and started up, more nimbly than any one else, <lb/>
            to serve him in anything that he thought would gratify <lb/>
            him ; so that he gained the entire love of Astyages.</p>
          <p>3. Cyrus was, perhaps, a little over-talkative; but this was <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. 1. </note> <lb/>
            partly from education ; because he was obliged by his master <lb/>
            to give a reason for what he did, and to require reasons from <lb/>
            others, when he had to give his opinion in judgment; and <lb/>
            partly, because, from being very eager after knowledge, he <lb/>
            was always putting questions to those about him on many <lb/>
            subjects, to ascertain how such and such things were; and, <lb/>
            upon whatever subjects he was questioned by others, he gave, <lb/>
            from being of a quick apprehension, very ready answers; so <lb/>
            that, from all these circumstances, loquacity was contracted by <lb/>
            him. But, as in the persons of those who, while still young, <lb/>
            have attained an extraordinary stature, there yet appears <lb/>
            something childish, which betrays the fewness of their years, <lb/>
            so, in the talkativeness of Cyrus, there was no forwardness to <lb/>
            be observed, but a certain simplicity, and affectionateness of <lb/>
            disposition ; so that a person was desirous rather to hear yet <lb/>
            more from him than to be in his company in silence.</p>
          <p>4. But when time, with increase of stature, advanced him to <lb/>
            the age to become a young man, he then used fewer words <lb/>
            and a gentler tone of voice ; he became remarkably bashful, so <lb/>
            as to blush when he came into the company of men of years; <lb/>
            and that playful dog-like habit, of running up to everybody <lb/>
            alike, he no longer retained. Thus he became more quiet, <lb/>
            but was still in society extremely agreeable ; for in whatever <lb/>
            exercises he and his equals used to emulate each other, he did <lb/>
            not challenge his companions to those in which he knew him­ <lb/>
            self superior, but in those in which he felt himself inferior, he <lb/>
            was the first to commence declaring that he would perform <lb/>
            better than they. Accordingly, he would begin vaulting upon <lb/>
            the horse, shooting with the bow, or hurling the javelin on <lb/>
            horseback, while he was yet scarcely able to sit on a horse; <lb/>
            and, when he was outdone, he was the first to laugh at him­ <lb/>
            self; 5. and as, on being unsuccessful, he did not shrink from <lb/>
            attempting again the things in which he had failed, but assi­ <lb/>
            duously employed himself in endeavouring to do them better, <lb/>
            he soon attained an equality with his companions in horse­ <lb/>
            manship, and, by his love of the exercise, soon left them be­ <lb/>
            hind. He rapidly, too, exhausted all the beasts in the park, <lb/>
            pursuing, throwing at them, and killing them, so that Astyages <lb/>
            could no longer collect animals for him. Cyrus, perceiving <lb/>
            that, though he was desirous, he was unable to procure many <lb/>
            living creatures for him, said to him, " Why need you take so <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            much pains, grandfather, in seeking these animals ? If you <lb/>
            will but send me out a hunting with my uncle, I shall consider <lb/>
            that whatever beasts I see are maintained for my use." 6. <lb/>
            But though he was very desirous to go out to hunt, yet he <lb/>
            could not now be importunate, as when he was a boy; but <lb/>
            became more backward in going to his grandfather ; and as <lb/>
            to what he had previously blamed in the Sacian, that he <lb/>
            did not admit him to his grandfather, he became in this a <lb/>
            Sacian to himself; for he never went in, unless he had ascer­ <lb/>
            tained whether it was convenient, and begged the Sacian, by <lb/>
            all means, to signify to him when it was convenient and when <lb/>
            not; so that the Sacian now loved him extremely, as did all <lb/>
            other people.</p>
          <p>7. When Astyages, therefore, knew that he was extremely <lb/>
            desirous to hunt abroad, he sent him out with his uncle, and <lb/>
            sent some older persons on horseback with him, as guards <lb/>
            upon him, to take care of him in the rugged parts of the <lb/>
            country, and in case any beasts of the fiercer kind should <lb/>
            show themselves. Cyrus, in consequence, was very earnest <lb/>
            in inquiring of those that attended him, what beasts he was <lb/>
            not to approach, and what sort of animals he might confidently <lb/>
            pursue. They told him, that bears had destroyed many that <lb/>
            had ventured to approach them, as well as lions, wild boars, <lb/>
            and leopards, but that stags, antelopes, wild sheep, and wild <lb/>
            asses, were harmless creatures. They told him, likewise, that <lb/>
            he must guard against rough places not less than the beasts; <lb/>
            for that many men, with their horses, had been carried head­ <lb/>
            long over precipices. 8. Cyrus attended to all these instruc­ <lb/>
            tions very readily ; but, as soon as he saw a stag leap forth, <lb/>
            forgetting all that he had heard, he pursued, regarding nothing <lb/>
            but which way the animal fled; and his horse, taking a leap <lb/>
            with him, fell somehow upon his knees, and very nearly threw <lb/>
            him over his neck. However Cyrus, though with difficulty, <lb/>
            kept upon his back, and the horse got up again. When he <lb/>
            reached the open ground he hurled his javelin, and struck the <lb/>
            stag down, a fine large animal; and he was most highly de­ <lb/>
            lighted. But his guards, riding up to him, reproved him, <lb/>
            told him into what danger he had run, and said that they <lb/>
            must complain of him. Cyrus, having alighted from his horse, <lb/>
            stood and listened to this with much uneasiness; but, hearing <lb/>
            a shout, he sprang on his horse, as in a sort of enthusiasm, <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="18"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. 1. </note> <lb/>
            and seeing before him a boar advancing, he rode forward to <lb/>
            meet it, and taking a good aim with his javelin, struck the <lb/>
            boar in the forehead, and brought it down. 9. But now his <lb/>
            uncle, seeing his rashness, began to reprove him. Cyrus how­ <lb/>
            ever, notwithstanding his uncle was finding fault with him, <lb/>
            begged that he would allow him to carry off the beasts that he <lb/>
            had taken, and to present them to his grandfather. To this, <lb/>
            they say, his uncle replied, " But, if he learn that it is you <lb/>
            that have taken them, he will not only blame you, but me, for <lb/>
            allowing you to do it." " Let him even beat me,” says lie, “ if <lb/>
            he will, when I have given them to him; and do you, if you <lb/>
            will, uncle," says he, “ correct me as you please ; gratify me <lb/>
            only in this." Cyaxares at last said, " Do as you please ; for <lb/>
            you seem now to be our king."</p>
          <p>10. Cyrus accordingly, carrying home the beasts, presented <lb/>
            them to his grandfather, and told him that he himself had <lb/>
            hunted them for him. The javelins he did not show him, but <lb/>
            laid them down, covered with blood, where he thought that he <lb/>
            certainly would see them. Astyages said, " Child, I receive <lb/>
            with pleasure whatever you give me ; yet I am not in such <lb/>
            want of any of these animals, as that you should run into <lb/>
            danger for them." " If, then, you do not want them, grand­ <lb/>
            father," said Cyrus, “ pray give them to me, that I may dis­ <lb/>
            tribute them to my companions." “ Child," said Astyages, <lb/>
            “ take them, and distribute them to whom you please, and of <lb/>
            everything else whatever you will." 11. Cyrus, taking the <lb/>
            beasts, carried them off and gave them to the boys ; and said <lb/>
            to them at the same time, " Boys, what very triflers were we <lb/>
            when we hunted the beasts in the park ! It seems to TIle the <lb/>
            same as if one had hunted animals tied by the leg; for, first, <lb/>
            they were within a narrow compass of ground; then the <lb/>
            creatures were lean mangy things; one was lame, another <lb/>
            maimed ; but the beasts in the mountains and plains, how fine, <lb/>
            how large, and how sleek did they appear ! The stags, as if <lb/>
            they had wings, leaped to the very sky; the boars, as they say <lb/>
            brave men do, came to close quarters ; and, by reason of their <lb/>
            bulk, it was impossible to miss them. These, even when they <lb/>
            are dead," says he, " appear to me finer than those other wall­ <lb/>
            ed-up creatures when alive. But," added he, "would your <lb/>
            fathers, think you, allow you to go out a hunting ? ” " Yes, <lb/>
            very readily," said they, "if Astyages desired it." 12. Cyrus <pb n="19"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            then said, “Vho is there, then, that would mention it for us <lb/>
            to Astyages ? ” “ Who more able," said they, “ to persuade <lb/>
            him than yourself? ” " By Jupiter," said he, “ for my part, I <lb/>
            know not what kind of person I am become ; for I am neither <lb/>
            able to speak, nor look up to my grandfather in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner as formerly; and, if I go on at this rate, I fear," says he, <lb/>
            " I shall become a mere dullard and fool; yet, when I was <lb/>
            a little boy, I was thought a wonderful talker." The boys <lb/>
            then said, “ You tell us a sad piece of news, if you will be <lb/>
            able to do nothing for us in case of need, but, as far as <lb/>
            depends on you,1 we must make our requests to some one else."</p>
          <p>13. Cyrus, on hearing this remark, was annoyed, and retir­ <lb/>
            ing in silence, encouraged himself to venture; and, having <lb/>
            considered how he might speak to his grandfather in the least <lb/>
            offensive manner, and obtain for himself and the boys what <lb/>
            they desired, went in, and began thus: “ Tell me," said he, <lb/>
            "grandfather, if one of your domestic servants should run <lb/>
            away, and you should take him again, what would you do with <lb/>
            him?" "What else," said he, but put him in chains, and <lb/>
            force him to work ? " "But if he should of himself return to <lb/>
            you, how would you act ? " " What else should I do," said <lb/>
            he, “ but have him whipped, that he may do so no more, and <lb/>
            make use of him as at first ? " “ It is time for you, then," said <lb/>
            Cyrus, " to prepare a scourge to whip me, as I am contriving <lb/>
            how to run away, and take my companions with me, to hunt." <lb/>
            " You have done well," said Astyages, " to tell it me before­ <lb/>
            hand ; for I now order you not to stir from home. It would <lb/>
            be a fine thing, indeed," added he, "if, for the sake of a little <lb/>
            venison, I should send out my daughter's son to ramble at his <lb/>
            pleasure."</p>
          <p>14. Cyrus, hearing this, obeyed, and stayed at home; but <lb/>
            he continued afflicted, melancholy-looking, and silent. Asty­ <lb/>
            ages, finding that he was so extremely distressed, and being <lb/>
            willing to please him, took him out to the chase; and, assem­ <lb/>
            bling abundance of people, both foot and horse, and also the <lb/>
            boys, and driving the beasts into that part of the country <lb/>
            which was suited for riding, he made a great hunt, and being <lb/>
            himself present, royally attended, gave orders that none should <lb/>
            throw till Cyrus had had enough of the exercise. Cyrus how­ <note type="footnote"> To <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπὶ ϭέ</foreign>.] Most of the old editions have TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπὶ</foreign> coi, “ what is in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            ever would not let him hinder them, but said, " If you have a <lb/>
            mind, grandfather, that I should hunt with pleasure, let all those <lb/>
            with me engage in the pursuit, and strive each to do his best." <lb/>
            is. Astyages then gave them permission, and, taking his stand, <lb/>
            saw them engage with the beasts, striving to outdo each other, <lb/>
            pursuing and throwing their javelins. He was delighted with <lb/>
            Cyrus, who, from excess of joy, could not hold his tongue, but, <lb/>
            like a young and generous dog, cried out when he approached <lb/>
            a beast, and encouraged every one by name. He was pleased <lb/>
            to see him laughing at one; another he observed him to <lb/>
            praise cordially, and without the least feeling of envy. At <lb/>
            last Astyages, having taken abundance of game, retired ; and, <lb/>
            in other respects, was so pleased with that hunt, that he <lb/>
            always went out with Cyrus whenever he could, and took <lb/>
            abundance of people with him, as well as the boys, for the sake <lb/>
            of Cyrus. Thus, for the most part, did Cyrus pass his time, <lb/>
            contributing much pleasure and service to every one, without <lb/>
            doing the least harm.</p>
          <p>16. But, when he was about fifteen or sixteen years of age, <lb/>
            the king of Assyria's son,l who was about to marry, had a <lb/>
            mind at that time to hunt; and, hearing that there was plenty <lb/>
            of game upon the borders of his own people and those of the <lb/>
            Modes, having not been hunted because of the war,2 he de- <note type="footnote"> 1 The king of Assyria at that time was Nabuchodonosor, or Ne­ <lb/>
            buchadnezzar, whose empire, besides Assyria and Babylonia, in­ <lb/>
            cluded Chaldæa, Arabia, Syria, and Palestine; for on the death of <lb/>
            Sardanapalus, the king of Assyria, three other kingdoms were <lb/>
            formed out of his dominions, the Babylonian, Assyrian, and Me­ <lb/>
            dian. Astyages was then king of Media; but Esarhaddon, the <lb/>
            king of Assyria, united under his rule the other two kingdoms, and <lb/>
            Nebuchadnezzar was the fourth king from him, his father having <lb/>
            destroyed Nineveh with the assistance of Astyages, who had be­ <lb/>
            trothed his daughter Amyitis to Nebuchadnezzar. He is therefore <lb/>
            called by Xenophon the king of Assyria, as he is also by John Ma­ <lb/>
            lala, Chronogr. 190; while in the Book of Daniel he is called king <lb/>
            of Babylon. The son of this Nebuchadnezzar was Evilmerodach, <lb/>

            sired to go thither. That he might hunt, therefore, without <lb/>
            danger, he took with him a body of horse and another of light- <lb/>
            armed foot, who were to drive the beasts for him out of the <lb/>
            thickets into the parts that were cultivated and easy to ride <lb/>
            over. Having come, therefore, to the place where their gar­ <lb/>
            risons were, and a guard attending, he took supper there, <lb/>
            with the intention of hunting early the next morning. 17. <lb/>
            But, when it was evening, a guard of horse and foot arrived <lb/>
            from the city, 1 to relieve those who were there before; and <lb/>
            he accordingly thought that he had now a considerable army <lb/>
            with him; for the two parties of guards were united in <lb/>
            a body, and he himself had brought with him a large number of <lb/>
            both horse and foot. He conceived it best, therefore, to carry <lb/>
            off some plunder from the Median territory, as this would be <lb/>
            a nobler exploit than a hunt; and he thought he should thus <lb/>
            procure great abundance of beasts for sacrifice. Rising, in <lb/>
            consequence, early in the morning, he led out his army. The <lb/>
            foot he left in a body upon the borders; while he himself, ad­ <lb/>
            vancing up to the Median garrisons with the horse, and <lb/>
            keeping the best and greatest number of them with him, halted <lb/>
            there, that the Modes in garrison might not give assistance to <lb/>
            their countrymen against those who were to overrun the <lb/>
            country; and such as were suited for the purpose, he sent <lb/>
            out in parties, some to ride one way and some another; and <lb/>
            ordered them to surround and seize whatever booty they met <lb/>
            with and bring it to him. These did as they were directed.</p>
          <p>is. But notice being given to Astyages, that the enemy <lb/>
            was in the country, he marched himself, with what forces he <lb/>
            had at hand, to the borders, and his son, likewise, with such <lb/>
            cavalry as were with him ; and he sent word to all his other <lb/>
            forces to come and support him. When they caught sight of <lb/>
            a great number of Assyrians, drawn up in a body, and their <lb/>
            horses standing still, the Medes likewise came to a halt.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, seeing others marching out in troops to support <lb/>
            their friends, went out to join the expedition himself, putting <lb/>
            on his arms then for the first time; having thought that the <lb/>
            time would never come for doing so, such was his eagerness <lb/>
            to equip himself with them; for they were very fine, and fit­ <lb/>
            ted him very well, being those which his grandfather had <note type="footnote"> Babylon is supposed to be signified. Bornemann. </note> <pb n="22"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I </note> <lb/>
            had made to suit his size. Having thus armed himself, he rode <lb/>
            ap to the rest on his horse. Astyages wondered by whose en <lb/>
            couragement he came ; however, he told him to remain near <lb/>
            him. 19. Cyrus, seeing a great number of horsemen in front <lb/>
            of him, “ Grandfather," asked he, " are these men enemies, <lb/>
            that sit there quietly on their horses ?" " They are indeed <lb/>
            enemies," said he. " And are those enemies, too, that are <lb/>
            riding up and down?" " Yes, and those also." " By Jove, <lb/>
            then, grandfather," said he, " they seem to be wretched fel­ <lb/>
            lows, and mounted upon wretched horses, that are carrying off <lb/>
            our property; and ought not some of us to march against <lb/>
            them ?“ " But do you not see, child," said he, “ what a body <lb/>
            of horse stands there in close order, who, if we advance against <lb/>
            the others, will intercept us ? And our full strength is not <lb/>
            yet come up." " But," said Cyrus, " if you wait here, and <lb/>
            attach to yourself those that are marching to support us, those <lb/>
            of the enemy that are here will be under apprehension, and <lb/>
            will not stir; but the plunderers, should they see any troops <lb/>
            marching against them, will soon relinquish their booty." 20 <lb/>
            As he said this, he appeared to Astyages to say something to <lb/>
            the purpose; and, wondering to see how sagacious and vigilant <lb/>
            he was, he ordered his son to take a troop of horse and march <lb/>
            against the plunderers. " And I," said he, " will bear down <lb/>
            upon these men that are here, if they offer to move towards <lb/>
            you; so that they shall be obliged to watch our motions."</p>
          <p>Cyaxares, accordingly, taking some of the strongest and <lb/>
            best, both of men and horses, set forward; and Cyrus seeing <lb/>
            them start, pushed on with them, and soon, at a quick pace, <lb/>
            got to the head of them. Cyaxares followed, and the rest <lb/>
            were not left behind. As soon as the plunderers saw them <lb/>
            approaching, they immediately quitted their booty and fled. <lb/>
            21. Those that were with Cyrus intercepted them, and fell at <lb/>
            once to blows with such as they overtook, and Cyrus was the <lb/>
            first to attack. Those who had got the start, and were be­ <lb/>
            yond them, they pursued in the rear, and made no pause, but <lb/>
            captured several of them. As a generous do- that has no <lb/>
            experience hurries headlong without caution upon a boar, so <lb/>
            Cyrus pressed forward, minding only to strike whomsoever <lb/>
            he overtook, and heedless of anything else. The enemy, <lb/>
            when they saw their people in distress, moved forward their <lb/>
            main body, judging that the pursuers would discontinue their <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            chase as soon as they should see them advancing. 22. Cyrus, <lb/>
            notwithstanding, did not give over, but calling out to his <lb/>
            uncle for joy, continued the pursuit, and, pressing on, put the <lb/>
            enemy to an entire rout. Cyaxares followed, (perhaps being <lb/>
            in awe of his father,) and the rest kept up behind, even those <lb/>
            who would not have shown themselves very brave against <lb/>
            men that had opposed them, being, on such an occasion, <lb/>
            more than ordinarily eager in pursuing. Astyages, when he <lb/>
            saw the one party so incautiously pursuing, and the enemy, <lb/>
            in a close and regular body, marching to meet them ; fearing <lb/>
            for his son and for Cyrus, lest they, in disorder, should fall in <lb/>
            with the enemy prepared to receive them, and suffer some <lb/>
            harm, immediately advanced against the enemy. 23. The <lb/>
            enemy, as soon as they saw the Medes move forward, halted, <lb/>
            presenting some their javelins, and some their bows, in ex­ <lb/>
            pectation that they would halt when they came within bow- <lb/>
            shot, as they generally had been accustomed to do ; for within <lb/>
            such a distance, when they approached nearest.,l they would <lb/>
            ride towards one another, and frequently skirmish till evening. <lb/>
            But when they saw their own men in full flight towards them, <lb/>
            and those with Cyrus following close upon them, and Astyages, <lb/>
            with his horse, advancing within bow-shot, they gave way <lb/>
            and fled before the enemy, who pursued them at full speed, <lb/>
            and killed several; they fell upon all that they overtook, whe­ <lb/>
            ther man or horse, and whoever fell they killed. Nor did <lb/>
            they stop till they came up with the Assyrian foot; but here, <lb/>
            fearing lest some greater force than was seen might be lying <lb/>
            in ambuscade, they desisted. 24. Astyages then led back his <lb/>
            troops in much joy at this victory obtained by his cavalry, but <lb/>
            knew not what to say to Cyrus, for he knew him to be the <lb/>
            cause of the action, and saw him almost mad with excess of <lb/>
            spirit; for while the rest were retiring home, lie alone, by <lb/>
            himself, did nothing but ride round and gaze upon those that <lb/>
            had fallen in the action. And they who were sent for the <lb/>
            purpose could with difficulty tear him away and bring him to <lb/>
            Astyages, while he kept his conductors constantly before him. <lb/>
            because he saw the countenance of his grandfather grow ex­ <lb/>
            tremely stern at the sight of him.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, their nearest approach to each other was only within <lb/>

            other people had Cyrus in their mouths, both in their coil­ <lb/>
            versation and songs, but Astyages, who before had a great <lb/>
            esteem for him. was now struck with extraordinary admira­ <lb/>
            tion of him. Cambyses, the father of Cyrus, was pleased to <lb/>
            hear these things of him; but when he heard that he was <lb/>
            taking upon him the duties of a 'man, he recalled him home, <lb/>
            that he might complete the customary education among the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. Cyrus is reported to have said on this occasion, "That <lb/>
            he was desirous to return, lest his father should be dissatisfied <lb/>
            and his country should blame him." It appeared necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, for Astyages to send him home ; and he accordingly <lb/>
            let him depart, presenting him with such horses as he desired <lb/>
            to have, and bestowing on him many other presents, both be­ <lb/>
            cause he had a great affection for him, and because he enter <lb/>
            tained - the strongest hopes that he would prove a man <lb/>
            thoroughly able to do service to his friends, and give trouble <lb/>
            to his enemies.</p>
          <p>All the people waited upon Cyrus at his departure, both <lb/>
            boys, youth, men, and those in years, on horseback; as did <lb/>
            also Astyages himself; and they said that not one turned <lb/>
            back without shedding tears. 26. It is said, too, that Cyrus <lb/>
            himself shed many tears at parting ; that he distributed many <lb/>
            presents among his companions and equals in age, out of the <lb/>
            gifts which Astyages had given him; and that, at last, taking <lb/>
            off the Median robe that he had on, he gave it to a certain <lb/>
            youth, thus showing that he loved him the most of all. It is <lb/>
            told that those who had taken and accepted of these presents, <lb/>
            returned them to Astyages, and that Astyages on receiving <lb/>
            them, sent them to Cyrus, but that he sent them back again <lb/>
            to the Medes, with a message to this effect: “ 0 grand­ <lb/>
            father ! if you would have me return hither again to you <lb/>
            without shame, let every one keep what I have given him <lb/>
            and that Astyages, hearing this, did as Cyrus had entreated <lb/>
            him to do.</p>
          <p>27. But, if I may be allowed to relate an amusing occur­ <lb/>
            rence, it is said, that when Cyrus was going away, and they <lb/>

            him with a kiss, according to the Persian custom ; for the Per­ <lb/>
            sians retain the practice to this day ; and that a certain Mede, <lb/>
            a person of handsome figure and excellent character, stood for <lb/>
            a long time astonished, as it were, at the beauty of Cyrus; <lb/>
            and that, when he saw Cyrus's relations kiss him, he stayed <lb/>
            behind, and when the rest were gone, accosted Cyrus, and <lb/>
            said to him, " And am I, Cyrus, the only one of all your re­ <lb/>
            lations that you do not know?” “What!” said Cyrus, <lb/>
            and are you a relation ?” “ Yes," said he. " This was the <lb/>
            reason, then , said Cyrus, "that you used to gaze at me ; for <lb/>
            I recollect that you frequently did so." " For I was very de­ <lb/>
            sirous," said he, “ to salute you, but, by the gods, was always <lb/>
            ashamed to do it." " But," said Cyrus, " you, that are a re­ <lb/>
            lation, ought not to have been so," and at the same time went <lb/>
            up to him and kissed him. 2s. The Mede having received <lb/>
            the kiss, is said to have asked this question : “ And is it a <lb/>
            . custom also among the Persians to kiss relations?" " It is," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " when they see one another after some length <lb/>
            of time, or are going away from one another." " It must be <lb/>
            certainly time, then," said the Mede, " for you to kiss me <lb/>
            again ; for, as you see, I am going away." So Cyrus, kissing <lb/>
            him again, took leave of him, and went his way. They had <lb/>
            not gone very far before the Mede came up with him again, <lb/>
            with his horse in a sweat; and Cyrus, observing him, said, <lb/>
            " Have you forgotten anything that you intended to say to <lb/>
            me ?” “ No, by Jove !" said he, " but I am returning after <lb/>
            some length of time." " Dear kinsman,” said he, "it is cer­ <lb/>
            tainly a very short length.” " How a short one?" said the <lb/>
            Mede: "do you not know, Cyrus," added he, "that the very <lb/>
            time I am winking appears to me extremely long, because .I <lb/>
            do not then see you, who are so lovely?" Here Cyrus, from <lb/>
            being before in tears, burst out into laughter, and bade him <lb/>
            go his way cheerfully, as in a short time he would be with <lb/>
            them again; so that he would be at liberty to look at him, ii <lb/>
            he pleased, without winking.</p><pb n="26"/>

          <p>Cyrus, on. returning to Persia, continies another year in the class of boys. <lb/>
            His conduct in the class of youth. His superiority over his companions. <lb/>

            bled. His address to his officers.</p>
          <p>1. CYRUS, returning thus into Persia, is said to have con­ <lb/>
            tinued a year longer amongst the boys. At first they made <lb/>
            jests upon him, as if he had returned to them after learning to <lb/>
            be luxurious among the Medes, But when they saw that he <lb/>
            dressed as they did; that he drank as they did, and with <lb/>
            pleasure; and observed that whenever, at a festival, there <lb/>
            were any delicacies, he was more ready to give part of his <lb/>
            share away than to wish for any addition to it, and perceived <lb/>
            him also in other respects superior to themselves, they then, <lb/>
            such as were of his own age, paid him great deference. And <lb/>
            when he had passed through the discipline of these years, and <lb/>
            entered the class of youth, he appeared among them again <lb/>
            superior to the rest, both in practising what was fit, in steady <lb/>
            perseverance, in respect to his elders, and in obedience to his <lb/>
            governors.</p>
          <p>2. In process of time, Astyages died in Media, and his son <lb/>
            Cyaxares, brother to Cyrus's mother, succeeded to the throne <lb/>
            of the Modes. The king of Assyria, at the same time, hav­ <lb/>
            ing overthrown all the Syrians, a numerous nation, and <lb/>
            having made the king1 of the Arabians his subject, having <lb/>
            also the Hyrcanians under his dominion, and being employed <lb/>
            in reducing the Bactrians, considered that, if he could break <lb/>
            the power of the Medes, he should easily obtain the dominion <lb/>
            of all the people around; for the Modes seemed to be the <lb/>
            strongest of all the neighbouring nations. 3. He accord­ <lb/>
            ingly sent to all those that were subject to him, to Crœsus <lb/>
            king of Lydia, to the king of Cappadocia, to both the Phry­ <lb/>
            glans, to the Paphlagonians, Indians, Carians, and Cilicians, <lb/>
            not only loading the Medes and Persians with reproach, but <lb/>
            saying2 how great, how powerful, and how united in interest, <note type="footnote"> I He is called Aragdus, ii. I. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It seems necessary to insert with Bornemann ra of. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> before <lb/>

            these two nations were, and how they had made intermar­ <lb/>
            riages with each other, and were likely, if he did not preven <lb/>
            them and break their power, to subdue all the neighbouring <lb/>
            nations by attacking them one after another. Some, being <lb/>
            persuaded by these arguments, entered into an alliance with <lb/>
            him; and others were prevailed upon by money and presents ; <lb/>
            for of these he had abundance.</p>
          <p>4. Cyaxares, the son of Astyages, when he became aware <lb/>
            of this design, and the preparations of those uniting against <lb/>
            him, immediately made the utmost preparations that he was <lb/>
            able, to oppose them. He sent to the Persians, both to the <lb/>
            public council, and to Cambyses who was married to his <lb/>
            sister, and was king of Persia; and he sent likewise to Cyrus, <lb/>
            desiring him to endeavour to come as commander of the <lb/>
            forces, if the public council of the Persians should send any ; <lb/>
            for Cyrus, by this time, had completed ten years amongst the <lb/>
            youth, and was now ranked among the full-grown men.</p>
          <p>5. As Cyrus was willing to undertake the charge, the <lb/>
            elders, in council, chose him commander of the expedition <lb/>
            into Media. They gave him power to choose two hundred <lb/>
            from amongst the Equals-in-honour; 1 and to each of these <lb/>
            two hundred they gave power to choose four of their own <lb/>
            order. These altogether made a thousand; and to each of <lb/>
            these thousand they gave permission to choose, from amongst <lb/>
            the common people of Persia, ten peltasts, ten slingers, and <lb/>
            ten archers. Thus there were ten thousand archers, ten <lb/>
            thousand peltasts, and ten thousand slingers; and there were <lb/>
            the thousand besides. So great was the army that was given to <lb/>
            Cyrus. 6. But as soon as he was chosen, he began by address­ <lb/>
            ing himself to the gods; and, having sacrificed with good <lb/>
            omen, he then chose the two hundred; and, when these had <lb/>
            afterwards chosen each their four, he assembled them to­ <lb/>
            gether, and spoke to them, for the first time, to the following <lb/>
            effect:</p>

            had proof of your worth, but as having seen you, from boy­ <lb/>
            hood, performing, with ardour, all things that the state judges <lb/>
            honourable, and avoiding entirely whatever it considers dis­ <lb/>
            graceful. I would now make known to you, for what reasons <lb/>
            I, not unwillingly, have devoted myself to this undertaking, <lb/>
            and why I have called you together. 8. I have considered <lb/>
            that our forefathers were in no respect inferior to ourselves. <lb/>
            They passed their time, at least, in the constant practice of <lb/>
            what are thought virtuous employments; but what benefit, <lb/>
            with such a character, they acquired either for the common- <lb/>
            wealth of Persia, or for themselves, I cannot yet discover. 9. <lb/>
            Yet I conceive that no virtue is practised by mankind, with a <lb/>
            view that those who thus become deserving characters may <lb/>
            have no advantage over the worthless. They who abstain <lb/>
            from present pleasures, do not abstain that they may never <lb/>
            have any enjoyment, but order their conduct thus, that, by <lb/>
            means of their present abstinence, they may, in future, <lb/>
            have manifold more enjoyments. Those who are desirous to <lb/>
            be able speakers, do not exercise themselves in the art, that <lb/>
            they may never cease haranguing, but in hopes that, by pre­ <lb/>
            vailing upon men by the power of their eloquence, they <lb/>
            may effect many objects of great consequence. They who <lb/>
            exercise themselves in martial affairs, do not labour in them <lb/>
            that they may never cease fighting ; but they judge that, by <lb/>
            making themselves skilful in military matters, they shall ac­ <lb/>
            quire great riches, great happiness, and great honours, to <lb/>
            themselves and to their country. 10. And, if any have taken <lb/>
            pains in such pursuits, and have allowed themselves to become <lb/>
            disabled by old age before they reaped any fruits from them, <lb/>
            they appear to me to have acted like a person, who, desiring <lb/>
            to be a good husbandman, and sowing and planting with skill, <lb/>
            should, when the time came for gathering the fruits, let them <lb/>
            fall ungathered to the ground again. Or if a wrestler, after <lb/>
            long exercise, and becoming qualified for victory, should pass <lb/>
            his days without entering the lists, he could not, I think, <lb/>
            justly be acquitted of folly. 11. Let us not, friends, incur <lb/>
            such a fate; but, since we are conscious to ourselves that <lb/>
            from boyhood we have exercised ourselves in honourable and <lb/>
            worthy pursuits, let us march against the enemy, whom I well <lb/>
            know, from having myself seen them, to be far too unskilled <lb/>
            to contend with us. For those are not very powerful antagon- <pb n="29"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            ists, who, though they may manage their bows, their javelins, <lb/>
            and their horses with skill, yet, if they have to undergo toil, <lb/>
            sink beneath it; and these men, with respect to labour, are <lb/>
            utterly inexperienced. Nor are those powerful antagonists, <lb/>
            who, when they have to submit to want of sleep, are over­ <lb/>
            come by it; and, with respect to want of sleep, these men are <lb/>
            wholly unpractised. Nor are those powerful antagonists, <lb/>
            who, though able in all these respects, yet are ignorant how <lb/>
            to deal with allies or enemies; and these men are evidently <lb/>
            ignorant of these most important arts. 12. But you can make <lb/>
            use of the night, as others of the day; you regard toils as <lb/>
            guides to a life of pleasure; you make hunger the sauce to <lb/>
            your food ; you drink water more readily than lions;1 and you <lb/>
            have cherished in your minds the noblest and most warlike <lb/>
            quality in the world; for you rejoice in obtaining praise more <lb/>
            than in all other things beside; and they that are lovers of <lb/>
            praise, must of necessity possess the qualities for attaining it,2 <lb/>
            and must therefore submit to every labour, and every danger, <lb/>
            with pleasure.</p>
          <p>is. If I should express myself thus concerning you, while <lb/>
            I apprehend that the case may be otherwise, I should but be <lb/>
            guilty of self-deception ; for whatever point in your character <lb/>
            shall fail of being such as I represent, the deficiency will be <lb/>
            felt by me. But I trust that, through your experience, your <lb/>
            good-will towards me, and the folly of our enemies, these good <lb/>
            hopes will not deceive me. Let us then set forward with <lb/>
            confidence, since the appearance of desiring to possess other <lb/>
            men's property unjustly is far from us ; for our enemies are <lb/>
            coming upon us, being themselves the aggressors in wrong, <lb/>
            and our friends call us to their assistance. What then is more <lb/>
            just than to repel injuries, or more noble than to assist <lb/>
            friends ? 14. I consider, too, that you ought to derive courage <lb/>
            from this circumstance, that I do not enter upon this expedi­ <lb/>
            tion with neglect of the gods ; for you, who have conversed <lb/>
            much with me, know that I endeavour to begin not great <lb/>
            affairs only, but even small ones, with the sanction of the <lb/>
            deities." In conclusion he said, ‘What more need I add ? <lb/>
            Make choice of your men, take them under your care, and <lb/>
            making all other necessary arrangements, proceed to join the <lb/>
            Modes; I, after having returned to my father, will go before <note type="footnote"> I Lions are said seldom or never to pass water without drinking. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κτα̃σϑαι τὰ αἴτια</foreign>.] These words are wanting in many editions. </note> <pb n="30"/>

            art of war.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS, after returning home, and making his supplica­ <lb/>
            tions to Vesta, to Jupiter Patrius, and to the other deities, <lb/>
            set out upon the expedition, and his father attended him on <lb/>
            his way. As soon as they were out of the house, propitious <lb/>
            lightning and thunder is said to have occurred. When this <lb/>
            had taken place, they went on without seeking further augu­ <lb/>
            ries, as if these signals of the greatest of the gods could be <lb/>
            misunderstood by no one. 2. As Cyrus proceeded on his jour­ <lb/>
            ney, his father began to discourse with him in this manner :</p>
          <p>" That the gods send you forth propitiously and favourably, <lb/>
            is evident, my son, both from the sacrifices and from the signs <lb/>
            from heaven ; and you yourself know it to be so ; for I have <lb/>
            purposely taught you these things, that you might not learn <lb/>
            what the gods advise from other interpreters ; but that you <lb/>
            yourself, seeing what is to be seen, and hearing what is to be <lb/>
            heard, might understand for yourself, and not be in the power <lb/>
            of augurs, if they should wish to deceive you by telling you <lb/>
            something different from what is signified by the gods ; and <lb/>
            that moreover, in case you should be without an augur, you <lb/>
            might not be at a loss how to profit by the divine signals, but <lb/>
            understanding, by your knowledge in divination, the advice <lb/>
            given you by the gods, you might follow it." 3. " And I will <lb/>
            continue to take care, father," said Cyrus, " as far as I can, <lb/>
            according to your instructions, that the gods, being propitious <lb/>
            to us, may be willing to give us their advice ; for I remember <lb/>
            to have once heard you remark, that the most likely person to <lb/>
            obtain favour from the gods, as well as from men, is not he, <lb/>
            who, when he is in distress, flatters them servilely, but he <lb/>
            who, when he is most prosperous, is most mindful of them. <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            And you used to say, that it was in the same manner that we <lb/>
            ought to cultivate friends." 4. " Accordingly, my son," said <lb/>
            he, " in consequence of this care, you now approach the gods <lb/>
            to make your requests with the more pleasure, and have better <lb/>
            hopes of obtaining what you ask, because you feel conscious <lb/>
            that you have never neglected them." " Certainly, father," <lb/>
            said he, " I feel so disposed towards the gods, as to account <lb/>
            them my friends." 5. " And do you remember those other <lb/>
            opinions, my son," said he, "in which we heretofore agreed ? <lb/>
            that, in all things that the gods bestow, such men as have ac­ <lb/>
            quired knowledge of them succeed better in them than they <lb/>
            who are ignorant; that the laborious succeed better than the <lb/>
            idle ; that the diligent live with more security than the care­ <lb/>
            less ; and that, therefore, first rendering ourselves such as we <lb/>
            ought to be, we should then make our prayers to the gods for <lb/>
            their blessings." 6. “Yes, indeed," said Cyrus, "I remember <lb/>
            to have heard such remarks from you; and I was forced to <lb/>
            assent to your reasoning; for I know you used to say, that it <lb/>
            was absolute impiety, for such as had never learned to ride, <lb/>
            to supplicate the gods for victory in a battle of cavalry; or <lb/>
            for such as had not learned the use of the bow, to ask for <lb/>
            superiority, in archery, over those who understood it; or for <lb/>
            such as knew not how to steer, to pray that they might pre­ <lb/>
            serve ships as pilots; or for such as have not sown corn, to <lb/>
            pray that they might have a good crop of it; or for such as <lb/>
            are not watchful in war, to pray for safety; for that all such <lb/>
            things were contrary to the laws of the gods; and you said, <lb/>
            that such as made impious prayers, would probably meet with <lb/>
            disappointments from the gods, as those would fail of success <lb/>
            with men, who should desire things contrary to human laws."</p>
          <p>7. " And have you forgotten, my son," said he, “those other <lb/>
            matters on which you and I used once to discourse ? As, that <lb/>
            it was a great and noble work for a man to be able to take <lb/>
            care that he himself should be a good and honourable charac­ <lb/>
            ter, and that both himself and his family should have plenty of <lb/>
            all things necessary; and this being allowed to be a great work, <lb/>
            that to understand how to govern other men, so that they may <lb/>
            have all things necessary in abundance, and so that they may <lb/>
            all be such as they ought to be, this seemed to us to be indeed <lb/>
            an astonishing work ! " 8. " Yes, truly, father," said he, " I <lb/>
            remember that you said this, and it appeared also to me that <pb n="32"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. <lb/>
            </note>to govern well was a work of the highest nature." "And I con­ <lb/>
            tinue now," added Cambyses, " to hold the same opinion, when <lb/>
            I turn my thoughts to consider the duty of a ruler. But when <lb/>
            I look to other men, and contemplate what sort of characters <lb/>
            they are that continue to rule, and what kind of men are to be <lb/>
            our antagoni-sts, I think it altogether disgraceful to fear such <lb/>
            people, and to be unwilling to go forth and engage them ; <lb/>
            men," said he, “who, to begin with these friends of ours, think <lb/>
            that a governor ought to be distinguished from those that he <lb/>
            governs, by faring more sumptuously, by having more gold in <lb/>
            his house, by sleeping longer, and by living, in all respects, <lb/>
            more at ease than those whom he governs. But my opinion <lb/>
            is," continued he, "that a governor ought to differ from the <lb/>
            governed, not by a life of ease, but by forethought, and by his <lb/>
            readiness to undergo labour. 9. There are some points, how­ <lb/>
            ever, my son, in which you will not have to contend with men, <lb/>
            but with circumstances, which it may not be easy satisfactorily <lb/>
            to overcome. You are aware, for instance, that if the army <lb/>
            have not provisions, your command will be immediately at an <lb/>
            end." " Accordingly, father," said he, " Cyaxares says, that <lb/>
            he will supply them to all that go from hence, however great <lb/>
            the number be." " You go then, my son," said he, “trusting <lb/>
            in these matters to Cyaxares's riches ? " "I do," said Cyrus. <lb/>
            " Do you know then," said he, “what those riches are?" <lb/>
            " No, truly," said Cyrus, "I do not." " You trust then," said <lb/>
            he, " to what is unknown to you. But do you not know that <lb/>
            you will be in want of many things, and that you must now <lb/>
            expend many additional sums ?” "I do know it," said Cy­ <lb/>
            rus. " If money, then," said he, " should tail him, or he <lb/>
            should purposely deal falsely by you, how will the affairs of <lb/>
            the army stand ? It is plain that they will not stand very <lb/>
            well." " But, father," added he, “if you know any means of <lb/>
            obtaining supplies, and such as may depend upon myself, make <lb/>
            them known to me, whilst I am yet upon friendly ground." <lb/>
            10. " Do you ask, my son," said he, "if there be any means of <lb/>
            supply depending upon yourself ? And upon whom are sup­ <lb/>
            plies more likely to depend, than upon one who has power in <lb/>
            his hands ? You go from hence with a body of foot in ex­ <lb/>
            change for which I know that you would not take any other <lb/>
            many times as numerous; and you will have the Median <lb/>
            cavalry, who are an excellent body of men, to support you. <pb n="33"/>

            </note>What nation is there then, of all those round about, that is <lb/>
            not likely to serve you both from a desire to gain your favour, <lb/>
            and for fear of receiving harm ? These matters you ought to <lb/>
            settle with Cyaxares, that nothing of what is necessary for <lb/>
            you may ever be wanting ; and, for the sake of habit, you <lb/>
            ought to devise means of obtaining supplies. But, above all <lb/>
            things, remember never to delay procuring supplies till neces­ <lb/>
            sity forces you; but, while you have the greatest plenty, and <lb/>
            before you come to want, contrive methods of replenishing; <lb/>
            for you will obtain more readily from those, from whom you <lb/>
            ask, when you seem not to be in want; and you will besides <lb/>
            be blameless in the eyes of your own men. By this means, <lb/>
            likewise, you will gain more respect from others ; and if you <lb/>
            wish to do good or harm to any, your men, while they are supplied <lb/>
            with all that they want, will do you better service; and you <lb/>
            will be able, be assured, to utter far more persuasive words, <lb/>
            when you can show that you are able to do service or injury." <lb/>
            11. "You appear to me, father," said Cyrus, "to make all <lb/>
            these remarks with justice, both for other reasons, and be­ <lb/>
            cause none of the soldiers will feel gratitude to me, for what <lb/>
            they are now to receive ; for they know upon what terms <lb/>
            Cyaxares takes them as allies ; but whatever any of them <lb/>
            may receive in addition to what is stipulated, they will esteem <lb/>
            a favour; and it is natural that they should pay the greatest <lb/>
            gratitude to the bestower of it. Indeed, that a man should <lb/>
            have a force, by means of which, through doing service to his <lb/>
            friends, he may receive benefit in return, and endeavour to <lb/>
            take vengeance on his enemies, and should then be careless in <lb/>
            securing supplies,-do you think," said he, " that such conduct <lb/>
            would be at all less disgraceful, than it would be for a man <lb/>
            to have lands, and servants by whose labour he might keep <lb/>
            them in a state of cultivation, and yet to suffer the soil to <lb/>
            lie fallow and unprofitable ? Be assured, therefore," added <lb/>
            he, " that both in the territory of friends and of enemies, I <lb/>
            shall never neglect to devise means of supplying my men <lb/>
            with everything necessary."</p>
          <p>12. "Do you also remember certain other points, my son, <lb/>
            said he, " that it once appeared to us necessary not to neg­ <lb/>
            lect? " "Do I not remember," replied Cyrus, "when I came <lb/>
            to you for money to give a man, who pretended to have taught <lb/>
            me the art of commanding an army, and you, as you gave me <note type="footnote">VOL. II. </note><note type="footnote">D </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            the money, asked me, ' Child,' said you, ‘did this man, to <lb/>
            whom you carry this remuneration, ever, amongst the qualifi­ <lb/>
            cations of a general, mention anything of military economy <lb/>
            to you ? for soldiers in an army,' you observed, ‘are not less <lb/>
            in want of necessary supplies, than domestics in a family;’ <lb/>
            and when, telling you the truth, I said that he had not made <lb/>
            the least mention of it, you asked me again, ‘Whether he had <lb/>
            said anything to me concerning the health and strength of <lb/>
            the men ? as a general ought to attend to these things, as well <lb/>
            as to the conduct of troops in the field.' 13. When I answered <lb/>
            this question in the negative, you again asked me, ‘Whether <lb/>
            he had taught me any arts by which my allies1 might be ren­ <lb/>
            dered excellent at their several military duties?' and when I <lb/>
            said ‘No' to this too, you inquired again, ' Whether he had <lb/>
            given me any instruction how I might put spirit into an <lb/>
            army?' for you said, 'that, in every undertaking, spirit <lb/>
            differed in the greatest possible degree from despondency.' <lb/>
            When I answered this too in the negative, you inquired <lb/>
            again, ‘Whether he had said anything to instruct me about <lb/>
            obedience in an army, and how a commander might best con­ <lb/>
            trive to produce it.' 14. When this also appeared to have <lb/>
            been entirely omitted, you at last inquired of me, ‘what then <lb/>
            he had taught me, that he should say that he had taught me <lb/>
            the art of commanding an army ?' I then replied that ‘he <lb/>
            had taught me tactics ;' when you, laughing, remarked to me, <lb/>
            recapitulating each particular that you had mentioned, what <lb/>
            benefit could there be to an army from tactics without provi­ <lb/>
            sions, or without health, or without a knowledge of the arts <lb/>
            invented for conducting a war,2 or without obedience ? When <lb/>
            you had thus made it evident to me, that tactics were but a <lb/>
            small part of generalship, and I asked you, whether you were <lb/>
            able to teach me any of these matters, you bid me go and dis­ <lb/>
            course with men that were reputed knowing in military affairs, <lb/>
            and inquire of them how all such things were managed. 15. <lb/>
            Upon this, I conversed with such as I had heard were expe­ <lb/>
            rienced in these particulars. With regard to provisions, I <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύμμαχοι</foreign>.] Or this word may rather mean commilitones, fellow- <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 6. ] </note> <lb/>
            was persuaded that what Cyaxares was going to give us <lb/>
            would be sufficient. With respect to health, having heard <lb/>
            and observed, that cities that want health choose physicians; <lb/>
            and that commanders, for the sake of their men, take physi­ <lb/>
            cians with them ; so I, when I was placed in this command, <lb/>
            immediately attended to this point, and, I believe, father," <lb/>
            said he, " that I have men with me that are very skilful in <lb/>
            the art of physic." 16. To this the father replied: "But, <lb/>
            my son, these men that you mention are like menders of torn <lb/>
            clothes ; for so, when people are sick, physicians cure them ; <lb/>
            but your care of health is to be of a nobler kind than this ; <lb/>
            for you ought to make it your study that the army may never <lb/>
            be diseased at all."</p>
          <p>" By taking what course, then, father," said he, " shall I be <lb/>
            able to do this ? " “Why," replied Cambyses, “if you are to <lb/>
            stay some time in the same place, you ought not to be careless <lb/>
            in choosing a healthy spot for a camp ; and in this you will not <lb/>
            be deceived if you but give your attention to it; for men are <lb/>
            continually talking of unhealthy and healthy places, and in each <lb/>
            kind of places the persons and complexion of the inhabitants <lb/>
            are spire indications of their nature. But it will not be suf­ <lb/>
            ficient for you to look to places only, but you must remem­ <lb/>
            ber by what means you have endeavoured to take care of your­ <lb/>
            self, so as to continue in health." 17. Cyrus then observed, <lb/>
            " In the first place, I study never to overload my stomach, for <lb/>
            it is hurtful; and what goes into me I work off by exercise. <lb/>
            By this means, health seems to me to be better retained, <lb/>
            and vigour to be acquired." " In the same manner therefore, <lb/>
            my son," said he, " you must take care of others." " And <lb/>
            will the soldiers have leisure," said he, "father, to exercise <lb/>
            themselves?” " There will not only be leisure," said the <lb/>
            father, " but necessity ; for an army that will do its duty must <lb/>
            never be unemployed, either in distressing the enemy or <lb/>
            securing some advantage for itself. It is a difficult matter <lb/>
            for a single man to be maintained idle, and yet more difficult <lb/>
            for a whole family ; but most difficult of all is it to maintain an <lb/>
            army in idleness. For in an army there are many eaters, who <lb/>
            go out with very small supplies, and consume most lavishly <lb/>
            whatever they may capture; so that an army ought never to <lb/>
            be idle." is. "You say, father, as it seems to me,” said he, <lb/>
            " that as there is no good in an idle husbandman, so there ia <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            no good in an idle general. But, unless some god render vain <lb/>
            my endeavours, I take it upon me to show you a diligent and <lb/>
            active general, and soldiers well supplied with all things ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, and to take care that they shall be in the best condition. <lb/>
            But, with respect to the practice of the several military arts, <lb/>
            father, it appears to me," said he, " that he who should estab­ <lb/>
            lish games for the several sorts of troops, and propose prizes, <lb/>
            would make them exercise themselves best, so that he would <lb/>
            be able to make use of men practised in every department <lb/>
            whenever he had need of them." " You say very well, my <lb/>
            son," said he, " for by doing so, you will, be assured, see the <lb/>
            several divisions of your men, like sets of dancers, always <lb/>
            performing their proper parts."</p>
          <p>19. "And then," said Cyrus, "with respect to putting <lb/>
            spirit into the soldiers, nothing seems to me more effectual, <lb/>
            than to be able to give the men great hopes of advantage." <lb/>
            "But," said he, “my son, this expedient is just as if any one <lb/>
            in hunting should always encourage the dogs with the call <lb/>
            which he uses when he has the beast in view; for at first, I <lb/>
            know, he would find them very ready to attend to him, but, <lb/>
            if he often deceived them, they would at last give no attention <lb/>
            to him even when he called them with the beast in sight. <lb/>
            It is the same with respect to these hopes; if any one should <lb/>
            disappoint men often, after raising in them expectations of <lb/>
            advantage, he would at last be unable to prevail over them, <lb/>
            even when he spoke to them of hopes ever so well grounded. <lb/>
            But, my son," continued he, "you must be cautious of saying <lb/>
            anything that you do not certainly know; sometimes others, <lb/>
            saying it, may produce the same effect; your own encourage­ <lb/>
            ment you must preserve in credit as much as possible for the <lb/>
            greatest emergencies." " Indeed, father," said Cyrus, " in <lb/>
            my opinion, you say well, and to act thus is to me the more <lb/>
            agreeable method.</p>
          <p>20. " But, as to rendering the soldiers 'obedient, I think <lb/>
            myself, father, not wholly unskilled in that particular; for <lb/>
            from my boyhood you taught me discipline, obliging me to be <lb/>
            obedient to you ; you then committed me to teachers, and <lb/>
            they acted similarly; and when I was classed among the <lb/>
            youth, our officer took strict care as to that point; and the <lb/>
            greater number of laws appear to me to teach chiefly these <lb/>
            two things, how to govern, and how to obey; and, on reflect­ <pb n="37"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 6.] <lb/>
            </note>iug upon these matters, I think I understand that what ex­ <lb/>
            cites most to obedience among all men is to praise and honour <lb/>
            the obedient, and to disgrace and punish the disobedient." <lb/>
            21. "This is indeed the way, my son," said he, "to make <lb/>
            them obey you through necessity ; but to what is far better <lb/>
            than this, to have them obey you willingly, there is another <lb/>
            readier way; for whomsoever men think to be more know­ <lb/>
            ing than themselves in what is for their good, him they obey <lb/>
            with the utmost pleasure. You may see that this is so in the <lb/>
            case of many other people, and particularly in that of the sick, <lb/>
            for you observe how readily they call in such as may pre­ <lb/>
            scribe what they ought to do; how readily at sea, too, the <lb/>
            people that are on board obey their pilots ; and how anxious <lb/>
            people are not to be left behind by such as they think know <lb/>
            roads better than themselves; but when men think that they <lb/>
            shall incur any harm by obedience, they are not at all willing <lb/>
            either to submit to punishments or be encouraged by rewards; <lb/>
            for no one willingly takes even a reward to his own prejudice." <lb/>
            22. " You say, then, father," said he, " that nothing is more <lb/>
            effectual to render men obedient than to appear to be wisei <lb/>
            than those under command." " I do say so," said he. " And <lb/>
            how, father," said he, " will a person be best able to raise such <lb/>
            an opinion of himself?" “My son," replied he, " there is no <lb/>
            readier way to appear wise in things in which you desire to <lb/>
            appear so, than to be in reality wise in those things; and if <lb/>
            you look to particulars, you will find that what I say is true. <lb/>
            For if you would appear a good agriculturist, a good horse­ <lb/>
            man, a good physician, a good player on the flute, or anything <lb/>
            else whatsoever, when you really are not so, consider how <lb/>
            many contrivances you must use in- order to make such an <lb/>
            appearance. And if you should prevail with a great many <lb/>
            people to commend you, that you may gain a reputation, and <lb/>
            should procure fine instruments belonging to each of those <lb/>
            arts, you would but deceive for a time, and soon after, <lb/>
            when you came to give proof of your skill, you would be ex­ <lb/>
            posed, and appear a mere boaster." 23. " But how can a <lb/>

            ing everything that he can acquire by learning, as you have <lb/>
            learned tactics; but, with respect to what is not to be learned <lb/>
            with the aid of men, or ascertained by human foresight, you <pb n="38"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. 1. <lb/>

            gods by means of augury, and whatever you find most proper to <lb/>
            be done, taking care that it be done; for to see to the execu­ <lb/>
            tion of what is proper, is the part of a man of superior pru­ <lb/>
            dence, rather than to neglect it."</p>
          <p>24. " But," said Cyrus, " as to being beloved by those that <lb/>
            are under command, a point which seems to me to be among <lb/>
            those of most'importance, it is evident, that the way is the same <lb/>
            which any one would take who should desire to be loved by <lb/>
            his friends; for I know very well that he ought plainly to <lb/>
            appear of service to them." " But, my son," said he, " it is <lb/>
            a matter of great difficulty to be always able to serve those <lb/>
            that we would wish to serve; but to be observed to rejoice <lb/>
            with them if any good fortune befalls them, and to grieve <lb/>
            with them if anything ill happens ; to appear zealous to assist <lb/>
            them in their distresses, afraid lest they should miscarry in <lb/>
            anything, and anxious to provide that they may not miscarry, <lb/>
            these are the respects in which you should show sympathy <lb/>
            with them.1 25. And, in action, if it be summer, the commander <lb/>
            ought to be observed to bear more heat, and if it be winter, <lb/>
            more cold, and in great fatigues, more exertion, than others ; <lb/>
            for all these things contribute to his being beloved by those <lb/>
            that are under his government." "You say then, father," <lb/>
            said he, " that a commander ought in everything to show <lb/>
            himself more capable of endurance than those whom he com­ <lb/>
            mands." " I do say so," said he ; “but be of good courage, <lb/>
            my son, as to this particular; for, be assured that, with like <lb/>
            bodies, the same labours do not equally affect the commander <lb/>
            and the private man ; glory, and the consciousness that, what­ <lb/>
            ever he does, his acts are not concealed, make toils lighter to <lb/>
            the commander."</p>
          <p>26. "But when the soldiers, father, are supplied with all <lb/>
            things necessary, when they are in health, and able to under­ <lb/>
            go labour, when they are well exercised in all the military arts, <lb/>
            when they are ambitious to appear brave men, and when <lb/>
            obedience is more pleasing to them than the contrary; would <lb/>
            not that commander be wise, in your opinion, who should then <lb/>
            desire, upon the first opportunity, to bring them to an engage­ <lb/>
            ment with the enemy?" "Yes, truly," said he, "provided <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συμπαρομαρτει̃ν</foreign>.] “To go along with." </note> <pb n="39"/>

            that he was likely to have the superiority; but if otherwise, <lb/>
            the better I thought of myself, and the better I thought of my <lb/>
            men, the more should I guard my advantages ; just as we en­ <lb/>
            deavour to secure other things, which we think of the greatest <lb/>
            value to us, in the safest manner."</p>
          <p>27. " By what means then, father," said he, " would a com­ <lb/>
            mander be best able to get the advantage of the enemy?" <lb/>
            “Truly, my son," said he, " this is no contemptible or simple <lb/>
            business about which you inquire. But be assured that he <lb/>
            who is to do this must be full of wiles, a dissembler, crafty, <lb/>
            deceitful, a thief, and a robber, and an encroacher upon the <lb/>
            enemy in every way." Cyrus, laughing, cried out, “0 <lb/>
            Hercules ! what sort of a man, father, do you say that I must <lb/>
            be ? " “Such a one, my son," said he, " as may yet have the <lb/>
            strictest regard to justice and law." 28. “Why, then," said <lb/>
            he, “while we were boys, and while we were youths, did <lb/>
            you teach us the direct contrary ?" " So indeed we do still," <lb/>
            said be, " with respect to friends and fellow-citizens. But <lb/>
            were you not aware that you learned a great many mischievous <lb/>
            arts in order that you might be able to do harm to your ene­ <lb/>
            mies? " "I was not, father," said he. " For what purpose, <lb/>
            then," said he, “did you learn to use the bow, and to throw <lb/>
            the javelin ? For what purpose did you learn to deceive wild <lb/>
            boars with nets and trenches, and stags with snares and gins ? <lb/>
            What is the reason that, in your encounters with lions, bears, <lb/>
            and leopards, you did not put yourself upon an equal footing <lb/>
            with them, but endeavoured to contend against them with <lb/>
            every advantage ? Do you not know that these are all mis­ <lb/>
            chievous artifices, deceits, subtleties, and circumventions ?" <lb/>
            29. “Yes, certainly," said Cyrus, "against beasts; but if I <lb/>
            were discovered attempting to deceive a man, I remember that <lb/>
            I used to receive a good many stripes for it." " Nor did we, <lb/>
            I think," said he, " allow you to shoot with the bow, or hurl <lb/>
            a javelin, at a man ; but we taught you to throw at a mark, <lb/>
            that you might not, at that time, do mischief to your friends, <lb/>
            but that if war should happen, you might be able to take your <lb/>
            aim at men. We instructed you, also, to practise deceit, and <lb/>
            to take advantage, not upon men, but upon beasts, that you <lb/>
            might not hurt your friends by these means, but that, if a war <lb/>
            should ever happen, you might not be unpractised in them.” <lb/>
            so. " Then," said he, " father, if it be of use to know both <pb n="40"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            how to do men good, and how to do them harm, you should have <lb/>
            taught us how to practise both these arts upon men." 31. “My <lb/>
            son,” said be, " in the time of our forefathers, there is said to <lb/>
            have been a certain teacher of youth, who, just as you desire, <lb/>
            taught the boys both justice and injustice ;1 to lie and not to <lb/>
            lie; to deceive and not to deceive; to calumniate and not to <lb/>
            calumniate ; to take advantage and not to take advantage. <lb/>
            And he distinguished which of these was to be practised to­ <lb/>
            wards friends, and which towards enemies, and, proceeding yet <lb/>
            further, taught that it was even just to deceive friends for their <lb/>
            good, and to steal the property of friends for their good. 32. <lb/>
            In giving these instructions, he was obliged to exercise the <lb/>
            boys one against another in the practice of them, as they say <lb/>
            that the Greeks teach boys to deceive in wrestling, and exercise <lb/>
            them in it one against another, so that. they may be able to <lb/>
            put it in practice. Some, accordingly, being naturally quali­ <lb/>
            fled to deceive artfully, and artfully to take advantage, and, <lb/>
            perhaps, not naturally unqualified to pursue profit for them­ <lb/>
            selves, did not refrain from using their endeavours to take <lb/>
            advantage even of their friends. 33. In consequence, a decree <lb/>
            was made, which we yet observe, that we should teach the <lb/>
            boys simply, as we teach our servants in their behaviour <lb/>
            towards us, to tell truth, not to deceive, not to take advant­ <lb/>
            age; and that if they transgress in these things, we should <lb/>
            punish them, in order that, being accustomed to this conduct, <lb/>
            they may become more tractable citizens. 34. But when they <lb/>
            arrived at the age to which you are now come, it appeared to <lb/>
            be safe to teach them also what is lawful with respect to ene­ <lb/>
            mies, for, having been bred together with a regard for each <lb/>
            other, you did not seem likely to break out afterwards so as <lb/>
            to become lawless citizens; just as before very young people <lb/>
            we avoid discoursing on amatory subjects, lest license be­ <lb/>
            ing added to strong desire, they should indulge their pas­ <lb/>
            sions to excess." 35. “To me, therefore," said he, " father, <lb/>
            as being a very late learner of these artifices, do not refuse to <lb/>
            communicate them, if you know means by which I may take <lb/>
            advantage of the enemy." “As far as is in your power, then," <lb/>
            said he, " contrive, with your own men in the best order, to <note type="footnote"> 1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἀδικίαν</foreign> are inserted in Hutchinson's text, from a <lb/>

            take the enemy in disorder; the enemy unarmed, with your <lb/>
            own men armed; the enemy sleeping, with your own men <lb/>
            waking ; the enemy exposed to you, yourself being concealed <lb/>
            from them; and you will then, while you are yourself in se­ <lb/>
            curity, surprise them in the midst of difficulties." 36. And <lb/>
            how," said he, "can a leader possibly surprise the enemy <lb/>
            making such mistakes as these ? " " Because, my son," re­ <lb/>
            plied Cambyses, " both the enemy and yourself must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity afford many opportunities of this kind ; for you must both <lb/>
            get provisions; you must both necessarily have rest; in the <lb/>
            morning you must almost all, at the same time, retire on ne­ <lb/>
            cessary occasions; and in your marches, you must make use <lb/>
            of such roads as there happen to be: considering all these <lb/>
            things, in whatever part you know yourself to be the weak­ <lb/>
            est, in that you must be the most watchful; and in whatever <lb/>
            part you observe the enemy to be most assailable, in that you <lb/>
            must attack him."</p>
          <p>37. " Is it then in these things only," said Cyrus, " that it is <lb/>
            possible to take advantages, or may it be done in others ? ” <lb/>
            " Much more in others, my son," said he, " and more effectu­ <lb/>
            ally ; for, in reference to these things, all men, for the most <lb/>
            part, take strict precautions, knowing that they require them. <lb/>
            But those who would deceive the enemy, may possibly, by <lb/>
            rendering them confident, surprise them unguarded ; or, by <lb/>
            letting themselves be pursued, may throw them into disorder, <lb/>
            and alluring them on, by flight, into disadvantageous ground, <lb/>
            may there attack them. 38. But it becomes you, my son, <lb/>
            who are fond of understanding all these affairs, not to adopt <lb/>
            such plans only as you have been taught, but to be yourself <lb/>
            a contriver of stratagems to put in force against the enemy; <lb/>
            just as musicians play not only such tunes as they have been <lb/>
            taught, but endeavour to compose other new melodies; and as, <lb/>
            in music, such pieces as are new, and as it were in flower, are <lb/>
            held in esteem, so, in affairs of war, new contrivances are much <lb/>
            more approved, for they are more effective in deceiving the <lb/>
            enemy. 39. But, my son," continued he, "if you do no more <lb/>
            than transfer to men those contrivances which you have used <lb/>
            to insnare small animals, do you not think that you will go a <lb/>
            great way in the art of taking advantage of your enemy ? <lb/>
            For, in order to catch birds, you used to rise and go out in <lb/>
            the night, in the severest winter; and before the birds were <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            stirring your snares were laid ready for them ; the moveable <lb/>
            platform was made like the unmoved ground; birds were <lb/>
            taught by you to serve your purposes, and to deceive those of <lb/>
            their own kind ; you yourself lay hid, so as to see them, but <lb/>
            not to be seen by them ; and you practised drawing your nets <lb/>
            before the birds could escape. 40. For the hare, too, because <lb/>
            she feeds in the dusk, and conceals herself by day, you kept <lb/>
            dogs, to find her by the scent; and, because she ran off as soon <lb/>
            as she was found, you had other dogs prepared to overtake <lb/>
            her on her track ; and if she escaped these, then, having before <lb/>
            discovered her paths, and to what sort of places hares flee, and <lb/>
            are caught,1 you would lay, in these places, nets difficult to be <lb/>
            seen, and the hare, in the impetuosity of flight, would fall <lb/>
            into them and entangle herself. And that she might not <lb/>
            escape from hence, you would set people to watch what passed, <lb/>
            who, from some place near at hand, would presently be upon <lb/>
            her; you yourself shouting behind, with noise that never quits <lb/>
            her, would overwhelm her with amazement, so that in this <lb/>
            distraction she would be taken: and you would make those <lb/>
            that are set to watch lie concealed, having instructed their <lb/>
            beforehand to be silent. 41. As I said before, therefore, if <lb/>
            you would form such contrivances against men, I do not know <lb/>
            that you would leave one of the enemy alive. But if it ever <lb/>
            be necessary to fight upon even terms with respect to situa­ <lb/>
            tion, openly, and both parties being fully armed, in such a case, <lb/>
            my son, those advantages, that have been long before secured, <lb/>
            are of great weight; those which I mean are, when the bodies <lb/>
            of your men are duly exercised, their minds keen, and all mili­ <lb/>
            tary arts well studied. 42. Besides, it is very necessary that <lb/>
            you should understand, that whomsoever you desire to be <lb/>
            obedient to you, they, on their part, will all desire you to be <lb/>
            provident for them; never be remiss, therefore, but consider <lb/>
            at night what your men shall do when it is day ; and consider <lb/>
            in the day how matters may be best settled for the night. 43, <lb/>
            But as to the mode in which you should arrange your troops <lb/>
            for battle ; how you should lead them, by day or night, through <lb/>
            narrow or open ways, through mountains or plains; how you <lb/>
            should encamp; how you should place sentinels by night <lb/>

            treat from them ; how you should march past a city belonging <lb/>
            to the enemy; how you should advance up to a rampart, or <lb/>
            retreat from it; how you should pass through woods or rivers ; <lb/>
            how you should guard against cavalry, or javelin-men, or <lb/>
            archers ; how, if, when you are marching in columns, the <lb/>
            enemy should appear, you should form a front against them ; <lb/>
            how, if, when you are marching in phalanx, the enemy appear <lb/>
            in some other part than in front, you should advance upon them ; <lb/>
            how you may get the best intelligence of the enemy's affairs, <lb/>
            and how the enemy may be best kept in ignorance of yours ; <lb/>
            what, on all these subjects, can I say to you ? What I know of <lb/>
            them, you have often heard from me; and whoever else ap­ <lb/>
            peared knowing in any such matters, you have not neglected <lb/>
            to get information from them; nor are you ignorant of them ; <lb/>
            according to circumstances, therefore, you must turn these <lb/>
            acquirements to advantage, as it may seem fit.</p>
          <p>44. "Take my instruction, my son," said he, "likewise, on <lb/>
            the following points, which are of the greatest importance: <lb/>
            Never run into danger, either in your own person, or with <lb/>
            your army, contrary to the sacrifices and auguries ; reflecting <lb/>
            how men engage in undertakings on conjecture, and without <lb/>
            knowing in the least from what course of conduct benefits will <lb/>
            result to them. 45. This you may see from the things them­ <lb/>
            selves that happen; for many men, and such, too, as were <lb/>
            thought to be very wise, have persuaded people to undertake <lb/>
            war against those by whom those that were persuaded to be <lb/>
            the aggressors have been destroyed. Many, also, have exalted <lb/>
            both private men and cities, from whom, when exalted, they <lb/>
            have suffered the greatest misfortunes. Many, too, having <lb/>
            chosen rather to treat those as slaves than as friends, whom <lb/>
            they might have treated as friends, giving and receiving <lb/>
            reciprocal benefits, have met with retaliation at their hands. <lb/>
            To many, likewise, it has not been sufficient to live in plea­ <lb/>
            sure, possessing their own proper share of things; but, de­ <lb/>
            siring to be lords of all, they have by this means lost what <lb/>
            they had; and many, who have acquired the much wished <lb/>
            for metal, gold, have perished by means of it. 46. Thus <lb/>
            human wisdom knows no more how to choose what is best, <lb/>
            than a man who, casting lots, should do whatever might chance <lb/>
            to fall to him. But the ever-living gods, my son, know all <lb/>

            gods and heroes who presided over the land of Persia, to send <lb/>
            them away favourably and propitiously, and crossed the bor­ <lb/>
            ders. When they had crossed them, they again made suppli­ <lb/>
            cation to the gods who preside over the land of Media, to <lb/>
            receive them propitiously and favourably; and, having done <lb/>
            so, and embraced each other, according to custom, the father <lb/>
            returned into Persia, and Cyrus marched on into Media to <lb/>
            join Cyaxares.</p>
          <p>-2. When Cyrus came to Cyaxares in Media, they first <lb/>
            embraced each other, according to custom, and Cyaxares then <lb/>
            asked Cyrus, " How large a force he was bringing him.” <lb/>
            He replied, " Thirty thousand of such as used to come to <lb/>
            you before as mercenary troops, but there are others coming <lb/>
            who have never served out of their own country, of the order <lb/>
            of the Equals-in-honour." " How many ? " said Cyaxares. 3. <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξ ἑκάστου αὐτω̃ν</foreign>.] From everything, both of things past and <lb/>

            " The number of them," replied Cyrus, “will scarcely please <lb/>
            you, when you hear it; but consider," said lie, "that those <lb/>
            who are called the Equals-in-honour,. though but few, rule <lb/>
            with ease the rest of the Persians, who are very numerous. <lb/>
            But," added he, " are you in any real want of these men, or <lb/>
            are you under a vain alarm, and the enemy not coming?" <lb/>
            " Assuredly they are," said he, " and in great numbers." 4. <lb/>
            “How does this appear ? Because a great many people, <lb/>
            who come from that quarter, some one way and some an­ <lb/>
            other, all tell the same tale." "We must then," said Cy­ <lb/>
            rus, " engage with these men." “We must of necessity," re­ <lb/>
            plied Cyaxares. “Why do you not tell me then," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            "if you know, what the number of these forces is, that are <lb/>
            coming upon us, and what is the number of our own, that, <lb/>
            knowing the strength of both, we may consult how to carry <lb/>
            on the war in the best manner?" 5. “ Hear, then," said Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares: "Crœsus, the Lydian, is said to be bringing with him <lb/>
            ten thousand horse, and upwards of forty thousand peltasts <lb/>
            and archers ; they say, too, that Arsamas, governor of Greater <lb/>
            Phrygia, is bringing horse to the number of eight thousand, <lb/>
            and lancers and peltasts not less than forty thousand; that <lb/>
            Aribæus, king of the Cappadocians, brings horse to the num­ <lb/>
            ber of six thousand, and archers and peltasts not less than <lb/>
            thirty thousand; and that Aragdus, the Arabian, is bringing <lb/>
            cavalry as many as ten thousand, a hundred chariots, and a very <lb/>
            large body of slingers. As to the Greeks that are settled <lb/>
            in Asia, there is no certain intelligence as yet whether they <lb/>
            have joined the expedition or not. But they say that Gaboeus <lb/>
            has assembled in the Caystrian plain,1 from Phrygia on the <lb/>
            Hellespont, six thousand horse, and peltasts to the number <lb/>
            of ten thousand. The Carians, Cilicians, and Paphlagonians, <lb/>
            though summoned, they say, do not join the expedition. The <lb/>
            Assyrian king, who possesses Babylon and the rest of Assyria, <lb/>
            will, as I conjecture, bring not less than twenty thousand <lb/>
            horse; chariots, I am well aware, not fewer than two hun­ <lb/>
            dred ; and, I believe, a vast body of foot; at least he was <lb/>
            accustomed to do so when he invaded this country." 6. <lb/>
            " The enemy then," said Cyrus, " you say, amount to sixty <note type="footnote"> 1 Either that plain of Caystrus which is mentioned in the Ana­ <lb/>
            basis, i. 2. 11, or, as is more probable, the plain through which the <lb/>
            river Cayster flowed. Bornemann. </note> <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            thousand horse, and more than two hundred thousand pel­ <lb/>
            tasts and archers. But what then do you say is the num­ <lb/>
            ber of your own forces?" " Of the Medes,” said Cyaxares, <lb/>
            the cavalry are above ten thousand; the peltasts and archers <lb/>
            may be, perhaps, from such a territory as ours,1 about sixty <lb/>
            thousand ; and of the Armenians, our neighbours, there will <lb/>
            be with us four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot." <lb/>
            " You say then," said Cyrus, " that our cavalry will be less <lb/>
            than a third part of the enemy's, and our foot about half the <lb/>
            number of theirs." 7. " What, then," said Cyaxares, " do <lb/>
            you think that those Persians, whom you say you bring, are <lb/>
            but an inconsiderable number?" " Whether we want more <lb/>
            men," said Cyrus, " or not, we will consider hereafter ; at <lb/>
            present, pray tell me what is the mode of fighting that is in <lb/>
            use with those several people." " It is nearly the same amongst <lb/>
            them all," said Cyaxares; "there are archers and lancers <lb/>
            among them, just like ours." "Then," said Cyrus, "since <lb/>
            such are their arms, they must necessarily skirmish at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance." " Necessarily," said Cyaxares. s. " In this case, <lb/>
            therefore," said Cyrus, " the victory will fall to the greater <lb/>
            number; for the few will be much sooner wounded and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by the many, than the many by the few." " If such <lb/>
            be the case, Cyrus," said he, “what better expedient can we <lb/>
            find than to send to the Persians, acquaint them that, if the <lb/>
            Medes sustain any harm, the danger will extend to themselves, <lb/>
            and, at the same time, request of them a greater force ?" Be <lb/>
            well assured," said Cyrus, " that even if all the Persians <lb/>
            should come, we should not exceed the enemy in numbers." <lb/>
            9. " What plan have you in view, then, that is better than <lb/>
            this?" "Why," said Cyrus, "if Iliad the power, I would <lb/>
            immediately make, for all the Persians that are coming, such <lb/>
            arms as those with which the Equals-in-honour come pro­ <lb/>
            vided ; and these are, a corslet over the breast, a shield for <lb/>
            the left hand, and a bill, or short sword,2 for the right. <lb/>
            If you provide these arms, you will make it safest for us to <lb/>
            come to close fight with the enemy, and better for the enemy <lb/>
            to flee than to stand their ground. Ourselves, said he, “we <note type="footnote"> I ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ως ἐπὶ τη̃ς ἡμετέρας</foreign>.] Ut in nostrâ terrâ, i. e. pro ratione et tenui­ <lb/>

            range against those that stand; those that flee we leave to <lb/>
            you and your horse, that they may have no time either to make <lb/>
            their escape or to turn again." 10. Thus Cyrus suggested; <lb/>
            and Cyaxares was of opinion that what he said was reason­ <lb/>
            able, and thought no longer of sending for more men, but pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to provide the arms already mentioned; and they were <lb/>
            scarcely ready when the Equals-in-honour arrived from Per­ <lb/>
            sia, bringing the Persian army with them.</p>
          <p>11. Soon after, Cyrus is said to have called them together, <lb/>
            and to have addressed them thus: " My friends, I, who saw <lb/>
            that you were armed, and prepared in mind for close com­ <lb/>
            bat with the enemy, and knew that the Persians who attend <lb/>
            you were armed only in such manner as to skirmish from a <lb/>
            distance, was afraid that, being but few in number, and desti­ <lb/>
            tute of others to support you, you might, when you fell in <lb/>
            with the great number of the enemy, incur some misfortune. <lb/>
            Now, therefore, you are come," said he, " you bring with you <lb/>
            men whose bodies are not to be despised; and they are to be <lb/>
            supplied with arms like our own; but to raise their courage <lb/>
            will be our part. For it is the duty of an officer not only <lb/>
            to be brave himself, but to take such care of those that be <lb/>
            commands, that they may be as brave as is possible."</p>
          <p>12. Thus spoke Cyrus; and they were all much pleased, <lb/>
            seeing they should now engage the enemy with more to sup­ <lb/>
            port them; and one of them spoke to this effect: 13. "Pei <lb/>
            haps," said he, “I may be thought to talk strangely, if I ad <lb/>
            vise Cyrus to say something on our behalf, when these men <lb/>
            who are to be our fellow-combatants, receive their arms; foi <lb/>
            I know," said he, " that the words of those who have the most <lb/>
            power to do service or injury, sink deepest into the minds of <lb/>
            the hearers; and if such men make presents, though they <lb/>
            may happen to be less than those which men receive from <lb/>
            their equals, yet the receivers value them more. Accordingly," <lb/>
            said he, " our Persian supporters will be much more pleased <lb/>
            on this occasion, if they receive an exhortation from Cyrus, <lb/>
            than if they receive one from us. And when they are placed <lb/>
            in the degree of the Equals-in-honour, they will think that <lb/>
            they occupy it more securely, if the honour is conferred by <lb/>
            the son of our king, and our commander-in-chief, than if they <lb/>
            receive it from us. Nor ought endeavours to be wanting on <lb/>
            our part; but we should, ourselves, by every possible means <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            excite these men's courage; for the more courageous they be­ <lb/>
            come, the more will it be for our advantage."</p>
          <p>14, Cyrus, therefore, causing the arms to be arranged in a <lb/>
            place open to view, and calling together all the Persian sol­ <lb/>
            diers, spoke to the following effect: 15. “Men of Persia, <lb/>
            you were born and bred in the same country with ourselves; <lb/>
            you have bodies in no respect inferior to ours, and you ought <lb/>
            to have souls not inferior. But though you are such in your­ <lb/>
            selves, you were not, in our own country, upon an equal foot­ <lb/>
            ing with us. It was not by us that you were excluded from <lb/>
            it, but by the necessity that you were under of providing <lb/>
            yourselves with subsistence. But now, with the help of the gods, <lb/>
            it shall be my care that you be supplied with these; and it is <lb/>
            permitted you, if you think proper, by accepting these arms, <lb/>
            which are such as we have ourselves, to engage in the same <lb/>
            enterprises with us; and, if anything honourable and ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous result from them, to be honoured with the same <lb/>
            distinctions as ourselves. 16. Hitherto you have used the bow <lb/>
            and the javelin as we have; and if you were inferior to us <lb/>
            in the exercise of these weapons, it is not at all wonderful; <lb/>
            for you had not the leisure that we had, to improve your­ <lb/>
            selves in them. But, with these arms, we shall have no ad­ <lb/>
            vantage over you, for every one will have a corslet fitted to <lb/>
            his breast, a shield for the left hand, which we are all alike <lb/>
            accustomed to carry ; and, for the right, a bill or short sword, <lb/>
            which we are to use against the enemy, guarding against no­ <lb/>
            thing but that we may not miss our blow. 17. With these <lb/>
            arms, then, what difference can there be between one and <lb/>
            another of us, unless it be in courage, which you ought to <lb/>
            cherish not less than we ? As to the desire of victory, which <lb/>
            gains and secures all that is honourable and advantageous, <lb/>
            how can it concern us more than you ? As to superior power <lb/>
            in arms, which gives all the possessions of the conquered to <lb/>
            the conquerors, how is it possible that we should long for it <lb/>
            more than you?" is. In conclusion, he said, “You have <lb/>
            heard all; you see the arms before you ; let him that thinks <lb/>
            fit take them, and enrol himself under his officer in the same <lb/>
            rank with us. But he that is content to be in the condi­ <lb/>
            tion of a mercenary, let him continue in servile arms." 19. <lb/>
            Thus he spoke; and the Persians that heard him were of <lb/>
            opinion, that if, when they were invited to an equal share of <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            advantages, by sharing in like labours, they should not accept <lb/>
            the offer, they would justly pass all their days in a low con­ <lb/>
            dition. They all accordingly enrolled themselves, and all <lb/>
            took the arms.</p>
          <p>20. During the time that the enemy was said to be ap­ <lb/>
            proaching, but had not yet arrived, Cyrus endeavoured to <lb/>
            exercise his men so that they might acquire vigour; to teach <lb/>
            them military evolutions, and to excite their minds to warlike <lb/>
            enterprise. <unclear>20</unclear>. In the first place, being supplied with servants <lb/>
            by Cyaxares, he ordered them to furnish all the soldiers, liber­ <lb/>
            ally, with everything that they wanted, ready prepared. By <lb/>
            providing for them in this way, he left them nothing to do <lb/>
            but to exercise themselves in such things as related to war, <lb/>
            appearing to have convinced himself of the truth of this <lb/>
            maxim, that those men become most skilful in anything, who, <lb/>
            abstaining from giving their attention to many occupations, <lb/>
            apply themselves to one employment only. And of exercises <lb/>
            relating to war, he relieved them from practice with the bow <lb/>
            and javelin, and left them only one object of attention, to <lb/>
            fight with sword, shield, and corslet. He accordingly soon <lb/>
            brought their minds to this state, that they found they must <lb/>
            either engage the enemy hand to hand, or confess that they <lb/>
            were allies of no value ; and this was hard to be owned by such <lb/>
            as knew they were maintained for nothing else but to fight for <lb/>
            those that maintained them. 22. Having considered, too, that <lb/>
            in whatever things there are emulations among mankind, they <lb/>
            are much more willing to exercise themselves in them, he ap­ <lb/>
            pointed contests among his men in whatever he knew was <lb/>
            importance to be practised by soldiers.</p>
          <p>The particulars which he specified were these : for the <lb/>
            private man, to render himself obedient to his commanders, <lb/>
            ready to undergo labour, willing to face dangers consistently <lb/>
            with good order, skilful in military exercises, fond of having <lb/>
            his arms in good condition, and desirous of praise in all such <lb/>
            matters. For the captain of five, to make himself such as it <lb/>
            became an able private man to be ; and to do his utmost to <lb/>
            make his five likewise such. For the captain of ten, to make <lb/>
            his ten such; for the captain of twenty-five, to do the same <lb/>
            for his twenty-five; and for the centurion, to be himself un­ <lb/>
            exceptionable in conduct, and to keep watch over those who <lb/>
            commanded under him, that they might make those whom <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            they commanded fulfil their duties. 23. The rewards that he <lb/>
            proposed were, for the centurions, that those who appeared to <lb/>
            have brought their companies into the best condition, should <lb/>
            be made commanders of a thousand ; for the captains of <lb/>
            twenty-five, that those who appeared to exhibit the best com­ <lb/>
            panies, should be promoted to the places vacated by the <lb/>
            centurions; for the captains of ten, that such as were most <lb/>
            meritorious should be put into the places of the captains of <lb/>
            twenty-five; for the captains of five, in like manner, to be <lb/>
            advanced to the places of the captains of ten; and for the <lb/>
            private men that behaved best, to be promoted to the rank of <lb/>
            captains of five. It happened to all these officers, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, that they were well served by those whom they com­ <lb/>
            manded, and that all the honours suitable to each were readily <lb/>
            paid to them. Greater hopes, too, were held out to such as <lb/>
            deserved praise, in case any more than ordinary advantage <lb/>
            should hereafter present itself. 24. He offered also rewards, <lb/>
            in case of victory, to whole companies of a hundred and of <lb/>
            twenty-five, as well as to those of ten and five, if they proved <lb/>
            themselves eminently obedient to their officers, and zealous in <lb/>
            performing the duties above mentioned. These rewards were <lb/>
            such as were proper to be bestowed in common upon a number <lb/>
            of men. Such were the things which were proclaimed, and <lb/>
            in which the soldiers were exercised.</p>
          <p>25. Tents he likewise provided for them, as many in num­ <lb/>
            ber as were the centurions, and of such a size that each would <lb/>
            contain a company; a company consisting of a hundred men. <lb/>
            Thus they were quartered in tents by companies. The men <lb/>
            seemed to him to be benefited, with a view to the war that was <lb/>
            coming on, by thus dwelling together, inasmuch as they saw <lb/>
            each other maintained alike ; and there was no pretence of <lb/>
            lying under a disadvantage, so that any one should be remiss, <lb/>
            or that one should be inferior to another for acting against <lb/>
            the enemy. They appeared to him likewise to be benefited <lb/>
            by this joint habitation in knowing one another; for, from <lb/>
            being known, a greater feeling of self-respect seems to be pro­ <lb/>
            duced in all men ; and they who are unknown appear to act <lb/>
            with less restraint, like persons in the dark. 26. They seemed <lb/>
            to him also to be improved by this cohabitation, in having an <lb/>
            exact knowledge of their places and companies; for thus the <lb/>
            centurions had their several companies in order under them, <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            just. as much as when the company was going one by one <lb/>
            upon a march; so the captains of twenty-five their twenty- <lb/>
            fives ; the commanders of tens their tens; and the com­ <lb/>
            manders of five their fives: 27. and this exact knowledge <lb/>
            of their places seemed to him to be of great service, both to <lb/>
            prevent their being put into disorder, and, if they should be <lb/>
            disordered, to enable them to rally more readily ; as in the <lb/>
            case of stones and pieces of wood, that are to be fitted to­ <lb/>
            gether, it is possible, if they have certain marks to make it evi­ <lb/>
            dent to what place each of them belongs, to fit them together <lb/>
            again with ease, however confusedly they may have been <lb/>
            thrown down. 28. They seemed to him, moreover, to be <lb/>
            benefited by living together, inasmuch as they would be <lb/>
            less likely to desert one another; because he observed that <lb/>
            beasts, which were fed together, were in great trouble if any <lb/>
            one separated them from each other.</p>
          <p>29. Cyrus also took care that they should never go in to <lb/>
            their dinner or supper without previous exercise; for he <lb/>
            either led them out to hunt, and gave them exercise in that <lb/>
            way, or contrived such sports for them as would make them <lb/>
            exert themselves; or, if he happened to want anything done, <lb/>
            he so managed it, that they should not return without hard <lb/>
            exercise ; for this he judged to be of service, in order to make <lb/>
            them eat with pleasure, and to render them healthy and able <lb/>
            to undergo labour; and labour he judged to be of use in mak­ <lb/>
            ing them more gentle one towards another, because even <lb/>
            horses, that labour jointly together, stand likewise more con­ <lb/>
            tentedly together. And certainly with regard to facing the <lb/>
            enemy, those who are conscious of having duly exercised <lb/>
            themselves, are inspired with more boldness.</p>
          <p>30. Cyrus likewise provided himself with such a tent as <lb/>
            would be large enough to contain those that he invited to sup <lb/>
            with him. He invited, for the most part, such of the cen­ <lb/>
            turions as he thought proper ; but he sometimes invited some <lb/>
            of the captains of twenty-five, some of the captains of ten, and <lb/>
            some of the commanders of five; sometimes some of the pri­ <lb/>
            vate soldiers, and sometimes a whole company of five, a whole <lb/>
            one of ten, a whole twenty-five, or a whole hundred together. <lb/>
            He invited likewise, and rewarded, such as he saw practise <lb/>
            anything that he wished all the others to imitate. And the <lb/>
            dishes that were set before himself, and before those that he <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            invited to supper, were always alike. 31. The attendants on <lb/>
            the soldiers, too, lie always made equal sharers in everything; <lb/>
            for he thought it not less becoming him to distinguish those <lb/>
            who served in the concerns'of the army, than to honour heralds <lb/>
            and ambassadors; as he was aware they ought to be faithful, <lb/>
            skilled in military affairs, and intelligent, as well as zealous, <lb/>
            quick of despatch, diligent, and orderly. Besides, whatever <lb/>
            good qualities those had who were accounted the better class, <lb/>
            Cyrus thought that the attendants should have those qualities <lb/>
            likewise ; and that they should bring themselves, by practice, <lb/>
            to refuse no work, but to consider it becoming them to do <lb/>
            everything that their commander should enjoin.</p>

          <p>The plans of Cyrus for improving the army are adopted. His conversations <lb/>
            with the officers and soldiers at entertainments. His proposals respecting <lb/>
            the distribution of the spoil which should be taken in war.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS always took care that, when he entertained any of <lb/>
            the men in his tent, the most agreeable subjects of discourse, <lb/>
            and such as might excite them to good conduct, should be intro­ <lb/>
            duced. On one occasion, therefore, he began to speak thus: <lb/>
            “Friends,” said he, "do the newly-attached1 appear inferior <lb/>
            to us for this reason, that they have not been disciplined in <lb/>
            the same manner as we have ? Or are they likely not to differ <lb/>
            from us at all, either in their converse with us, or in action <lb/>
            against the enemy?" 2. Hystaspes, in answer to him, said, <lb/>
            " What they will prove to be in action against the enemy, I <lb/>
            do not yet know; but, by the gods, some of them have shown <lb/>
            themselves ill-bred enough in company. Yesterday, for in­ <lb/>
            stance," continued he, “Cyaxares sent certain animals to be <lb/>
            killed for each company of a hundred; and there were three <lb/>
            or more pieces of flesh carried round for each of us. The <lb/>
            cook began the first round with me, and when he came in to <lb/>
            go round the second time, I bid him begin with the last man, <lb/>
            and carry round the contrary way. 3. One, therefore, in the <note type="footnote"> Ol <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑται̃ροι</foreign>.] Those whom Cyrus had lately promoted to the rank <lb/>
            of the Equals-in-honour. </note> <pb n="53"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            middle of the circle of soldiers, as they sat, cried out, ‘By <lb/>
            Jove there is no fairness in this, if nobody ever begins with <lb/>
            us here in the middle.' I, hearing this, was uneasy that any <lb/>
            of them should think they lay under a disadvantage, and <lb/>
            immediately bid him come to me ; in this he, in a very orderly <lb/>
            manner, obeyed me; but when the portions carried round <lb/>
            came to us who were to take last, only the least were left; <lb/>
            and upon this he plainly showed himself very much dissatis­ <lb/>
            fied, and said to himself, ‘O, ill fortune ! that I should happen <lb/>
            now to have been called hither!' 4. I then said to him, <lb/>
            ' Never mind; he will begin presently with us, and you shall <lb/>
            help yourself first to the largest piece. Just at this moment <lb/>
            the cook began to carry round the third time what was left <lb/>
            for distribution, and he took next after me; but as soon as <lb/>
            the third person had taken, and seemed to have taken a larger <lb/>
            portion than himself, he threw down that which he had taken, <lb/>
            intending to take another; but the cook, supposing that he <lb/>
            wanted no more meat, carried it past him before he could take <lb/>
            a second piece. 5. He now bore so ill the misfortune of losing <lb/>
            what he had taken, that from forgetting his self-command, <lb/>
            and being angry at his ill-fortune, he overturned in his impati­ <lb/>
            ence what sauce lie had remaining. The captain, who was <lb/>
            next us, seeing this, clapped his hands, and laughed out, much <lb/>
            amused; I," added Hystaspes, " made as if I coughed, for I <lb/>
            was not able to refrain from laughing. Cyrus," said he, <lb/>
            " such a man do I show you one of our new companions1 to <lb/>
            be." Upon this, as was natural, they all laughed.</p>
          <p>6. Another of the centurions then said, “Hystaspes, it <lb/>
            seems, Cyrus, has met with one of a very perverse temper. <lb/>
            For my part, after you had taught us the discipline of <lb/>
            our companies, and had dismissed us with commands to <lb/>
            teach every one his company what he had learned from <lb/>
            you, I, as the others did, went away and began to teach <lb/>
            one of the companies. Having placed the captain first, a <lb/>
            young man immediately behind him, and the rest as I thought <lb/>
            proper, I then, standing in front, and looking towards the <lb/>
            company, gave the order, when I thought it time, to advance. <lb/>
            7. This young man, advancing before the captain, marched on <lb/>
            first; I, seeing him do thus, said to him, ‘Young man, what <lb/>
            are you doing ?' He said, ‘I am advancing, as you order.' But, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν ἑταίρων</foreign>.] See sect. 1. </note> <pb n="54"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. II. </note> <lb/>
            said I, 'I did not order you only to advance, but all;' when <lb/>
            he, turning to his companions, said, 'Do you not hear him <lb/>
            finding fault ? He tells you all to advance.' 8. Upon this, all <lb/>
            the men, passing by the captain, came up to me ; but when <lb/>
            the captain made them go back again, they were offended, and <lb/>
            said, ' Whom are we to obey? for one tells us to advance, and <lb/>
            another will not allow us to do so.' Bearing all this patiently, <lb/>
            and placing them as at first, I told them, that none of those <lb/>
            behind should move till he that was before him led the way, <lb/>
            and that they should all mind only to follow the leader. 9. <lb/>
            But as a person, that was going to Persia, happened then to <lb/>
            come to me, and ask me for a letter that I had written home, <lb/>
            I told the captain, (for he knew where the letter was lying,) <lb/>
            to run and fetch the letter; he then began to run; and the <lb/>
            young man that was next him, armed as he was, with corslet <lb/>
            and sword, followed after the captain; and the rest of the <lb/>
            company, seeing him run, ran off with him ; and so they came <lb/>
            back, bringing me the letter. So exact," said he, " is this <lb/>
            company of mine in executing all the instructions they receive <lb/>
            from you." 10. The rest, as was natural, laughed at thi? <lb/>
            armed procession with the letter; but Cyrus said, " 0 Jove, <lb/>
            and all ye gods ! what sort of men have we for our com&lt;­ <lb/>
            panions ! Men so easily pleased, that we may render numbers <lb/>
            of them our friends with the aid of a small piece of meat; <lb/>
            and so obedient, that they obey before they understand what <lb/>
            they are ordered to do. For my part, I do not know what <lb/>
            sort of soldiers we should wish to have, rather than such !" <lb/>
            11. Cyrus thus, laughing, commended the soldiers.</p>
          <p>There happened at that time to be in the tent a certain <lb/>
            centurion whose name was Aglaitadas, an austere sort of man <lb/>
            in his manners,'who spoke thus : " Do you think, Cyrus," said <lb/>
            he, " that these men tell truth in these stories ?" " Why <lb/>
            what end," said Cyrus, "can they have in telling false <lb/>
            hood ? " " What other end," said he, "but to make you laugh ? <lb/>
            For this reason, they tell you these stories like boasters, as <lb/>
            they are." 12. " Speak civilly, pray !" said Cyrus: " and do not <lb/>
            say that these men are boasters ; for the term boaster seems to <lb/>
            me applicable to such as feign themselves richer or braver <lb/>
            than they really are, and undertake to do what they are not <lb/>
            able to do, and evidently show that they act thus with a view <lb/>
            to gaining something and making profit. But why may not <pb n="55"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            those who move their companions to laughter, neither for their <lb/>
            own gain, nor to the hearers' loss, nor for any ill purpose, be more <lb/>
            justly called polite and agreeable than boastful ? " 13. Thus <lb/>
            did Cyrus apologize for such as afforded matter of laughter. <lb/>
            The captain, who had told the pleasant story of the company <lb/>
            of soldiers, then observed, " Assuredly, Aglaitadas, you would <lb/>
            have blamed us most severely if we had endeavoured to make <lb/>
            you weep, (like some who, in songs and discourses, speaking of <lb/>
            certain melancholy subjects, try to move people to tears,) when <lb/>
            you now, though you know that we are desirous to give you <lb/>
            pleasure, and do you no harm, lay us under so much censure !" <lb/>
            14. " By Jove," said Aglaitadas, " I do lay you under censure, <lb/>
            and justly; because he that makes laughter for his friends, <lb/>
            seems to me, frequently, to do them much less service than he <lb/>
            who makes them weep; you will therefore find, if you con­ <lb/>
            sider rightly, that I speak with reason. Fathers, for instance, <lb/>
            instil discretion into their sons, and teachers useful instruc­ <lb/>
            tion into their pupils, by exciting tears; and the laws lead <lb/>
            citizens, by making them weep, to the observance of justice. <lb/>
            But can you say that movers of laughter either do any service <lb/>
            to the bodies of men, or render their minds fitter for the con­ <lb/>
            duct of private or public affairs ?" is. Upon this, Hystaspes <lb/>
            remarked, " Aglaitadas, if you will follow my advice, you will <lb/>
            boldly expend this very valuable commodity upon our enemies, <lb/>
            and endeavour to set them to weep ; but that worthless thing, <lb/>
            laughter, you will by all means spend upon us, your friends <lb/>
            here. I know you have a great deal of it lying by you in <lb/>
            store; for you neither expend it by using it on yourself, nor <lb/>
            do you, willingly at least, bestow it either on your friends <lb/>
            or on strangers; so that you have no pretext for refusing to <lb/>
            communicate it to us." " Do you think then," said Ag­ <lb/>
            laitadas, "to extract laughter out of me ?" "By Jove," ex­ <lb/>
            claimed the centurion, " he would be a fool indeed if he did; <lb/>
            for I believe one may with greater ease strike fire out of you, <lb/>
            than draw laughter from you." 16. At this the others laughed, <lb/>
            knowing the temper of the man; and Aglaitadas himself <lb/>
            smiled ; while Cyrus, seeing him look pleased, said, " Indeed, <lb/>
            centurion, you are wrong to corrupt the most serious man we <lb/>
            have, by tempting him to laugh ; especially when he is so great <lb/>
            an enemy to laughter ! " 17. Such was the conversation that <lb/>
            took place on this subject.</p><pb n="56"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [ B. II. </note>is. Chrysantas then said, "Cyrus, I, and all that are here <lb/>
            present, consider that though, of the men who have come out <lb/>
            with us, some are of greater and some of less merit, yet that, <lb/>
            if any advantage fall to our lot, they will all think themselves <lb/>
            entitled to an equal share of it; but, for my part, I think that <lb/>
            nothing among men can be more unfair, than that the good <lb/>
            and the bad should claim an equal share of benefits." To this <lb/>
            observation Cyrus rejoined, "It would be best, then, by the <lb/>
            gods, my friends, to propose this matter as a subject of debate <lb/>
            to the army, whether it be proper, if the gods give us any <lb/>
            profit from our labours, that we should make all equal sharers <lb/>
            in it; or that, taking into consideration the actions of each, <lb/>
            we should give rewards to each accordingly?" 19. But <lb/>
            why," said Chrysantas, " should you propose this as a subject <lb/>
            of debate, and not announce that you will have it so ? Did you <lb/>
            not thus announce emulation and promotion ?" " But by Jove," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " these matters are not like those; for what the <lb/>
            men may acquire by their service, they will, I conceive, be <lb/>
            apt to regard as their common property; but the command of <lb/>
            the army they naturally allow to be mine, even from the time <lb/>
            when we set out from home ; so that in regulating the grades <lb/>
            of the officers, I believe they do not think that I act at all <lb/>
            wrong." 20. " And do you think," said Chrysantas, " that the <lb/>
            multitude, when assembled, will ever resolve that every one <lb/>
            shall not have an equal share, but that the best shall have <lb/>
            the advantage in honours and profit ? " "I do think so," <lb/>
            said Cyrus ; partly because we shall express our assent to it, <lb/>
            and partly because it is infamous to assert, that he who <lb/>
            labours most for the public, and does it most service, is not to <lb/>
            he thought entitled to the greatest rewards ; and I believe that <lb/>
            it will appear advantageous even to the worst of our men, <lb/>
            that the best should have the advantage."</p>
          <p>21. Cyrus was desirous that such a resolution should be <lb/>
            passed, even for the sake of the Equals-in-honour themselves ; <lb/>
            for he thought that they would be yet better men, if they <lb/>
            knew that they themselves would be judged by their actions, <lb/>
            and rewarded accordingly. This, therefore, seemed to him to <lb/>
            be the proper opportunity to put the subject to the vote, <lb/>
            whilst the Equals-in-honour were dissatisfied with the claim <lb/>
            of the multitude to equality of shares. It was therefore <lb/>
            thought right by those in the tent to propose a discussion of <pb n="57"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            the subject; and they said, that every one who thought it <lb/>
            his part to act like a man ought to assist in settling the <lb/>
            question. 22. Upon this one of the centurions said with a <lb/>
            laugh, "I know a man, one of the common soldiers, who <lb/>
            will agree with us, that this equality of shares, without dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, ought not to be." Another asked him, " Whom he <lb/>
            meant ? " He replied, " Truly, he is one of my own tent, who <lb/>
            is, on every occasion, seeking to get the advantage of others." <lb/>
            Another then asked, " What! in labours ? " " No, by Jove ! " <lb/>
            said lie; " here I have been caught in a falsehood; for, in <lb/>
            labour and everything of that kind, he very contentedly allows <lb/>
            any one to get the advantage of him that will."</p>
          <p>23. " Friends," said Cyrus, " my judgment is, that such men <lb/>
            as our friend here mentions, ought to be removed from the <lb/>
            army, if we intend to keep it vigorous and obedient. For the <lb/>
            greater part of the soldiers appear to me to be such as will <lb/>
            follow whither any one shall lead them ; honourable and good <lb/>
            men certainly endeavour to lead to what is honourable and <lb/>
            good; but vicious men to what is vicious; 24. and corrupt <lb/>
            men have often more abettors than the well-disposed ; for vice, <lb/>
            that pursues its course amidst present pleasures, has these <lb/>
            pleasures to persuade the multitude to favour her; but virtue, <lb/>
            that leads along an arduous path, has not power sufficient <lb/>
            for the present, to draw men at once1 after her, especially if <lb/>
            there are others, in opposition to her, inviting them to follow <lb/>
            the prone and easy track. 25. Accordingly, when men are <lb/>
            vicious from sloth and indolence, I regard them, like drones, as <lb/>
            injuring their companions only in the expense of maintaining <lb/>
            them ; but those who are unfair sharers in labour, but forward <lb/>
            and shameless in taking advantage of others, lead men to vici­ <lb/>
            ous practices ; for they can often show vice to be successful <lb/>
            in gaining advantages ; so that such men must be entirely re­ <lb/>
            moved from among us. 26. Nor must you think of filling up <lb/>
            your companies only from your own countrymen ; but as, in <lb/>
            selecting horses, you look for those that are the best, and not <lb/>
            for those that are of your own country, so you must choose, <lb/>
            from among men of all kinds, such as seem most likely to add <lb/>
            to your strength, and do you honour. That such a course will <lb/>
            be for our advantage, I have these examples to bear me testis <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰκὴ̨</foreign>. ] 'Ev <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῳ̃ παραυτἰκα εἰκῃ̃</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">οΰτως ἐξαίφυης</foreign> <lb/>

            tached to it, nor can it be fit for work,.if vicious ones be <lb/>
            yoked to it; nor can a house be well regulated that has bad <lb/>
            servants ; it even takes less harm by being left without serv­ <lb/>
            ants, than by being disordered by dishonest ones. 27. And <lb/>
            be assured, my friends, that the removal of the vicious will <lb/>
            not only be of advantage to you inasmuch as they will be <lb/>
            out of the way, but, of those that remain, they who have been <lb/>
            imbued with vice will free themselves from it again; and the <lb/>
            good, seeing the vicious dishonoured, will adhere to rectitude <lb/>
            with much more earnestness." 28. Thus spoke Cyrus, and <lb/>
            all his friends agreed with him in opinion, and acted accord­ <lb/>
            ingly.</p>
          <p>After this, Cyrus began again to jest with them ; for, ob­ <lb/>
            serving that one of the captains had made a man excessively <lb/>
            rough and ugly his guest and companion at table, he called the <lb/>
            captain to him by name, and spoke to him thus : " Sambaulas, <lb/>
            do you take that young man that sits next you, about with <lb/>
            you, according to the Greek custom, because he is handsome ? " <lb/>
            No, by Jove," said Sambaulas; " and yet I am pleased <lb/>
            with his conversation, and even with looking at him." 29. <lb/>
            They that were in the tent, upon hearing this remark, looked <lb/>
            at the man, and, seeing that his face was exceedingly ugly, <lb/>
            all began to laugh ; and one of them said, " In the name of <lb/>
            all the gods, Sambaulas, by what service has this man so at­ <lb/>
            tached himself to you ? " 30. He said, " By Jove, friends, I <lb/>
            will tell you ; whenever I have called upon him, either bj <lb/>
            night or by day, he never pretended want of leisure, never <lb/>
            obeyed lazily, but always with the utmost despatch ; whenever <lb/>
            I have ordered him to do a thing, I never saw him execute it <lb/>
            without activity; and he has made the whole twelve1 such as <lb/>
            himself, not showing them in word, but in action, what sort <lb/>
            of men they ought to be." 31. Somebody then said, "And, <lb/>
            being such as he is, do not you kiss him as people kiss rela­ <lb/>
            tions ? " Here the ugly-looking soldier interposed, " No, by <lb/>
            Jove, for he is not fond of making great efforts; and if he <lb/>
            were to kiss me, it would be equivalent to the greatest efforts." 2 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὺς δεκαδέας πάντας</foreign>. ] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκὰς</foreign> is supposed to have consisted <lb/>

          <p>Discussion concerning the distribution of the spoil. It is decided that the <lb/>
            most deserving shall receive the largest share. Cyrus entertains whole <lb/>
            companies of soldiers in his tent, to do honour to them for their merit in <lb/>
            their exercises.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH kind of things, both merry and serious, were said <lb/>
            and done in the tent. At last, having performed the third <lb/>
            libation,1 and prayed to the gods for blessings, they separated <lb/>
            and went to rest.</p>
          <p>2. The next day, Cyrus assembled all the soldiers, and <lb/>
            spoke to them to this effect: "Friends, the conflict is at <lb/>
            hand; for the enemies are approaching ; the prizes of victory, <lb/>
            if we conquer, (for this we ought to say and suppose,2) are <lb/>
            evidently our enemies themselves, and their possessions ; and <lb/>
            so, on the other hand, if we are conquered, the property of the <lb/>
            conquered stands exposed as the reward of the conquerors. <lb/>
            3. Thus then," said he, " you must consider that, if when men <lb/>
            are united as associates in war, they have each this feeling in <lb/>
            their breasts, that nothing will be as it ought to be, unless <lb/>
            each individually act with resolution, they readily accomplish <lb/>
            many honourable achievements ; for nothing that ought to be <lb/>
            done is then neglected. But when every one imagines that <lb/>
            there will be another to act and fight, though he himself be <lb/>
            remiss, be assured," said he, " that on such men all kinds of <lb/>
            difficulties fall at once. 4. The gods themselves have so or­ <lb/>
            dered the course of things; to those who will not impose <lb/>
            upon themselves the task of labouring for their own ad­ <lb/>
            vantage, they give other task-masters. Now, therefore," said <lb/>
            he, " let some one stand up, and give his opinion on this <lb/>
            point; whether he think that virtue will be the better prac­ <lb/>

            all to have an equal share ? "</p>
          <p>5. Here Chrysantas, one of the Equals-in-honour, a man <lb/>
            neither tall nor strong in appearance, but of excellent under­ <lb/>
            standing, rose up and spoke: " I cannot but think, Cyrus," said <lb/>
            he, " that you do not propose this subject for our debate, as <lb/>
            intending that the worthless should have equal advantages <lb/>
            with the deserving, but as desiring to ascertain whether there <lb/>
            be a man amongst its that will venture to declare himself <lb/>
            of opinion, that though he perform nothing honourable or <lb/>
            serviceable, he ought to have an equal share of what is gained <lb/>
            by the bravery of others, 6. I am myself," said he, "neither <lb/>
            swift of foot nor strong of arm ; and, from what I can per­ <lb/>
            form in my own person, I am sure that I cannot be judged to <lb/>
            be the first man, nor yet the second, and I suppose not the <lb/>
            thousandth, perhaps not the ten thousandth ; but of this I am <lb/>
            certain, that if those who are men of strength set themselves <lb/>
            vigorously to work, I shall have such a share in some ad­ <lb/>
            vantage or other, as is justly due to me ; but if worthless men <lb/>
            shall do nothing, and men of bravery and vigour shall be quite <lb/>
            out of heart, I am afraid that I shall have a greater share <lb/>
            than I desire of something else rather than advantage." 7. <lb/>
            Thus spoke Chrysantas.</p>
          <p>After him stood up Pheraulas, a Persian, one of the com­ <lb/>
            mon people ; a man intimately known to Cyrus, and greatly <lb/>
            in his favour whilst they were yet in Persia, one who was not <lb/>
            uncomely in person, and in mind not at all like a man of low <lb/>
            birth; and he spoke to this effect: s. " 0 Cyrus," said he, <lb/>
            "and all ye Persians here present, I consider that we are all <lb/>
            now proceeding to contend with each other in merit on an <lb/>
            equal footing ; for I see that we all exercise our bodies on like <lb/>
            food ; that we are all deemed worthy of like society ; and that <lb/>
            the same honours are set before all of us ; for obedience to our <lb/>
            commanders is enjoined upon us in common, and I observe <lb/>
            that whoever is found sincerely to practise it, obtains honour <lb/>
            at the hands of Cyrus ; while to act with bravery against the <lb/>
            enemy is not a thing belonging to one, and not to another, <lb/>
            but stands recommended as most honourable to us all. 9. A <lb/>
            mode of fighting,1 too, is now plainly taught us, which I see <note type="footnote"> 1 Namely, of defending ourselves, and assailing our enemies, </note> <pb n="61"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            indeed that all men naturally know ; as all other animals know <lb/>
            some method of fight, and without having learned it from any­ <lb/>
            thing else but nature ; as the bull to attack with his horn, the <lb/>
            horse with his hoof, the dog with his mouth, the boar with <lb/>
            his tooth ; and all of them know," continued he, " from what <lb/>
            animals it is most necessary for them to defend themselves, <lb/>
            although they have never had recourse to any teacher. 10. ] <lb/>
            understood, even from my childhood, how to hold out some­ <lb/>
            thing before that part of my body on which I thought that I <lb/>
            should be struck ; and, if I had nothing else, I endeavoured, <lb/>
            as well as I was able, by holding out my hands, to obstruct <lb/>
            the person that sought to strike me ; and this I did not only <lb/>
            without being taught, but even though I were beaten for <lb/>
            holding out anything before me. When I was a child, wherever <lb/>
            I saw a sword, I presently seized it; nor was I taught how <lb/>
            to take hold of it by anything else than by nature. This, <lb/>
            therefore, I did, not only untaught, but even when hindered ; <lb/>
            as there are many other things which, though checked in <lb/>
            them both by my father and mother, I was necessarily <lb/>
            prompted by nature to do. Then, by Jove, I hacked with <lb/>
            my sword whatever I could hack secretly ; for it was not only <lb/>
            natural to me, like walking and running, but, besides its being <lb/>
            natural, I thought it a pleasure to do it. 11. Since, therefore," <lb/>
            added he, " this kind of fighting1 is now assigned us, in which <lb/>
            there is employment for courage rather than art, how can we <lb/>
            contend otherwise than with pleasure against these noble per­ <lb/>
            sons the Equals-in-honour, when the rewards of merit lie <lb/>
            equally before us, and when we do not go to the trial with equal <lb/>
            risk ? For they have at stake a life of honour, which is the <lb/>
            only truly pleasant life ; we only a laborious and ignoble one, <lb/>
            which, I think, is one of unhappiness. 12. It greatly animates <lb/>
            me, too, my friends, to enter the lists against these men, that <lb/>
            Cyrus is to be our judge ; a man who judges not partially and <lb/>
            invidiously; but I aver, and swear by the gods, that Cyrus <lb/>
            certainly seems to me to love those that he finds deserving <lb/>
            not less than he loves himself. Accordingly, I observe that <lb/>
            he bestows what he has upon such men, with more pleasure <lb/>
            than he takes in keeping it himself. 13. However," continued <note type="footnote">with those weapons which are put into our hands, as bulls use their <lb/>
            horns, &amp; c. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 See note on sect. 9. </note> <pb n="62"/>

            lie, " I observe that these men are greatly elevated with hav­ <lb/>
            ing been disciplined to bear hunger, thirst, and cold ; not <lb/>
            knowing that we have been disciplined to endure the same <lb/>
            things, under a much abler teacher than they have been; for <lb/>
            there is no more effectual teacher of such matters than neces­ <lb/>
            sity, which has taught us to understand them fully. 14. They <lb/>
            have exercised themselves in the labour of bearing arms, which <lb/>
            have been so contrived by all men as to be borne with the <lb/>
            greatest ease; but we," added he, "have been obliged, by <lb/>
            necessity, to walk and run under heavy burdens; so that the <lb/>
            weight of the arms which we now bear seems to. me rather <lb/>
            like the lightness of wings than a burden. 15. Consider, there­ <lb/>
            fore," said he, " 0 Cyrus, that I shall both heartily engage in <lb/>
            this struggle, and that I shall think it sufficient, whatever <lb/>
            character I may acquire, if you reward me according to my <lb/>
            merit. And I exhort you, my friends of the people, to exert <lb/>
            yourselves in this military contention, against these men of dis­ <lb/>
            cipline ; for they are now involved in this popular dispute." <lb/>
            16. Thus spoke Pheraulas ; and many others stood up to sup­ <lb/>
            port them both in their opinion. It was thought fit, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that every one should be rewarded according to his <lb/>
            desert, and that Cyrus should be the judge. Thus were these <lb/>
            matters brought to a decision.</p>
          <p>IT. Cyrus, on one occasion, invited an entire company, to­ <lb/>
            gether with their centurion, to sup with him. This invitation <lb/>
            he gave him, from having seen him forming half the men of <lb/>
            his company against the other half,1 in order to attack each <lb/>
            other; both parties having their corslets on, and their shields <lb/>
            in their left hands; but to one half he had given thick sticks <lb/>
            in their right hands, and the others he had ordered to pick up <lb/>
            clods of earth to throw. is. When they stood thus ready <lb/>
            prepared, he gave them a signal to engage; when some of <lb/>
            those who threw the clods hit the corslets or shields of the <lb/>
            opposite party, others their thighs or legs; but when they <lb/>
            came to close quarters, they who had the sticks applied their <lb/>
            blows to the thighs of some, the hands and legs of others, and <lb/>
            the necks and backs of such as were stooping for clods; and, <lb/>
            at last, those that had the sticks put the others to the rout, and <lb/>
            pursued them, laying on their blows with much laughter and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έκατέϱωϑεν</foreign>. ] " On each side," placing one half on one side <lb/>
            and the other half on the other, face to face. </note> <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            diversion. Then the others, in their turn, taking the sticks, <lb/>
            assailed in the same manner their opponents, who took their <lb/>
            turn in throwing the clods. 19. Cyrus was much struck with <lb/>
            these proceedings, with the contrivance of the officer, and the <lb/>
            obedience of the men, and was glad that they were at the <lb/>
            same time both exercised and diverted, and that those men <lb/>
            gained the victory who were armed in a manner like that <lb/>
            of the Persians. Being delighted, therefore, at their ex. <lb/>
            ercise, he invited them to supper; and observing some of <lb/>
            them with their shins and some with their hands tied up, he <lb/>
            asked them what had happened to them. 20. They replied <lb/>
            that they had been struck with the clods of earth. He then <lb/>
            asked them again, whether they were hit when they were <lb/>
            close together, or while they were at a distance. They said, <lb/>
            while they were at a distance; but those who had the sticks <lb/>
            said that, when they closed, it was the finest sport imaginable ; <lb/>
            while those who had been wounded by the sticks cried out that <lb/>
            it seemed no sport to them to be thrashed in such close en­ <lb/>
            counter. They showed the blows at the same time that they <lb/>
            had received from the sticks, both upon their hands and <lb/>
            necks, and some in their faces ; and then, as was natural, they <lb/>
            laughed at one another. The next day, the whole field was <lb/>
            full of soldiers imitating this company; and, whenever they <lb/>
            had nothing more serious to do, they applied themselves to <lb/>
            this diversion.</p>
          <p>21. Cyrus, observing another centurion, on a certain occa­ <lb/>
            sion, leading his men from the river, one by one, away to the <lb/>
            left; and, when he thought proper, ordering the last twenty- <lb/>
            five to advance to the front, then the third, and then the <lb/>
            fourth; and, when the captains of twenty-five were all in <lb/>
            front, ordering each twenty-five to double their files, upon <lb/>
            which the captains of tens advanced in front; and also, when <lb/>
            he thought proper, ordering each twenty-five to form four <lb/>
            deep, when the captains of five advanced to the head of the <lb/>
            men four deep ; and, when they arrived at the door of the <lb/>
            tent, ordering them to enter, one by one, he first led in the <lb/>
            first company, directing the second to follow in their rear, and <lb/>
            the third and fourth in like manner, and so led them all in ; <lb/>
            and introducing them in this manner, he made them all <lb/>
            sit down to dinner in the order in which they entered ; he so <lb/>
            much admired the mildness of the man's discipline and his <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II </note> <lb/>
            care, that he invited the whole company, together with the <lb/>
            centurion, to sup with him. 22. But another captain, who <lb/>
            was present at the dinner, said, " My company, Cyrus, you do <lb/>
            not invite to your tent; yet, when they go to dinner, they <lb/>
            perform all these manoeuvres; and, when the business in the <lb/>
            tent is over, the rear leader of the last twenty-five leads out <lb/>
            that twenty-five, keeping those in the rear who are ranged <lb/>
            in front when in order of battle ; then the rear leader of <lb/>
            the next twenty-five follows after these; and the third and <lb/>
            fourth in the same manner; in order that, when it is proper <lb/>
            to lead off from the enemy, they may know how to re­ <lb/>
            treat. And when we draw up in the course where we exer­ <lb/>
            cise, when we march to the east, I lead the way, and the first <lb/>
            twenty-five moves first, the second in order, and the third and <lb/>
            fourth, and the tens and fives of the several companies, until <lb/>
            I give orders to the contrary ; but," said he, "when we march <lb/>
            to the west, the rear leader, and the last men, lead the way in <lb/>
            front, and yet obey me who march in the rear, so that they <lb/>
            may be accustomed both to follow and to lead with equal <lb/>
            obedience." 23. " And do you always do thus ?" said Cyrus. <lb/>
            " As often," said he, " as we take our meals." " I will invite <lb/>
            you, then," said he, " because you practise your exercise <lb/>
            both in advancing and retiring, both by day and by night, <lb/>
            and both exercise your bodies by marching, and benefit your <lb/>
            minds by the discipline. And since you do in everything <lb/>
            twice as much as others, it is but just that I should give you <lb/>
            double entertainment." 24. " By Jove," said the centurion, <lb/>
            " not in one day, unless you also give us double stomachs." <lb/>
            Thus they made an end of that conversation in the tent. The <lb/>
            next day Cyrus invited this company, as he had said that <lb/>
            he would, and also on the day following. The rest of the <lb/>
            soldiers, perceiving this, all imitated that company for the <lb/>
            future.</p><pb n="65"/>

          <p>An embassy to Cyaxares from the Indians. The answer given to it. Cy­ <lb/>
            rus persuades Cyaxares to oblige the king of Armenia, who had revolted, <lb/>
            to return to his allegiance. Cyrus proceeds with a body of troops to make <lb/>
            an attack on him, under the disguise of a hunting expedition.</p>
          <p>1. As Cyrus, upon a certain occasion, was making a ge­ <lb/>
            neral review and muster of his men under arms, there came a <lb/>
            messenger from Cyaxares, acquainting him, that an embassy <lb/>
            from the Indians1 had arrived. " Cyaxares, therefore," said <lb/>
            the messenger, " desires that you would come as soon as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, and I bring you from him a beautiful robe; for he <lb/>
            wishes that you should present your men in the handsomest <lb/>
            and most splendid dress, as the Indians will see how you make <lb/>
            your approach." 2. Cyrus, hearing this, gave command to <lb/>
            the centurion who stood first in order, to place himself in <lb/>
            front, bringing up his men in single file behind him, and keep­ <lb/>
            ing himself on the right. He ordered him to deliver <lb/>
            the same directions to the second, and thus to transmit them <lb/>
            along through the whole number. The officers, in obedience <lb/>
            to Cyrus, soon communicated the orders, and soon put them <lb/>
            in execution. In a very little time, they formed a front of <lb/>
            three hundred, for that was the number of the centurions, and <lb/>
            the men were a hundred in depth. 3. When they had placed <lb/>
            themselves thus, he commanded them to follow as he should <lb/>
            lead them, and immediately led them on at a quick pace. <lb/>
            But when he found that the avenue, which led to the palace, <lb/>
            was too narrow to allow all those in front to move on as they <lb/>
            were, he commanded the first thousand to follow in their pre­ <lb/>
            sent order, and the next thousand to follow in their rear, and <lb/>
            so throughout the whole, and he himself led on without stop­ <note type="footnote">"Many commentators, and among them Hutchinson, have thought <lb/>
            that these Indians dwelt in a part of Colchis, which the Æthiopians, <lb/>
            oftener called Indians, inhabited. But the manners and wealth, <lb/>
            which Xenophon attributes to them, leave us little room to doubt <lb/>
            that he meant that people who, in the age of Darius, were either <lb/>
            subject to the Persians, or at least attached to them by some bond <lb/>
            of alliance, and who inhabited the northern parts of India bordering <lb/>
            on the Bactrians; a people whom Alexander, at a later period, at­ <lb/>
            tempted to subdue. See Heeren, Ideen, T. i. P. i. p. 337, seqq.; Sainte <lb/>

            ping, while the other thousands followed, each in the rear of <lb/>
            that which went before. 4. He sent also two officers to the <lb/>
            opening of the avenue, in order that, if any should be at a loss, <lb/>
            they might tell them what they were to do. When they came <lb/>
            to the gate of Cyaxares, he commanded the first centurion to <lb/>
            form his company twelve in depth, and to range the captains <lb/>
            of twelve in front around the palace ; he directed him likewise <lb/>
            to transmit these orders to the second, and so throughout the <lb/>
            whole army. 5. These manoeuvres the soldiers executed; <lb/>
            and he himself went in to Cyaxares, in a Persian robe, void <lb/>
            of all ostentation. Cyaxares, when he saw him, showed <lb/>
            pleasure at his expedition, but testified dissatisfaction at the <lb/>
            plainness of his dress, and said, " Why is this, Cyrus ? what <lb/>
            have you done in appearing thus before the Indians ? I wished <lb/>
            you," said he, " to appear as splendid as possible; for it would <lb/>
            have been an honour to me, for you, who are my sister's son, <lb/>
            to have appeared with the utmost magnificence." 6. To this <lb/>
            remark Cyrus replied, " In which way, Cyaxares, should I <lb/>
            have honoured you most, whether if, clothing myself with a <lb/>
            purple robe, putting on bracelets, and encircling my neck with <lb/>
            a collar, I had obeyed you but slowly, or whether when I now <lb/>
            obey you with such despatch, at the head of so numerous and <lb/>
            efficient a force, and distinguish myself, for the purpose of <lb/>
            honouring you, by such exertion and haste on my own part, <lb/>
            and exhibit others so ready to obey you ?"</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Cyrus. Cyaxares, judging that he spoke rea­ <lb/>
            sonably, gave orders to introduce the Indians. 7. The In­ <lb/>
            dians, having come in, said, " That the king of the Indians <lb/>
            had sent them, and had commanded them to ask, from what <lb/>
            cause the war had arisen between the Medes and Assyrians ? <lb/>
            and he has desired us," added they, "when we have heard your <lb/>
            answer, to go to the Assyrian king and ask him the same <lb/>
            question; and, in the end, to tell you both, that the king of <lb/>
            the Indians declares, that, after having ascertained what is <lb/>
            right, he will take the side of the injured party." 8. Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares to this said, "Hear then, from me, that. we do no injury <lb/>
            to the king of the Assyrians; and now go and inquire of him <lb/>
            what he says." Cyrus, who stood by, asked Cyaxares, " May <lb/>
            I," said he, "say what I think?" Cyaxares bid him do so. <lb/>
            " Give the king of the Indians this message, then," said he, <lb/>
            (unless Cyaxares disapprove,) that, if the Assyrian say he has <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4. ] </note> <lb/>
            been in any way injured by us, we declare that we choose <lb/>
            the king of the Indians himself to be arbitrator between us." <lb/>
            The ambassadors, on hearing this, went their way.</p>
          <p>9. When the Indians were gone, Cyrus commenced an <lb/>
            address to Cyaxares, to this effect: " I came from home, Cy­ <lb/>
            axares, without having much money of my own ; and, what­ <lb/>
            ever I had, I have but very little of it left; for I have spent <lb/>
            it," said he, "- upon the soldiers. Perhaps you wonder how <lb/>
            I have spent it on them, when it is you that maintain them. But <lb/>
            be assured," said he, "that I have employed it in nothing else <lb/>
            but in bestowing rewards and gratuities whenever I have been <lb/>
            pleased with any of the soldiers. 10. For it appears to me," <lb/>
            said he, "much more agreeable to incite all those whom <lb/>
            a man wishes to make serviceable co-operators in any busi­ <lb/>
            ness, of whatever kind it be, by using fair words, and <lb/>
            doing them good, than by trying severe treatment and force. <lb/>
            But those that a person would render zealous fellow-labourers <lb/>
            in the business of war, I think that he must absolutely <lb/>
            court to it both by words and deeds; for such as are to be <lb/>
            sincere fellow-combatants, who shall neither envy the good <lb/>
            fortune of their commander, nor betray him in adversity, ought <lb/>
            to be friends, and not enemies. 11. Having determined thus <lb/>
            with myself on these points, I think myself in want of money. <lb/>
            Yet to look to you upon every occasion, whom I see already <lb/>
            involved in great expenses, appears to me unreasonable. But <lb/>
            I think that you and I should consider jointly by what means <lb/>
            money may be prevented from failing you ; for, if you have <lb/>
            plenty, I know that I may take it whenever I have need; <lb/>
            especially if I take for such a purpose as, when the money is <lb/>
            spent upon it, will be for your advantage. 12. I remember, <lb/>
            therefore, having lately heard you say, that the king of Armenia <lb/>
            now contemns you, because he hears that the enemy is coming <lb/>
            upon us, and neither sends you forces, nor renders you the <lb/>
            tribute that he ought to pay." "Indeed, Cyrus," said he, <lb/>
            "he is acting thus, so that I am in doubt whether it would <lb/>
            be better for me to make war upon him, and force him to <lb/>
            compliance, or whether it would be for our interest to let him <lb/>
            alone for the present, lest we add him to the number of our <lb/>
            enemies." Cyrus then asked, 13. "Are his habitations in <lb/>
            places of strength, or in such as are accessible with ease ?" <lb/>
            Cyaxares replied, " Their habitations are in places that are <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. II. </note> <lb/>
            Tot very strong, for I have not been inattentive in that par­ <lb/>
            ticular ; 1 but there are mountains to which he may retire, <lb/>
            and be in safety for a time, so that neither he, nor any­ <lb/>
            thing that he may carry off thither, may fall into our hands, <lb/>
            unless we sit down and besiege him there, as my father once <lb/>
            did." 14. Cyrus then said, "But, if you will send me, as­ <lb/>
            signing me such a number of horse as may appear sufficient, <lb/>
            I think that, with the assistance of the gods, I can make him <lb/>
            send you forces, and pay you the tribute. Besides. I have <lb/>
            hopes that he will be made more our friend than he is at pre­ <lb/>
            sent." 15. " And I have hopes," said Cyaxares, " that they <lb/>
            will sooner come to you than to me; for I have heard, that <lb/>
            some of his children were your companions in hunting; so <lb/>
            that, perhaps, they may join you again ; and if they once fall <lb/>
            into our power, everything may be settled as we wish." " Do <lb/>
            you not think then," said Cyrus, " that it will be for our ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to keep it secret that we are forming any such plan ?" <lb/>
            " Yes," said Cyaxares, " for by this means some or other of <lb/>
            them may come into our hands; or if any force should fall <lb/>
            upon them, they may be taken unprepared." 16. "Listen then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " whether what I am going to say be of any mo­ <lb/>
            ment : I have often hunted upon the borders of your territory <lb/>
            and that of the Armenians, with all those that were of my com­ <lb/>
            pany ; and I used to go thither also with several horsemen from <lb/>
            among my companions here." " By acting in a similar man­ <lb/>
            ner now, therefore," said Cyaxares, " you may escape sus­ <lb/>
            picion ; but if the force should appear much greater than that <lb/>
            with which you used to hunt, it would soon give rise to sus­ <lb/>
            picion." 17. " But it is possible," said Cyrus, " to frame a very <lb/>
            plausible pretence among ourselves; and if somebody should <lb/>
            carry a report thither, that I intend to undertake a great hunt­ <lb/>
            in- match, then," added he, " I might openly request of you a <lb/>
            body of horse." " You say very well," said Cyaxares, " but I <lb/>
            shall consent to give you but a very moderate number, as I in­ <lb/>
            tend to march myself to our garrisons that lie towards Assyria ; <lb/>
            and indeed," added he, "I want to go thither, to make them as <lb/>
            strong as possible. But when you have gone before with the <lb/>
            force which you will have, and have hunted for about two <lb/>
            days, I can send you a sufficient reinforcement, both of horse <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, I did not allow them to build strong fortresses. See <lb/>
            iii. 1. 10, </note> <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4. ] </note> <lb/>
            and foot, out of those that have been assembled under me; <lb/>
            with this you may at once set forward, and I, with the other <lb/>
            forces, will endeavour to keep not far from you, that, if there <lb/>
            be occasion, I may make my appearance."</p>
          <p>is. Cyaxares accordingly soon collected horse and foot for <lb/>
            the garrisons, and sent on waggons with provisions by <lb/>
            the road that led to them. Cyrus offered a sacrifice with <lb/>
            reference to the march; and; at the same time, sent to Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, and asked him for some of the younger horse-soldiers. <lb/>
            Cyaxares, though there were multitudes that would have at­ <lb/>
            tended Cyrus, granted him but a small number. After <lb/>
            Cyaxares had set forward, with a force of infantry and cavalry, <lb/>
            on the road towards the garrisons, the omens proved favour­ <lb/>
            able to Cyrus for marching against the Armenian ; and he <lb/>
            accordingly set out prepared as for a hunting expedition. 19. <lb/>
            As he was pursuing his journey, a hare started in the very <lb/>
            first field, and an eagle of favourable omen, 1 flying towards <lb/>
            them, caught sight of the hare as it ran, and, bearing down <lb/>
            upon it, struck it, snatched it up, and carried it into the air, <lb/>
            and taking it away to an eminence not far off, did there what <lb/>
            it thought fit with its prize. Cyrus, therefore, on seeing this <lb/>
            omen, was delighted, and paid his adoration to Jupiter, sove­ <lb/>
            reign of the gods, saying to those that were with him, <lb/>
            " Friends, our hunt, if the gods please, will be a noble one !"</p>
          <p>20. When he came to the borders, he immediately pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to hunt after his usual manner. The greater number <lb/>
            of his infantry and cavalry went in a line before him, in order <lb/>
            to rouse the beasts as they came upon them. But the best of <lb/>
            his men, both horse and foot, stood here and there dispersed, <lb/>
            awaited the beasts as they were roused, and pursued them. <lb/>
            They took a large number both of boars, stags, antelopes, and <lb/>
            wild asses; for there are abundance of wild asses in those <lb/>
            parts even to this day. 21. When he had left off hunting, he <lb/>
            went close up to the Armenian borders, and took supper there. <lb/>
            The next day he hunted again, advancing to those mountains <lb/>
            of which he desired to get possession. When he had again <lb/>
            ended his sport, he went to supper; but, as he found that <lb/>
            the forces from Cyaxares were advancing, he sent privately to <lb/>
            them, and desired them to take their supper about the distance <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἴσιος</foreign>, L e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεξιός</foreign>. Compare ii. 1. 1. </note> <pb n="70"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II </note> <lb/>
            of two parasangs from him, foreseeing that this would coil. <lb/>
            tribute to the concealment of his design. When they had <lb/>
            supped, he told their commander to join him. After supper, <lb/>
            he summoned the centurions to him,and, as soon as they were <lb/>
            come, spoke to them thus:</p>
          <p>22. " Friends, the Armenian has been hitherto both an ally <lb/>
            and subject of Cyaxares; but now, as he finds that enemies are <lb/>
            coming upon him, he contemns him, and neither sends him <lb/>
            forces nor pays him tribute. It is he, therefore, that we are <lb/>
            come to hunt, if we can. We must accordingly, as it appears <lb/>
            to me, proceed in the following manner. You, Chrysantas, <lb/>
            when you have slept a sufficient time, take half the Persians <lb/>
            that are with us, pursue your way up the hill, and secure <lb/>
            those mountains, to which, they say, the Armenian flees when <lb/>
            he fears any danger; and I will give you guides. 23. They <lb/>
            say these mountains arc covered with wood, so that it is to be <lb/>
            hoped you will not be observed. However, if you send, be­ <lb/>
            fore the rest of your force, some active men, who, both by <lb/>
            their number and equipments, may look like marauders, <lb/>
            they, if they meet with any of the Armenians, may prevent <lb/>
            such as they can take from carrying intelligence ; and, fright­ <lb/>
            ening away such as they cannot take, may hinder them from <lb/>
            seeing the whole army, and make them take measures only <lb/>
            as against a band of robbers. 24. You, then," said he, " do <lb/>
            thus : I, at break of day, with half the foot, and all the horse, <lb/>
            will proceed through the plain straight to the palace. If he <lb/>
            oppose us, it is plain that we must fight; but if he retire from <lb/>
            the plain, it is evident that we must hasten in pursuit of him. <lb/>
            If he flee to the mountains, it must then," said he, " be your <lb/>
            care to allow none of those that come towards you to escape <lb/>
            you ; but to consider, as in hunting, that we are the finders, <lb/>
            and that you are the person standing at the nets. 25. Re­ <lb/>
            member, therefore, that the passages must be stopped before <lb/>
            the prey is roused; and that those who are stationed at the <lb/>
            outlets must conceal themselves, if they do not wish to turn <lb/>
            back the animals coming towards them. 26. Do not however <lb/>
            act," said he, " Chrysantas, as you have sometimes acted from <lb/>
            your fondness for hunting ; for you sometimes occupy yourself <lb/>
            the whole night without sleeping ; but you must now allow <lb/>
            your men to take a moderate portion of rest, that they may be <lb/>
            able to resist drowsiness. 27 And do not, because you used <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            to wander through the mountains without taking men for <lb/>
            your guides, but pursued wherever the beasts led the way, <lb/>
            march now through such difficult places, but bid your guides <lb/>
            lead you the easiest way, unless there be one that is much <lb/>
            shorter; for, to an army, the easiest way is the most expe­ <lb/>
            ditious. 28. Nor, because you can run over the mountains, <lb/>
            lead on now at full speed; but proceed only at a moderate <lb/>
            pace, so that the army may be able to follow you. 29. It <lb/>
            will be expedient, too, that some of the most vigorous and <lb/>
            spirited should halt sometimes, and encourage the rest; and <lb/>
            when the whole wing has passed, it animates them all to speed, <lb/>
            to see the others running by them as they themselves move on <lb/>
            at a walking pace."</p>
          <p>30. Chrysantas, hearing this, and being proud of the orders <lb/>
            that Cyrus had given him, took his guides, and went his way ; <lb/>
            and then, having given the proper directions to those that <lb/>
            were to attend him in his march, betook himself to rest. When <lb/>
            they had slept as long as he thought sufficient, he proceeded <lb/>
            towards the mountains.</p>
          <p>31. Cyrus, as soon as it was day, despatched an envoy to <lb/>
            the Armenian, ordering him to deliver this message : " Prince <lb/>
            of Armenia, Cyrus desires you to order matters so that you <lb/>
            may come and bring, as soon as possible, the tribute and the <lb/>
            forces." " If he asks you," added he, " where I am, tell him <lb/>
            the truth, that I am upon the borders. If he ask whether I <lb/>
            am advancing towards him, tell him the truth on this point <lb/>
            also, that you do not know. If he inquire how many we are, <lb/>
            bid him send somebody back with you to ascertain. ' 32. <lb/>
            After giving the messenger these orders, he sent him off, <lb/>
            thinking it more friendly to act thus than to march upon <lb/>
            him without previous notice. Having then arranged his <lb/>
            men in the best order, both for speedily accomplishing the <lb/>
            march, and for fighting, if it should be necessary, he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded on his way. He also gave orders to his men to injure <lb/>
            no one; and, if any of them met with an Armenian, to bid <lb/>
            him be of good cheer ; and to tell every one, that had a mind, <lb/>
            to bring them provisions for sale, wherever they might be. <lb/>
            whether he desired to sell meat or drink.</p><pb n="72"/>

          <p>The Armenian king and his family are made prisoners. Cyrus brings him <lb/>
            to trial, for his breach of faith, in the presence of his officers. He is par­ <lb/>
            tially defended by his son Tigranes. As the king confesses his guilt, and <lb/>
            makes unconditional submission, Cyrus restores to him his family, and re­ <lb/>
            ceives him into favour. The generosity and magnanimity of Cyrus <lb/>
            highly extolled by the Armenians.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS attended to these arrangements. The Armenian, <lb/>
            as soon as he heard from the envoy the message from Cyrus, <lb/>
            was alarmed at it, being conscious that he had acted unjustly, <lb/>
            both in failing to pay the tribute, and in not sending the <lb/>
            troops. But he dreaded most of all that he should be dis­ <lb/>
            covered to have begun fortifying his place of residence, so as to <lb/>
            be able to offer resistance. 2. Being in perplexity on all these <lb/>
            accounts, lie sent round to assemble his forces, and despatched, <lb/>
            at the same time, his younger son Sabaris, his own wife, his <lb/>
            son's wife, and his daughters, to the mountains, sending with <lb/>
            them all his most valuable apparel and furniture, and appoint­ <lb/>
            ing a force to conduct them. He also sent out scouts to dis­ <lb/>
            cover what Cyrus was doing, and mustered such of the <lb/>
            Armenians as he had with him. Soon after there arrived <lb/>
            others, -who told him that Cyrus in person was close at hand ; <lb/>
            when he no longer felt bold enough to come to an engagement, <lb/>
            but retreated.</p>
          <p>3. The Armenians, when they saw him act in this manner, <lb/>
            ran every one to their own homes, with intent to put all their <lb/>
            property out of the way. Cyrus, seeing the whole plain before <lb/>
            him full of people, hurrying hither and thither, and driving off <lb/>
            their cattle, sent messengers to assure them that he would be <lb/>
            an enemy to none that remained at home, but declared that if <lb/>
            he caught any one trying to escape, he would treat him as an <lb/>
            enemy. The greater part accordingly remained; some, how­ <lb/>
            ever, retreated with the king.</p>
          <p>4. But when those who were going forward with the women <lb/>
            fell in with those who were on the mountains, they immedi- <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            ately raised a cry, and many of them, betaking themselves to <lb/>
            flight, were captured. At last the son of the Armenian king, <lb/>
            his wives, and daughters, were likewise taken, as well as <lb/>
            all the property that was being carried off with them. The <lb/>
            king, when he perceived what had happened, being at a loss <lb/>
            which way to turn himself, fled to an eminence.1 5. Cyrus, <lb/>
            seeing this, surrounded the eminence with the force that was <lb/>
            with him, and sending to Chrysantas, ordered him to leave <lb/>
            a guard upon the mountains, and to come and join him. The <lb/>
            troops then assembled under Cyrus; who, sending a herald <lb/>
            to the Armenian, put the following question to him: " Tell <lb/>
            me," said he, " Armenian prince, whether you choose to stay <lb/>
            there, and combat with hunger and thirst, or to come down <lb/>
            and fight us upon equal ground ? " The Armenian answered, <lb/>
            " That he did not choose to combat with either." 2 6. Cyrus <lb/>
            sent again to him, and asked him, " Why do you then sit <lb/>
            there, and not come down ? " " Because I am at a loss," said <lb/>
            he, " what I ought to do." " But you ought not to be at a <lb/>
            loss," replied Cyrus, "for you are at liberty to come down and <lb/>
            submit to be tried." " And who," said he, "shall be the <lb/>
            judge ? " " He, without doubt," said Cyrus, " to whom the <lb/>
            gods have given power to treat you as he pleases without a <lb/>
            trial." The Armenian, in consequence, seeing the necessity, <lb/>
            came down ; and Cyrus, taking him, and all that belonged to <lb/>
            him, into the midst of his troops, encamped, keeping his <lb/>
            whole force together.</p>
          <p>7. Just at this time, Tigranes, the eldest son of the Arme <lb/>
            nian king, returned from a journey which he had taken ; he <lb/>
            who had formerly been Cyrus's companion in hunting. When <lb/>
            lie heard what had happened, he went directly, just as he was, <lb/>
            to Cyrus, and when he saw his father and mother, his brother, <lb/>
            and his own wife, prisoners, he wept, as was natural; 8. and <lb/>
            Cyrus, on seeing him, gave him no other token of friendship, <lb/>
            except saying to him, " You are come opportunely, that you <lb/>
            may be present and hear the trial of your father." He then <lb/>
            summoned all the officers of the Persians and Medes, and in­ <lb/>
            vited such of the Armenians of rank as were there; the <note type="footnote"> 1 Presignified by the flight of the eagle to the hill, ii. 4. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὺδετέροις βοὺλοιτο μάχεσϑαι</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὺδετέϱοις</foreign> refers as well to hunger <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III </note> <lb/>
            women, too, who were present in their chariots, he did not <lb/>
            send away, but allowed them to listen.</p>
          <p>9. When everything was arranged, he began by saying, <lb/>
            “ King of Armenia, I advise you, in the first place, to speak <lb/>
            truth on your trial; so that one fault at least, the most hate­ <lb/>
            ful of all, may not be laid to your charge; for be assured, that <lb/>
            to be found false is the greatest obstacle that can lie in men's <lb/>
            way to obtaining pardon. Besides," continued he, "your chil­ <lb/>
            dren and wives here, and all the Armenians present, are <lb/>
            aware of all that you have done; and if they find that you <lb/>
            say what is at variance with facts, they will think that, if I <lb/>
            discover the truth, you condemn yourself to the severest pun­ <lb/>
            ishment." " Ask, me," said he, " Cyrus, whatever you please, <lb/>
            as I am resolved to tell you truth, whatever may happen in <lb/>
            consequence of it." 10. " Tell me then," said he, " did you <lb/>
            ever make war with Astyagcs, my mother's father, and with <lb/>
            the rest of the Medes ? " “ I did," said he. “ And when you <lb/>
            were conquered by him, did you agree to pay him tribute, to <lb/>
            attend him to the field whithersoever he should desire you, and <lb/>
            to have no fortified places ? " “ It was so." " And why then <lb/>
            have you now neither brought him tribute, nor sent him <lb/>
            troops, and have built fortifications ? " He replied, " I was de­ <lb/>
            sirous of liberty ; for it appeared to me a noble privilege, both <lb/>
            to be free myself, and to leave liberty to my children." 11. <lb/>
            " It is indeed noble," said Cyrus, " to fight, in order not to be <lb/>
            made a slave; but if a man be conquered in war, or by other <lb/>
            means be reduced to servitude, and be found attempting to <lb/>
            withdraw himself from the power of his masters, tell me <lb/>
            first whether you reward and honour such a one as an <lb/>
            honest man, and one that acts nobly, or punish him, if <lb/>
            you take him, as one that does wrong ? ” "I punish him," <lb/>
            said he ; “ for you do not suffer me to speak falsely." 12. <lb/>
            “ Answer me, then, plainly," said Cyrus, " as to each of the <lb/>
            following particulars: if a man be a governor under you, and <lb/>
            transgress, do you suffer him to continue in his government, <lb/>
            or do you appoint another in his stead ?” "I appoint an­ <lb/>
            other," said he. " If he is master of great riches, do you <lb/>
            suffer him to continue rich, or do you make him poor ? " " I <lb/>
            take from him," said he, " all that he has." " If you find <lb/>
            him revolting to the enemy, what do you do ?" "I put him <pb n="75"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. l.] </note> <lb/>
            to death," said lie ; " for why should I die convicted of false­ <lb/>
            hood, rather than telling the truth ? "</p>
          <p>13. His son, when he heard these words, pulled off his <lb/>
            turban, and rent his clothes. The women raised a lamentable <lb/>
            cry, and began to tear their flesh, as if their father were <lb/>
            dead, and themselves utterly undone. Cyrus bid them be <lb/>
            silent, and again spoke. " Be it so, Armenian ; your answers <lb/>
            are just; and what do you advise us to do in accordance with <lb/>
            them ? ” The Armenian was silent, being at a loss whether <lb/>
            he should counsel Cyrus to put him to death, or desire him <lb/>
            to do the contrary to what he had said that he would do <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>14. His son Tigranes then asked Cyrus, saying, " Tell me, <lb/>
            Cyrus, since my father seems to be at a loss, whether I shall <lb/>
            advise you concerning him what I think best for you?" <lb/>
            Cyrus, having observed that when Tigranes used to hunt with <lb/>
            him, there was a philosopher associating with him and much <lb/>
            admired by him, was very desirous to hear what he would <lb/>
            say, and boldly bid him say what he thought. 15. " Then," <lb/>
            said Tigranes, “ if you approve the measures which my father <lb/>
            has concerted, and what he has done, I advise you, by all <lb/>
            means, to imitate him ; but if you are of opinion, that he has <lb/>
            done wrong in everything, my advice is, that you should not <lb/>
            imitate him." " By doing what is just, then," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            “ I shall be as far as possible from imitating him who does <lb/>
            wrong." " It is so," said he. “ According to your own <lb/>
            reasoning, then, I should punish your father, if it be just to <lb/>
            punish one who does wrong." " But whether do you think it <lb/>
            best, Cyrus, to inflict punishments for your advantage, or to <lb/>
            your prejudice?” By acting in the latter way," said he, <lb/>
            "I should punish myself." IG. " But you would indeed be <lb/>
            severely punished," said Tigranes, “ if you put to death those <lb/>
            that belonged to you, at a time when they would be of the <lb/>
            greatest service to you if saved?" " But how," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            " can men be of the greatest service, when they are proved <lb/>
            to have done wrong?” “ They would be of service," replied <lb/>
            Tigranes, “ if they should then become discreet; for this, <lb/>
            Cyrus, seems to me to be the case, that there is no profit in <lb/>
            any virtue without discretion; for,” continued he, " to what <note type="footnote"> I His younger son, Sabaris; for the elder, Tigranes, appears, from <lb/>
            what Xenophon relates, to have been of a firmer mind. Fischer </note> <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            purpose could a person use a man of great strength or bravery, <lb/>
            but destitute of discretion ? or one skilled in horsemanship, or <lb/>
            one abounding in riches, or a man of power in his country ? <lb/>
            But, with discretion, every friend is useful, and every servant <lb/>
            valuable." 17. “ Do you then intimate," said he, " that your <lb/>
            father, from being indiscreet, is become discreet, in this one <lb/>
            day's time?" "I do, indeed," said he. “ You say then that <lb/>
            discretion is a passion of the mind, as grief is, and not a matter <lb/>
            of knowledge ? For, if it be necessary that he, who is to be dis­ <lb/>
            creet, should be knowing, he cannot be turned from indiscretion <lb/>
            to discretion in a moment, is. But, Cyrus," added he, “ did <lb/>
            you never observe a man, from folly, attempt to fight with <lb/>
            another more powerful than himself, and, when conquered, <lb/>
            presently cease from his folly In regard to that man ? Or, have <lb/>
            you never seen one city engaged in war with another, and, <lb/>
            when conquered, immediately become willing to obey the other <lb/>
            instead.of continuing the war?" 19. “ And to what conquest <lb/>
            over your father," asked Cyrus, “ do you allude, that you so <lb/>
            strongly intimate that he has been rendered discreet? <lb/>
            “ That," replied he, “ by which he has grown conscious to <lb/>
            himself, that, by coveting liberty, he has become yet more a <lb/>
            slave than he was before; and that, of the things which <lb/>
            he thought to have effected, by secrecy, by surprise, or by <lb/>
            force, he has not been able to effect one; while he has seen <lb/>
            you, when you wished to deceive him, deceive him as effectu­ <lb/>
            ally as a person might deceive the blind, or the deaf, or men <lb/>
            of no understanding at all; and in matters in which you <lb/>
            thought it necessary to use concealment, he has seen you using <lb/>
            such concealment, that you have unawares rendered those <lb/>
            places prisons to him which he thought were set apart as <lb/>
            places of defence; and you have so far exceeded him in <lb/>
            despatch, that you have come upon him from a distance with <lb/>
            a large force before he had assembled his troops that were <lb/>
            just at hand." 20. “ Does such a defeat, then," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            ,; such an obligation to acknowledge other men better than <lb/>
            themselves, appear to you to be sufficient to render men dis­ <lb/>
            creet?" “ Much more,” said Tigranes, "than when a man is <lb/>
            conquered in battle; for he who is subdued by force, some­ <lb/>
            times thinks that, by exercising himself, he may be enabled to <lb/>
            renew the combat; and cities, that have been taken, imagine <lb/>
            that, by gaining allies, they may renew the war; but to those <pb n="77"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. l. ] </note> <lb/>
            whom men think better than themselves, they are often will­ <lb/>
            ing to submit, though without necessity." 21. "You seem," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " not to think that the insolen t can suppose that <lb/>
            there are others more discreet than themselves; or thieves, <lb/>
            that there are men who are not thieves ; or liars, that there <lb/>
            are men who speak truth; or unjust men, that there are men <lb/>
            who act with justice. Do not you know," continued he <lb/>
            " that your father has, at this time, dealt falsely, and not ad­ <lb/>
            hered to his agreements with us, though he knew very well <lb/>
            that we violate nothing of what Astyages stipulated ?" 22. <lb/>
            “ But I do not say," replied Tigranes, “ that merely to know <lb/>
            that there are others better than ourselves, makes men dis­ <lb/>
            creet, unless they suffer punishment at the hands of their <lb/>
            betters, as my father now suffers." " But your father," said <lb/>
            Cyrus, “ has as yet suffered not the least harm; though I <lb/>
            know very well, indeed, that he is afraid of suffering the <lb/>
            severest punishment." 23. "Do you think then," said Ti­ <lb/>
            granes, " that anything humbles men more than violent fear ? <lb/>
            Do not you know that those who are oppressed by the sword, <lb/>
            which is reckoned the severest instrument of correction, will <lb/>
            nevertheless fight again with the same enemy; but that men <lb/>
            are unable to look at those whom they thoroughly dread, even <lb/>
            when they utter words of consolation to them?" Do you <lb/>
            say then," said Cyrus, " that fear is a heavier punishment <lb/>
            upon men than real suffering?" 24. " You know yourself," <lb/>
            said he, " that what I say is true ; you know, that they who <lb/>
            are in fear of being banished from their country, or that are <lb/>
            in dread of being beaten when about to fight, are in a most <lb/>
            dejected condition. Those who are at sea, and dread ship­ <lb/>
            wreck, and those who fear servitude and chains, are neither <lb/>
            able to take food or sleep through terror ; but they who are <lb/>
            already under banishment, who are already conquered and al­ <lb/>
            ready slaves, are sometimes in a condition to eat and sleep <lb/>
            better than the fortunate themselves. 25. How great a burden <lb/>
            fear is, is yet more evident from these considerations, that <lb/>
            some, dreading lest they should be taken captive and put to <lb/>
            death, have killed themselves beforehand from the oppression <lb/>
            of that dread; some throwing themselves headlong from pre­ <lb/>
            cipices, some hanging themselves, and some dying by the <lb/>
            sword; so that, of all things terrible, fear produces the most <lb/>
            violent effect on the mind. And in what state of mind, <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            tben," added he, “ do you consider my father to be, who is in <lb/>
            fear not only for his own liberty, but for mine, for that of his <lb/>
            wife, and that of all his children ? " 26. Cyrus replied, " It <lb/>
            does not appear at all improbable to me, that your father is, at <lb/>
            this time, affected as you intimate; but it may be the part, I <lb/>
            think, of the same man to be insolent in prosperity, and, when <lb/>
            reduced in fortune, to become soon servilely afraid; and yet, <lb/>
            when freed from apprehension, to become insolent again, and <lb/>
            again to give trouble.” 27. “ Indeed, Cyrus," said he, " our <lb/>
            delinquencies give you cause to distrust us; but you are at <lb/>
            liberty to build fortresses in our country, to keep possession of <lb/>
            our places of strength, and to require from us whatever other <lb/>
            pledge you please; and yet," said he, " you will not find us <lb/>
            very uneasy under these circumstances ; for we shall remem­ <lb/>
            ber that we ourselves were the cause of them. But if you <lb/>
            give up our government to any of those who are free from <lb/>
            guilt, and then appear distrustful of them ; take care, lest, at <lb/>
            the same time that you become a benefactor to them, they may <lb/>
            think you no friend to them ; and if again, through anxiety <lb/>
            not to incur their enmity, you forbear to impose upon them a <lb/>
            yoke to prevent them from being rebellious, consider whether <lb/>
            it may not hereafter be more necessary for you to bring them <lb/>
            to their senses than it has been for you now to bring us to <lb/>
            ours." 28. But by the gods," said Cyrus, "I seem to myself <lb/>
            to have no pleasure in using such servants as I know to serve <lb/>
            me from necessity; but such as I consider to perform their <lb/>
            duties from friendship and good-will for me, I can more <lb/>
            easily endure when they transgress, than such as hate me, and <lb/>
            yet, from compulsion, fulfil their duty to the utmost." To <lb/>
            these remarks Tigranes replied, " And from whom could you <lb/>
            ever secure so strong a feeling of friendship as you may now <lb/>
            gain from us?" "From those, I should think, who have <lb/>
            never been at enmity with me, if I should but benefit them, <lb/>
            as you now desire me to benefit you." 29. " And could you <lb/>
            possibly find, Cyrus," said he, " at this time, any one to whom <lb/>
            you could grant such favours as you may grant to my father ? <lb/>
            For example," continued he, “ if you grant life to one of <lb/>
            those who never did you any injury, what gratitude will he <lb/>
            feel towards you for it, think you ? Or what man, if you do <lb/>
            not deprive him of his wife and children, will love you more, <lb/>
            on thai account, than he who thinks that he deserves to be <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. l.] </note> <lb/>
            deprived of them ? Or do you know any one, who, if he shall <lb/>
            not have the kingdom of Armenia, will grieve more than our­ <lb/>
            selves ? Accordingly, it is evident that he who will grieve <lb/>
            most if he is not king, will feel most gratitude to you if he <lb/>
            receives from you kingly power. so. And if," added he, <lb/>
            “ you are at all desirous to leave everything here, when <lb/>
            you quit us, in the least possible disorder, consider whether <lb/>
            you can expect the country to be more quiet under the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of a new government, than if the accustomed <lb/>
            government continue. If it be at all an object to you, to draw <lb/>
            from hence the greatest possible number of forces, who, do <lb/>
            you think, will muster them better, than he who has often <lb/>
            made use of them ? And if you should want money, who, do <lb/>
            you think, will supply you better than he who knows and <lb/>
            commands all the resources of the kingdom ? Good Cyrus," <lb/>
            said he, " be careful, lest, by setting us aside, you do yourself <lb/>
            more mischief than my father has been able to do you." To <lb/>
            this effect he spoke.</p>
          <p>31. Cyrus was extremely pleased to hear him, for he <lb/>
            thought that he should be able to effect all that he had pro­ <lb/>
            mised Cyaxares to do; as he remembered to have told him, <lb/>
            that he thought he should make the Armenian more his <lb/>
            friend than before. Soon after, therefore, he asked the Ar­ <lb/>
            menian king, " If I trust you in these matters, tell me," said <lb/>
            he, "what force will you send with me, and what money will <lb/>
            you contribute to the war?" 32. To this question the Ar­ <lb/>
            menian answered, " I have no offer to make, Cyrus, more <lb/>
            straightforward or more just, than that I should exhibit to <lb/>
            you all the forces that I have, and that you, on seeing the <lb/>
            whole, should take with you whatever you will, and leave the <lb/>
            rest for the protection of the country. In like manner, with <lb/>
            respect to our riches, it is just that I should discover to you <lb/>
            all that I have, that, taking account of all, you may carry off <lb/>
            what you please of it, and leave what you please." 33. “ Pro­ <lb/>
            ceed, then," said Cyrus, " and show me what forces you have, <lb/>
            and tell me what your treasures are." The Armenian replied, <lb/>
            “ The cavalry of the Armenians amount to eight thousand, <lb/>
            and the infantry to forty thousand. Our riches, including the <lb/>
            treasure my father left, reckoned in silver, amount to more <lb/>
            than three thousand talents.” 1 34. Cyrus then made no hesita- <note type="footnote">1 About £ 731,250. See Anab. i. 1. 9 </note> <pb n="80"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            tion, but said, “ Since the Chaldeans, that border upon you, <lb/>
            are at war with you, send me half of your forces ; and of your <lb/>
            treasure, instead of fifty talents, which was the tribute you <lb/>
            used to pay, give Cyaxares double that sum, for your failure <lb/>
            in paying; and lend me," added he, " a hundred more, and I <lb/>
            promise you, that, if the gods prosper me, I will, in return for <lb/>
            what you lend me, either do you such services as shall be <lb/>
            of greater value, or, if I am able, will pay you back the <lb/>
            money again: if I am not able to do it, I may then be con­ <lb/>
            sidered unable ; but unjust I cannot deservedly be accounted." <lb/>
            35. "I beseech you, by the gods, Cyrus," said the Armenian, <lb/>
            " do not talk in that manner ; if you do, you will put me out <lb/>
            of heart; but consider," said he, " that what you leave be­ <lb/>
            hind is not less yours than what you take away with you." <lb/>
            " Be it so," said Cyrus; " but, to have your wife again, how <lb/>
            much money will you give me?” "As much as I can," said he. <lb/>
            " How much for your children ?" " For them, too," said he, <lb/>
            “ as much as I can." " That, then," said Cyrus, "is already <lb/>
            as much again as you have.1 36. And you, Tigranes," said <lb/>
            he, " at what price would you purchase the recovery of your <lb/>
            wife?" Tigranes happened to be but recently married, <lb/>
            and to be very fond of his wife. " Cyrus," said he, “ to save <lb/>
            her from servitude, I would ransom her at the expense of <lb/>
            my life." 37. “ Take, then, your own," said he : “ for I can­ <lb/>
            not consider that she has been taken captive, since you never <lb/>
            fled from us. And do you, king of Armenia, take your wife <lb/>
            and children without paying anything for them, that they <lb/>
            may know they come free to you. And now," said he, ” pray <lb/>
            dine with us ; and when dinner is over, depart whithersoever <lb/>
            you please." They accordingly stayed.</p>
          <p>38. While they were together after dinner in the tent, Cy­ <lb/>
            rus asked this question : Tell me," said he, " Tigranes, where <lb/>
            is that man2 who used to hunt with us, and whom you seemed <lb/>
            to me greatly to admire?” " He is no more," said Tigranes, <note type="footnote">' As much again as the three thousand talents which he said that <lb/>
            he had, sect. 33. He had first said that he would give as much as <lb/>
            lie could for his wife, and, afterwards, as much as he could for his <lb/>
            children ; and Cyrus, jesting, tells him that he has now promised <lb/>
            to give twice as much as he has. Fischer. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The man to whom allusion is made in sect. 14. Weiske sup­ <lb/>

            "for has not my father here put him to death?" “What <lb/>
            crime, then, did he find him committing?" “ He said that <lb/>
            he corrupted me: and yet, Cyrus, so noble and excellent a <lb/>
            man was he, that, when he was going to die, he sent for me, <lb/>
            and told me, ‘ Tigranes,' said he, ‘ do not bear the least ill-will <lb/>
            to your father for putting me to death; for he does it not out <lb/>
            of malice, but out of ignorance. And whatever faults men <lb/>
            commit through ignorance, I consider them all involuntary.'" <lb/>
            39. Cyrus, upon this, exclaimed, " Alas ! for the man !” The <lb/>
            Armenian king then said, " They, Cyrus, who find strangers <lb/>
            engaged in familiar conversation with their wives, do not put <lb/>
            them to death on the charge of endeavouring to make their <lb/>
            wives less sensible, but on the conviction that they alienate <lb/>
            from them their wives' affection, for which reason they treat <lb/>
            them as enemies. And I," continued he, "bore ill-will to this <lb/>
            man because he appeared to me to make my son regard him <lb/>
            more than myself." 40. Cyrus then said, "By the gods, king <lb/>
            of Armenia, I think you have committed a fault incident to <lb/>
            human nature ; and you, Tigranes, must forgive your father." <lb/>
            Having held this discourse on the occasion, and having treated <lb/>
            each other with kindness, as is natural upon a reconciliation, <lb/>
            the Armenians mounted their chariots in company with the <lb/>
            women, and drove away in good spirits.</p>
          <p>41. When they came home, one talked of Cyrus's wisdom, <lb/>
            another of his resolution, another of his mildness; and some <lb/>
            spoke of his beauty, and the tallness of his person ; when <lb/>
            Tigranes asked his wife, "And does Cyrus appear to you, too, <lb/>
            Armenian princess, to be a handsome man ?" “Indeed,” said <lb/>
            she, " I did not look at him." " At whom, then, did you <lb/>
            look?" said Tigranes. "At him who said that he would pay <lb/>
            the price of his own life to save me from slavery." After <lb/>
            some conversation of this kind, as was usual, they went to­ <lb/>
            gether to rest.</p>
          <p>42. Next day the Armenian king sent presents of friend­ <lb/>
            ship to Cyrus, and to the whole army; he despatched orders <lb/>
            also to such of his troops as were to serve in this expedition, <lb/>
            to attend on the third day; and he sent in payment double the <lb/>
            sum of money that Cyrus had specified. Cyrus, accepting <lb/>
            the sum that he had named, sent the rest back, and asked, <lb/>
            " Which of them would command the army, whether his son <lb/>
            or himself?" They both answered together, the father thus: <note type="footnote"> VOL. II </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            " Either of us that you shall order :” the son thus: “ I will <lb/>
            not leave you, Cyrus, even if I should have to attend you as a <lb/>
            baggage-carrier." 43. Cyrus, laughing, rejoined, " And for <lb/>
            how much would you consent that your wife should hear that <lb/>
            you are a baggage-bearer?" “ There will be no need," said <lb/>
            he, " that she should hear, for I will bring her with me; so <lb/>
            that she shall be able to see what I do." " It is then time <lb/>
            for you," said he, “ to prepare everything for joining us." " Be <lb/>
            assured," returned Tigranes, " that we shall join you at the <lb/>
            time, prepared with everything that my father affords us." <lb/>
            The troops were then entertained, and went to rest.</p>

          <p>The Armenians join their troops with those of Cyrus. The united force <lb/>
            attacks and defeats the Chaldeans, of whose high grounds Cyrus retains <lb/>
            possession, and builds a fortress on them. Peace established between the <lb/>
            Armenians and Chaldeans. Cyrus sends ambassadors to the king of the <lb/>
            Indians for a supply of money.</p>
          <p>1. THE next day Cyrus, taking Tigranes with him, and <lb/>
            the best of the Median horse, together with as many of his <lb/>
            own friends as he thought proper, rode round and surveyed <lb/>
            the country, examining where he should build a fortress. <lb/>
            Going up to a certain eminence, he asked Tigranes what sort <lb/>
            of mountains they were from which the Chaldeans came down <lb/>
            to plunder the country ? Tigranes pointed them out to him. <lb/>
            He then inquired again, “ And are these mountains now en­ <lb/>
            tirely deserted ? ” " No, indeed," said he ; " but there are al­ <lb/>
            ways scouts of the Chaldeans there, who give notice to the rest <lb/>
            of whatever they observe." " And how do they act," said he, <lb/>
            " when they receive this notice ? " " They hasten with aid <lb/>
            to the eminences, just as each can." 2. Cyrus gave attention <lb/>
            to this account; and, looking round, observed a great part of <lb/>
            the Armenian territory lying desert and uncultivated, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the war. They then retired to the camp; and, <lb/>
            after taking supper, went to rest.</p>
          <p>3. The next day Tigranes presented himself with every­ <lb/>
            thing ready; and with cavalry to the number of four <lb/>
            thousand, archers to the number of ten thousand, and as <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            many peltasts. Cyrus, while they were assembling, offered <lb/>
            a sacrifice. When the victims appeared favourable, he sum­ <lb/>
            moned the leaders of the Persians and Medes ; and, when <lb/>
            they came together, spoke to them to this effect: 4. " Friends, <lb/>
            those mountains that we see belong to the Chaldeans; if we <lb/>
            can secure them, and a fortress of ours could be erected upon <lb/>
            the summit, there would be a necessity for both the Armenians <lb/>
            and Chaldeans to act with discretion towards us. Our sacri­ <lb/>
            fice is propitious; and, for the execution of such designs, no­ <lb/>
            thing favours the inclinations of men so much as expedition ; for <lb/>
            if we anticipate the enemy, by ascending the mountains before <lb/>
            they assemble, we may either secure the summit entirely with­ <lb/>
            out a blow, or have to deal with only a few and weak enemies. <lb/>
            5. Of all labours, therefore, there is none more easy or free <lb/>
            from danger, than resolutely to bear the fatigue of despatch. <lb/>
            Hasten, then, to arms ! and you, Medes, march upon our left; <lb/>
            you, Armenians, march half of you on our right, and the other <lb/>
            half in front; and you, cavalry, follow in the rear, exhorting <lb/>
            us, and pushing us up before you ; and, if any one is disposed <lb/>
            to relax his efforts, by no means allow him to do so."</p>
          <p>6. Cyrus, having said this, led on, disposing the several <lb/>
            companies in files. The Chaldeans, as soon as they perceived <lb/>
            that the movement was directed towards the heights, immedi­ <lb/>
            ately made a signal to their people, and shouted to each other, <lb/>
            and ran together. Cyrus then exhorted his troops, saying, <lb/>
            " Men of Persia, they make a signal for us to hasten ; if we <lb/>
            reach the heights before them, the efforts of the enemy will <lb/>
            be of no avail."</p>
          <p>7. The Chaldeans had each a shield, and two javelins ; they <lb/>
            are said to be the most warlike of all people in that part of <lb/>
            the world. They serve as mercenaries, if any one requires <lb/>
            their services, being a warlike people, and poor; for their <lb/>
            country is mountainous, and but little of it yields anything <lb/>
            profitable. 8. As Cyrus's men approached the heights, <lb/>
            Tigranes, who was riding on with Cyrus, said, "Cyrus, <lb/>
            are you aware that we ourselves must very soon come to <lb/>
            action, as the Armenians will not stand the attack of the <lb/>
            enemy?" Cyrus, telling him that he knew it, immediately <lb/>
            gave orders to the Persians to hold themselves in readi­ <lb/>
            ness, as they would have immediately to press forward <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            as soon as the flying Armenians drew the enemy down1 so as <lb/>
            to be near them. 9. The Armenians accordingly led on ; and <lb/>
            such of the Chaldeans as were on the spot when the Ar­ <lb/>
            menians approached, raised a shout, and, according to their <lb/>
            custom, ran upon them ; and the Armenians, according to their <lb/>
            custom, did not stand their charge. 10. When the Chaldeans, <lb/>
            pursuing, saw swordsmen fronting them, and pressing up the <lb/>
            hill, some of them, coming up close to the enemy, were at once <lb/>
            killed ; some fled, and some were taken ; and the heights were <lb/>
            immediately gained. As soon as Cyrus's men were in occupa­ <lb/>
            tion of the summit, they looked down on the habitations of the <lb/>
            Chaldeans, and perceived them fleeing from the nearest houses. <lb/>
            11. Cyrus, as soon as the troops were all assembled, ordered <lb/>
            them to take their dinner. When they had dined, Cyrus, <lb/>
            learning that the spot where the scouts of the Chaldeans had <lb/>
            been posted, was strong and well supplied with water, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded at once to erect a fortress there. He ordered Tigranes <lb/>
            to send to his father, and bid him come with as many car­ <lb/>
            penters and builders as could be procured. The messenger <lb/>
            went off to the Armenian; and Cyrus applied himself to the <lb/>
            building with all the workmen that were with him.</p>
          <p>12. Meanwhile they brought Cyrus the prisoners, some <lb/>
            bound, and some wounded. As soon as he saw them, he gave <lb/>
            orders to loose those that were bound; and, sending for the <lb/>
            surgeons, desired them to take care of the wounded. He <lb/>
            then told the Chaldeans, that he was not come either with a <lb/>
            desire to destroy them, or with an inclination to make war <lb/>
            upon them; but with a wish to make peace between the Ar­ <lb/>
            menians and Chaldeans. “ Before your mountains were oc­ <lb/>
            cupied," said he, " I know that you had no desire for peace: <lb/>
            your own possessions were in safety; those of the Armenians <lb/>
            you plundered and ravaged. But now you see in what con­ <lb/>
            dition you are placed. is. Those of you, therefore, that have <lb/>
            been taken, I dismiss to your homes, and allow you, together <lb/>
            with the rest of the Chaldeans, to consult amongst yourselves, <lb/>
            whether you are inclined to make war with us, or to De our <lb/>
            friends : if war be your choice, come no more hither without <lb/>
            arms, if you are wise; if you resolve to prefer peace, come <note type="footnote">1 Cyrus disguises from his soldiers the want of courage in the <lb/>
            Armenians, by representing that they would flee designedly. </note> <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            without arms. And, if you become our friends, it shall be <lb/>
            my care, that your affairs be established upon the best footing." <lb/>
            14. The Chaldeans hearing these assurances, and bestowing <lb/>
            many praises upon Cyrus, and giving him many pledges of <lb/>
            friendship, went home.</p>
          <p>The Armenian king, as soon as he heard of the summons of <lb/>
            Cyrus, and his achievement, took carpenters with him, and <lb/>
            whatever else he thought necessary, and came to Cyrus with <lb/>
            all possible despatch. 15. As soon as he saw Cyrus, he said <lb/>
            to him, " 0 Cyrus, how do we men, able to see so little with <lb/>
            regard to the future, attempt to accomplish numberless pro­ <lb/>
            jects ! I, endeavouring upon this occasion to obtain liberty, <lb/>
            became more a slave than ever; and, being made captives, <lb/>
            and thinking our destruction certain, we now again appear to <lb/>
            be in greater safety than ever. For the Chaldeans never <lb/>
            ceased doing us all manner of mischief; and I now see <lb/>
            them just in the condition in which I wished them to be. 16. <lb/>
            And be assured of this," said he, " Cyrus, that to have so <lb/>
            driven the Chaldeans from these heights, I would have given <lb/>
            many times the money that you have now received from me; <lb/>
            and the services which you promised to do us, when you took <lb/>
            the money, have been so fully performed, that we appear to be <lb/>
            brought under new obligations to you, which, if we are not <lb/>
            unworthy men, we shall be ashamed not to discharge; and <lb/>
            though we attempt to discharge them, we shall not, even thus, <lb/>
            be found to have done anything worthy of regard towards such <lb/>
            a benefactor." Thus spoke the Armenian.</p>
          <p>17. The Chaldeans came back, begging of Cyrus to make <lb/>
            peace with them. Cyrus asked them, " Chaldeans," said he, <lb/>
            “ is it not on this consideration that you desire peace, that <lb/>
            you think you will live with more security in peace than <lb/>
            if you continue the war, since we are in possession of these <lb/>
            heights?” The Chaldeans said that it was so. is. And <lb/>
            what," said he, "if there should be still other advantages that <lb/>
            may arise to you from peace ?" " We should be still the more <lb/>
            pleased," said they. " Do you not think, therefore," said he, <lb/>
            that you are now a needy people, through being in want of <lb/>
            good land ? They agreed with him in this. “Well, then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, “ would you wish to be at liberty to cultivate as <lb/>
            much of the Armenian land as you pleased, paying the same <lb/>
            for it that the Armenians pay?" "Yes," said they, "if we <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            could be sure that we should not be injured." 19. "Would <lb/>
            you then, king of Armenia," said he, " be willing that your <lb/>
            waste land should be cultivated on condition that the culti­ <lb/>
            vators of it pay you the usual rent ?" The Armenian said, <lb/>
            that he would give much to have it so ; for his revenue would <lb/>
            be greatly improved by it. 20. " And you," said he, " Chal­ <lb/>
            deans, since you have mountains that are serviceable, would <lb/>
            you consent that the Armenians should use them for pasturage, <lb/>
            on condition that the herdsmen pay what is reasonable?" <lb/>
            The Chaldeans said that they would, as they would thus be <lb/>
            greatly benefited without any labour. " And would you, <lb/>
            king of Armenia," said he, " be willing to make use of the <lb/>
            pastures of these men, if by allowing a small profit to the <lb/>
            Chaldeans, you might make a much greater profit by it your­ <lb/>
            self?" "Readily," said he, "if I thought I could use the <lb/>
            pastures securely." “ And you, Armenians, might use them <lb/>
            securely," said he, “ if you have the heights to protect you." <lb/>
            The Armenian expressed his assent. 21. But, assuredly," <lb/>
            said the Chaldeans, " we should not be able to cultivate in <lb/>
            security, either the lands of these people, or our own, if they <lb/>
            are in possession of the summits.” " But suppose," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            “ that the heights be for defences to you, Chaldeans ?” <lb/>
            “ Thus, indeed," said they, " things might be very well for <lb/>
            us." “ But, certainly," said the Armenian, " things will not <lb/>
            be well for us, if these men come to be again possessed of the <lb/>
            summits ; especially when they are fortified." 22. " I will <lb/>
            therefore settle matters in this way," replied Cyrus; "I will <lb/>
            give up the heights to neither of you, but we will garrison <lb/>
            them ourselves, and, whichsoever of you shall injure the <lb/>
            other, we will take part with the injured." 23. When both <lb/>
            parties heard this proposal, they gave their applause, and said <lb/>
            that thus only could the peace be stable. Upon this under­ <lb/>
            standing they gave and received, mutually, assurances of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, and agreed that both nations should be independent of <lb/>
            each other; that there should be liberty of intermarriage, and <lb/>
            of tillage and pasturage on each other's lands, and if any one <lb/>
            should harm them, a defensive alliance between them. 24. <lb/>
            Thus were these matters settled on the occasion, and the com­ <lb/>
            pacts, then made between the Chaldeans and the possessor of <lb/>
            Armenia, subsist to this day. When the agreement was <lb/>
            made, they both immediately applied themselves, with zeal, to <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            the erection of the fortresses, as a common security; and <lb/>
            jointly brought provisions into them.</p>
          <p>25. When evening came on, he took both parties to sup with <lb/>
            him, as being now friends. As they were at supper, one of <lb/>
            the Chaldeans said, that these things were such as all the <lb/>
            rest of them desired; but that there were some of the Chal­ <lb/>
            deans who lived by spoil, and who neither knew how to <lb/>
            apply themselves to work, nor were able to do it, being accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to live by war; as they were always engaged in plun­ <lb/>
            dering, or serving as mercenaries, frequently with the king of <lb/>
            the Indians, (" for he is a man," said they, " abounding in <lb/>
            gold,") and frequently with Astyages. 26. Cyrus then said, <lb/>
            " And why do they not now, then, engage themselves as mer­ <lb/>
            cenaries to me ? for I will give them as much as any other <lb/>
            person has ever given them." The Chaldeans approved of <lb/>
            this suggestion, and said, that there would be a great many <lb/>
            that would willingly engage in his service. 27. These matters <lb/>
            were accordingly arranged.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, when he heard that the Chaldeans frequently went <lb/>
            to serve under the Indian king, and remembered that there <lb/>
            were certain persons that came from him to the Modes, to <lb/>
            acquaint themselves with the Median affairs, and went thence <lb/>
            to the enemy, to get an insight likewise into their affairs, was <lb/>
            desirous that the Indian should be informed of what he had <lb/>
            done. 28. He therefore began to speak to this effect: "Tell <lb/>
            me," said he, " king of Armenia, and you, Chaldeans, if I <lb/>
            should send one of my people to the Indian king, would you <lb/>
            send with him some of yours, who should direct him on his <lb/>
            way, and act in concert with him, so that what I desire of the <lb/>
            Indian may be obtained from him ? for I would wish some <lb/>
            further addition to be made to my treasure, that I may have <lb/>
            the means of giving pay in abundance to such as require it, <lb/>
            and to honour and reward such of my soldiers as are deserv­ <lb/>
            ing. For these purposes I would have plenty of money, <lb/>
            knowing that I want it; and to spare your funds would be a <lb/>
            pleasure to me; for I now regard you as friends; but from <lb/>
            the Indian I would gladly obtain something, if he would give <lb/>
            it me. 29. The messenger, therefore, to whom I desire you <lb/>
            to give guides and to support, shall speak, when he arrives <lb/>
            there, to this purport: ' King of India, Cyrus has sent me to <lb/>
            you ; be says that he is in want of money, expecting another <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            army from Persia;' (for indeed I do expect one, said he ;) <lb/>
            ‘ if you send him, therefore, as much as you can conve­ <lb/>
            niently spare, he engages, if the gods give a happy issue <lb/>
            to his undertakings, to endeavour to make you think that <lb/>
            you have decided well in doing him this favour.' so. This <lb/>
            my messenger shall say. You, on the other hand, desire <lb/>
            your messengers to say whatever may appear for your ad­ <lb/>
            vantage. And if we obtain anything from him," added he, <lb/>
            " we shall have more abundant resources ; if we get nothing, <lb/>
            we shall have the consciousness that we owe him no thanks, <lb/>
            but that we shall be at liberty, as far as he is concerned, to re­ <lb/>
            gulate all our affairs with reference only to our own interests." <lb/>
            31. Thus spoke Cyrus, not doubting that those of the Arme­ <lb/>
            nians and Chaldeans that went upon this message, would say <lb/>
            such things of him, as he himself desired that all men should <lb/>
            say and hear concerning him. Then, when the proper time <lb/>
            was come, they broke up the assembly, and went to rest.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Honours paid to Cyrus by the Armenians and Chaldeans. He declines the <lb/>
            gifts of the Armenian princess. He persuades Cyaxares to lead his forces <lb/>
            into the enemy's country. They approach the army of the Assyrians ; the <lb/>
            different modes in which the two nations pitch their camps. The two <lb/>
            armies prepare for battle ; the addresses of the king of Assyria and Cyrus <lb/>
            to their men. The engagement; the Assyrians are driven back into their <lb/>
            camp with great loss.</p>
          <p>1. THE next day Cyrus sent off his messenger, charging <lb/>
            . him with all that he had before expressed. The Armenian <lb/>
            king and the Chaldeans sent with him such men as they <lb/>
            judged most proper to act in concert with him, and to say <lb/>
            what was proper concerning Cyrus.</p>
          <p>Soon after, Cyrus, having furnished the fortress with a <lb/>
            sufficient garrison, and with all things necessary, and left as <lb/>
            governor of it a certain Mede, one that he judged would be <lb/>
            most acceptable to Cyaxares, departed, taking with him both <lb/>
            the force with which he came, and that which he had received <lb/>
            from the Armenians, as well as the troops that came from the <lb/>
            Chaldeans, who amounted to about four thousand, and thought <lb/>
            themselves superior to all the rest.</p><pb n="89"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note>2. When he came down into the inhabited country, not one <lb/>
            of the Armenians, either man or woman, stayed within doors, <lb/>
            but all went out to meet him, being overjoyed at the peace, <lb/>
            and bringing out and presenting to him whatever they had <lb/>
            worthy of his acceptance. The Armenian was not at all dis­ <lb/>
            pleased at this conduct, thinking that Cyrus, on receiving such <lb/>
            honour from all, would be the better pleased. At last, also, <lb/>
            the wife of the Armenian king met him, having her daughters <lb/>
            with her, and her younger son; 1 and, together with other <lb/>
            presents, she brought the gold which Cyrus had before refused <lb/>
            to take. 3. Cyrus, when he saw her, said, “ You shall not <lb/>
            make me go about doing services for money ; but go, madam, <lb/>
            and take with you the treasure that you offer me, and do not <lb/>
            give it to the king of Armenia again to bury,2 but equip your <lb/>
            son with it in the handsomest possible manner, and send him <lb/>
            to join the army ; and, out of the remainder, procure for your­ <lb/>
            self, your husband, daughters, and sons, those things with <lb/>
            which, possessing and being adorned with them, you will pass <lb/>
            your days in increased elegance and pleasure ; let it suffice for <lb/>
            us, when each of us dies, to lay our bodies in the earth." <lb/>
            4. Having said this, he rode on; and the Armenian king <lb/>
            attended upon him, as did all the rest, calling him, aloud, " their <lb/>
            benefactor, that excellent man ! " Thus they did till he had <lb/>
            quitted their territory. The Armenian sent a still greater <lb/>
            force with him, as he had now peace at home.3 5. Thus Cyrus <lb/>
            departed, not only enriched with the treasure he had actually <lb/>
            received, but having laid up for himself, through his conduct, <lb/>
            a much greater store, so that he could supply himself when­ <lb/>
            ever he wanted. He then encamped upon the borders; and <lb/>
            the next day he sent the army and treasure to Cyaxares, who <lb/>
            was at hand, as he had said that he would be. He himself, <lb/>
            with Tigranes, and the principal Persians, hunted wherever <lb/>
            they met with game, and diverted themselves.</p>
          <p>6. When he came into Media, he distributed money among <lb/>
            his centurions, whatever he thought sufficient for each of them, <lb/>
            that they might have the means of rewarding such of those <note type="footnote"> 1 Sabaris, iii. 1. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It is not previously intimated that the money was buried. </note><note type="footnote">3 He had already furnished Cyrus with a certain number of men, <lb/>
            iii. 2. 3; 3. 1; and being now at peace with the Chaldeans, he sends <lb/>
            an additional force. </note> <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III </note> <lb/>
            under them as they might think worthy ; for he thought that, <lb/>
            if every one rendered his own part of the army praiseworthy, <lb/>
            the whole would be in excellent condition for him. He him­ <lb/>
            self, wherever he saw anything that might contribute to the <lb/>
            beauty of the army, procured it, and distributed it, from time <lb/>
            to time, among the most deserving ; considering that, what­ <lb/>
            ever his men had that was beautiful and serviceable, he him­ <lb/>
            self received distinction from it all.</p>
          <p>7. When he had distributed among them a portion of what <lb/>
            he had received, he spoke, in an assembly of centurions, cap­ <lb/>
            tains, and all such as he particularly esteemed, to this effect: <lb/>
            " Friends, a particular pleasure seems now to attend us, both <lb/>
            because some supplies have fallen to us, and because we have <lb/>
            resources from which we may reward those whom we wish, <lb/>
            and from which you may be distinguished as each may be de­ <lb/>
            serving. 8. But let us by all means remember what sort of <lb/>
            actions were the cause of these advantages, for upon examin­ <lb/>
            ation, you will find that they were watching when it was re­ <lb/>
            quired, labouring, being active, and not giving way to the <lb/>
            enemy. Thus therefore it behoves us to be brave men for the <lb/>
            future ; knowing that obedience and resolution, labours and <lb/>
            hazards, on proper occasions, produce great benefits."</p>
          <p>9. Cyrus, contemplating in how excellent a condition his <lb/>
            men were, corporeally, for sustaining military labours, and <lb/>
            how well they were disposed in mind to look with contempt <lb/>
            on the enemy, seeing how skilful, too, they were in their pro­ <lb/>
            per exercises, each in his own kind of arms, and how well <lb/>
            disposed they all were to obey their officers, was eager, from <lb/>
            these considerations, to make some attempt on the enemy, <lb/>
            knowing that by delay, some part or other of excellent mili­ <lb/>
            tary preparations often comes to nothing in the hands of the <lb/>
            commanders. 10. Observing also that many of the soldiers, <lb/>
            from desire of distinction in the exercises in which they con­ <lb/>
            tended, had contracted feelings of envy towards one another; <lb/>
            he was, on this account, desirous to lead them out, as soon as <lb/>
            possible, into the enemy's country; knowing that common <lb/>
            dangers make fellow-combatants conceive a friendly disposi­ <lb/>
            tion one towards another; and that, in such circumstances, <lb/>
            they neither envy those that are finely armed, nor those that <lb/>
            are ambitious of glory, but that such men rather applaud and <lb/>
            esteem others that are like themselves, regarding them as fellow- <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            labourers in the public service. 11. Accordingly, in the first <lb/>
            place, he completely armed his whole force, and formed it into <lb/>
            the best and most beautiful order that was possible. He then <lb/>
            summoned the commanders of ten thousands, the commanders <lb/>
            of thousands, the centurions, and captains ; (for these were <lb/>
            exempt from being reckoned in the numbers of the divisions; <lb/>
            and when they had to execute any orders from the com­ <lb/>
            mander-in-chief, or to communicate any particular directions <lb/>
            to others, there was yet no part left without control, but all <lb/>
            the other men were kept in order by the commanders of twelves <lb/>
            and sixes ;)1 12. and when all these officers were assembled, he <lb/>
            took them round with him, and showed them that all was in <lb/>
            proper order, and taught them in what point each of the allies <lb/>
            were peculiarly strong. After he had rendered these men <lb/>
            also desirous to attempt something soon, he bid them go to <lb/>
            their several divisions, teach them what he had taught them­ <lb/>
            selves, and endeavour to inspire them all with a desire of <lb/>
            taking the field, that they might set forth with all possible <lb/>
            ardour. He told them also to be in attendance in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing at the gate of Cyaxares. is. They then retired, and did <lb/>
            as they were directed.</p>
          <p>The next morning, as soon as it was day, the officers at­ <lb/>
            tended at the gate ; and Cyrus, going in with them to Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, proceeded to speak to this effect. " I know, Cyaxares," <lb/>
            said he, “ that what I am going to say has been for some time <lb/>
            not less your opinion than it is our own, but perhaps you <lb/>
            shrink from expressing it, lest you should seem to be think­ <lb/>
            ing of our departure, as being uneasy at having to maintain <lb/>
            us. 14. Since, therefore, you are silent, I will speak both for <lb/>
            you and for ourselves ; for it appears to all of us, that, since we <lb/>
            are prepared, we should not then proceed to fight after the <lb/>
            enemy have entered your country, or sit down and wait here <lb/>
            in the territory of our friends, but should march, with all <lb/>
            possible despatch, into the enemy's country. 15. For now, <lb/>
            being here in your territory, we do harm against our will to <lb/>
            much of what belongs to you ; but, if we march into the <lb/>
            enemy's country, we shall with pleasure do mischief to what <lb/>
            belongs to them. 16. It is you that now maintain us, and at <lb/>
            a great expense; but if we carry the war abroad, we shall <lb/>
            maintain ourselves from the enemy's country. 17. If indeed <note type="footnote"> I The same that are elsewhere called captains of tens and fives. </note> <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            greater danger would await us there than here, perhaps the <lb/>
            safer alternative should be chosen ; but the enemy will be the <lb/>
            same men, whether we wait for them here, or march into their <lb/>
            own country and meet them ; and we shall be the same in <lb/>
            the field, whether we receive them here, as they come upon <lb/>
            us, or march up to them and attack them. is. We, however, <lb/>
            shall have the minds of our men in better condition, and more <lb/>
            resolute, if we march against the enemy, and seem not to <lb/>
            come in sight of them against our will ; and they will have a <lb/>
            much greater terror of us, when they shall hear, that we do <lb/>
            not, as men in dread, sit at home, and shrink from them ; but <lb/>
            that, as soon as we perceive them advancing, we march to <lb/>
            meet them, in order that we may close with them as soon as <lb/>
            possible; and that we do not wait till our own country is <lb/>
            ravaged by them, but that we anticipate them by laying <lb/>
            waste their lands. 19. And," added he, " if we render them <lb/>
            more timid, and ourselves more bold, I think that it will be a <lb/>
            great advantage to us ; and consider that the danger will thus <lb/>
            be rendered much less to us, and much greater to the enemy. <lb/>
            My father, too, always says, you yourself say, and all others <lb/>
            agree, that battles are decided rather by courage than by <lb/>
            strength of body. 20. Thus spoke Cyrus, and Cyaxares re­ <lb/>
            plied, "Do not imagine, Cyrus, and you other Persians, that I <lb/>
            am at all discontented at maintaining you. To march into the <lb/>
            enemy's country, however, appears also to me to be now in <lb/>
            every respect the better course." " Since, then," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            " we agree in opinion, let us get all things ready, and as soon <lb/>
            as our sacrifices to the gods express assent, 1 let us set out <lb/>
            without delay."</p>
          <p>21. Accordingly they gave orders to the soldiers to have <lb/>
            their baggage in readiness. Cyrus then sacrificed, first to <lb/>
            Jupiter the king, and afterwards to the other deities ; and <lb/>
            prayed, that they would be propitious and benevolent, good <lb/>
            guides, supporters, and allies, to the army, and counsellors in <lb/>
            whatever was good. He invoked likewise the heroes, who <lb/>
            dwelt in and protected the land of Media. 22. When he <lb/>
            found the sacrifices favourable, and his army was assem­ <lb/>
            bled upon the borders, he at once, meeting with propitious <lb/>
            omens, advanced into the enemy's country. As soon as he <lb/>
            had passed the borders, he performed propitiatory rites to the <note type="footnote"> 1 Simul ac res divinæ nobis annuere incipiant. Bornemann. </note> <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            Earth with libations, and sought the favour of the gods and <lb/>
            heroes that dwell in Assyria with sacrifices. Having done <lb/>
            this, he sacrificed again to Jupiter Patrius; and whatever <lb/>
            other deity occurred to him, he did not neglect.</p>
          <p>23. When these things were duly performed, they immedi­ <lb/>
            ately led the infantry a short distance forward, and en­ <lb/>
            camped ; and then, making excursions with the horse, they <lb/>
            captured much booty of every kind. For some time after, <lb/>
            too, they continued, while changing their encampments, get­ <lb/>
            ting abundance of provisions, and laying waste the country, <lb/>
            to wait the approach of the enemy. 24. When they were said <lb/>
            to be advancing, and not to be more than ten days' march <lb/>
            distant, Cyrus said, "Now, Cyaxares, is the time for us to <lb/>
            march and meet them, and not to appear, either to the enemy <lb/>
            or to our own people, afraid of advancing against them ; but <lb/>
            let us make it evident, that we do not come to battle with <lb/>
            them against our will." 25. As this suggestion was ap­ <lb/>
            proved by Cyaxares, they advanced in order, each day as far <lb/>
            as they thought proper; they took their supper always by <lb/>
            day-light, and kindled no fires in their camp at night; in the <lb/>
            front of the camp, however, they did kindle some, that, by <lb/>
            means of them, they might see if any people approached in <lb/>
            the night, and might not be seen themselves by those ap­ <lb/>
            proaching ; they also frequently made fires behind the camp, <lb/>
            in order to deceive the enemy, so that the enemy's scouts <lb/>
            sometimes fell in with the outposts, thinking themselves to be <lb/>
            still at a distance from the camp, because the fires were behind.</p>
          <p>26. The Assyrians, then, and those that were with them, as <lb/>
            soon as the armies drew near each other, surrounded them­ <lb/>
            selves with a trench; a practice which the Barbarian kings <lb/>
            observe to this day. Wherever they encamp, they throw a <lb/>
            trench round them with ease by means of the multitude of <lb/>
            their hands ; for they know that an army of cavalry, espe­ <lb/>
            dally of Barbarian cavalry, is confused and unwieldy ; 27. for <lb/>
            they have their horses tied by the feet at their mangers, and, <lb/>
            if an enemy comes upon them, it is a trouble in the darkness <lb/>
            to loose the horses, a trouble to bridle them, a trouble to put <lb/>
            on their housings, and a trouble to fasten their breastplates ; <lb/>
            and, when they have mounted their horses, it is absolutely <lb/>
            impossible for them to ride them through the camp.1 On all <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Anab. iii. 4. 35. </note> <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            these accounts, other Barbarians as well as they surround <lb/>
            themselves with a trench; and they also imagine, that to be <lb/>
            within an intrenchment gives them the power of fighting <lb/>
            only when they please. Observing these precautions, they <lb/>
            approached each other.</p>
          <p>28. When they had come so near, that they were distant <lb/>
            only about a parasang, the Assyrians encamped in the man­ <lb/>
            ner before mentioned, in a post intrenched, but open to <lb/>
            view; Cyrus, in a place as much concealed as possible, <lb/>
            keeping villages and rising grounds before him, consider­ <lb/>
            ing that all things in war that discover themselves on a sud­ <lb/>
            den, are the more alarming to the enemy. And both parties, <lb/>
            posting advanced guards, as was proper, went to rest for <lb/>
            that night.</p>
          <p>29. The next day, the Assyrian king, and Crœsus, and the <lb/>
            other leaders, gave their armies rest in their fortified camp. <lb/>
            Cyrus and Cyaxares waited in order of battle, as intending to <lb/>
            fight, if the enemy advanced. But as it appeared that the <lb/>
            enemy would not stir out of their intrenchment, nor come to <lb/>
            an engagement that day, Cyaxares summoned Cyrus and the <lb/>
            officers of the other troops to him, and spoke to this effect: <lb/>
            so. " It is my opinion, friends," said he, " that we should ad­ <lb/>
            vance, in the order in which we are, up to the intrenchment <lb/>
            of these men, and show them that we are ready to come to a <lb/>
            battle ; for, by this means," said he, " if they do not come out <lb/>
            against us, our men will return with an accession of courage, <lb/>
            and the enemy, observing our boldness, will be the more <lb/>
            alarmed." 31. This was the opinion of Cyaxares ; but Cyrus <lb/>
            said, " By the gods, Cyaxares, let us by no means act thus ; <lb/>
            for if we now discover ourselves, and march forward as you <lb/>
            desire, the enemy will see us advance without fear, knowing <lb/>
            themselves to be in a situation secure from danger ; and, when <lb/>
            we retire without attempting anything, they, seeing our num­ <lb/>
            bers much inferior to theirs, will conceive a contempt for us, <lb/>
            and will march out against us to-morrow with greater reso­ <lb/>
            lution. 32. But now," said he, " while they know we are at <lb/>
            hand, and do not yet see us, be assured that they do not contemn <lb/>
            us, but are solicitous to know what our intention is; and are, <lb/>
            I know very well, incessantly occupied in talking about us. <lb/>
            But when they come forth, then must we, at once, make our <lb/>
            appearance, and come to close quarters with them, taking <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            them at the advantage which we have long desired." 33. <lb/>
            When Cyrus had spoken thus, his suggestion was approved <lb/>
            both by Cyaxares and the other officers. Then, having taken <lb/>
            their suppers, placed their guards, and kindled several fires in <lb/>
            front of the sentinels, they went to rest.</p>
          <p>34. The next day, early in the morning, Cyrus, with a <lb/>
            crown upon his head, made a sacrifice; and ordered the rest <lb/>
            of the officers, Equals-in-honour, to attend the sacred rites <lb/>
            with crowns. When the sacrifice was over, Cyrus called them <lb/>
            together, and said, " The gods, friends, as the diviners say, <lb/>
            and as I myself think, foretell that there will be a battle; <lb/>
            they grant us victory, and promise us safety by the victims. <lb/>
            35. I should be ashamed to exhort you what sort of men you <lb/>
            ought to prove yourselves on such an occasion; for I know <lb/>
            that you understand, and have practised and learned, and are <lb/>
            continually learning, the same things as myself; so that you <lb/>
            may justly instruct others in them. But if you have not <lb/>
            taken into consideration the following particulars, pray listen <lb/>
            to me. 36. Those men that we have lately received as our <lb/>
            fellow-combatants, and are endeavouring to make similar to <lb/>
            ourselves, it is your part to remind for what object we are all <lb/>
            maintained by Cyaxares ; what exercises we learned, to what <lb/>
            exertions we invited them, and in what point they said that <lb/>
            they would joyfully be our rivals. 37. Put them in mind, <lb/>
            likewise, that this day will show of what every one is deserv­ <lb/>
            ing ; for, in things in which men have been late learners, it <lb/>
            is no wonder if some of them have need of a monitor; and it <lb/>
            is satisfactory if they can show themselves deserving characters <lb/>
            even with admonition. 38. In doing this, too, you will make <lb/>
            trial of yourselves ; for he that, upon such an occasion, is able <lb/>
            to make others better men, may justly feel conscious of being <lb/>
            himself perfectly good; but he who, in such duties, can ad­ <lb/>
            monish himself only, and rests satisfied with doing so, should, <lb/>
            in justice, account himself but half perfect. 39. The reason <lb/>
            why I do not address these men myself, but bid you speak to <lb/>
            them, is, that they may endeavour to please you ; for you are <lb/>
            immediately conversant with them, each of you, in his par­ <lb/>
            ticular division. And be assured," added he, " that, if you <lb/>
            show yourselves to them to be courageous, you will teach <lb/>
            them courage, and many more,1 not by word, but by deed," <note type="footnote"> 1 The Medes, Armenians, and Chaldeans. </note> <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            40. In conclusion, lie bid them go, crowned as they were, to <lb/>
            take their breakfast, and after making libations, to come <lb/>
            crowned to their posts.</p>
          <p>When these were gone, he summoned the captains in the <lb/>
            rear to him, and gave them an exhortation to this effect: 41. <lb/>
            " You, likewise, men of Persia, have been admitted among <lb/>
            the Equals-in-honour, and have been chosen1 to command the <lb/>
            rear, as men who appear to be equal, in other respects, to the <lb/>
            bravest, and, by your age, to excel others in discretion. You <lb/>
            have, accordingly, a station assigned you, which is not less <lb/>
            honourable than that of the commanders in front; for, being <lb/>
            placed in the rear, and observing such as are brave, and en­ <lb/>
            couraging them, you make them still better men; and, if any <lb/>
            one is remiss, you do not suffer him to continue so. 42. Vic­ <lb/>
            tory, if it be of advantage to any, is advantageous to you, both <lb/>
            by reason of your age, and the weight of your military equip­ <lb/>
            ments. If they, therefore, who are in front, call to you, and <lb/>
            exhort you to follow, obey them; and that you may not be <lb/>
            outdone by them in this respect, exhort them, in return, to <lb/>
            lead with still more despatch against the enemy. Go, then," <lb/>
            said he, “ and when you have taken your breakfast, come, <lb/>
            crowned with the rest, to 'your posts." 43. Thus did Cyrus <lb/>
            and his men occupy themselves.</p>
          <p>The Assyrians, when they had breakfasted, marched boldly <lb/>
            forth, and ranged themselves with great spirit. The king him­ <lb/>
            self appointed them their places, driving round in his chariot; <lb/>
            and addressed to them an exhortation to this purpose : 44. “Men <lb/>
            of Assyria, it is now incumbent on you to be brave men, for you <lb/>
            have now to fight for your lives, for the land in which you <lb/>
            were born, for the houses in which you were brought up, foi <lb/>
            your wives and children, and for everything valuable that you <lb/>
            possess. If you conquer, you will remain masters of all theso <lb/>
            as before; if you are defeated, be assured you give them all <lb/>
            up to the enemy. 45. As you desire victory, therefore, stand <lb/>
            firm, and fight; for it is folly for those that desire conquest, <lb/>
            to turn the blind, unarmed, and handless parts of their <lb/>
            bodies towards the enemy by flight. He is a fool, who, de­ <lb/>
            siring to live, should attempt to flee, when he knows that the <lb/>
            conquerors save their lives, and that runaways meet their <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιλελγμέοι ἐστέ</foreign>.] Eo pertinet qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>d lecti erant <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούραγοί</foreign>. <lb/>

            death more certainly than they who stand their ground. He <lb/>
            also is a fool, who, desiring gain, incurs a defeat ; for who does <lb/>
            not know that conquerors save all that belongs to themselves, <lb/>
            and acquire, in addition, all that belongs to the defeated <lb/>
            enemy, but that they who are conquered, throw both them­ <lb/>
            selves and all that belongs to them away?" 46. In such a <lb/>
            manner was the Assyrian monarch employed.</p>
          <p>But Cyaxares, sending to Cyrus, told him, that now was <lb/>
            the time for leading on against the enemy ; " for, if there <lb/>
            are yet but few," said he, " advanced beyond the intrench­ <lb/>
            ment, by the time we arrive there will be great numbers of <lb/>
            them; let us not, therefore, wait till they are more numerous <lb/>
            than ourselves ; but let us march, whilst we think we may <lb/>
            still easily master them." 47. But Cyrus replied, " Unless <lb/>
            those, Cyaxares, that we shall defeat, amount to above half <lb/>
            the number of the enemy, be assured they will say that we, <lb/>
            from being afraid of their numbers, attacked but a few of <lb/>
            them; while they will not consider themselves defeated, but <lb/>
            you will be obliged to fight another battle, in which, perhaps, <lb/>
            they may contrive better than they have now contrived, <lb/>
            when they give themselves up to us to portion them out, so as <lb/>
            to engage with as many of them as we please." 48. The mes­ <lb/>
            sengers, on hearing this, went their way.</p>
          <p>At this time Chrysantas the Persian came up, and others <lb/>
            of the Equals-in-honour, bringing with them some deserters. <lb/>
            Cyrus, as was to be expected, put some questions to these <lb/>
            deserters as to the state of affairs among the enemy. They <lb/>
            told him, that they were already marching out under arms; <lb/>
            that the king was come out and was ranging them; and that, <lb/>
            as they passed in succession, he addressed to them many <lb/>
            warm and earnest exhortations, as those who had heard him, <lb/>
            they said, reported. 49. Chrysantas then said, " What if you too, <lb/>
            Cyrus, should call the soldiers together, and exhort them, while <lb/>
            you have yet time, if, indeed, you may thus make them at all <lb/>
            better men?" so. Cyrus replied, "0 Chrysantas, let not the <lb/>
            exhortations of the Assyrian king disturb you; for no exhort­ <lb/>
            ation, however excellent, can on the instant make the hearers <lb/>
            of it brave, who were not brave before ; nor can it make those <lb/>
            archers, who have not before practised archery, or javelin- <lb/>
            throwers, or horsemen ; nor can it make those capable of bodily <lb/>
            labour, who have not been previously inured to it." 51. " But <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            it is enough," rejoined Chrysantas, "if you can make their <lb/>
            minds better by an exhortation." " And can a single word," re­ <lb/>
            plied Cyrus, " spoken on the instant, inspire the minds of the <lb/>
            hearers with a feeling of self-respect, or hinder them from <lb/>
            doing things mean and base, or influence them to undergo, as <lb/>
            they ought, all labours, and to run all hazards, for the sake of <lb/>
            praise, or establish firmly in their minds the sentiment, that <lb/>
            to die fighting is preferable to saving their lives by flight ? <lb/>
            52. If such sentiments," said he, " are to be instilled into men, <lb/>
            and to be made enduring, must there not, in the first place, <lb/>
            be laws established, by which a life of honour and liberty will <lb/>
            be provided for the brave, and an abject, painful, and value­ <lb/>
            less existence will be allotted to the worthless ? 53. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, methinks, there must be teachers and governors for <lb/>
            these purposes, who may direct men aright, and teach and <lb/>
            accustom them to practise such a course of conduct, until it <lb/>
            becomes inherent in them to think that the brave and hon­ <lb/>
            ourable are in reality the happiest of men, and to believe that <lb/>
            the vicious and infamous are of all men the most miserable ; <lb/>
            for thus ought those to stand affected, who are to prove their <lb/>
            discipline superior to the fear of the enemy. 54. But if, at the <lb/>
            very time when men are going in arms to the field of battle, <lb/>
            and when many are even deprived of the power of using <lb/>
            their former acquirements, a man could then, by putting to­ <lb/>
            gether a set form of words, make men soldiers at once, it <lb/>
            would thus be the easiest thing in the world both to learn <lb/>
            and to teach the greatest of the virtues that belong to men. <lb/>
            55. I could not feel certain that the men whom we now have, <lb/>
            and whom we have trained under ourselves, would stand <lb/>
            firm, unless I saw you here present with them, who will be <lb/>
            examples to them, to show them what sort of characters they <lb/>
            ought to be, and will be able to remind them, if they forget <lb/>
            anything that they have learned. I should wonder indeed," <lb/>
            said he, " Chrysantas, if a speech, however finely spoken, <lb/>
            should avail with men wholly undisciplined in virtue, to lead <lb/>
            them to honourable exertion, any more than a song, however <lb/>
            well sung, could profit such as were wholly ignorant of music, <lb/>
            so as to make them understand music."</p>
          <p>56. They were engaged in this discourse, when Cyaxares <lb/>
            again sent word to Cyrus, that he was wrong to waste time, <lb/>
            and not to march immediately against the enemy. Cyrus <pb n="99"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            made answer to the messengers, " Let him be assured," said <lb/>
            he, " that as many of them are not yet come out as is desir­ <lb/>
            able ; and tell him this, openly, before all; but, since he <lb/>
            thinks it proper, I will lead forward this instant." 57. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing said this, and made supplications to the gods, he drew out <lb/>
            the army. As soon as he began to put forward with more <lb/>
            despatch, he led the way, and the men followed, keeping good <lb/>
            order, because they had been taught and trained to march <lb/>
            with regularity; inspired with great resolution, because they <lb/>
            were emulous of each other, because their bodies had been <lb/>
            inured to labour, and because all their officers were at the head <lb/>
            of them ; and animated with pleasure, because they under­ <lb/>
            stood what they were going about; for they knew, and had <lb/>
            long since learned, that it was their safest and easiest course <lb/>
            to close at once with the enemy, especially when the enemy <lb/>
            consisted of archers, javelin-throwers, and cavalry. 58. While <lb/>
            they were yet beyond reach of the enemy's weapons, Cyrus <lb/>
            gave out the watch-word, " JUPITER OUR ALLY AND LEADER." <lb/>
            When the word came round to him again,l he commenced the <lb/>
            usual paean; and all the soldiers devoutly accompanied him <lb/>
            with a loud voice; for in such circumstances they who fear <lb/>
            the gods are the less in fear of men. 59. When the hymn <lb/>
            was over, the Equals-in-honour, marching with alacrity and <lb/>
            good discipline, and looking round on each other, calling by <lb/>
            name those that were on each side of them, and those that <lb/>
            were behind, and frequently crying out, " Come on, friends ! <lb/>
            come on, brave men !" exhorted one another to follow ; while <lb/>
            they that were in the rear, hearing this, exhorted the fore­ <lb/>
            most, in their turn, to lead on with resolution. Cyrus had <lb/>
            thus an army full of spirit, eagerness for honour, vigour, <lb/>
            boldness, mutual exhortation, discretion, and obedience; a <lb/>
            state of things which I think most formidable to an enemy.</p>
          <p>so. Of the Assyrians, those who fought from chariots in <lb/>
            front, as soon as the body of the Persians drew near, mounted <lb/>
            their chariots, and retired to their own body; while their <lb/>
            archers, javelin-men, and slingers, discharged their weapons, <lb/>
            long before they could reach the enemy. 61. As soon as the <lb/>
            Persians came upon these weapons, thus discharged, Cyrus <lb/>
            cried aloud, “ Now, my brave men, let each of you press on <lb/>
            and distinguish himself, and pass this word to the rest." <note type="footnote"> I Anab. i. 8. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            They accordingly passed it; and some, from zeal and ardour, <lb/>
            and eagerness to close with the enemy, began to run. 62. <lb/>
            The whole body then followed, running; and Cyrus him­ <lb/>
            self, forgetting his slower pace, led them on running, and <lb/>
            cried out, at the same time, 63. “ Who will follow ? who is <lb/>
            brave ? who will first strike down his man ?" The men, <lb/>
            hearing this, cried out in the same manner; and the word <lb/>
            ran, as he first uttered it, through them all, " Who will fol­ <lb/>
            low ? who is brave ? " In such a spirit did the Persians close <lb/>
            with the enemy.</p>
          <p>The enemy were unable to stand their charge, but turned, <lb/>
            and fled to the intrenchment. 64. The Persians, following <lb/>
            them to the entrance, struck down many of them, as they <lb/>
            were pushing against each other, and, leaping in after such as <lb/>
            fell into the trench, killed men and horses together; for some <lb/>
            of the chariots, in their flight, could not avoid falling into the <lb/>
            trench. 65. The Median cavalry, observing this state of <lb/>
            things, charged the enemy's cavalry, which gave way before <lb/>
            them. Then followed a pursuit of both horses and men, and <lb/>
            a great slaughter of both. 66. Those who were within the <lb/>
            Assyrian intrenchment, and were posted at the head of it; had, <lb/>
            by reason of the dreadful spectacle before them, and of their <lb/>
            own terror, neither skill nor ability to do execution with their <lb/>
            arrows and javelins, upon those that were making destruction <lb/>
            of their people. Learning, too, soon after, that some of the <lb/>
            Persians had cut their way through at the entrances of the <lb/>
            intrenchment, they turned away, and fled from the higher <lb/>
            parts of it. 67. The Assyrian women, and those of their <lb/>
            allies, both such as had children, and such as were of the <lb/>
            younger sort, seeing that flight had begun even in the camp, <lb/>
            raised a cry and ran up and down in consternation, rending <lb/>
            their clothes and tearing themselves, and begging of every one <lb/>
            they met, not to flee and abandon them, but to stand by <lb/>
            them, their children, and each other. 68. The princes them­ <lb/>
            selves, with their most faithful adherents, standing at the <lb/>
            entrances of the intrenchment, and mounting on the higher <lb/>
            parts,2 fought themselves, and encouraged the rest. 69. <lb/>
            Cyrus, as soon as he saw how things stood, being afraid lest, <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επὶ τη̃ς κεφαλη̃ς τη̃ς τάφρου</foreign>. ] In summo aggere ejus fossæ, <lb/>

            as they were but few, they should incur some harm from the <lb/>
            great multitude of the enemy, if they forced their way in, gave <lb/>
            orders to retreat slowly out of the reach of the enemy's wea­ <lb/>
            pons, and required prompt obedience in so doing. 70. Here a <lb/>
            spectator might distinguish the Equals-in-honour, who had <lb/>
            been properly disciplined; for they instantly obeyed, and in­ <lb/>
            stantly communicated the order to the rest. When they were <lb/>
            beyond reach of the enemy's weapons, they drew them­ <lb/>
            selves up in their places, much more regularly than a set of <lb/>
            dancers; knowing exactly where each ought to be.</p>

          <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
          <p>Cyrus returns thanks to the gods, congratulates Cyaxares, and rewards his <lb/>
            deserving soldiers, especially Chrysantas, on account of the victory which <lb/>
            he obtained. He thinks of pursuing the enemy, but is retarded by the <lb/>
            envy and inactivity of Cyaxares, who at last, however, gives him leave to <lb/>
            undertake the pursuit with as many troops as would willingly follow him.</p>
          <p>i. CYRUS, having waited there a considerable time with the <lb/>
            army, and having shown that they were ready to fight, if any <lb/>
            force would come out against them, led back his troops, as no <lb/>
            one came forth to attack him, to such a distance as he thought <lb/>
            proper, and encamped.</p>
          <p>Having then placed sentinels, and sent out scouts, he took <lb/>
            his stand in the midst of the camp, and, calling his soldiers <lb/>
            around him, spoke to this effect: 2. " Men of Persia, I give <lb/>
            in the first place all possible praise to the gods; and I believe <lb/>
            that you do the same; for we have obtained victory and <lb/>
            safety. For these benefits, therefore, it is our duty to make <lb/>
            thank-offerings to the gods from whatever we may have in <lb/>
            our possession. I now praise you all generally; for the <lb/>
            achievement that has been performed was the honourable <lb/>
            work of you all; and when I have ascertained from the proper <lb/>
            persons what each man deserves, I will endeavour, both in <lb/>
            word and deed, to give every one his due. 3. With respect <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            to Chrysantas, indeed, who was the centurion nearest to me, <lb/>
            I have no need to inquire of others, for I myself know how <lb/>
            he conducted himself; for he did whatever else I believe you <lb/>
            an did; and when I gave orders to retreat, calling upon him <lb/>
            by name, he at once, though he had his sword lifted up, with <lb/>
            intent to strike an enemy, obeyed me, and, desisting from <lb/>
            what he was proceeding to do, executed my directions; for <lb/>
            he retreated himself, and transmitted the order, with the <lb/>
            greatest despatch, to others ; so that he brought his century <lb/>
            beyond the reach of the missiles before the enemy perceived <lb/>
            that we were retreating, or could bend their bows, or throw <lb/>
            their javelins; and thus he was himself unhurt, and kept his <lb/>
            men unhurt through his obedience. 4. But there are others," <lb/>
            added he, “that I see wounded; concerning whom, when I <lb/>
            have ascertained at what time it was that they were wounded, <lb/>
            I will then declare my opinion. Chrysantas, as a man active <lb/>
            in the duties of the field, prudent, and fitted both to obey and <lb/>
            command, I now reward with the captaincy of a thousand; <lb/>
            and whenever the gods grant us any further advantage, I will <lb/>
            not then forget him. 5. I am desirous too," continued he, <lb/>
            "to give you a word of admonition. What you have now <lb/>
            seen in this battle, never cease to bear in mind; that you <lb/>
            may always decide for yourselves, whether it is flight or <lb/>
            valour that saves men's lives ; whether they who are willing <lb/>
            to engage come off the better, or those who are unwilling; <lb/>
            and what sort of pleasure it is that victory affords. You may <lb/>
            now the better form a judgment of these things, as you have <lb/>
            had experience of them, and as the affair has so recently <lb/>
            taken place. 6. By keeping these considerations always pre­ <lb/>
            sent to your minds, you will become the better soldiers. Now, <lb/>
            like men who are favoured of heaven, and who are brave and <lb/>
            prudent, take your suppers, make libations to the gods, com­ <lb/>
            mence the pæan, and await the word of command."</p>
          <p>7. Having spoken thus, he mounted his horse and rode off, <lb/>
            and joined Cyaxares. When he had congratulated him, as was <lb/>
            proper, and had seen how things stood there, and inquired <lb/>
            whether Cyaxares had any further need of him, he rode back <lb/>
            to his own army. Cyrus's men, having taken their suppers <lb/>
            and placed the necessary sentinels, went to rest.</p>
          <p>8. The Assyrians, as their prince1 was killed, and almost <note type="footnote">1 Neriglissar. i. 4. 16. </note> <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1. ] </note> <lb/>
            all the bravest of their men with him, were all in dejection, <lb/>
            and many of them fled from the camp in the night. Crœsus, <lb/>
            and their other allies, on beholding this state of things, lost <lb/>
            all courage, for everything around them was full of difficul­ <lb/>
            ties. What caused the greatest despondency among them all, <lb/>
            was, that the principal nation1 in the army were alto­ <lb/>
            gether unsettled in their opinions. They in consequence <lb/>
            quitted the camp, and went off in the night.</p>
          <p>9. As soon as it was day, and the camp of the enemy <lb/>
            seemed entirely abandoned, Cyrus immediately led the Per­ <lb/>
            sians into it first. Great numbers of sheep and oxen had <lb/>
            been left there by the enemy; and many waggons full of <lb/>
            abundance of valuable things. Soon after, all the Medes, <lb/>
            with Cyaxares, marched in, and there took their dinners. <lb/>
            to. When they had dined, Cyrus called his centurions to­ <lb/>
            gether, and spoke to them to this effect: “What advantages, <lb/>
            and what excellent opportunities, my friends, do we appear <lb/>
            to throw away, when the gods offer them to us ! You your­ <lb/>
            selves now see that the enemy have fled from us; and how <lb/>
            can any one imagine that they who, when possessed of an in­ <lb/>
            trenched post, quitted it and fled, will stand and look us in <lb/>
            the face on equal ground? How will they, who did not <lb/>
            stand while they were as yet unacquainted with us, stand <lb/>
            now, after they have been beaten by us, and suffered so much <lb/>
            damage at our hands ? How should the worst of those resolve <lb/>
            to fight with us, of whom the best have been destroyed ?" <lb/>
            11. Some one then exclaimed, " Why do we not immediately <lb/>
            pursue, when the advantages of pursuit are so evident?" <lb/>
            Cyrus replied, "Because we want horses; for the best of the <lb/>
            enemy's men, and such as it is most for our purpose to cap­ <lb/>
            ture or kill, are gone off on horseback; whom we, with the <lb/>
            help of the gods, are able to put to flight, but are not able to <lb/>
            overtake in pursuit." 12. “Why then," said they, " do not <lb/>
            you go to Cyaxares, and tell him this?" Cyrus rejoined, <lb/>
            “Come, then, all of you, along with me; that he may see <lb/>
            that we are all of the same mind." They accordingly all <lb/>
            followed him, and said what they thought calculated to obtain <lb/>
            that which they had in view.</p>
          <p>is. Cyaxares felt in some degree envious, as it were, be­ <lb/>
            cause they had begun the discourse upon the subject, and <note type="footnote"> I The Assyrians. </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            thought it perhaps, at the same time, not desirable to hazard <lb/>
            another battle, (for he was indulging himself in pleasure, and <lb/>
            knew that many of the Medes were following his example,) <lb/>
            and he in consequence replied to this effect: 14. "1 am con­ <lb/>
            vinced, Cyrus, both from what I see and what I hear, that <lb/>
            you Persians are anxious, more than any other men, not to <lb/>
            give yourselves up insatiably to any one kind of pleasure; <lb/>
            but I am of opinion, that it is by much the most advantageous <lb/>
            thing to be master of one's self in the greatest pleasure of all. <lb/>
            And what gives men greater pleasure than good fortune, <lb/>
            such as has now befallen us ? 15. If then, when we are in pros­ <lb/>
            perity, we take care to preserve it with discretion, perhaps <lb/>
            we may, without hazard, reach old age in happiness; but if <lb/>
            we pursue it intemperately, and endeavour to secure one <lb/>
            piece of good fortune after another, take care lest we suffer <lb/>
            the same fate that they say many people incur at sea, who, <lb/>
            from having been once fortunate, are unwilling to cease re­ <lb/>
            peating their voyages, and are lost; and many, they say, <lb/>
            having obtained one victory, and aiming at more, have lost <lb/>
            the benefit of the first. 16. If, indeed, the enemy, who have <lb/>
            fled, were fewer than we, perhaps we might pursue a smaller <lb/>
            number with safety ; but consider with how small a part of <lb/>
            them it was that our whole number fought, and conquered ; <lb/>
            the rest were out of the action, who, unless we force them to <lb/>
            fight, will go off in ignorance and cowardice, without know­ <lb/>
            ing our strength or their own. But if they shall find that <lb/>
            they are not less in danger in retreating than in standing <lb/>
            their ground, take care lest we force them, even against <lb/>
            their will, to act bravely; 17. for be assured, that you are not <lb/>
            more desirous to seize their wives and children, than they are <lb/>
            to preserve them; and reflect that even swine, when they are <lb/>
            discovered, betake themselves, though in great numbers, to <lb/>
            flight, together with their young; but that, if a man pursue <lb/>
            one of their little ones, the sow, though she be single, does <lb/>
            not continue her flight, but attacks the pursuer that attempts <lb/>
            to seize it. 18. And these men, upon this recent occasion, <lb/>
            having shut themselves up in an intrenchment, let themselves <lb/>
            be parcelled out by us in such a manner, that we might engage <lb/>
            with as many of them as we pleased at a time. But if we <lb/>
            march up to them in an open country, and they shall learn, by <lb/>
            dividing themselves, to oppose us partly in front, as at pre- <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            sent, partly on the flanks, and partly on the rear, take care <lb/>
            lest every one of us may stand in need of many hands and eyes. <lb/>
            Besides," said he, " as I see the Medes enjoying themselves, I <lb/>
            should not now be willing to rouse them and compel them to <lb/>
            run again into danger."</p>
          <p>19. Cyrus, in reply, said, " Compel no one then, but merely <lb/>
            allow those to follow me that are willing to do so. Perhaps <lb/>
            we may come back, and bring you, and each of these friends <lb/>
            of yours, something with which you may all be pleased. We <lb/>
            will not pursue the main body of the enemy: for how could <lb/>
            we even overtake them ? But if we meet with any stragglers <lb/>
            from the rest of the army, or anything left behind, we will <lb/>
            come and bring it you. 20. Consider too," said lie, "that <lb/>
            when you wanted us, we came a long way to gratify you ; <lb/>
            you ought justly therefore to gratify us in return, that we <lb/>
            may go home possessed of something, and, besides, may not <lb/>
            all of us look to your treasury." 21. Cyaxares then said, <lb/>
            " If any, indeed, would attend you voluntarily, I should feel <lb/>
            obliged to you." " Send with me then one of these trust­ <lb/>
            worthy persons here, who may communicate what you may <lb/>
            desire." " Take with you, then," said he, " which of them <lb/>
            you please." 22. The person happened to be present who had <lb/>
            said that he was his relation, and who had been kissed by <lb/>
            him; Cyrus, therefore, immediately said, " This man is suffi­ <lb/>
            cient for me." “Let him, then," said he, " attend you ; and <lb/>
            do you," said he to him, " announce that any one, who is <lb/>
            willing, may go with Cyrus." 23. Taking this man with him, <lb/>
            therefore, Cyrus went out. As soon as he had come forth, <lb/>
            Cyrus said to him, “You will now show whether you spoke <lb/>
            truth, when you said that you were delighted with the sight <lb/>
            of me." " I will not abandon you," said the Mede, " if that is <lb/>
            what you mean." 1 " And will you then exert yourself," said <lb/>
            Cyrus, " to bring out others with you likewise ? " The Mede <lb/>
            with an oath said, " By Jove, I will; until I make you look <lb/>
            upon me with delight." 24. This messenger of Cyaxares, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, delivered his message faithfully, in other respects, <lb/>
            to the Modes, and added this of himself, " That, for his <lb/>
            part, he would not desert this most honourable and excellent <note type="footnote"> 1 Ei <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυ̃το λέγεις</foreign>.] If you intimate that you would wish me to <lb/>

          <p>Messengers arrive from the Hyrcanians, who signify that they are going io <lb/>
            revolt from the Assyrians; Cyrus receives them as allies. He pursues the <lb/>
            enemy, and obtains a victory. His care for his troops and allies, and re­ <lb/>
            gulations as to the division of the spoil.</p>
          <p>1. WHILE Cyrus was engaged in these affairs, there arrived, <lb/>
            providentially as it were, messengers from the Hyrcanians. <lb/>
            The Hyrcanians border upon the Assyrians; they are not a <lb/>
            numerous nation, and in consequence are subject to the <lb/>
            Assyrians. At that time they appear to have been good <lb/>
            horsemen, and seem now to bear the same character ; hence <lb/>
            the Assyrians used them as the Lacedæmonians use the peo­ <lb/>
            ple of Sciros,l sparing them neither in labour nor in dangers ; <lb/>
            and they had commanded them on this occasion, being about <lb/>
            a thousand horse, to form the rear-guard, that in case any <lb/>
            danger threatened them behind, the Hyrcanians might meet <lb/>
            it before it reached themselves. 2. These Hyrcanians, as <lb/>
            being to march behind all, had their waggons in the rear, as <lb/>
            well as their domestics ; for most of the inhabitants of Asia, <lb/>
            when they go on military expeditions, are attended by those <lb/>
            with whom they live at home; and the Hyrcanians had now <lb/>
            taken the field with this train of attendants. 3. But as they <lb/>
            reflected with themselves what they suffered under the Assy­ <lb/>
            rians ; that the king of the Assyrians was now dead, and them­ <lb/>
            selves defeated; that great terror pervaded the army, and <lb/>
            that their allies were desponding and deserting ; it appeared <lb/>
            to them, on these considerations, to be a favourable opportunity <lb/>
            for revolting, if Cyrus's party would but fall upon the enemy in <lb/>
            conjunction with them. With this view they sent messengers <lb/>
            to Cyrus, for, since the battle, his fame had risen to the great­ <lb/>
            est height.</p>
          <p>4. The men that were sent told Cyrus, “ That they had a <note type="footnote"> I The people of Sciros, a city in Arcadia, served the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians for hire; they were not mixed with the Spartans, but kept <lb/>
            apart, and required to support the Spartans in the field wherever <lb/>
            they were hard pressed. Diod. Sic. xv. 32. </note> <pb n="107"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2 ] </note> <lb/>
            just hatred to the Assyrians ; and that, if he would now march <lb/>
            against them, they themselves would be his supporters, and <lb/>
            put him in the way." They gave him likewise an account <lb/>
            of the state of affairs among the enemy, being extremely <lb/>
            desirous to incite him to the expedition. 5. Cyrus then <lb/>
            asked them, " Do you think that we can overtake them be­ <lb/>
            fore they shelter themselves in their fortresses ? For," added <lb/>
            he, " we think it a great misfortune, that they stole away <lb/>
            from us." This he said with an intention to raise in them <lb/>
            as high an opinion as possible of himself and his people. 6. <lb/>
            They replied, " That if the Persians were to set out early in <lb/>
            the morning, and march with expedition, they might over­ <lb/>
            take them the next day ; as, by reason of their multitude, and <lb/>
            the number of their carriages, they marched very slowly; and <lb/>
            besides," added they, " having had no rest the night before, <lb/>
            they advanced but a little way, and are now encamped." 7. <lb/>
            Cyrus said, " Have you any pledge, then, to give us of what <lb/>
            you say, to convince us that you speak truth?" "We are <lb/>
            ready," said they, " to ride off this instant, and bring you <lb/>
            hostages to-night; only do you pledge your faith to us by the <lb/>
            gods, and give us your right hand, that what we ourselves <lb/>
            thus receive from you, we may communicate to the rest of our <lb/>
            people." 8. He accordingly gave them assurances, that if they <lb/>
            performed what they said, he would treat them as friends and <lb/>
            faithful adherents, so that they should not be of less consider­ <lb/>
            ation with him, than the Persians or Medes. And even to <lb/>
            this day we may see the Hyrcanians trusted, and holding posts <lb/>
            of government, like those of the Persians and Modes that ap­ <lb/>
            pear worthy of them.</p>
          <p>9. When they had dined, he led out the army, while it was <lb/>
            yet day, desiring the Hyrcanians to stay, that they might go <lb/>
            with him. All the Persians, as might be expected, were al­ <lb/>
            ready out, as well as Tigranes, with his forces. 10. Of the <lb/>
            Medes, some marched out, because, when they were boys, <lb/>
            they had been friends to Cyrus while yet a boy ; some, be­ <lb/>
            cause, when associating with him in his hunting expeditions, <lb/>
            they had been much struck with his demeanour; some from <lb/>
            gratitude, because he was thought to have freed them from <lb/>
            great terror; some from having hopes, that, as he already ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be a man of worth, he would hereafter prove ex­ <lb/>
            tremely fortunate and great; and some, because they were de­ <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            sirous to make a return for whatever service lie had done <lb/>
            them while he was brought up among the Modes, (and, from <lb/>
            good-nature, he had obtained a great many favours for many <lb/>
            of them from his grandfather;) but most of them went forth <lb/>
            with a view to getting spoil, because they saw the Hyrcanians <lb/>
            going, and because a report was spread abroad that they were <lb/>
            to lead the way to abundance of plunder. 11. Thus almost <lb/>
            all the Medes marched out, except those that were in the tent <lb/>
            with Cyaxares ; these remained, and the men that were under <lb/>
            their command. The rest hastened forth with pleasure and <lb/>
            zeal, as not going by constraint, but voluntarily, and with a <lb/>
            wish to oblige. 12. When they were out, he went first to <lb/>
            the Medes, and commended them, and prayed especially that <lb/>
            the gods, being propitious both to them, to himself, and to his <lb/>
            people, would vouchsafe to conduct them, and also that he <lb/>
            himself might be enabled to make them a grateful return for <lb/>
            their zeal. He told them, that the foot should lead the way, <lb/>
            and bid them follow with their horse; desiring that, wherever <lb/>
            they rested or suspended their march, some of their people <lb/>
            should ride up to him, so that they might ascertain from time <lb/>
            to time how it was proper to proceed. 13. Soon after, he <lb/>
            ordered the Hyrcanians 1 to lead on ; when they asked him, <lb/>
            " What! will you not wait till we bring our hostages, that <lb/>
            you may march with the pledges of our fidelity in your hands ?” <lb/>
            To this question it is said that he replied, " I consider that <lb/>
            we have pledges of your fidelity in our own hearts and <lb/>
            hands ; for we think ourselves so well provided, that, if you <lb/>
            prove to have spoken truth, we are in a condition to do you <lb/>
            service; while, if you deceive us, we suppose ourselves <lb/>
            sufficiently strong not to be in your power, but rather think, <lb/>
            if the gods please, that you will be in ours ; and since," said <lb/>
            he, " Hyrcanians, you say that your people march in the <lb/>
            rear, give us, as soon as you see them, a signal that they are <lb/>
            yours, in order that we may spare them." 14. The Hyrca­ <lb/>
            nians, on hearing these words, led the way as he ordered; <lb/>
            they admired his firmness of mind, and no longer dread­ <lb/>
            ed either the Assyrians, the Lydians, or their allies, but only <lb/>
            lest Cyrus should think it of little moment whether they were <lb/>
            present or absent.</p>
          <p>15. When they were on the march, and night was come on, <note type="footnote"> I The two Hyrcanian envoys. </note> <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] <lb/>
            </note>a clear light from heaven is said to have appeared to Cyrus, <lb/>
            and to the army; so that dread fell upon them all at the <lb/>
            divine manifestation, while courage was excited in them <lb/>
            against the enemy. As they marched without encumbrance <lb/>
            and with despatch, they cleared, as was to be expected, a <lb/>
            great portion of ground, and at the dawn of day drew near <lb/>
            the Hyrcanian army. 16. As soon as the messengers came in <lb/>
            sight of them, they told Cyrus that these were their people ; <lb/>
            for they said that they knew them from being the hindmost, <lb/>
            and from the number of fires. 17. He accordingly sent one <lb/>
            of the two messengers to them, ordering him to tell them that <lb/>
            if they were friends, they were at once to come to meet him, <lb/>
            holding up their right hands. He sent also one of his own <lb/>
            people with them, and bid him tell the Hyrcanians, that, when <lb/>
            he and his people saw them advancing, they themselves would <lb/>
            do the same thing. Thus one of the messengers stayed with <lb/>
            Cyrus ; and the other rode off to the Hyrcanians. 18. While <lb/>
            Cyrus was waiting to see what the Hyrcanians would do, he <lb/>
            made the army halt; and the chiefs of the Medes, with Ti­ <lb/>
            granes, rode up to him, and asked him what they were to <lb/>
            do. He told them in reply, “This body of troops, which <lb/>
            is nearest us, is that of the Hyrcanians ; one of their messen­ <lb/>
            gers is gone to them, and one of our people with him, to tell <lb/>
            them, if they are friends, to meet us all with their right hands <lb/>
            held up ; if, therefore, they do so, hold out your right hands <lb/>
            to them, in your several places,1 and encourage them; but if <lb/>
            they take to their arms, or attempt to flee, you must at once <lb/>
            endeavour to let none of these that we first meet with escape." <lb/>
            19. He gave them this charge; and the Hyrcanians, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing the report of the messengers, were in great joy, and leap­ <lb/>
            ing on their horses, came up, as had been told them, holding <lb/>
            out their right hands. The Medes and Persians, on their <lb/>
            side, held out their right hands to them, and encouraged them. <lb/>
            20. Soon after, Cyrus said, " Hyrcanians, we now trust you; <lb/>
            and it is your part to feel similarly towards us; but, in the <lb/>
            first place," said he, " tell us how far from hence is the place <lb/>
            where the enemy's officers are, and their main body ? " They <lb/>
            replied that it was little more than a parasang.</p>
          <p>21. Cyrus immediately exclaimed, "Come on then, Per- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καϑ ὃν ἂν ἦ ἕκαστοϚ</foreign> ] " Over against whomsoever each may <lb/>

            sians, Medes, and you, Hyrcanians; (for I now speak to you <lb/>
            as confederates and associates;) you must be well aware that <lb/>
            we are in such circumstances, that we must incur the greatest <lb/>
            severities of fortune if we act remissly; for the enemy know <lb/>
            for what purpose we come ; but if we march upon them with <lb/>
            vigour and spirit, charging them with our whole force, you <lb/>
            will soon see them, like slaves that have run away and are dis­ <lb/>
            covered, some supplicating for mercy, some flying, and some <lb/>
            without presence of mind enough to do either; since, beaten <lb/>
            as they have already been, they see us coming upon them a <lb/>
            second time, and, not having thought of the possibility of our <lb/>
            approach, will be surprised in disorder, and unprepared to <lb/>
            fight. 22. If, therefore, we desire, henceforward, to take our <lb/>
            food, to pass our nights, and to spend the rest of our lives, with <lb/>
            pleasure, let us not give them leisure to contrive or execute <lb/>
            anything for their own defence, or to know even that we are <lb/>
            men; but let them fancy that all that comes upon them is <lb/>
            shields, swords, scymetars, and blows. 23. And you, Hyrca­ <lb/>
            nians," said he, " extending your line before us, march on in <lb/>
            front, in order that, while your arms are seen, we may con­ <lb/>
            ceal ourselves as long as possible. When I have come up <lb/>
            with the enemy's army, leave with me, each of you, a troop <lb/>
            of horse, that I may make use of them, if I should require <lb/>
            them for any purpose, whilst I remain in the camp. 24. <lb/>
            You, commanders, and men of experience, march together, if <lb/>
            you are wise, in close order, that you may not be repulsed, if <lb/>
            you fall in with a compact body of the enemy; and send out <lb/>
            your younger men to pursue ; and let them kill all that they <lb/>
            can ; for it is our safest course, at present, to leave as few of <lb/>
            them alive as possible. 25. But if we defeat them," he added, <lb/>
            " we must beware of turning our attention to plunder; an <lb/>
            error which has changed the fortune of many when they had <lb/>
            victory in their hands; for he that does so is no longer a man, <lb/>
            but a baggage-bearer, and he that will, may use him as a <lb/>
            slave. 26. You ought to be sensible that there is nothing <lb/>
            more gainful than victory ; for the victor possesses himself of <lb/>
            everything at once, men, women, treasure, and the whole <lb/>
            country. Keep yourselves intent, therefore, only on securing <lb/>
            victory, for even the plunderer himself is in the power of the <lb/>
            conqueror. Remember too, when you are pursuing, to re- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΑὐτὸϚ ὁ ἁϱπάζων ἔχεται</foreign>.] In potestate victoris est. Poppo. </note> <pb n="111"/>

            turn again to me while it is yet day; for, after it is dark, we <lb/>
            shall no longer admit any one into the camp."</p>
          <p>27. Having said this, he dismissed them each to his own <lb/>
            century, desiring them to go and communicate these or­ <lb/>
            ders each to his captains of tens; (for the captains of tens <lb/>
            were all in front, so that they could hear;) and bidding them <lb/>
            order the captains of tens to give these directions each to his <lb/>
            own ten. The Hyrcanians then led the way; he himself <lb/>
            marched with the Persians in the centre, and posted the <lb/>
            horse, as usual, upon each wing.</p>
          <p>28. Among the enemy, as soon as day-light appeared, some <lb/>
            wondered what was coming to pass ; some soon discovered <lb/>
            what it was; some told it; some raised a shout; others loosed <lb/>
            their horses; others packed up their baggage; others threw <lb/>
            off the arms from the beasts of burden ; others began to arm <lb/>
            themselves; others mounted their horses; others bridled them ; <lb/>
            others helped the women into the carriages; others laid hold <lb/>
            on what they had of greatest value, to save it; and others <lb/>
            were found burying such things; but most of them betook <lb/>
            themselves to flight. It may be imagined that they did other <lb/>
            things of various kinds, but none fought, and they were cut <lb/>
            to pieces without making any opposition. 29. Crœsus, the <lb/>
            king of the Lydians, as it was summer, had sent forward his <lb/>
            women in the night, in chariots, that they might travel with <lb/>
            the more ease in the cool, and he himself, with the cavalry, <lb/>
            was following. 30. The Phrygian, they say, who was prince <lb/>
            of that Phrygia that lies upon the Hellespont, had acted in the <lb/>
            same manner. But when they made inquiries of some that <lb/>
            were fleeing, and overtook them, and learned what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened, they fled also themselves in the utmost haste. 31. The <lb/>
            kings of the Cappadocians, and of the Arabians, who were at <lb/>
            hand, and standing still without their corslets, the Hyrca­ <lb/>
            nians killed. The greatest number, however, of those that <lb/>
            fell were Assyrians and Arabians; for, being in their own <lb/>
            country, they had been most tardy in marching off. 32. The <lb/>
            Medes and Hyrcanians performed such achievements in the <lb/>
            pursuit as were to be expected from men that had gained a <lb/>
            victory. Cyrus ordered the horse, that had been left with <lb/>
            him, to ride round the camp, and kill all that they saw going <lb/>
            off with their arms; and, to those that remained, he ordered <lb/>
            it to be proclaimed, " That all soldiers of the enemy whatever, <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            whether horsemen, peltasts, or archers, should bring their <lb/>
            arms, bound up together, to him, and leave their horses at <lb/>
            their tents; and that whoever should not do so, should imme­ <lb/>
            diately lose his head." 33. Some, with their swords drawn, <lb/>
            stood round in order, while those who had arms brought <lb/>
            them, and threw them down upon the place that he appointed, <lb/>
            and those whom he directed to do so, burnt them.</p>
          <p>34. But Cyrus now began to reflect, that they were come <lb/>
            without either meat or drink, and that without supplies it was <lb/>
            impossible to prosecute a war, or do anything else. Considering, <lb/>
            therefore, how these supplies might be best and soonest procured, <lb/>
            he came to the conclusion, that for all men who were engaged <lb/>
            in military service, it was necessary that there should be some <lb/>
            certain person who should have charge of the tent, and who <lb/>
            should see that the provisions were ready for the soldiers when <lb/>
            they came in. 35. He judged, too, that of all people, such were <lb/>
            the most likely to have been surprised in the camp, because <lb/>
            they would be employed in collecting the baggage ; he accord­ <lb/>
            ingly ordered proclamation to be made, that all the stewards <lb/>
            should come to him, and, wherever there was no steward, the <lb/>
            oldest man of the tent; and he denounced the severest penal­ <lb/>
            ties to such as should disobey. They all however rendered obe­ <lb/>
            dience instantly, as they bad already seen their masters obey. <lb/>
            36. When they were come, he first ordered all such as had <lb/>
            provisions in their tents for more than two months to sit down. <lb/>
            37. When he had taken note of these, he then ordered such as <lb/>
            had provisions for one month to sit down. Upon this almost <lb/>
            all of them sat down. When he perceived that such was the <lb/>
            case, he addressed them thus : “Attend to me, my friends. If <lb/>
            any of you dislike evil, and desire to obtain any good from us, <lb/>
            take especial care that in each tent there be prepared double <lb/>
            the portion of meat and drink that you used to provide, each <lb/>
            day, for your masters and their domestics; and have every­ <lb/>
            thing else ready that will furnish a handsome entertainment; <lb/>
            the party that conquers, whichsoever it be, will soon be with <lb/>
            you, and will require to have all things necessary for them <lb/>
            in abundance. Be assured, therefore, that it may be of ser­ <lb/>
            vice to you to receive them in the most unexceptionable man­ <lb/>
            ner." 38. Having heard this announcement, they executed <lb/>
            the orders with the greatest diligence; while Cyrus, calling <lb/>
            the centurions together, spoke to them to this effect:</p><pb n="113"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH 2.] </note>" We know, friends, that it is now in our power to take <lb/>
            our dinners before our absent allies dine, and to apply <lb/>
            the choicest meats and drink to our own use ; but it does not <lb/>
            appear to me that such a dinner would be of more service <lb/>
            to us than to appear careful of our allies ; nor would such en­ <lb/>
            tertainment add more to our strength, than we should gain by <lb/>
            making our confederates zealous for our interest.1 39. If we <lb/>
            appear so negligent of those that are pursuing and killing <lb/>
            our enemies, and fighting any that oppose them, as to be found <lb/>
            to have dined before we know how they are faring, take care <lb/>
            lest we appear dishonourable in their sight, and grow weak by <lb/>
            losing our allies ? But to have regard to those who are en­ <lb/>
            gaged in dangers and toils for us, so that they may have every­ <lb/>
            thing prepared when they come in, is a treat that should more <lb/>
            delight us, as I conceive, than the present gratification of our <lb/>
            appetites. 40. Consider also," continued he, “that if we paid <lb/>
            no respect to our friends, still it is by no means proper for us <lb/>
            at present to indulge in feasting or drinking ; for what we <lb/>
            proposed has not yet been accomplished, while everything has <lb/>
            now reached a point requiring care; we have enemies in the <lb/>
            camp many times more numerous than ourselves, and un­ <lb/>
            confined; against whom we must be upon our guard, and <lb/>
            over whom we must place guards, that we may have people <lb/>
            to do necessary services for us. Our cavalry are absent, caus­ <lb/>
            ing us some anxiety as to where they may be, whether they <lb/>
            will come back to us, or whether they will stay away. 41. So <lb/>
            that, in my opinion, friends, only so much meat and drink ought <lb/>
            now to be taken by us, as may least tend to overwhelm us <lb/>
            with sleep and want of thought.2 42. There are besides great <lb/>
            treasures in the camp; of which, as being common to all that <lb/>
            were concerned in capturing them, I am not ignorant that it is <lb/>
            in our power to appropriate what we please ; but to take them <lb/>
            does not seem to me likely to be more profitable to us than to <lb/>
            appear honest, and by that means to make our allies regard us <lb/>
            with still more affection than at present. 43. And I am in­ <lb/>
            clined," added he, " to give up the distribution of these trea­ <lb/>
            sures to the Modes, Hyrcanians, and Tigranes, when they <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν αὔτη</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ εὐωχία, κ</foreign>. T. " Nor would this entertainment <lb/>
            make us stronger so much as if we should be able to make our allies <lb/>
            zealous." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, only a moderate quantity of meat and drink. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            come; and even to consider it an advantage, if they allot us <lb/>
            the smaller share; for, for the sake of such profit, they will <lb/>
            the more readily remain with us. 44. To gain a present ad­ <lb/>
            vantage might, indeed, afford us short-lived riches, but to re­ <lb/>
            linquish this temporary gain, and acquire those possessions <lb/>
            from which riches arise, will probably, in my opinion, procure <lb/>
            much more lasting wealth to ourselves and all belonging to us. <lb/>
            45. It was for this end, I think, that we practised at home to <lb/>
            gain a command over our appetites, and refrain from un­ <lb/>
            seasonable gains, that we might be able, if occasion required, <lb/>
            to exert these qualities for our advantage; and in what more <lb/>
            important circumstances than the present we could give a <lb/>
            proof of our education, I do not see."</p>
          <p>46. Thus spoke Cyrus; and Hystaspes, a Persian, one of the <lb/>
            Equals-in-honour, expressed himself in favour of his opinion, in <lb/>
            the manner following: “It would, indeed, be strange, Cyrus, if, <lb/>
            in hunting, we should often persevere in abstaining from food, <lb/>
            in order to get possession of some beast, perhaps of very little <lb/>
            value, but, when we are in pursuit of all that is valuable in <lb/>
            the world, should think it not at all dishonourable to us, if we <lb/>
            should suffer any of those things to be an obstacle to us, which <lb/>
            have command, indeed, over base men, but are under the coil­ <lb/>
            trol of the high-minded." 47. Thus spoke Hystaspes; and all <lb/>
            the rest approved his sentiments. Cyrus then said, “Well, <lb/>
            since we agree on this point, send out five men of each com­ <lb/>
            pany, such as are the most respected; let these walk round, <lb/>
            and whomsoever they find employed in providing necessaries, <lb/>
            let them commend them; but such as they find negligent, let <lb/>
            them chastise, even less sparingly than if they were their <lb/>
            masters." These men did as they were directed.</p>

          <p>Cyrus acknowledges the superior skill of the Medes and Assyrians in horse­ <lb/>
            manship. His institution of cavalry, and equestrian exercises, among the <lb/>
            Persians.</p>
          <p>1. SOME of the Medes were now bringing up waggons which <lb/>
            had gone forward from the enemy's camp, (having overtaken <lb/>
            and turned them back,) laden with things of which the army <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            stood in need. Others brought chariots that they had taken, <lb/>
            belonging to women of rank, some lawful wives, others con­ <lb/>
            cubines, that were carried about by these people on account of <lb/>
            their beauty; 2. for, to this day, all the inhabitants of Asia, <lb/>
            when they take the field, go to it accompanied with whatever <lb/>
            they value most; and say that they fight the better if their <lb/>
            dearest objects of affection are present with them ; for they de­ <lb/>
            clare that they feel compelled to defend them with ardour. Per­ <lb/>
            haps, indeed, it is so; but perhaps they observe the custom <lb/>
            merely to gratify their inclinations.</p>
          <p>3. Cyrus, observing what was done by the Medes and Hyr­ <lb/>
            canians, was almost angry with himself and those that were <lb/>
            with him, as the others seemed to outshine them at that time, <lb/>
            and to be continually making some capture or other, while <lb/>
            they themselves appeared to stand in comparative inaction. <lb/>
            They that brought the prizes, after showing them to Cyrus, <lb/>
            rode off again, in pursuit of the rest of the enemy; for they <lb/>
            said that they had been ordered to do so by their commanders. <lb/>
            Cyrus, though annoyed at this, yet ordered the things away <lb/>
            to proper places. He then called the centurions again toge­ <lb/>
            ther, and, standing in a place where they would easily hear <lb/>
            him, spoke thus: 4. " I believe, friends, you are all convinced, <lb/>
            that if we had had the taking of these things that now appear <lb/>
            before us, great gain would have been got by the Persians in <lb/>
            general, and the greatest, probably, by us, by whose agency <lb/>
            this enterprise has been effected. But how we, who are not <lb/>
            able of ourselves to acquire these possessions, can possibly be­ <lb/>
            come masters of them, I do not yet see, unless the Persians <lb/>
            provide a body of horse of their own. 5. For you observe," <lb/>
            continued he, " that we Persians have arms with which we <lb/>
            can put to flight enemies that close with us, but when we <lb/>
            have put them to flight, what cavalry, archers, peltasts, or <lb/>
            javelin-men, can we possibly take or destroy in their flight, <lb/>
            when we are without horse ? What enemies, too, would fear <lb/>
            to come up and annoy us, whether archers, javelin-men, or <lb/>
            cavalry, when they know very well that there is no more <lb/>
            danger of receiving any hurt from us, than from trees that <lb/>
            grow fixed in the ground ? 6. If such be the case, it is cer­ <lb/>
            tain that the horsemen, now with us, must consider all things <lb/>
            that fall into our hands not less theirs than ours, and perhaps. <lb/>
            by Jupiter, even more so. 7. Upon this footing, therefore, things <note type="footnote"> 1 2 </note> <pb n="116"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            now necessarily stand. But if we should get a body of horse, <lb/>
            not inferior to them, is it not evident to you all, that we should <lb/>
            be able, without them, to achieve the same things against the <lb/>
            enemy that we now achieve with them, and that we shall find <lb/>
            them more submissively disposed towards us ? for, when they <lb/>
            feel inclined either to remain or go away, it will be of less con­ <lb/>
            cern to us which course they take, if we are sufficient to our­ <lb/>
            selves without them. 8. But, be this as it may, no one, I be­ <lb/>
            lieve, will be of a contrary opinion to me in this, that for the <lb/>
            Persians to have a body of horse of their own, will be in the <lb/>
            highest degree advantageous to them. But perhaps you are <lb/>
            considering how this object may be effected. If then we <lb/>
            should resolve upon raising a body of horse, let us examine <lb/>
            what we have, and what we want. 9. Here are numbers of <lb/>
            horses that have been taken in the camp of the enemy, and <lb/>
            bridles with which they are managed, and all other things which <lb/>
            horses must have when we use them. We have also such <lb/>
            things as a horseman must use, corslets as defences for the <lb/>
            person, and lances which we may either use in throwing or <lb/>
            hold in the hand. What then is wanting ? 10. Doubtless <lb/>
            we shall want men. But these we certainly have, for there is <lb/>
            nothing so much our own as we ourselves. But, perhaps, some <lb/>
            will say, that we do not know how to ride ; but, by Jove, none <lb/>
            of those who do know, knew before they learned. But they <lb/>
            learned it, somebody may say, when they were boys. 11. <lb/>
            And whether are boys more intelligent in learning what is told <lb/>
            them and shown them, or men? which of the two are best <lb/>
            able to carry into effect, with bodily exertion, what they have <lb/>
            learned, boys or men? 12. We have leisure, too, for learning <lb/>
            such as neither boys nor other men have; for we have neither <lb/>
            to learn the use of the bow, as boys have, for we know it <lb/>
            already; nor to throw the javelin, for we know that too; <lb/>
            nor is it with us as with other men, to some of whom agri­ <lb/>
            culture gives occupation, to others various arts, and to others <lb/>
            domestic affairs; 13. but to us there is not only leisure for <lb/>
            military exercises, but necessity for them. Nor is this, like <lb/>
            many other military matters, a. thing of difficulty, as well as <lb/>
            of use ; for is not riding on a journey more pleasant than tra­ <lb/>
            velling on foot ? And is it not a pleasure to reach a friend <lb/>
            quickly, whenever despatch is required ? Or, if it be necessary <lb/>
            to pursue a man or a beast, is it not a pleasure to overtake it <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            quickly ? And is it not a convenience that, whatever arms <lb/>
            are necessary to be carried, the horse helps to carry them ; for, <lb/>
            to have arms and to carry them is the same thing.1 14. And <lb/>
            as to what a person may have most reason to fear, that we <lb/>
            may possibly have to come to action on horseback, before we <lb/>
            are yet well skilled in the exercise, and accordingly be no longer <lb/>
            either footmen or able horsemen, even this is not an irremedi­ <lb/>
            able difficulty ; for, whenever we please, we shall at once be <lb/>
            at liberty to fight on foot, since we shall unlearn nothing of <lb/>
            our skill as foot-soldiers by learning to ride."</p>
          <p>15. Thus spoke Cyrus; and Chrysantas expressed himself <lb/>
            in favour of his proposal as follows: " I am," said he, " so de­ <lb/>
            sirous of learning to ride, that I think, if I were a horseman, <lb/>
            I should be a flying man. 16. As things now are, I am con­ <lb/>
            tent, if, starting fair in a race with a man, I get before him <lb/>
            merely by the head, and, when I see a beast running by, if, <lb/>
            by exerting myself, I can contrive to reach him with my jave­ <lb/>
            lin or arrow, before he is at a great distance from me. But, <lb/>
            if I become a horseman, I shall be able to overtake a man, <lb/>
            though as far off as I can see; and in pursuing beasts, I shall <lb/>
            be able to come up with some, and strike them down with my <lb/>
            weapon in my hand, and to reach others with my javelin, as <lb/>
            well as if they stood still; for, if the animals are both swift, <lb/>
            yet, if they be near one another, they will be as if they stood <lb/>
            still. 17. And as to the sort of animal which I think I most <lb/>
            envy, the Centaurs, if they ever existed, and were of such <lb/>
            a nature as to contrive with the forethought of a man, to exe­ <lb/>
            cute what was necessary with their hands, and to exert the <lb/>
            swiftness and strength of the horse, so as to overtake what­ <lb/>
            ever fled from them and to overthrow whatever opposed them, <lb/>
            I, assuredly, if I become a horseman, shall confer all these <lb/>
            advantages on myself; 18. for I shall be able to contrive every­ <lb/>
            thing with the understanding of a man, I shall carry my arms <lb/>
            with my hands, I shall pursue with the aid of my horse, and <lb/>
            shall overthrow whoever opposes me with my horse's force; <lb/>
            yet I shall not grow and be united together with him like the <lb/>
            Centaurs; 19. and this is certainly better than to grow together; <lb/>
            since I conceive that the Centaurs must have been at a loss how <note type="footnote"> 1 Foot-soldiers may properly be said to carry or bear arms; horse- <lb/>

            to profit by many conveniences discovered by men, and how to <lb/>
            enjoy many of the pleasures natural to horses. 20. But I, if <lb/>
            I learn to ride, shall, when I am mounted on horseback, per­ <lb/>
            form, I trust, the part of a Centaur; and, when I have dis­ <lb/>
            mounted, shall take my meals, dress myself, and take rest, <lb/>
            as other men do; so that what else shall I be but a Centaur, <lb/>
            separated and unitable again? 21. Besides, I shall have the <lb/>
            advantage over the Centaur, said he, " in these respects, that <lb/>
            he saw but with two eyes, and heard but with two ears, but <lb/>
            I shall discover objects with four eyes, and receive notice of <lb/>
            them with four ears; for the horse, they say, warns men of <lb/>
            many things, from seeing them previously with his own eyes, <lb/>
            and gives them notice of many things, from hearing them pre­ <lb/>
            viously with his own ears. Write me down, therefore," con­ <lb/>
            eluded he, " as one of those that are extremely desirous to <lb/>
            serve on horseback." 22. “And us too, by Jupiter," exclaimed <lb/>
            all the others. Cyrus then said, " Since this proposal is so <lb/>
            strongly approved, what if we should make a law for ourselves, <lb/>
            that it shall be dishonourable for any amongst us, to whom I <lb/>
            shall furnish horses, to be seen travelling on foot, whether <lb/>
            he has a long or short distance to go, that men may imagine <lb/>
            us to be altogether Centaurs ?" 23. He put this question to <lb/>
            them, and they all expressed their assent; so that, from that <lb/>
            time even to this day, the Persians still observe this custom; <lb/>
            and no man of rank or honour among them is ever willingly <lb/>
            seen travelling to any place on foot. With such discourse did <lb/>
            they occupy their attention.</p>

          <p>1. WHEN it was past mid-day, the Median and Hyrcanian <lb/>
            cavalry rode up, bringing with them both horses and men, <lb/>
            that they had taken ; for such as delivered up their arms they <lb/>
            had not killed. 2. When they came forward, Cyrus first asked <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΑνθϱώποιϚδηλου̃</foreign>.] Dindorf's text has, in some editions <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθϱώπου</foreign>: a misprint </note> <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            them, whether they bad all returned safe ? When they said <lb/>
            that it was so, he next asked them what they had done; and <lb/>
            they related what they had achieved, and gave magnificent <lb/>
            accounts how manfully they had acted in every particular. <lb/>
            3. He listened with pleasure to all that they wished to tell <lb/>
            him, and then commended them thus : "It is evident that you <lb/>
            have been brave fellows, for you are now taller, more hand­ <lb/>
            some, and more terrible to look upon, than before." 4. He <lb/>
            then asked them what distance they had gone, and whether <lb/>
            the country was inhabited. They told him that they had <lb/>
            gone a great distance, and that the whole country was in­ <lb/>
            habited, and abounded in sheep, goats, oxen, and horses, corn, <lb/>
            and everything desirable. 5. “There are two things then," said <lb/>
            he, " that we must consider : how to make ourselves masters of <lb/>
            the people that possess these things; and how the people may <lb/>
            be induced to remain in the country. For a country well in­ <lb/>
            habited is a very valuable acquisition, but if destitute of men, <lb/>
            becomes destitute of everything that is good. 6. Those that <lb/>
            offered resistance," added he, " I know that you have killed; <lb/>
            and you did right; for to do so is of the greatest importance <lb/>
            for preserving a victory. Those that delivered up their arms <lb/>
            you have made prisoners; and if we should let them go, we <lb/>
            should do, I think, the very thing that would be for our ad­ <lb/>
            vantage ; 7. for, in the first place, we shall have to be upon <lb/>
            our guard against them, or to keep a guard over them, or to <lb/>
            supply them with provisions; for, doubtless, we should not let <lb/>
            them die of starvation. Besides, by releasing them, we shall <lb/>
            gain a greater number of captives; 8. for, if we conquer the <lb/>
            country, all will be our captives that inhabit it; and the rest, <lb/>
            when they see these alive, and set at liberty, will the more <lb/>
            readily remain, and choose rather to submit than to continue at <lb/>
            war. I, at least, am of this opinion ; but if any other person <lb/>
            sees anything better, let him speak." 9. But all who were <lb/>
            listening agreed to do what was proposed.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, accordingly, having called for the prisoners, ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them thus: 10. " Friends," said he, " in consequence <lb/>
            of your present submission, you have preserved your lives; <lb/>
            and for the future, if you conduct yourselves in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner, no ill whatever shall befall you, unless it be that the same <lb/>
            person will not govern you that governed you before ; but you <lb/>
            shall inhabit the same houses, you shall cultivate the same <pb n="120"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            lands, you shall live with the same wives, and you shall rule <lb/>
            your children as you do at present; but you shall not make <lb/>
            war upon us, or upon any one else; and whenever any one <lb/>
            injures you, we will fight for you. 11. And that nobody may <lb/>
            require you to take the field, bring your arms to us; to those <lb/>
            that bring them, there shall be peace; and what I promise <lb/>
            shall be honourably performed. But upon such as do not <lb/>
            bring their arms, we will assuredly make war ourselves. 12. <lb/>
            If any of you, however, shall appear to come to us in friend­ <lb/>
            ship, and to do anything for our service, or to give us any <lb/>
            information, we will treat him as a benefactor and a friend, <lb/>
            not as a slave. Receive these assurances yourselves, and com­ <lb/>
            municate them to the rest. And if, when you wish to act <lb/>
            thus, there be any that will not comply with your wishes, lead <lb/>
            us against them, that you may master them, and not be mas­ <lb/>
            tered by them." Thus spoke Cyrus; and they paid him <lb/>
            obeisance, and said that they would perform what he enjoined <lb/>
            them.</p>

          <p>Vigilance of Cyrus while his troops arc taking their supper. He receives <lb/>
            an angry message from Cyaxares; his politic conduct towards the mes­ <lb/>
            senger, whom he detains. He solicits a reinforcement from the Persians ; <lb/>
            his letter to Cyaxares. He causes most of the enemy's arms to be burned; <lb/>
            distributes much of the spoil among the allies; and arranges that the horses <lb/>
            and cavalry equipments may be assigned to his own troops.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN they were gone, Cyrus said, " It is time, 0 Medes <lb/>
            and Armenians, for all of us to take our suppers. Everything <lb/>
            necessary has been prepared for you, in the best manner that <lb/>
            we could. Go then, and send us half the bread that has been <lb/>
            made; for enough has been made for us both; but send us <lb/>
            neither meat with it, nor anything to drink, for of these we <lb/>
            have enough with us already provided. 2. And you," said he, <lb/>
            " Hyrcanians, conduct them to the tents; the officers to the <lb/>
            largest, (for you know which they are,) and the others as may <lb/>
            seem best to you. For yourselves, take your suppers where <lb/>
            it is most agreeable to you ; for the tents are safe and unin­ <lb/>
            jured, and preparation has been made there for you, as well <lb/>
            as for the others. 3. But understand this, both of you, that <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5. ] </note> <lb/>
            we shall keep the night-watch without the camp ; look your­ <lb/>
            selves to what passes in the tents, and keep your arms in readi­ <lb/>
            ness ; for they who are in the tents1 are not yet our friends."</p>
          <p>4. The Medes, then, and the troops of Tigranes, went to <lb/>
            bathe, and, having changed their clothes, (for garments had <lb/>
            been provided for them,) took their suppers; and their horses <lb/>
            were supplied with all necessaries. Half their bread they <lb/>
            sent to the Persians, but sent no meat with it, .nor wine; <lb/>
            thinking that Cyrus's troops were sufficiently provided, be­ <lb/>
            cause he had said that they had them in plenty. But what <lb/>
            Cyrus meant was, that their accompaniment to their bread was <lb/>
            hunger, and that they would have water from the river that <lb/>
            ran by. 5. Cyrus, therefore, after seeing that the Persians took <lb/>
            their supper, sent many of them out, as soon as it was dark, <lb/>
            by fives and tens, and ordered them to go round the camp <lb/>
            privately; judging that they would be a guard to it, if any <lb/>
            enemy came upon them from without; and that if any one <lb/>
            ran off with property of any kind, he would be taken. And <lb/>
            so it happened; for many ran away, and many were taken. <lb/>
            6. Cyrus allowed those that made the captures to keep the <lb/>
            property, but ordered them to kill the men ; so that, after­ <lb/>
            wards, even though a person desired it, he would not easily <lb/>
            find a man going off in the night. 7. Thus the Persians em­ <lb/>
            ployed themselves ; but the Medes drank and feasted, enter­ <lb/>
            tained themselves with the music of flutes, and indulged them­ <lb/>
            selves in all kinds of pleasure; for abundance of what was <lb/>
            subservient to such purposes had been taken ; so that those <lb/>
            who kept awake were in no want of occupation.</p>
          <p>8. But Cyaxares, king of the Medes, during the night that <lb/>
            Cyrus went out on this expedition, drank to intoxication, as <lb/>
            well as those whom he had with him in the tent, as on an <lb/>
            occasion of success; and he thought that the rest of the <lb/>
            Medes, excepting some few, were still remaining in the camp, <lb/>
            because he heard a great noise; for the servants of the <lb/>
            Modes, as their masters were gone, drank without ceasing, <lb/>
            and were very disorderly; the more so, as they had taken <lb/>
            from the Assyrian army great quantities of wine and other <lb/>
            supplies. 9. But when the day came, and nobody was in at­ <lb/>
            tendance at his gates, except those who had supped with him, <lb/>
            and when he heard that the camp was deserted by the Medes <note type="footnote"> 1 The Assyrians. </note> <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            and their cavalry, and saw himself, when he went out, that <lb/>
            such was really the case, he was enraged at both Cyrus and <lb/>
            the Medes for going away, and leaving him alone ; and, (as <lb/>
            he is said to have been violent and rash,) he immediately <lb/>
            commanded one of those about him to take his own body of <lb/>
            cavalry, and ride with the utmost despatch to Cyrus and his <lb/>
            troops, and deliver this message: 10. "I should not have <lb/>
            thought, Cyrus, that you would have taken measures so im­ <lb/>
            prudently for me; or, if Cyrus had thought fit to do so, T <lb/>
            should not have expected that you, Medes, would have con­ <lb/>
            sented to leave me thus unguarded. But now, whether <lb/>
            Cyrus will come or not, return to me with the utmost de­ <lb/>
            spatch." 11. This was the message which he sent; but he <lb/>
            that was ordered to go, said, “But how, 0 king, shall I be <lb/>
            able to find them ? "In the same manner," replied Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, “as Cyrus and his party found those whom they pur­ <lb/>
            sued." “Because I hear," continued the messenger, “that <lb/>
            certain Hyrcanians, who had revolted from the enemy, came <lb/>
            hither, and went off to show him the way." 12. Cyaxares, on <lb/>
            hearing this, was still more enraged at Cyrus, for not having <lb/>
            told him of the circumstance, and sent off still more hastily to <lb/>
            the Medes, that he might draw away his troops from him ; he <lb/>
            repeated his message of recall with much more vehemence than <lb/>
            before, and with threats ; and also threatened the messenger with <lb/>
            his displeasure, if he did not deliver his message with decision.</p>
          <p>13. The officer thus sent, set off with about a hundred of <lb/>
            his own horse, feeling sorry that he himself had not also gone <lb/>
            with Cyrus. As they proceeded on their way, they were <lb/>
            misled1 by some beaten track, and did not reach the army of <lb/>
            their friends, till, meeting with some Assyrians that were <lb/>
            coming back, they forced them to be their guides; and, by <lb/>
            this means, getting sight of their own peopled fires, they <lb/>
            came up with them about midnight. 14. When they rode up <lb/>
            to the camp, the guards, as had been ordered by Cyrus, <lb/>
            refused to admit them before day.</p>
          <p>When day appeared, Cyrus, calling to him the Magi, com­ <lb/>
            manded them to select what was usual for the gods on an <lb/>
            occasion of such success. The Magi employed themselves <note type="footnote"> 1<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΔιασχισϑέντεϚ</foreign>.] " Separated " from the right way, appears to be <lb/>

            accordingly. 15. He then summoned the Equals-in-honour, <lb/>
            and addressed them thus: “My friends, the gods are pleased <lb/>
            to lay many advantages before us; but we, 0 Persians, are, <lb/>
            at present, but few in number, to secure to ourselves the pos­ <lb/>
            session of them ; for if we do not guard what we have gained, <lb/>
            it will fall again into the power of others; and, if we leave some <lb/>
            of our own men as guards over what falls into our power, we <lb/>
            shall soon be found to have no strength remaining. 16. It <lb/>
            appears to me, therefore, that some one of you should go, as <lb/>
            soon as possible, to the Persians, acquaint them with what I <lb/>
            say, and request them to send an army with the utmost de­ <lb/>
            spatch, if the Persians desire that the dominion and revenues <lb/>
            of Asia should be theirs. 17. Go then," said he, "you who <lb/>
            are the oldest, and, when you arrive, deliver this message, <lb/>
            and add, that whatever soldiers they send, I, when they come <lb/>
            to me, will provide for their maintenance. You see what ad­ <lb/>
            vantages we have gained; conceal no part of them. What <lb/>
            part of the spoil I shall act honourably and legally in sending <lb/>
            to the Persians, consult my father, at least as to what con­ <lb/>
            cerns the gods ; as to what regards the public, inquire of the <lb/>
            magistrates. Let them send also inspectors of what we do, <lb/>
            and counsellors as to what we desire from them. For your <lb/>
            part," added he, "make yourself ready, and take your com­ <lb/>
            pany to attend you."</p>
          <p>is. Soon after he called the Medes, and with them the <lb/>
            messenger from Cyaxares presented himself, and, before them <lb/>
            all, announced the anger of Cyaxares towards Cyrus, and his <lb/>
            threats to the Medes, and in conclusion said, “That he com­ <lb/>
            manded the Medes to return, even though Cyrus should de­ <lb/>
            sire to stay." 19. The Medes, on hearing the messenger, were <lb/>
            silent, not knowing how they could disobey the summons of <lb/>
            Cyaxares, and yet in fear how to obey him while he thus <lb/>
            threatened them, especially as they knew the violence of his <lb/>
            character. 20. But Cyrus said, " I do not at all wonder, 0 <lb/>
            messenger, and you Medes, that Cyaxares, who then saw <lb/>
            a multitude of enemies, and knew not what we were doing, <lb/>
            should be under concern both for us and for himself; but <lb/>
            when he finds that a great many of the enemy are destroyed, <lb/>
            and that they are all driven off, he will cease, in the first <lb/>
            place, to fear, and will next feel convinced, that he is not de­ <lb/>
            serted at this time, when his friends are destroying his ene­ <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            mies. 21. But how can we deserve blame, when we do <lb/>
            him service, and not of ourselves merely ? for I did not enter <lb/>
            on this expedition till I had prevailed on him to allow me to <lb/>
            go, and to take you with me. It was not you that, from any <lb/>
            desire of your own for the journey, begged his leave to march, <lb/>
            and are now come hither; but it was because orders were <lb/>
            given by himself to go, to every one of you that was not <lb/>
            averse to it. This anger of his, therefore, I feel assured, <lb/>
            will be allayed by our successes, and will pass off as his fear <lb/>
            ceases. 22. You, therefore, messenger, take some rest for the <lb/>
            present, since you have undergone a great deal of fatigue; <lb/>
            and let us, 0 Persians, since we expect the enemy to be with <lb/>
            us, either to fight or to surrender, keep ourselves in the best <lb/>
            order ; for, if we are observed to be so, it is probable we shall <lb/>
            succeed the better in what we desire. You, prince of the <lb/>
            Hyrcanians,” concluded he, “attend here, after you have <lb/>
            commanded the officers of your men to put them under <lb/>
            arms."</p>
          <p>23. When the Hyrcanian had done so, and came to him, <lb/>
            Cyrus said, " I am gratified, 0 Hyrcanian, to see that you <lb/>
            attend me, not merely as you give us tokens of friendship, but <lb/>
            as you appear to me to show intelligence. It is now evi­ <lb/>
            dent that the same things are advantageous for us both ; for <lb/>
            the Assyrians are enemies to me, and are now greater ene­ <lb/>
            mies to you than to myself. 24. We must both of us, there­ <lb/>
            fore, take precautions that none of our allies that are at pre­ <lb/>
            sent with us, may fall off, and that we may, if we can, secure <lb/>
            others. You heard the Mede1 recalling the cavalry; but if <lb/>
            they leave us, we, the infantry, shall be left unsupported. <lb/>
            25. You and I, therefore, must contrive that this messenger, <lb/>
            who comes to recall them, may himself consent to stay with <lb/>
            us. Do you, therefore, find out a tent for him, and give it to <lb/>
            him, where he may pass his time in the most pleasant man­ <lb/>
            ner, with all things convenient about him. I meanwhile will <lb/>
            endeavour to give him some commission, which he may have <lb/>
            more pleasure in executing than in going away. Converse <lb/>
            with him on the many advantages that are expected to accrue <lb/>
            to all our friends, if these matters are well managed; and, <lb/>
            when you have done so, come again to me." 26. The Hyr- <note type="footnote"> 1The messenger sent from Cyaxares. </note> <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            canian accordingly went away, and conducted the Mede to <lb/>
            a tent.</p>
          <p>He that was going to Persia then came forward, prepared <lb/>
            for his journey. Cyrus directed him to tell the Persians what <lb/>
            has been before -mentioned in our narrative, and to deliver <lb/>
            Cyaxares a letter. But," said he, " I wish to read you what <lb/>
            I have written in it, that, being apprized of its contents, yov <lb/>
            may speak in accordance with them, if any one question you <lb/>
            on the subject." What the epistle contained was as follows :</p>
          <p>27. " CYRUS TO CYAXARES, greeting. We neither left you <lb/>
            deserted, (for no man, while he conquers his enemies, can be <lb/>
            without friends,) nor did we imagine that by quitting you <lb/>
            we brought you into danger; but the greater distance we <lb/>
            withdrew from you, the more security did we consider that <lb/>
            we procured you ; 28. for it is not those who sit down nearest <lb/>
            to their friends, that procure their friends most security; but <lb/>
            it is those who drive off their enemies to the greatest distance, <lb/>
            that rather put their friends out of danger. 29. Consider, <lb/>
            then, after what conduct of mine towards you, and after what <lb/>
            conduct of yours towards me, you now blame me. I brought <lb/>
            you allies; not merely as many as you persuaded me to <lb/>
            bring, but as many as I was able. You granted me, while I <lb/>
            was yet upon friendly ground, as many as I could persuade to <lb/>
            follow me ; and now, when I am in the enemy's territory, you <lb/>
            call away from me not simply every one that is willing to go, <lb/>
            but the whole body. 30. At that time, accordingly, I thought <lb/>
            myself indebted both to yourself and them; but now you <lb/>
            oblige me to forget you, and to prepare to make my whole <lb/>
            return of gratitude to those that followed me. 31. And yet <lb/>
            I cannot act like you; but even now, when I am sending to <lb/>
            the Persians for an army, I give directions that, whatever <lb/>
            troops come to join me, you, if you should be in want of them <lb/>
            before they reach us, shall be at liberty to employ them, <lb/>
            not as they may wish, but as you yourself may desire. <lb/>
            32. And I advise you, though I am the younger, not to take <lb/>
            away what you have once given, lest in-will be due to you, <lb/>
            instead of thanks; and do not send for any person, whom <lb/>
            you would have to come quickly to you, with threats; <lb/>
            nor, when you talk of being deserted, threaten a multitude, <lb/>
            lest you teach them not to regard you. 33. We will prepare <note type="footnote"> I See sect. 16. </note> <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            to attend you, as soon as we have effected what we think will <lb/>
            be, when accomplished, of advantage both to you and us. <lb/>
            Farewell."</p>
          <p>34. " Deliver him this letter, and whatever he asks you with <lb/>
            reference to these affairs, answer conformably to what is here <lb/>
            written; for indeed, with respect to the Persians, I give you <lb/>
            such directions as are expressed in the letter." Having <lb/>
            spoken thus to him, and given him the letter, he dismissed <lb/>
            him; enjoining him also to use diligence, as he knew that it <lb/>
            would be of advantage to him to return speedily.</p>
          <p>35. Soon after, he observed all the Medes and Hyrcanians, <lb/>
            and the force of Tigranes, in full armour; the Persians were <lb/>
            also under arms ; and some of the neighbouring people were <lb/>
            now beginning to bring in arms and horses. 36. The javelins <lb/>
            he ordered them to throw down where he had ordered others <lb/>
            before to throw theirs; and those, whose business it was, <lb/>
            burned such of them as they did not want. The horses he <lb/>
            ordered those who brought them to stay and watch, until some <lb/>
            further directions should be given them. Then, calling to <lb/>
            him the officers of the cavalry, and those of the Hyrcanians, <lb/>
            he addressed them thus: 37. " My friends and allies, do not <lb/>
            wonder that I frequently call you together; for, as our pre­ <lb/>
            sent circumstances are new to us, many things are yet in dis­ <lb/>
            order ; and things that are in disorder, must of necessity give <lb/>
            trouble, until they are assigned their proper places. 38. We <lb/>
            have now in our possession much captured property, and <lb/>
            many prisoners with it; and, from our uncertainty what pro­ <lb/>
            portion of the property belongs to each of us, and from the <lb/>
            prisoners not knowing who is master over each of them, we <lb/>
            do not see very many of them performing their proper duties, <lb/>
            but perceive almost all of them at a loss what they ought to <lb/>
            do. 39. That things, therefore, may not continue thus, dis­ <lb/>
            tribute the spoil; and whoever is assigned a tent containing <lb/>
            plenty of meat and drink, with people to act as attendants, and <lb/>
            with carpets, apparel, and all other things with which a mili. <lb/>
            tary tent is properly furnished, there is nothing further in. <lb/>
            cumbent on him but to understand that the possessor of <lb/>
            such property must take care of it as his own. But whoever <lb/>
            is fixed in quarters deficient in any of these points, you must <lb/>
            look to his case, and supply what is wanting ; 40. for I know <lb/>
            that of many things there will be more than enough, as the <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            enemy was possessed of everything more than proportionate <lb/>
            to our numbers. Besides, there have been with me certain <lb/>
            stewards, both of the Assyrian king and of other great men, <lb/>
            who told me, that they had with them sums of coined gold, <lb/>
            arising, they said, from certain tributary payments. 41. Make <lb/>
            proclamation, therefore, for the people to bring all these <lb/>
            things to you wherever you may fix your quarters ; and strike <lb/>
            terror into him who shall not execute your commands. Re­ <lb/>
            ceive what they bring, and distribute it: to a horseman, a <lb/>
            double portion; to a foot-soldier, a single one; so that, if you <lb/>
            want anything, you may have money with which to buy it. <unclear/> <lb/>
            . Let proclamation be made, too," added he, “that nobody <lb/>
            injure the market in the camp ; but that the sutlers sell what­ <lb/>
            ever each of them has for sale; and that when they have dis­ <lb/>
            posed of these articles, they must fetch more in order that our <lb/>
            camp may be supplied."</p>
          <p>They immediately caused these things to be proclaimed. <lb/>
            43. But the Medes and Hyrcanians said, " And how can we <lb/>
            distribute these things, without you and your people?" 44. <lb/>
            Cyrus to this question replied, “Do you think then, friends, <lb/>
            that whatever is to be done, we must all attend to everything ? <lb/>
            Shall not I be sufficient to do what may be required for you, <lb/>
            or you for us ? By what other means could we create for our­ <lb/>
            selves more trouble, or do less business, than by acting thus ? <lb/>
            45. But consider for yourselves," added he; "we have guarded <lb/>
            these things for you; and you have relied on us that they <lb/>
            were well guarded; do you, on the other hand, distribute <lb/>
            these things, and we will rely on you that you have distributed <lb/>
            them well. 46. We again, on some other occasion, will en­ <lb/>
            deavour to exert ourselves for the public service.</p>
          <p>“Observe, at present," continued he, “in the first place, <lb/>
            how many horses we have with us, while others are continue <lb/>
            ally brought in ; if we leave these without riders, they will be <lb/>
            of no use to us, and will give us trouble to take care of them ; <lb/>
            but, if we set horsemen upon them, we shall free ourselves <lb/>
            from the trouble, and shall add to our strength. 47. If, then, <lb/>
            you have other men to whom you would give them, and with <lb/>
            whom you would share danger in the field, if it should be <lb/>
            necessary, more willingly than with us, assign the horses to <lb/>
            them; but, if you would rather have us for supporters, give <lb/>
            them to us; 48. for, when you rode on without us, in the late <pb n="128"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            enterprise, and hurried to meet danger, you caused us great <lb/>
            apprehension, lest you should incur some misfortune; and <lb/>
            you made us greatly ashamed, that we were not with you <lb/>
            wherever you were. 49. But if we are assigned horses, we <lb/>
            will follow you ; and if we appear to be of more service while <lb/>
            engaging on horseback with you, we shall, in that case, not be <lb/>
            deficient in zeal; but, if we seem more likely to support you <lb/>
            properly on foot, it will be easy for us to dismount,1 and we <lb/>
            shall at once be with you as foot-soldiers, and will contrive to <lb/>
            find people to whom we may intrust our horses."</p>
          <p>50. Thus spoke Cyrus; and they replied, “We, 0 Cyrus, <lb/>
            have neither men to mount upon these horses, nor, if we had, <lb/>
            would we, when you make these suggestions, take any course <lb/>
            contrary to them. Take, then," they added, “the horses, and <lb/>
            do as you think best." 51. "I receive them," said he, "and <lb/>
            may we become horsemen, and you divide the public property, <lb/>
            with good fortune ! First, however," said he, " select for the <lb/>
            gods whatever the Magi shall direct; and then choose such <lb/>
            things for Cyaxares, as you may think most likely to please <lb/>
            him." 52. They laughed, and said, that they must then choose <lb/>
            women. " Choose women, then," said he, " and whatever <lb/>
            else you think proper:-and when you have chosen for him, <lb/>
            you Hyreanians, render, as far as you can, all those that have <lb/>
            voluntarily followed me, perfectly satisfied. 53. You too, 0 <lb/>
            Medes, reward these, who first became our allies, in such a <lb/>
            manner that they may think they decided well in becoming <lb/>
            our friends. Out of the whole, also, give a share to the mes­ <lb/>
            senger that is come from Cyaxares, both for himself and the <lb/>
            men that are with him, and exhort him to stay with is, on <lb/>
            the understanding that I approve of his stay; so that, by <lb/>
            acquiring additional information on every point, he may re­ <lb/>
            port to Cyaxares the true state of things. 54. For the Per­ <lb/>
            sians that are with me," continued he, "whatever remains <lb/>
            over and above, after you are all well provided for, will be <lb/>
            sufficient; for," said he, "we have by no means been brought <lb/>
            up delicately, but in a frugal manner; so that you would <lb/>
            laugh at us, perhaps, if anything magnificent should be <lb/>
            left for us; as I know very well," added he, “that we shall <note type="footnote">1 To <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε καταη̃ναι ἐν μέσω̨</foreign>.] Fischer takes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν μἐσω̨</foreign> in the sense of <lb/>

            afford you a great deal of laughter, when we are seated on <lb/>
            horseback, and, I doubt not, when we tumble on the ground."</p>
          <p>55. They then went off to the distribution, laughing heartily <lb/>
            about the horsemen. But Cyrus, calling the centurions to <lb/>
            him, ordered them to take the horses, the horse-furniture, and <lb/>
            the men that were to have the care of them, and count them ; <lb/>
            and then to assign by lot an equal number for each century. <lb/>
            56. Next he ordered them to make proclamation, that what­ <lb/>
            ever slave there might be, whether of the Medes, Persians, <lb/>
            Bactrians, Carians, Cilicians, or Greeks, or from any other <lb/>
            country, forced to serve in the army, either of the Assyrians, <lb/>
            Syrians, or Arabians, he should appear. 57. These men, <lb/>
            hearing the proclamation, presented themselves joyfully before <lb/>
            him, in great numbers; and he, having chosen from among <lb/>
            them the best-looking men, told. them that they should now <lb/>
            become free, and carry such arms as he should give them. <lb/>
            58. That they should have everything necessary, he said, <lb/>
            should be his care; and, bringing them immediately to the <lb/>
            centurions, he put them under their charge, and bade them give <lb/>
            them shields and light swords, that, being thus equipped, they <lb/>
            might follow the cavalry; and he told them to take provisions <lb/>
            for these men, as well as for the Persians that were with him. <lb/>
            He also directed that the centurions themselves should always <lb/>
            march on horseback, with corslets and lances, a practice which <lb/>
            he began himself; and that, over the infantry of the Equals- <lb/>
            in-honour, each of them should, out of the number of the <lb/>
            Equals-in-honour, appoint a commander in his own stead. In <lb/>
            such affairs did Cyrus and his troops employ themselves.</p>

          <p>Gobryas, incensed at the king of Assyria, comes to join Cyrus ; his speech, <lb/>
            and reception. The Medes give an account of the division of the spoil.</p>
          <p>1. MEANWHILE Gobryas, an Assyrian, a man in years, came <lb/>
            up on horseback, attended by a retinue of cavalry, all pro­ <lb/>
            vided with arms proper for equestrian service. Those who <lb/>
            had been appointed to receive the arms, bade them deliver <lb/>
            their lances, that they might burn them. as they had burned <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> <lb/>
            the rest; but Gobryas said that he desired first to see Cyrus. <lb/>
            The officers then left the other horsemen there, and conducted <lb/>
            Gobryas himself to Cyrus. 2. As soon as he saw Cyrus, he <lb/>
            addressed him thus: " My lord, I am, by birth, an Assyrian ; <lb/>
            I hold a strong fortress, and have the command of a large <lb/>
            territory; I have two thousand three hundred cavalry, which <lb/>
            I used to furnish to the king of Assyria, and was very much <lb/>
            his friend; but since he, who was an excellent man, has lost <lb/>
            his life in the war with you, and his son, who is my greatest <lb/>
            enemy, now possesses the government, I come to you, and <lb/>
            throw myself at your feet as a suppliant, offering myself to <lb/>
            you as a servant and assistant in the war, and entreating you <lb/>
            to be my avenger. 3. I make you my son, as far as is possi­ <lb/>
            ble ; as, with respect to male issue, I am childless ; for he, 0 <lb/>
            sovereign, that was my only one, a noble and excellent youth, <lb/>
            who loved and honoured me as much as a son could do to make a <lb/>
            father happy,1—the present king, (the late king, the father of <lb/>
            the present, having sent for my son, as intending to give <lb/>
            him his daughter, when I let him go, proud, indeed, that I <lb/>
            should see my son the husband of a king's daughter,) the pre­ <lb/>
            sent king, I say, invited him to hunt with him, and permitted <lb/>
            him to exert himself in the chase to the utmost, as he thought <lb/>
            that he himself was a much better horseman than my son, <lb/>
            who accordingly hunted with him as a friend ; and, upon a <lb/>
            bear appearing in view, they both pursued, and the present <lb/>
            king, throwing his javelin, missed his aim, (would that he had <lb/>
            never done so !) and my son hurling his, (as he should not <lb/>
            have done,) brought the bear to the ground. 4. The king <lb/>
            was then enraged, but kept his envy concealed. Afterwards <lb/>
            however, when, on a lion coming in their way, he missed a <lb/>
            second time, (doing nothing, I conceive, at all wonderful,) and <lb/>
            my son, again hitting his mark, brought down the lion, and <lb/>
            exclaimed, ' I have hurled twice in succession, and struck <lb/>
            down a beast each time,' the impious prince could no longer <lb/>
            restrain his malice, but snatching a lance from one of his <lb/>
            attendants, struck it into his breast, and took away the life <lb/>
            of my only and beloved son ! 5. Thus I, miserable man ! <lb/>
            brought him away a corpse, instead of a bridegroom; and <lb/>
            I, who am of these years, buried him, my excellent and <note type="footnote"> 1 It has been observed that the loose structure of this sentence <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            dear son, a youth but just bearded. He who slew him, as if <lb/>
            he had destroyed an enemy, has never yet shown any re­ <lb/>
            morse ; nor has he, as some amends for the atrocious act, dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished with any honour him who is under ground. 6. His <lb/>
            father, indeed, felt compassion, and plainly appeared to sym­ <lb/>
            pathize with me at my misfortune; and I therefore, had he <lb/>
            been alive, should never have applied to you to his prejudice; <lb/>
            for I had received many instances of friendship from him, and <lb/>
            had done him some service. But since the government has <lb/>
            fallen to the murderer of my son, I should never be able to <lb/>
            bear him the least good-will; nor could he, I know very well, <lb/>
            ever regard me as a friend; for he knows how I stand affect­ <lb/>
            ed towards him; and how, having lived with pleasure before, <lb/>
            1 am now reduced to this condition, childless and wearing out <lb/>
            my old age in sorrow. 7. If you receive me, therefore, and I <lb/>
            have hopes of obtaining, by your means, revenge for my dear <lb/>
            son, I shall think that I rise to new life ; I shall no longer be <lb/>
            ashamed to live, nor do I think that, when I die, I shall end <lb/>
            my days with sorrow."</p>
          <p>8. Thus spoke Gobryas. Cyrus replied, "If you show, <lb/>
            Gobryas, that you really are disposed towards us as you <lb/>
            express, I receive you as a suppliant, and, with the help of <lb/>
            the gods, I promise to take vengeance for you on the mur­ <lb/>
            derer of your son. But tell me," said he, "if we do this <lb/>
            for you, and allow you to hold your fortress, your territory, <lb/>
            and the power that you had before, will you do us any service <lb/>
            in return for these things ?" 9. He answered, "I will give you <lb/>
            my fortress for a home, whenever you come to me ; I will pay <lb/>
            you the same tribute from my lands that I used to pay to him ; <lb/>
            and wherever you shall make war, I will attend you in the <lb/>
            field, with the forces from my territory: Besides," said he, <lb/>
            "I have a maiden daughter, whom I tenderly love, just of an <lb/>
            age for marriage; whom I once thought that I was bringing <lb/>
            up as a wife for the person now reigning ; but she herself has <lb/>
            now entreated me, with many tears, not to give her to the <lb/>
            murderer of her brother; and I have myself similar feelings; <lb/>
            and I here give you leave to act with regard to her, as I ap­ <lb/>
            pear to act by you." 10. Cyrus then said, On the understand­ <lb/>
            ing that what you say is true, I give you my right hand, and <lb/>
            take yours; let the gods be witnesses between us." When <lb/>
            these things had passed, he bid Gobryas go, and keep his <note type="footnote">X 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V </note> <lb/>
            arms; and asked him what distance it was to his residence, <lb/>
            signifying that he would go thither. Gobryas replied, " If <lb/>
            you set out to-morrow morning, you may quarter with us the <lb/>
            next day." 11. He then went away, leaving a guide.</p>
          <p>The Modes now came up, after having delivered to lie <lb/>
            Magi such things as they had directed them to choose for he <lb/>
            gods. They had chosen for Cyrus a most beautiful tent; a <lb/>
            Susian woman, that was said to be the most beautiful woman <lb/>
            in Asia; and two other women, that were excellent singers. <lb/>
            For Cyaxares, in the next place, they had chosen such as <lb/>
            were next in merit. They had fully supplied themselves with <lb/>
            all such things as they wanted, that they might take the <lb/>
            field deficient in nothing; for there was everything in great <lb/>
            abundance. 12. The Hyrcanians took likewise whatever they <lb/>
            wanted ; and they made Cyaxares's messenger an equal sharer <lb/>
            with them. Whatever tents were not wanted, they gave to <lb/>
            Cyrus, that the Persians might have them ; the money, they <lb/>
            said, they would divide as soon as it was collected; and they <lb/>
            divided it accordingly.</p>

          <p>Cyrus makes presents to others from his share of the spoil. Panthea, a wo­ <lb/>
            man of great beauty and merit, is intrusted to Araspes, who converses <lb/>
            with Cyrus on love, and boasts himself invulnerable to it, but is at last <lb/>
            captivated by the charms of Panthea. Cyrus takes the sense of the Medes <lb/>
            and allies as to the prosecution of the war, who all exhort him to continue <lb/>
            it, and promise not to desert him.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH things they did and said. Cyrus next directed such <lb/>
            as he knew to be the greatest friends of Cyaxares, to take <lb/>
            each a portion of what had been selected for Cyaxares, and to <lb/>
            keep it for him. " And whatever portions you give me," <lb/>
            added he, " I accept with pleasure; but whoever of you is <lb/>
            most in want, shall always have the use of them." Upon <lb/>
            this, a certain Mede, a lover of music, said, "In the even- <pb n="133"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. l.] </note> <lb/>
            ing, Cyrus, I heard those female singers that you now <lb/>
            have, and heard them with delight; and if you were to give <lb/>
            me one of them, I think I should go to the war with more <lb/>
            pleasure than I should stay at home. Cyrus replied, “I give <lb/>
            her to you, and I think myself more obliged to you for asking <lb/>
            her of me, than you are to me for taking her; so very desirous <lb/>
            am I to please you all." Accordingly he that asked for her, <lb/>
            received her.</p>
          <p>2. Cyrus then calling to him Araspes the Mode, (him that <lb/>
            had been his companion from a boy, to whom he gave the <lb/>
            Median robe,1 that he took off when he left Astyages to go to <lb/>
            Persia,) desired him to keep the woman and tent for him.2 <lb/>
            3. This woman was wife of Abradates, of Susa; and when <lb/>
            the camp of the Assyrians was taken, her husband happened <lb/>
            not to be in it, but was gone upon an embassy to the king of <lb/>
            the Bactrians. The Assyrian king had sent him to treat of <lb/>
            an alliance between them ; for he happened to be a guest- <lb/>
            friend to the king of the Bactrians. This woman Cyrus di­ <lb/>
            rected Araspes to keep, till he should take her himself. 4. <lb/>
            But Araspes, on receiving this order, asked him this question :</p>
          <p>“Have you seen," said he, " Cyrus, the woman that you <lb/>
            bid me keep ? " "Assuredly," said he, " I have not." " But <lb/>
            I saw her," said he, " when we chose her for you. When we <lb/>
            first went into her tent, we could not, to say the truth, dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish her from the others; for she was sitting upon the <lb/>
            ground, with all her women-servants round her, and had in­ <lb/>
            deed a dress like that of her servants; but when we looked <lb/>
            round on them all, desiring to know which was the mistress, <lb/>
            she at once was seen to excel all the others, though she was <lb/>
            sitting with a veil over her, and looking down upon the ground. <lb/>
            5. When we asked her to rise, all the servants round her <lb/>
            stood up with her; and she was then distinguishable above <lb/>
            them all, not only in stature, but in beauty and grace, though <lb/>
            she was standing with a dejected air, and tears were seen fall­ <lb/>
            ing from her eyes, some upon her clothes, and some at her <lb/>
            feet. 6. But when the eldest of us said to her, ‘Take courage, <lb/>
            lady; we have heard that your husband is, indeed, an hon­ <lb/>
            ourable and excellent man, but we now select you for a man <lb/>
            that, be assured, is not inferior to him in person, or possessed <lb/>
            of less understanding, or power; for, as we think, if there be <note type="footnote"> 1 i. 4. 26. 2 iv. 6. 11. </note> <pb n="134"/>

            </note>a man in the world that deserves admiration, it is Cyrus, to <lb/>
            whom you shall henceforth belong ;' the woman, on hearing <lb/>
            these words, tore down the upper part of her robe, and utter­ <lb/>
            ed a lamentable cry; and her servants cried out at the same <lb/>
            time with her; while the greater part of her face discovered <lb/>
            itself, and her neck and hands were also visible ; 7. and be­ <lb/>
            lieve me, Cyrus," continued he, " it was thought by me, and <lb/>
            all the rest that saw her, that never was yet produced, or born <lb/>
            of mortals, such a woman, throughout all Asia. But by all <lb/>
            means," said he, " go yourself to see her."</p>
          <p>8. "Certainly not," rejoined Cyrus, "much less if she be <lb/>
            such a one as you say." “Why so?" said the young man. <lb/>
            " Because," said Cyrus, " if, on now hearing from you that she <lb/>
            is handsome, I should be persuaded to go and see her, at a <lb/>
            time that I have not much leisure, I am afraid that she will <lb/>
            much more easily persuade me to come and see her again; <lb/>
            and, in consequence, perhaps I might neglect what I ought to <lb/>
            do, and sit gazing at her." 9. The young man then laughed, <lb/>
            and said, “ And do you think, Cyrus, that the beauty of a <lb/>
            human being can necessitate a person, against his will, to act <lb/>
            contrary to what is best? If this were naturally the case," <lb/>
            added he, “it would necessitate all men alike. 10. You see <lb/>
            how fire burns all people indiscriminately; for such is the order <lb/>
            of nature; but of beautiful objects, people love some, and <lb/>
            not others ; and one loves one, and another another ; for it is <lb/>
            voluntary, and every one loves those that he pleases. For <lb/>
            example, a brother does not fall in love with a sister, but some­ <lb/>
            body else falls in love with her; a father does not fall in love <lb/>
            with his daughter, but some other person falls in love with <lb/>
            her; for fear and the law are sufficient to prevent love. 11. <lb/>
            If indeed," continued he, " the law should enjoin, that those <lb/>
            who did not eat should not be hungry, and that those who did <lb/>
            not drink should not be thirsty; that men should not be cold <lb/>
            in the winter, or hot in the summer; no law could make men <lb/>
            obey such injunctions, for men are formed by nature to be <lb/>
            subject to these things. But to love is a voluntary matter ; and <lb/>
            every one loves that which suits him, as he loves his clothes or his <lb/>
            shoes." 12. " But if to love be voluntary," said Cyrus, “ how is <lb/>
            it that a person cannot desist from loving when he pleases ? For <lb/>
            I have seen persons," continued he, "in tears from grief, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of love; slaves to those with whom they were in love, <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            though they thought slavery a very great evil before they were <lb/>
            in love ; giving away many things with which they had better <lb/>
            not have parted ; wishing to be rid of love, as they would of <lb/>
            any other distemper, and yet not able to rid themselves of it, <lb/>
            but bound to it by a stronger necessity than if they had been <lb/>
            bound with iron chains ! They give themselves up therefore <lb/>
            to those they love, to serve them in many unaccountable ways ; <lb/>
            yet, with such troubles, they never attempt to escape, but keep <lb/>
            continual watch upon the objects of their affection, lest they <lb/>
            should escape from them."</p>
          <p>13. The young man, in reply, said, "There are people, in­ <lb/>
            deed, who act thus, but such persons are miserable ; and this, <lb/>
            I believe, is the reason why they are always wishing them­ <lb/>
            selves dead, as being unhappy; but, though there are ten <lb/>
            thousand ways of ridding themselves of life, they yet do not <lb/>
            rid themselves of it. Just such wretches as these, are they <lb/>
            that attempt thefts, and will not abstain from what belongs to <lb/>
            others; but when they have seized or stolen anything, you <lb/>
            see," said he, " that you are the first to accuse the thieves and <lb/>
            plunderers, not considering theft to be a matter of necessity; <lb/>
            and you do not pardon, but punish them. 14. So persons that <lb/>
            are beautiful do not necessitate others to love them, nor to covet <lb/>
            what they ought not; but weak and unhappy men are power­ <lb/>
            less, I know, over all their passions, and then they lay the <lb/>
            blame upon love. But honourable and worthy men, though <lb/>
            they may feel a desire for gold, or fine horses, or beautiful <lb/>
            women, can yet with ease abstain from any of them, so as not <lb/>
            to touch them contrary to what is right; 15. I, at least," said <lb/>
            he, “ though I have seen this woman, and though she appears <lb/>
            very beautiful to me, am yet here attendant on you, and ride <lb/>
            my horse, and discharge my duty in other respects."</p>
          <p>16. " But, by Jove," said Cyrus, "you, perhaps, retired be­ <lb/>
            fore the time that love naturally lays hold of a man. It is <lb/>
            possible that a person touching fire, may not immediately be <lb/>
            burned; and wood does not immediately blaze up; yet I do <lb/>
            not willingly touch fire, or gaze on beautiful persons; and I <lb/>
            advise you, Araspes, not to let your eyes dwell long upon <lb/>
            beautiful persons; for as fire burns those that touch it, beautiful <lb/>
            persons inflame those that look at them even from a distance, <lb/>
            so that they are set on fire with love." it. " Have no fear," <lb/>
            said he, " Cyrus, though I look at her without ceasing, I shall <lb/>

            not be so overcome, as to do anything that I ought not to do." <lb/>
            " You speak," said he, " extremely well; guard her, therefore," <lb/>
            added he, " as I tell you, and be careful of her ; for perhaps this <lb/>
            woman may be of great service to us upon some occasion or <lb/>
            other." After conversing in this manner they separated.</p>
          <p>18. This young man, however, partly from seeing the woman <lb/>
            to be extremely beautiful, and observing her worth and good­ <lb/>
            ness, partly from waiting upon her and thinking that he pleased <lb/>
            her, and partly from finding her not ungrateful in return, but <lb/>
            taking care, by means of her servants, that everything neces­ <lb/>
            sary should be provided for him when he came in, and that he <lb/>
            should want nothing if he happened to be ill, was by all these <lb/>
            means made her captive in love; and perhaps incurred no­ <lb/>
            thing wonderful. Such was the course of this matter.</p>
          <p>19. But Cyrus, wishing that both the Medes and allies <lb/>
            should stay with him of their own accord, called together all <lb/>
            the chief officers, and, when they were met, spoke to them to this <lb/>
            effect: 20. " Medes, and all you that are here present, I know <lb/>
            very well that you came with me, not from any desire to get <lb/>
            money, nor with the thought of thus serving Cyaxares, but <lb/>
            that you were willing to oblige me in the matter, and, in hon­ <lb/>
            our to me, consented to march by night, and to face danger <lb/>
            with me. 21. For such conduct I must feel grateful to you, <lb/>
            unless I have lost all sense of justice; but to make you a clue <lb/>
            return for it, I do not think that I have yet the power; and <lb/>
            this I am not ashamed to say. But to say, ‘I will make you a <lb/>
            return, if you will stay with me,' I should, I assure you, feel <lb/>
            ashamed; for I should think that I should seem to say this only <lb/>
            that you might be more willing to stay with me. Instead of <lb/>
            saying so, therefore, I say this : ‘ Even if you now go away in <lb/>
            obedience to Cyaxares, I will yet endeavour, if I meet with <lb/>
            any success, to act towards you in such a manner as that you <lb/>
            may commend me.' 22. For my own part, I shall not go ; but <lb/>
            shall adhere to the promises and engagements which I made <lb/>
            to the Hyrcanians, and shall not be found betraying them ; <lb/>
            and to Gobryas also, who delivers up to us his fortresses, his <lb/>
            territory, and his whole power, I will endeavour to act in such <lb/>
            a manner, that he shall not repent his journey to me; 23. and, <lb/>
            what is more than all, when the gods so evidently offer ad­ <lb/>
            vantages to us, I ought to reverence them, and be ashamed to <lb/>
            make a causeless retreat and abandon all. Thus, then," con- <pb n="137"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. l.] </note> <lb/>
            eluded he, “ shall I act; you must do as you think proper, and <lb/>
            tell me what your inclination is." Thus spoke Cyrus.</p>
          <p>24. He who had previously said that he was related to Cy­ <lb/>
            rus was the first to reply: “ For my own part," said he, “ 0 <lb/>
            king! (for 1 you seem to me to be a king by nature, not less <lb/>
            than the chief of the bees in a hive is naturally a queen; for <lb/>
            the bees always willingly obey her; where she remains, not <lb/>
            one departs thence; and if she goes out, not one of them stays <lb/>
            behind; so strong a desire to be governed by her is innate in <lb/>
            them; and men seem to me to be similarly disposed towards <lb/>
            you; 25. for when you left us to go to Persia, what Mede, <lb/>
            either young or old, stayed behind, and did not follow you, <lb/>
            till Astyages caused us to return ? and when you set out from <lb/>
            Persia to our assistance, we again saw almost all your friends <lb/>
            voluntarily following you; when you were desirous to under­ <lb/>
            take the expedition hither, all the Medes willingly attended <lb/>
            you; 26. and we now feel so disposed, that, with you, though <lb/>
            we are in an enemy's country, we are full of courage, but with­ <lb/>
            out you we should even be afraid to go home ;) the rest, there­ <lb/>
            fore, shall say for themselves how they will act, but I myself, <lb/>
            Cyrus, and those whom I command, will remain with you, and <lb/>
            will bear to look upon you,2 and endure to receive benefits from <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>27. Tigranes next said, "Do not at all wonder, 0 Cyrus, if <lb/>
            I am silent; for my mind," added he, " is not prepared to ad­ <lb/>
            vise you, but to do what you command."</p>
          <p>28. The Hyrcanian then said, "For my part, 0 Medes, if <lb/>
            you were now to go away, I should say that it was the ma­ <lb/>
            licious design of some deity, not to suffer you to be in the <lb/>
            highest degree happy; for who, with ordinary human pru­ <lb/>
            dence, would turn back when the enemy are fleeing, or would <lb/>
            not take their arms when they deliver them up, or would re­ <lb/>
            fuse to receive their persons and their possessions when they <lb/>
            surrender them, especially when we have such a leader as <lb/>
            seems to me, I swear to you by all the gods, to be more pleased <note type="footnote">1 Artabazus, after calling Cyrus king, might have thrown in his <lb/>

            with doing us good, than with enriching himself?" 29. Upon <lb/>
            this the Medes exclaimed, " You, 0 Cyrus, have led us out, <lb/>
            and when you think it time to return, lead us back again with <lb/>
            you." Cyrus, hearing this exclamation, offered the following <lb/>
            prayer: “0 supreme Jove, grant me, I entreat thee, to sur­ <lb/>
            pass in good offices those that pay me such honour !”</p>
          <p>30. He then ordered the rest to place their guards, and at­ <lb/>
            tend to their comforts; but the Persians he directed to dis­ <lb/>
            tribute the tents, assigning to the horse-soldiers such as were <lb/>
            proper for them, and to the foot such as were sufficient for the <lb/>
            foot; and desired them so to regulate matters, that they who <lb/>
            were in the tents, despatching the business there, should bring <lb/>
            all necessaries to the Persians at their stations, and present <lb/>
            them their horses in proper condition, that the Persians might <lb/>
            have nothing to do but to attend to matters of war. Thus <lb/>
            they passed this day.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Cyrus goes to see Gobryas, who surrenders into his hands himself and all his <lb/>
            possessions. Gobryas invited to sup with the Persians ; his admiration of <lb/>
            their manners and conversation. Cyrus ascertains from Gobryas and the <lb/>
            Hyrcanian what additional allies he may procure ; inquires about the <lb/>
            road to Babylon, and decides on marching thither.</p>
          <p>1. THE next morning, as soon as they arose, they set out <lb/>
            to visit Gobryas. Cyrus went on horseback with the Persian <lb/>
            cavalry, who were in number about two thousand. They who <lb/>
            carried their shields and swords1 followed them, being equal <lb/>
            to them in number; and the rest of the army marched in re­ <lb/>
            gular order. He directed them each to tell their new serv­ <lb/>
            ants, that whoever of them should either be seen behind the <lb/>
            rear-guard, or should advance before the front, or should be <lb/>
            found on the outside of those that were in their rank upon <lb/>
            either wing, should be punished.</p>
          <p>2. On the second day, towards the evening, they arrived at <lb/>
            the dwelling of Gobryas. They saw that it was an exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly strong fortress, and that all things were provided on the <note type="footnote">1 From what is said in iv. 3. 13, it would hardly be supposed that <lb/>
            the cavalry needed any men to carry their arms. </note> <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            walls, to enable him to make a vigorous defence; and they <lb/>
            observed abundance of oxen and sheep driven up close under <lb/>
            the fortifications. 3. Gobryas, sending to Cyrus, asked him <lb/>
            to ride round, and see where the access was most easy, and to <lb/>
            send in to him some of those in whom he confided, who, hav­ <lb/>
            ing seen how things stood within, might give him an account <lb/>
            of them. 4. Cyrus accordingly, desiring in reality to see <lb/>
            whether the fortress might be taken on any side, should Go <lb/>
            bryas be found false, rode round the whole, but saw every <lb/>
            part too strong to be assailed. Those whom Cyrus sent in to <lb/>
            Gobryas brought him an account, that there was such a store <lb/>
            of provisions within, as could not, they thought, even in a <lb/>
            generation of men, fail the people that were there. 5. Cyrus <lb/>
            was somewhat concerned as to what might be the object of <lb/>
            such preparation ; when Gobryas himself came out to him, and <lb/>
            brought out all his men, some carrying wine, barley-meal, or <lb/>
            flour, and others driving oxen, goats, sheep, and swine; and <lb/>
            they brought abundance of everything that was eatable, so <lb/>
            that the whole army of Cyrus might take their supper. 6 <lb/>
            Those who were appointed for this service,1 distributed all <lb/>
            these provisions, and prepared supper.</p>
          <p>Gobryas, when all his men were come out, invited Cyrus to <lb/>
            enter, as he might think most safe. Cyrus, therefore, sending <lb/>
            in some of his officers to see the state of things, and a force <lb/>
            with them, went in, after this precaution, himself. 7. When <lb/>
            he had entered, keeping the gates open, he summoned all his <lb/>
            friends and the commanders of the troops with him ; and <lb/>
            when they were come in, Gobryas, producing cups of gold. <lb/>
            pitchers, and urns, all manner of furniture, a vast number of <lb/>
            clarics,2 and magnificent things of every kind, and, at last, <lb/>
            bringing out his daughter, a person of admirable beauty and <lb/>
            stature, but in affliction for the death of her brother, spoke <lb/>
            thus:</p>
          <p>" I give you, Cyrus, all these treasures, and intrust to you <lb/>
            this my daughter, to dispose of her as you think fit ; and we <lb/>
            are both your suppliants : I, as before, that you would be the <lb/>
            avenger of my son; and she, now, that you would be the <lb/>
            avenger of her brother."</p>
          <p>8. Cyrus, in reply, said, “ I promised you then, that, if you <note type="footnote"> 1 These, as Fischer thinks, were the tent-stewards. See iv. 2. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Anab. i. 1.9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            told me no falsehood, I would avenge you to the utmost of my <lb/>
            power; and now, when I find that you speak truth, I am <lb/>
            bound to perform my promise; and I promise your daughter, <lb/>
            with the help of the gods, to do exactly as I said. These <lb/>
            treasures," continued he, "I accept, but give them to this <lb/>
            your daughter, and to the man that shall marry her. But I <lb/>
            shall go away with one present from you, in exchange for <lb/>
            which, though I could have the riches of Babylon, extremely <lb/>
            great as they are, or even those of the world, instead of that <lb/>
            which you have given me, I should not go away with more <lb/>
            pleasure." 9. Gobryas, wondering what this could be, and sus­ <lb/>
            pecting that he might mean his daughter, put the question to <lb/>
            him, and said, “0 Cyrus, what is it?" Cyrus replied, “It is <lb/>
            this, Gobryas. I believe that there may be numbers of men <lb/>
            that would not be guilty either of impiety or injustice, or be <lb/>
            voluntarily false; but, because nobody has thought proper to <lb/>
            throw either great treasures, or power, or strong fortresses, or <lb/>
            lovely children, into their hands, die before they could show <lb/>
            what kind of persons they were ; 10. but you, by having now <lb/>
            put into my hands both strong fortresses, and wealth of all <lb/>
            kinds, your whole army, and your daughter, a most valuable <lb/>
            possession, have made it manifest to all men with regard to <lb/>
            me, that I would neither be guilty of impiety towards friends <lb/>
            that entertain me, nor of injustice for the sake of riches, nor <lb/>
            be willingly faithless to compacts. 11. This, therefore, be as­ <lb/>
            sured I will never forget as long as I am a just man, and as <lb/>
            long as I am praised by men for being thought to be such; <lb/>
            but I will endeavour to distinguish you in return with every <lb/>
            honour. 12. And do not be afraid of wanting a husband for <lb/>
            your daughter worthy of her; for I have many excellent friends, <lb/>
            of whom some one shall marry her. Whether however he <lb/>
            will have as much treasure as you give, or many times more, <lb/>
            I cannot say; but be assured, that there are some of them, <lb/>
            who, for all the treasures you give, do not esteem you at all <lb/>
            the more; but they now emulate me, and supplicate all the <lb/>
            gods, that they may at some time be able to show that they <lb/>
            are not less faithful to their friends than I am, and that, while <lb/>
            alive, they will never yield to their enemies, unless some god <lb/>
            render them powerless ; and be certain that, in exchange for <lb/>
            virtue and good reputation, they would not accept of all the <lb/>
            treasures of the Syrians and Assyrians added to your own. <pb n="141"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. .2.] </note> <lb/>
            Such men, believe me, are sitting here." 13. Gobryas, with <lb/>
            a smile, said, " By the gods, Cyrus, show me where these men <lb/>
            are, that I may beg of you one of them to be my son." " It <lb/>
            will not be at all necessary for you," rejoined Cyrus, " to ask <lb/>
            that question of me ; for if you will but attend us, you your­ <lb/>
            self will be able to show every one of them to anybody else."</p>
          <p>14. Having said this, he took Gobryas by the right hand, rose, <lb/>
            went out, and led out all that were with him; and though <lb/>
            Gobryas repeatedly invited him to sup within, he would not <lb/>
            do so, but supped in the camp, and took Gobryas to sup with <lb/>
            him. 15. After he had stretched himself on a mat, he put <lb/>
            this question to him : " Tell me," said he, " Gobryas, whether <lb/>
            do you think that you, or we here, have the greatest plenty of <lb/>
            furniture for couches?" " By Jove," replied he, "I know <lb/>
            very well that you have more furniture of this kind, and more <lb/>
            couches too; and your dwelling is much larger than mine; <lb/>
            for you have the earth and the heaven for a habitation, and <lb/>
            couches as many as there are spots upon the ground to lie on ; <lb/>
            and for their furniture, you do not think that you have as <lb/>
            much merely as sheep produce of wool, but as much as the <lb/>
            mountains and plains produce of brushwood."</p>
          <p>16. Gobryas, on supping with him for the first time, and <lb/>
            observing the plainness of the meats set before them, thought <lb/>
            that he and his people lived in a much nobler manner than the <lb/>
            Persians. 17. But when he noticed the temperance of those <lb/>
            who sat at meat with him ; for no Persian, among the well­ <lb/>
            educated, would ever indicate that he was struck with any <lb/>
            sort of meat or drink, either by his looks, or by eagerness to <lb/>
            help himself, or by abstraction of mind, so as not to notice <lb/>
            such other matters as be would notice, if he were not at his <lb/>
            meal; but, as good horsemen, from being undisturbed on <lb/>
            horseback, are able, at the same time that they ride, to see, <lb/>
            hear, and speak what is requisite ; so the Persians, at their <lb/>
            meals, think that they ought to appear discreet and temperate; <lb/>
            and to be much moved with any sort of meat or drink, they <lb/>
            consider to be rude and offensive ; is. and when he contem­ <lb/>
            plated, likewise, their manner of conversation, how they <lb/>
            asked each other such questions as were more agreeable to be <lb/>
            asked than not; how they rallied each other on points on <lb/>
            which it was more agreeable to be rallied than not; and how <lb/>
            the jests which they uttered were far from being offensive, <pb n="142"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            and far from giving rise to anything unbecoming, or from <lb/>
            rendering them irritated at one another ; he was constrained <lb/>
            to alter his opinion, and to acknowledge that the Persian mode <lb/>
            of living w-is preferable to his own.1 19. But what seemed to <lb/>
            him most extraordinary of all, was, that when they were en­ <lb/>
            gaged in military service, they did not think that greater <lb/>
            plenty should be set before themselves than before any one of <lb/>
            those entering into the same dangers with them; but thought <lb/>
            it the noblest of feasts to put those that were to be their <lb/>
            fellow-combatants into the best possible condition. 20. And <lb/>
            when Gobryas rose up to go home, he is reported to have said, <lb/>
            "I no longer wonder, Cyrus, that though we possess fine vessels, <lb/>
            rich habits, and gold, in greater abundance than you do, we <lb/>
            are men of less worth than you are; for we endeavour to ob­ <lb/>
            tain as many of these things as we can, but you seem to study <lb/>
            how you may become most excellent men." 21. Thus he <lb/>
            spoke; and Cyrus added, " See that you attend in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing, Gobryas, with your cavalry fully equipped ; that we may <lb/>
            see your force, and that you may conduct us, at the same time, <lb/>

            gard as belonging to our friends, and what to our enemies. <lb/>
            22. After holding this conversation, they went each to his own <lb/>
            abode.</p>
          <p>When it was day, Gobryas came with his cavalry, and con­ <lb/>
            ducted them. Cyrus, as became a commander, was not only <lb/>
            attentive to his present route, but, as he advanced, tried to <lb/>
            ascertain whether it would be in his power, by any means, to <lb/>
            render the enemy weaker, and his own party stronger. 23. <lb/>
            Calling, therefore, the Hyrcanian and Gobryas to him, (for he <lb/>
            thought that they understood best what he deemed it neces­ <lb/>
            sary for him to learn,) he said, “My friends, I think that I <lb/>
            shall not be in the wrong, if I consult with you upon the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of this war, as with trustworthy persons ; for I find that <lb/>
            it is more your business than mine, to take care that the As­ <lb/>
            syrian may not get the better of us; for to me, if I fail in my <lb/>
            undertaking here, there may possibly be some other resource; <lb/>
            but, as to you, if he gain the mastery, I see that all is lost. <note type="footnote"> 1 He was constrained preferable to his own.] These words <lb/>

            24. For to me he is an enemy, not because he hates me, but <lb/>
            because he thinks it disadvantageous to himself that we should <lb/>
            be powerful, and for this reason he makes war upon us ; but <lb/>
            you he hates, as supposing that he has been injured by you." <lb/>
            To this they both answered similarly, " That he should pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to say what he meant,l as they knew his views, and were <lb/>
            greatly concerned in what the course of affairs might result.</p>
          <p>25. Cyrus then began thus : " Tell me," said he, " does the <lb/>
            Assyrian think that you are the only people at enmity with <lb/>
            him, or do you know anybody else that is his enemy?" " Yes, <lb/>
            by Jove," said the Hyrcanian, " the Cadusians are his ene­ <lb/>
            miesin the highest degree, and are a strong and numerous <lb/>
            people ; the Sacians too, that are our borderers, and who <lb/>
            have suffered many hardships at the hand of the Assyrian, for <lb/>
            he endeavoured to subdue them as well as us.” 26. “ Do you <lb/>
            not think, therefore," said he, “that they would both gladly <lb/>
            fall upon the Assyrian, in conjunction with us?" "Most <lb/>
            gladly," said they, " if they could by any means join us." <lb/>
            " What is there then between," said he, " to hinder them from <lb/>
            joining us?" " The Assyrians," replied they; " the very na­ <lb/>
            tion through which you are now marching."</p>
          <p>27. After Cyrus had heard this, " Do you not then, Go­ <lb/>
            bryas," said he, “charge this young man, that is now placed <lb/>
            on the throne, with great insolence of disposition ? ”" Yes," <lb/>
            said Gobryas, "for such is the treatment that I have expe­ <lb/>
            rienced from him." "And has he," said Cyrus, “shown <lb/>
            himself such only towards you, or to others besides?" 28. <lb/>
            “By Jove," said Gobryas, " to others as well. But why need <lb/>
            I mention the wrongs that he has done to the weak ? For he <lb/>
            took the son of a man far more powerful than myself, when <lb/>
            he was his companion, as mine was, and was drinking with <lb/>
            him at his own table, and emasculated him; because, as some <lb/>
            say, a mistress of his had commended him as a handsome man, <lb/>
            and declared that woman happy that was to be his wife. But, <lb/>
            as the king himself now says, it was because he had attempted <lb/>
            to seduce his mistress. This man is now a eunuch, and since <lb/>
            the death of his father, holds his father's government." 29. <lb/>
            " Do you not think, then," said he, " that this man would see <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεϱαίνεινο</foreign>, rt <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλει</foreign>.] There has been much dispute about the <lb/>

            us with pleasure, if he thought that we would support him?" <lb/>
            "I know it very well," said Gobryas: “but to come at the <lb/>
            sight of him, Cyrus, is a difficult matter." " How so ? " said <lb/>
            Cyrus. "Because whoever would join him, must pass by <lb/>
            Babylon itself." so. And why should that be difficult?" <lb/>
            “Because, by Jove," said Gobryas, "I know the forces sent <lb/>
            out from Babylon alone, are much greater than those which <lb/>
            rOll have at present with you; and be assured, that the Assy­ <lb/>
            rians are now less forward than before to bring you arms and <lb/>
            horses, for this very reason, that your force appears to be but <lb/>
            small to those that have had a view of it; and a rumour to <lb/>
            this effect has been already widely spread abroad; and it <lb/>
            seems better to me," added he, " that we should march with <lb/>
            great caution."</p>
          <p>31. Cyrus, after listening to this intimation from Gobryas, <lb/>
            answered him as follows: “ You appear to advise us well," <lb/>
            Gobryas, "when you admonish us to pursue our march with the <lb/>
            utmost caution ; and, upon consideration, I cannot think of any <lb/>
            route safer for us to pursue than that to Babylon itself, if the <lb/>
            principal strength of the enemy lies there; for, as you say, <lb/>
            they are numerous; and, if they have courage, they will <lb/>
            also, I think, show themselves1 to us. 32. By not seeing us, <lb/>
            however, but imagining that we remain out of their sight from <lb/>
            fear of them, be assured," continued he, " that they will be <lb/>
            relieved from the dread that has fallen upon them, and cour­ <lb/>
            age will spring up in its stead; a courage which will be so <lb/>
            much the greater, the longer they are without seeing us. But <lb/>
            if we march upon them at once, we shall find many of them <lb/>
            still lamenting for those that have been killed by us, many <lb/>
            with the wounds bound up which they have received from <lb/>
            our people, and all yet remembering the courage of this army <lb/>
            as well as their own flight and loss. 33. And believe me, <lb/>
            Gobryas, that you may feel assured of this,2 that a multitude, <lb/>
            when they are in spirits, raise in themselves a courage not <lb/>
            to be resisted, but, when they are in fear, the more numerous <lb/>
            they are, the greater and more overpowering is the terror that <lb/>

            nor if victories in warlike enterprises are henceforth to fall to <lb/>

            to fear for us, and we are in reality in dangerous circum­ <lb/>

            cided by the merit of the combatants, you will not be wrong <lb/>
            in being of good courage ; for, with the help of the gods, you <lb/>

            that the enemy are at this time much fewer1 than they were <lb/>
            before they were beaten by us, and much less courageous1 than <lb/>
            when they fled from us; but we are stronger since we have <lb/>
            gained a victory, more confident since we have met with the <lb/>
            favour of fortune, and more numerous since you have joined <lb/>
            us; for you need not still think meanly of your people, now <lb/>
            that they are with us ; for be assured, Gobryas, that they who <lb/>
            attend the victorious, follow with confidence ; 37. nor let this <lb/>

          <p>Assyria is again ravaged, and much of the booty given to Gdoryas. Cyrus <lb/>
            advances towards Babylon, and challenges the Assyrian king to battle, <lb/>
            but without effect. Gadatas, a nobleman, who had been ill-treated by the <lb/>
            Assyrian king, revolts from him, and puts his fortress into the hands of <lb/>
            Cyrus; who is also joined by the Cadusians and Sacians. Gadatas goes to <lb/>
            defend his possessions ; Cyrus follows to support him, and instructs his <lb/>
            officers how to conduct a march by night. Cyrus's reason for addressing <lb/>
            his officers and others by name ; his care and attention on the march.</p>
          <p>1. PURSUING their march, accordingly, they reached the <lb/>
            boundaries of Gobryas's territory upon the fourth day. When <lb/>
            Cyrus bad entered the enemy's country, he took the foot <lb/>
            to himself, and as many of the horse as he thought proper, <lb/>
            and drew them up in order; the rest of the horse he sent out <lb/>
            upon excursions ; and ordered them to kill those that were in <lb/>
            arms, but to bring the rest, with whatever cattle they might <lb/>
            take, to him. He ordered the Persians also to join in these <lb/>
            excursions; and many of them returned, after being thrown <lb/>
            from their horses, but many of them brought off considerable <lb/>
            booty. 2. When the spoil was set before him, he called toge­ <lb/>
            ther the officers of the Medes and Hyrcanians, together with <lb/>
            the Equals-in-honour, and addressed them thus: “Gobryas, <lb/>
            my friends, has entertained us all with good things in great <lb/>
            abundance; if, therefore, after having selected what is usual <lb/>
            for the gods, and what will be sufficient for the army, we <lb/>
            should give the remainder of the spoil to him, should we not <lb/>
            do a proper thing, by making it at once apparent, that we en­ <lb/>
            deavour to surpass our benefactors in doing kindness to <lb/>
            them ?" 3. When they heard this proposal, they all commended <lb/>
            and applauded it; and one of them spoke thus: " We will do <lb/>
            so, Cyrus," said he, " by all means; for Gobryas seems to me <lb/>
            to take us for indigent people ; because we did not come with <lb/>
            abundance of darics, and do not drink out of golden cups; <lb/>
            but, if we do what you propose, he may understand that it is <lb/>
            possible to be generous, even without gold." 4. " Go then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, “ and, having delivered to the Magi what is due <lb/>
            to the gods, and taken what is sufficient for the army, call <lb/>
            Gobryas, and give him the remainder." Accordingly, hav­ <lb/>
            in- taken as much as was necessary, they gave the rest to <lb/>
            Gobryas.</p><pb n="147"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note>5. He then marched on towards Babylon itself, disposing his <lb/>
            army in the same order as on a day of battle. As the Assy­ <lb/>
            rians declined to come out against him, Cyrus desired Gobryas <lb/>
            to ride forward, and to say that, if the king were willing to <lb/>
            come out and fight for his country, he would engage with <lb/>
            him; 1 but if he would not defend his country, he must of <lb/>
            necessity submit to his conquerors. 6. Gobryas rode on as far <lb/>
            as it was safe, to deliver this message; and the king sent a <lb/>
            person out with an answer, to the following effect: " Gobryas, <lb/>
            your sovereign says, I do not repent that I put your son to death, <lb/>
            but I repent that I did not put you to death likewise ! If you <lb/>
            would fight, come hither upon the thirtieth day from hence; <lb/>
            we are not yet at leisure, for we are still employed in our pre­ <lb/>
            parations." 7. Gobryas then said, “May that repentance never <lb/>
            leave you ! for, it is evident that I have caused you some <lb/>
            affliction ever since such repentance took possession of you."</p>
          <p>8. Gobryas reported this message from the Assyrian ; and <lb/>
            Cyrus, having heard it, drew off the army, and calling Gobryas <lb/>
            to him, " Tell me," said lie, " did you not say, that you <lb/>
            thought the man who had been emasculated by the Assyrian <lb/>
            king, would join us ? " "I think I am sure of it," replied he ; <lb/>
            “for he and I have often conferred together with great free­ <lb/>
            dom.” 9. “When you think proper, therefore," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            "go to him: and, in the first place, contrive that you and he <lb/>
            alone2 may know what he says upon the subject; and, when <lb/>
            you have conferred with him, if you find him inclined to be <lb/>
            our friend, you must then contrive that he may not be known <lb/>
            to be our friend; for no one can do greater service to his <lb/>
            friends in war by any other means than by appearing to be <lb/>
            their enemy ; or do greater harm to his enemies by any other <lb/>
            means than by appearing to be their friend.”10. "I know <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὐτὸςσὺνἐκείνῳμάχοιτο</foreign>.]It has been much disputed whether, <lb/>
            by <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign>,Cyrus or Gobryas is meant. Zeune, Weiske, and Lange <lb/>
            refer it to Cyrus, considering <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺνἐκεινῳμάχεσϑαι</foreign>to be the same as <lb/>

            posing that Gobryas makes an offer to fight on the side of the <lb/>
            Assyrian king, not in earnest, but as a ruse. The former interpreta­ <lb/>
            tion, to which I have adhered, is the far more straightforward one; <lb/>
            though the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺν</foreign>will not allow it to be altogether satisfactory. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὐτοι</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδη̨̉τε</foreign>.] By <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοι</foreign>are meant Gobryas and Gadatas, <lb/>

            indeed," said Gobryas, "that Gadatas would even pay a price <lb/>
            for the power of doing some great harm to the Assyrian king ; <lb/>
            but we must consider what it is that he can do." 11. " Tell me, <lb/>
            then," said Cyrus, “ with regard to that fortress which lies <lb/>
            upon the frontiers of this country, and which you say was <lb/>
            built as a defence to it in war against the Hyrcanians and <lb/>
            Sacians, do you think," said he, "that the eunuch would be <lb/>
            allowed by the commander to enter it if he came with a force ? ” <lb/>
            " Certainly," said Gobryas, " if he came to him unsuspected <lb/>
            as now he is." 12. " And," said Cyrus, "if I should fall upon <lb/>
            the places that are in his possession, as if I wished to make <lb/>
            myself master of them, and he should defend them against me <lb/>
            with his whole force; and if I should take something of his, <lb/>
            and he, on the other hand, should capture either some of our <lb/>
            people, or some messengers sent by me to such people as you <lb/>
            say arc enemies to the Assyrian ; and if the persons so cap­ <lb/>
            tured should declare that they were going to bring forces, and <lb/>
            to fetch ladders for the attack of the fortress, and the eunuch, <lb/>
            on hearing these statements, should pretend that he came with <lb/>
            the intention of making a similar communication, he would <lb/>
            assuredly continue unsuspected.</p>
          <p>13. Gobryas then said, " If matters are managed thus, I <lb/>
            know very well that he would admit him, and would be- him <lb/>
            to stay till you should depart." “And then," said Cyrus, “if <lb/>
            he once gained an entrance, could he not give up the fortress <lb/>
            into our hands ?" 14. “ Very probably," said Gobryas, "if he <lb/>
            took part in the arrangements within, and you made a vigor­ <lb/>
            ous assault from without." “ Go then," said he, " and, after <lb/>
            you have given him these instructions, and arranged the pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, endeavour to join us here again ; but as for pledges <lb/>
            of faith, neither mention, nor intimate to him, any greater <lb/>
            than those which you yourself received from us."</p>
          <p>15. Soon after, Gobryas set out. The eunuch saw him with <lb/>
            great pleasure, consented to everything, and arranged with <lb/>
            him what was proper to be done.</p>
          <p>When Gobryas had brought word that the whole business <lb/>
            of his mission to the eunuch appeared satisfactorily settled, <lb/>
            Cyrus proceeded to attack him the following day. 16. Gadatas <lb/>
            defended himself; and Cyrus took some other place such as <lb/>
            Gadatas had pointed out; while of some messengers that Cy­ <lb/>
            rus had sent, directing them. beforehand, which way they <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            should go, Gadatas suffered a part to escape, that they might <lb/>
            bring up forces and fetch ladders; but such as he took, he ex­ <lb/>
            amined, in the presence of many persons; and, when he had <lb/>
            heard for what purpose they said that they were going, he <lb/>
            immediately prepared for a journey, and marched off in the <lb/>
            night, as if to go and give an account of the matter; in fine, he <lb/>
            was trusted, and entered the fortress, as an ally to defend it. 17. <lb/>
            For a while he concurred with the governor in every arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, as far as he could; but when Cyrus came up, he seized <lb/>
            the fortress, making the prisoners, whom he had taken from <lb/>
            Cyrus, his assistants in securing it.</p>
          <p>is. When this was done, Gadatas, having settled matters <lb/>
            within, came out immediately to Cyrus, and, having paid him <lb/>
            obeisance in the usual manner, he said, " Joy to you, 0 Cy­ <lb/>
            rus !" 19. "I have it," said he, "already; for, with the help <lb/>
            of the gods, you not only bid me, but oblige me to rejoice ; <lb/>
            for, be assured," said he, " that I esteem it of great import­ <lb/>
            ance to leave this place to my allies in these parts. The power <lb/>
            of procreating children, Gadatas, the Assyrian, it seems, has <lb/>
            taken from you; but he has not deprived you of the power of <lb/>
            acquiring friends, and, be assured that, by this act, you have <lb/>
            made friends of us, who will endeavour, if we are able, to be <lb/>
            not less valuable supporters to you, than if you had sons or <lb/>
            grandsons."</p>
          <p>20. Thus spoke Cyrus; and the Hyrcanian, who just now <lb/>
            understood what had been done, ran to Cyrus, and taking him <lb/>
            by the right hand, said, " Oh how great a blessing, Cyrus, are <lb/>
            you to your friends ! What a debt of gratitude and thanks do <lb/>
            you make me owe to the gods, for having joined me in alliance <lb/>
            with you !" 21. " Go then, presently," said Cyrus, " and take <lb/>
            possession of the place on account of which you are so pleased <lb/>
            with me, and dispose of it in such a manner, that it may be of <lb/>
            the utmost advantage to your own nation, and to our other <lb/>
            allies; but chiefly," said he, “ to Gadatas here, who has taken <lb/>
            it, and delivered it up to us." 22. " Then," said the Hyrca­ <lb/>
            nian, " when the Cadusians, the Sacians, and my countrymen <lb/>
            are come, shall we call in Gadatas also, that all of us, whom <lb/>
            it concerns, may consult in common how we may use the <lb/>
            fortress to the best advantage?" 23. This proposal Cyrus <lb/>
            applauded, and, when all that were concerned about the fortress <lb/>
            were met, they jointly determined that it should be kept by <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            those who had an interest in its being friendly to them, that <lb/>
            it might be a place of defence to cover them, and a bulwark <lb/>
            against the Assyrians.</p>
          <p>24. When this enterprise was concluded, the Cadusians en­ <lb/>
            gaged with more zeal, and in greater numbers, in the service, <lb/>
            as well as the Sacians and Hyrcanians. Hence there was <lb/>
            collected a force of Cadusians, consisting of twenty thousand <lb/>
            peltasts and four thousand cavalry; and of Sacians, consisting <lb/>
            of ten thousand archers on foot, and two thousand on horseback; <lb/>
            while the Hyrcanians sent all the infantry that they could, and <lb/>
            made up their cavalry to the number of two thousand; for <lb/>
            most of their cavalry had before been left at home, because <lb/>
            both the Cadusians and Sacians were enemies to the Assyrians. <lb/>
            25. During the whole time that Cyrus lay employed in making <lb/>
            regulations about the fortress, many of the Assyrians, in those <lb/>
            parts, were bringing horses, and many were bringing arms, <lb/>
            being now afraid of all their neighbours.1</p>
          <p>26. Soon after, Gadatas came to Cyrus, and acquainted him, <lb/>
            that there were messengers come to tell him, that the Assyrian <lb/>
            king, when he heard of the affair of the fortress, was extreme­ <lb/>
            ly incensed, and began to make preparations to invade his <lb/>
            territory. " If, therefore, you would let me go, Cyrus," said <lb/>
            he, " I would endeavour to save my places of strength ; of the <lb/>
            rest there is less account to be taken." Cyrus then said, 27. <lb/>
            " If you set out now, when shall you be at home ?" Gadatas <lb/>
            replied, "I shall sup in my own territory the third day." <lb/>
            " And do you think," said he, "that you will find the Assyrian <lb/>
            already there ?" " I know very well," said he, “that I shall; <lb/>
            for he will make haste, while he still thinks you at a great <lb/>
            distance." 28. " And in how many days," inquired Cyrus, <lb/>
            " could I march thither with the army ? " To this Gadatas <lb/>
            answered, " You have a very great army, my sovereign, and <lb/>
            would not be able to reach myresidence in less than six or <lb/>
            seven days." " Go, then," said Cyrus, " as soon as you can, <lb/>
            and I will march after with all possible despatch."</p>
          <p>29. Gadatas then took his departure, and Cyrus called to­ <lb/>
            gether all the officers of his allies, (and there seem now to <note type="footnote">1 The Sacians, Cadusidns, and Hyrcanians, against whom the <lb/>
            fortress had previously served them as a defence. See the end of <lb/>

            ans revolted to Cyrus. </note> <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            have been present many men of merit and valour,) and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them to this effect: " 30. Friends and allies, Gadatas has <lb/>
            done such services for us, as we all judge to be of great value, <lb/>
            and has done so before receiving the least benefit whatever at <lb/>
            our hands. The Assyrian king is now said to have invaded <lb/>
            his territory, and both intends, it is evident, to take vengeance <lb/>
            on him, because he thinks that he has been greatly injured by <lb/>
            him, and also, perhaps, considers, that if those who revolt to <lb/>
            us receive no harm from him, and those who continue on his <lb/>
            side are destroyed by us, it is probable that in a short time <lb/>
            nobody will remain with him; 31. therefore, ray friends, we <lb/>
            shall act but honourably, I think, if we afford zealous assist­ <lb/>
            ance to Gadatas, a man who has been our benefactor; we <lb/>
            shall at the same time act justly by discharging a debt of <lb/>
            gratitude; and we shall, in my opinion, do what will be for <lb/>
            our own advantage; 32. for if we make it apparent to all men, <lb/>
            that we endeavour to surpass those who injure us in returning <lb/>
            injury, and exceed our benefactors in doing them service, it is <lb/>
            likely that, through such conduct, many will be willing to be <lb/>
            friends to us, and nobody will desire to be our enemy; 33. but <lb/>
            if we appear neglectful of Gadatas, with what arguments, <lb/>
            in the name of the gods, shall we persuade others to do us <lb/>
            kindnesses ? how shall we dare to commend ourselves; and <lb/>
            how will any of us be able to look Gadatas in the face, if we <lb/>
            are outdone by him in good offices, we, who are so many, by <lb/>
            him who is but one, and one in such circumstances?"</p>
          <p>34. Thus spoke Cyrus, and they all earnestly expressed their <lb/>
            assent to what he proposed. " Proceed, then," said he, “since <lb/>
            lilY proposal pleases you. Let us each leave, with the car­ <lb/>
            riages and beasts of burden, all those that are fittest to travel <lb/>
            with them, and let Gobryas command and conduct them; 35. <lb/>
            for he is acquainted with the roads, and well qualified in other <lb/>
            respects; and let us march forward ourselves with the best of <lb/>
            our horses and men, taking provisions with us for three days ; <lb/>
            and the more lightly and frugally we furnish ourselves, the <lb/>
            more pleasantly shall we dine, sup, and sleep on the succeed­ <lb/>
            ing days. 36. Let us order our march in the following man­ <lb/>
            ner : You, Chrysantas, in the first place, lead on those armed <lb/>
            with corslets, (since the way is level and open,) and let each <lb/>
            century march in single file, keeping all the centurions in front; <lb/>
            for, by keeping compact order, we shall march with greater <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            despatch and greater safety. 37. I desire those armed with <lb/>
            corslets to lead, for this reason, that they are the heaviest <lb/>
            part of the army; and, when the heaviest lead the way, the <lb/>
            troops that march more expeditiously must all follow them <lb/>
            with ease; but when the lighter troops lead, especially in the <lb/>
            .night, it is not at all wonderful that the forces become se <lb/>
            parated; for the body that is at the bead runs off from the <lb/>
            rest. 38. Next after these," continued he, “ let Artabazus <lb/>
            lead the Persian peltasts and archers; next to these, let An­ <lb/>
            damyas the Mede lead the Median infantry; next to these, <lb/>
            Æmbas the Armenian infantry; next to these, Artuchas the <lb/>
            Hyrcanians; next to these, Thambradas the Sacian infantry ; <lb/>
            next to these, Datamas the Cadusians. 39. Let all these pro­ <lb/>
            ceed with their centurions in front, and their peltasts on the <lb/>
            right, and their archers on the left of their own oblong bodies; <lb/>
            for, by marching in this manner, they will be the more ready <lb/>
            for service. 40. Behind these, let the baggage-bearers of the <lb/>
            whole army follow; let their officers look to them all, that <lb/>
            they have everything packed up before they sleep, and that they <lb/>
            attend early in the morning in their appointed places, and fol­ <lb/>
            low in proper order. 41. Next after the baggage-carriers, let <lb/>
            Madatas the Persian bring up the Persian cavalry, and let him <lb/>
            also keep the equestrian centurions in front; and let each <lb/>
            centurion lead his century in single file, in the same manner <lb/>
            as the officers of the foot. 42. Next to these, let Rambacas <lb/>
            the Mede lead his cavalry in the same manner; next to these, <lb/>
            you, Tigranes, bring up your own cavalry; and the rest of <lb/>
            the cavalry officers the bodies of cavalry with which each <lb/>
            joined us. After these, let the Sacians follow, and let the <lb/>
            Cadusians, as they came in to us the last, bring up the rear of <lb/>
            the whole army ; you, Alceunas, who command them, take care <lb/>
            on the present occasion to be in the rear of all, and suffer none <lb/>
            to fall behind your horse. 43. And you, commanders, and all <lb/>
            of you that are wise, take care to march in silence; for it is by <lb/>
            means of the ears, rather than the eyes, that you must observe <lb/>
            and manage everything during the night; and to be thrown <lb/>
            into disorder in the night is of much worse consequence than <lb/>
            in the day, and more difficult to be remedied. Silence must <lb/>
            therefore be maintained and order preserved. 44. And the <lb/>
            night-watches, when you are to rise and march in the night, <lb/>
            you must make as short and as numerous as is possible, that <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            long watching on the night-guard may not incapacitate any <lb/>
            one for marching ; and when the time comes for setting for­ <lb/>
            ward, the signal is to be given with the horn. 45. And be <lb/>
            ready, all of you, on the road to Babylon, each furnished with <lb/>
            everything necessary; and let those in advance from time to <lb/>
            time exhort those in the rear to follow."</p>
          <p>46. They then went off to their tents, and, on their way, <lb/>
            observed among themselves how retentive a memory Cyrus had, <lb/>
            and hos, as he gave his orders to those to whom he assigned <lb/>
            their places, he addressed each of them by name.1 47. This <lb/>
            Cyrus was enabled to do by giving his attention to it; for he <lb/>
            thought it very strange, if, while artificers know the names <lb/>
            of their tools, each in his own art, and a physician knows the <lb/>
            names of all the instruments and medicines that he uses, a <lb/>
            general should be so foolish as not to know the names of the <lb/>
            commanders under him, whom he must necessarily use as his <lb/>
            instruments whenever he wishes to seize on any post, to keep <lb/>
            on guard, to encourage his men, or to strike terror into the <lb/>
            enemy; and when he desired to do honour to any one, he <lb/>
            thought it became him to address him by name. 48. He was <lb/>
            of opinion, too, that those who thought themselves known to <lb/>
            their commander, would thus be more eager to be seen per­ <lb/>
            forming some honourable action, and more anxious to abstain <lb/>
            from doing anything that was disgraceful. 49. He thought <lb/>
            it very foolish also, when a person wished anything to be done, <lb/>
            for him to give orders as some masters give theirs in their <lb/>
            families, “ Let somebody go for water, let somebody cleave <lb/>
            the wood;” 50. for when orders were given in such a manner, <lb/>
            all the servants seemed to him to look one at another, and no <lb/>
            one to execute what was ordered; and while all appeared to <lb/>
            be in fault, yet no one was ashamed or afraid on account of <lb/>
            his culpability, because he shared the blame equally with se­ <lb/>
            veral others. For these reasons, he named every one when <lb/>
            he gave his orders. Such was Cyrus's judgment on this point.</p>
          <p>51. The soldiers, having taken their suppers, arranged the <lb/>
            watches, and packed up everything that was necessary, went <lb/>
            to rest. 52. When it was midnight, the signal was given with <lb/>
            the horn; and Cyrus, having told Chrysantas that he would <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_84_fig2.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">λετο</foreign>.] “ With how good a memory Cyrus gave orders to all, as many <lb/>
              as be assigned posts, calling them by name " </note> <pb n="154"/>
              <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
              wait in the road in advance of the army, rode off, taking his <lb/>
              attendants with him. In a short time after, Chrysantas came <lb/>
              up at the head of those that were armed with corslets. 53. <lb/>
              Cyrus, assigning him guides, ordered him to march gently on <lb/>
              till a messenger came to him, as the troops were not yet all <lb/>
              upon the march; he himself, standing by the way-side, sped <lb/>
              forward, in order, those that came up, and sent to hurry on <lb/>
              such as were dilatory. 54. When they were all in motion, <lb/>
              he despatched horsemen to Chrysantas, to tell him, that all <lb/>
              were now upon the march: "Lead on, therefore," said he, <lb/>
              "at a quicker pace;" 55. and, riding forward himself to the front, <lb/>
              he observed, at leisure, the several divisions, and to such as <lb/>
              he saw marching orderly and silently, he rode up, and inquired <lb/>
              who they were, and when he was informed, commended them; <lb/>
              but if he perceived any of them disorderly, he inquired into <lb/>
              the cause, and endeavoured to put a stop to the confusion.</p>
          <p>56. One particular only, in his precautions for the night, <lb/>
            has been omitted; which is, that, in advance of the whole <lb/>
            army, he sent a small body of light-armed foot, who were kept <lb/>
            in sight by Chrysantas, and kept him in their sight;1 so <lb/>
            that, listening attentively, or getting notice of things, if they <lb/>
            could, by any other means, they might communicate to him <lb/>
            whatever the occasion seemed to require. There was a captain <lb/>
            over them, who kept them in order, and notified what was <lb/>
            worthy of notice ; what was not so, he gave no disturbance by <lb/>
            telling. Thus they proceeded during the night.</p>
          <p>57. When it was day, Cyrus left the Cadusian horse with <lb/>
            the Cadusian foot, because they marched in the rear, in or­ <lb/>
            der that they might not march uncovered by horse. But <lb/>
            the rest of the cavalry he ordered to advance to the front, be­ <lb/>
            cause the enemy were before them; in order that, if any force <lb/>
            opposed him, he might meet it with his troops in battle-array, <lb/>
            and come to an engagement, and, if any party should be seen <lb/>
            fleeing, he might pursue with the utmost expedition. 58. He <lb/>
            had always ready, in order, both those that were to pursue, <lb/>
            and those that were to remain by him; but the general order <lb/>
            of the whole he never suffered to be broken. 59. This was <lb/>
            the order in which Cyrus led his army. He himself was not <lb/>
            always in the same place, but, riding about, sometimes to one <note type="footnote"> I It has been suggested that it must have been moon-light. </note> <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            part and sometimes to another, inspected the whole, and, if they <lb/>
            had need of any directions, took care to give them. Thus did <lb/>
            Cyrus's forces pursue their march.</p>

            accompanies Cyrus. Cyrus explains why he wished, in passing Babylon, <lb/>
            to leave it at some distance. He captures three forts.</p>
          <p>i. A CERTAIN officer of Gadatas's troop of cavalry, one of <lb/>
            the chief men, when he saw Gadatas revolt from the Assyrian, <lb/>
            had conceived the notion, that if Gadatas should meet with <lb/>
            any ill-fortune, he himself might obtain from the Assyrian <lb/>
            king all that belonged to him. He accordingly sent one of <lb/>
            those whom he trusted most to the king of Assyria ; and <lb/>
            ordered the messenger, if he found the Assyrian army already <lb/>
            in Gadatas's territory, to tell the king, that, if he would lay <lb/>
            an ambuscade, he might take Gadatas and all that were with <lb/>
            him. 2. He directed him also to state what force Gadatas <lb/>
            had, and to say that Cyrus was not accompanying him; and <lb/>
            he told him the road that he intended to take. Moreover, in <lb/>
            order to be the better trusted, he sent orders to his own people <lb/>
            to deliver up to the Assyrian king a fort of which he had pos­ <lb/>
            session, in the territory of Gadatas, and all that was in it; and <lb/>
            he said that he would come himself, after he had, if he could, <lb/>
            put Gadatas to death, but if this should be impracticable, at least <lb/>
            to continue with the king of Assyria for the future. 3. When <lb/>
            the person intrusted with this commission, having ridden with <lb/>
            all possible speed, was come to the Assyrian king, and had <lb/>
            made known the object with which lie came, the king, on <lb/>
            hearing it, at once took possession of the fort, and placed him­ <lb/>
            self in ambush, with a great number of cavalry and chariots, <lb/>
            in some villages that lay very close together. 4. Gadatas, <lb/>
            when he came near these villages, sent forward some scouts <lb/>
            to explore them. The Assyrian king, when he perceived the <pb n="156"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. V. </note> <lb/>
            scouts approaching, ordered two or three chariots and a few <lb/>
            horse to quit their post, and betake themselves to flight, as <lb/>
            being terrified from being but few. The scouts, as soon as <lb/>
            they saw this, went on themselves in pursuit, and made signals <lb/>
            to Gadatas; who, being thus deceived pursued with all <lb/>
            speed. The Assyrians, when they thought Gadatas near <lb/>
            enough to be taken, started up from their ambuscade. 5. Ga­ <lb/>
            datas and his party, seeing their approach, took, as was <lb/>
            natural, to flight; and the others, as was natural, pursued; <lb/>
            when the contriver of the plot against Gadatas struck at him, <lb/>
            and though he failed in inflicting a mortal injury, hit him <lb/>
            upon the shoulder, and wounded him; and, having done this, <lb/>
            he made off to join the pursuers. When it was known who <lb/>
            he was, he urged on his horse with zeal, in company with the <lb/>
            Assyrians, and continued the pursuit with the king. 6. Here <lb/>
            those who had the slowest horses were of course overtaken by <lb/>
            those who had the fleetest; and when all Gadatas's cavalry <lb/>
            were hard pressed, from being exhausted with their previous <lb/>
            march, they beheld Cyrus advancing with his army; and we <lb/>
            may imagine that they made up to them with joy and plea­ <lb/>
            sure, as if they were putting into a port after a storm.</p>
          <p>7. Cyrus was at first surprised to see them, but when he <lb/>
            understood what the matter was, he continued, during the <lb/>
            time that the enemy were riding up towards him, to lead his <lb/>
            men forward in order; but when the enemy, finding how <lb/>
            things were, turned and fled, Cyrus commanded those that <lb/>
            were appointed for that purpose to pursue; while he himself <lb/>
            followed with the rest of the troops, in such a manner as he <lb/>
            thought most advantageous. 8. Upon this occasion, several <lb/>
            chariots were taken, some from the drivers falling off, (partly <lb/>
            in wheeling round, and partly in other ways,) and some from <lb/>
            being intercepted by the horse; and the pursuers killed a great <lb/>
            number, and amongst them the man that wounded Gadatas. <lb/>
            9. Of the Assyrian foot, that were besieging the fortress of <lb/>
            Gadatas, some fled to the fort that had revolted from Gadatas, <lb/>
            and some escaped to a large city that belonged to the Assyrian <lb/>
            king, where also the Assyrian monarch himself, with his <lb/>
            cavalry and chariots, took refuge.</p>
          <p>10. Cyrus, having made an end of the pursuit, retreated into <lb/>
            the territory of Gadatas, and after directing the proper per­ <lb/>
            sons to attend to the booty, proceeded at once to see how much <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            Gadatas was suffering from his wound; but, as lie was on his <lb/>
            way, Gadatas met him with his wound already bound up. <lb/>
            Cyrus, at sight of him, was greatly delighted, and said, " I <lb/>
            was coming to you to see how you were." 11. " And I, by <lb/>
            the gods," said Gadatas, “ was coming to gaze on you again, <lb/>
            - and to see what sort of person you are to look upon, you who <lb/>
            are possessed of such a soul; you who, neither having, I <lb/>
            know, any need of me, nor having promised to do such ser­ <lb/>
            vices for me, nor having personally received any benefit what­ <lb/>
            ever from me, have yet, because I was thought to have done <lb/>
            some service to your friends, so zealously assisted me, that, as <lb/>
            far as I myself was concerned, I had now perished, but, by <lb/>
            your means, am saved. 12. By the gods, Cyrus, if I were <lb/>
            such as I once was, and were to have children, I do not know <lb/>
            whether I could ever have a son so affectionate to me; for I <lb/>
            know that not only many another son, but that this present <lb/>
            king of the Assyrians particularly, has caused more affliction <lb/>
            to his father than be can now cause to you.</p>
          <p>is. To this address Cyrus replied, "Do you now wonder at <lb/>
            me, Gadatas, and omit to notice a much greater wonder?" <lb/>
            " What is that?" said Gadatas. "That so many Persians," <lb/>
            rejoined Cyrus, “ so many Medes, so many Hyrcanians, as <lb/>
            well as all these Armenians, Sacians, and Cadusians, have <lb/>
            been so earnest in your service." 14. Gadatas then prayed, <lb/>
            saying, “O Jupiter! may the gods bestow many blessings <lb/>
            upon them, but most upon him who is the cause that they are <lb/>
            such as they are ! But that we may properly entertain those <lb/>
            whom you commend, Cyrus, accept these presents of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, such as I am able to tender you." He at the same time <lb/>
            brought up supplies in great abundance, so that he who <lb/>
            wished might sacrifice, and that the whole army might be <lb/>
            entertained in a manner worthy of their noble acts and their <lb/>
            great good fortune.</p>
          <p>15. Meanwhile the Cadusian general still commanded in the <lb/>
            rear, and had no share in the pursuit; but being desirous <lb/>
            himself also to achieve something splendid, he made an excur­ <lb/>
            sion into the territory of Babylon, without communicating his <lb/>
            intention, or saying anything of it to Cyrus. But the As­ <lb/>
            syrian, as he was going from that city of his to which he had <lb/>
            fled, with his army in close array, fell in with the cavalry of <lb/>
            the Cadusian, which were then dispersed; 16. and, as soon as <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            he found that they were the Cadusians alone, attacked them, kill­ <lb/>
            ed their commander and many others, captured numbers of their <lb/>
            horses, and took from them the spoil that they were carrying <lb/>
            off. Having then pursued as far as he thought safe, he turned <lb/>
            back, and the Cadusians got safe to the camp, at least the fore­ <lb/>
            most of them, towards evening.</p>
          <p>17. Cyrus, as soon as he learned what had happened, went <lb/>
            out to meet the Cadusians, and of such as he saw wounded, <lb/>
            some he took and sent to Gadatas, that they might be attend­ <lb/>
            ed to, and others he lodged in tents, and took care that they <lb/>
            should have everything necessary, taking some of the Persian <lb/>
            Equals-in-honour to be his assistants; for, in such circum­ <lb/>
            stances, men of good feeling willingly afford their aid ; is. and <lb/>
            he seemed evidently to be greatly afflicted; so that, while <lb/>
            others were taking their suppers, when the time for it was <lb/>
            come, Cyrus, continuing still with the attendants and surgeons, <lb/>
            did not willingly leave any one neglected, but looked to all with <lb/>
            his own eyes; or, if he could not attend to them himself, he was <lb/>
            observed to send others to take care of them. 19. Thus at <lb/>
            length they went to rest.</p>
          <p>But as soon as it was day, he summoned the officers of the <lb/>
            other troops, and all the Cadusians, to assemble before him, and <lb/>
            addressed them to this effect: “Friends and allies, the mis­ <lb/>
            fortune that has happened to us, is such as is incident to <lb/>
            human nature; for I think it not at all wonderful, that, being <lb/>
            men, we should be guilty of error. We ought, however, to <lb/>
            reap some profit from the calamity, and to learn never to <lb/>
            separate from our whole body a force inferior to that of the <lb/>
            enemy. 20. I do not say," continued he, " that we are never <lb/>
            to march, where it may be necessary, with a detachment even <lb/>
            yet less than that with which the Cadusian marched on this <lb/>
            occasion ; but if a general march away, after having concerted <lb/>
            with another who is able to support him, though he may in­ <lb/>
            deed be deceived, yet he that remains behind may, by deceiv­ <lb/>
            ing the enemy, turn them in another direction, away from <lb/>
            those that have gone forth; he may procure safety to his <lb/>
            friends by giving other employment to his enemies, and thus <lb/>
            he that separates himself will not be wholly detached, but will <lb/>
            continue dependent on the strength of the main body; but he <lb/>
            that marches off without communicating whither he is going, is <lb/>
            in the same condition as if he were making war alone. 21. <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4. ] </note> <lb/>
            But," he proceeded, “if the gods please, we shall shortly have <lb/>
            our revenge on the enemy for this infliction. As soon as you <lb/>
            have breakfasted, I will lead you out to the spot where the <lb/>
            affair took place, and we will both bury our dead, and, if the <lb/>
            gods permit us, will let the enemy see men superior to them­ <lb/>
            selves upon the very ground where they think they have <lb/>
            triumphed, that they may not look with pleasure upon the <lb/>
            place where they butchered our fellow-combatants. If they <lb/>
            will not come out against us, we will burn their villages and <lb/>
            lay waste their country, that they may not be delighted at <lb/>
            contemplating what they themselves have done to us, but be <lb/>
            afflicted at the sight of their own calamities. 22. " Go, then," <lb/>
            said he, “ the rest of you, and take your breakfasts ; and you, <lb/>
            Cadusians, first go and choose a commander according to your <lb/>
            custom, who, with the help of the gods, and in concert with <lb/>
            us, may attend to you, in whatever way you may require; <lb/>
            and when you have made your choice and taken your break­ <lb/>
            fast, send him you have chosen to me."</p>
          <p>23. The Cadusians acted accordingly; and Cyrus, when he <lb/>
            had led out the army, placed the commander chosen by the <lb/>
            Cadusians in his station, and ordered him to lead on his force <lb/>
            near to himself, " that we may, if we can,” said he, “restore <lb/>
            the courage, of the men." They then marched on, and coming <lb/>
            to the place, buried the Cadusians, and laid the country waste. <lb/>
            Having done this, and supplied themselves with provisions <lb/>
            from the enemy's country, they again retreated into the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Gadatas.</p>
          <p>24. But, considering that those who had revolted to him, <lb/>
            being in the neighbourhood of Babylon, would suffer severely, <lb/>
            unless he himself was always at hand to protect them, he de­ <lb/>
            sired all those of the enemy that he dismissed, to tell the As­ <lb/>
            syrian, and he himself sent a herald to him with a message to <lb/>
            the same effect, " that he was ready to let the labourers em­ <lb/>
            ployed in the culture of the lands alone, and to do them no <lb/>
            injury, if he, on the other hand, would allow the labourers of <lb/>
            such as had revolted to himself, to pursue their work; 25. <lb/>
            "though indeed," added he, "if you are able to hinder them, <lb/>
            you will hinder but a few, for the land belonging to those that <lb/>
            have revolted to me, is but little; while I should allow a large <lb/>
            portion of land to be cultivated for you ; and, as to gathering <lb/>
            in the crop, if the war continues, he that is superior in arms, <pb n="160"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            I suppose, must gather it; but if there be peace, it is plain <lb/>
            that it must be you; but if any of my people take up arms <lb/>
            against you, or any of yours against me, we will both, if we <lb/>
            can, take vengeance on them." 26. Having delivered this <lb/>
            message to the herald, he despatched him.</p>
          <p>When the Assyrians heard of this proposal; they did all <lb/>
            that they could to persuade the king to comply with it, and to <lb/>
            leave as little of war remaining as was possible. 27. The <lb/>
            Assyrian monarch, accordingly, whether from being persuaded <lb/>
            by his people, or from his own inclination, consented: and an <lb/>
            agreement was made that there should be peace to those that <lb/>
            were employed in labour, and war to those that should bear <lb/>
            arms. 28. Such an agreement did Cyrus make with respect <lb/>
            to the labouring people ; but the pastures of the cattle he or­ <lb/>
            dered his own friends to settle, if they thought fit, within their <lb/>
            own jurisdiction. Booty from the enemy they carried off <lb/>
            wherever they could, in order that the service might be more <lb/>
            agreeable to the allies ; for the dangers were the same, even if <lb/>
            they did not take provisions, and to subsist by plundering the <lb/>
            enemy seemed to render the service the lighter.</p>
          <p>29. When Cyrus was preparing to march away, Gadatas <lb/>
            came to him, bringing and leading forward presents of all <lb/>
            kinds, and in great abundance, as coming from large posses­ <lb/>
            sions, and a great many horses which he had taken from his <lb/>
            own horsemen whom he mistrusted, in consequence of the late <lb/>
            plot against him. so. When he drew near, he spoke thus: <lb/>
            " I offer you these things, Cyrus, for the present; use them, <lb/>
            if you have need of them; and consider," added he, "that <lb/>
            everything else belonging to me is yours ; for there neither is, <lb/>
            nor will be, any one sprung from myself, to whom I may leave <lb/>
            my possessions; but my whole family and name," said he, <lb/>
            "must of necessity be extinguished with me when I die. 31. <lb/>
            And this misery I suffer, Cyrus," said he, " I swear to you by <lb/>
            the gods, who see everything, and hear everything, without <lb/>
            having said or done anything unjust or dishonourable." As <lb/>
            he said this, he burst into tears at his wretched fate, and was <lb/>
            unable to say more.</p>
          <p>32. Cyrus, on hearing these words, pitied his unhappy lot, <lb/>
            and replied to him thus: “The horses," said he, " I accept; for <lb/>
            I shall do you service, by giving them to men better affected to <lb/>
            rou, it seems, than they who had them before ; and shall soon <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            make up the Persian cavalry to ten thousand men, a numbei <lb/>
            which I have long desired; the rest of your property take <lb/>
            away, and keep until you see me in such a condition as not to be <lb/>
            outdone by you in making presents ; for, if you part from me, <lb/>
            giving me more than you receive from me, I know not, by the <lb/>
            gods, how it is possible for me not to feel ashamed."</p>
          <p>33. To this address Gadatas answered, " I intrust them to <lb/>
            you, for I see your disposition; and as to keeping them myself, <lb/>
            consider whether I am fit to do so. 34. While, indeed, we were <lb/>
            friends with the Assyrian king, my father's possessions seemed <lb/>
            to be the finest that could be; for, as they were near our me­ <lb/>
            tropolis, Babylon, we enjoyed all the advantages that we could <lb/>
            possibly receive from a great city; and whatever annoyances <lb/>
            we might suffer from the bustle, we escaped by retiring hither <lb/>
            to our home ; but now, since we are at enmity with him, it is <lb/>
            plain that, when you are gone, both we ourselves, and all that <lb/>
            belongs to us, will be assailed with machinations, and we shall, <lb/>
            I conceive, live in the greatest uneasiness, having our enemies <lb/>
            close upon us, and seeing them stronger than ourselves. 35. <lb/>
            Perhaps somebody may remark to me, And why did you not <lb/>
            consider this before you revolted ? Because, by reason of the <lb/>
            injuries which I received, and the resentment which I felt, <lb/>
            my mind, Cyrus, never dwelt upon the consideration of what <lb/>
            was safest, but was always teeming with the thought, whether <lb/>
            it would ever be in my power to take revenge upon this ene­ <lb/>
            my both to the gods and men, who passes his days in hating, <lb/>
            not the man that may have done him an injury, but everyone <lb/>
            that he imagines to be superior to himself. 36. This villain, <lb/>
            therefore, will, I conceive, find supporters in such as are worse <lb/>
            than himself. But if any one appear better than he, there <lb/>
            will be no need for you, Cyrus, (be assured,) to fight against <lb/>
            a good character, for the villain himself will be sufficient to <lb/>
            carry on the work till he has cut off the man better than him­ <lb/>
            self; and indeed, in annoying me, he will, I feel certain, <lb/>
            even with the aid of bad characters, easily get the advantage."</p>
          <p>37. Cyrus, on hearing this speech, was of opinion that <lb/>
            Gadatas said what was worthy of attention ; and he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately replied, "Have we not, then, strengthened your fortresses <lb/>
            with garrisons, that they may be safe for you to use them as you <lb/>
            please, whenever you go thither ? And are you not going <lb/>
            on military service with us, that, if the gods continue as at <note type="footnote"> VOL II. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            present to support us, he may be in fear of you, and not you <lb/>
            of him ? Whatever of yours you would like to see with <lb/>
            you, and whomsoever you like to converse with, bring with <lb/>
            you, and accompany us. You will be, as I expect, extremely <lb/>
            useful to me, and I will endeavour to be useful to you in <lb/>
            whatever respects I can."</p>
          <p>38. Gadatas, hearing this, recovered himself, and said, <lb/>
            " Should I be able to collect my baggage, and be ready before <lb/>
            you march ? for I should like," added he, " to take my mother <lb/>
            with me." "Yes, by Jupiter," said Cyrus, "you will be <lb/>
            ready soon enough; for I will wait till you say that all is <lb/>
            right." 39. Gadatas accordingly went and strengthened the <lb/>
            several fortresses, in concert with Cyrus, with garrisons,1 and <lb/>
            prepared every thing to bring with him with which a large <lb/>
            house might be handsomely furnished. He took with him, of <lb/>
            those whom he trusted, such as he liked, and several of those <lb/>
            also whom he distrusted, obliging some of them to take their <lb/>
            wives, and some their sisters with them, that, by their means, <lb/>
            he might hold them, as it were, bound. 40. Cyrus immediate­ <lb/>
            ly proceeded on his march, keeping Gadatas among those about <lb/>
            him, as one able to give him information about the roads, <lb/>
            springs of water, forage, and provisions, so that he might en­ <lb/>
            camp in the best supplied places.</p>
          <p>41. When, in the course of his march, he came in sight of <lb/>
            the city of Babylon, and the way that be was going appeared to <lb/>
            lead close under the walls, he called Gobryas and Gadatas, and <lb/>
            asked whether there was any other way, that he might not <lb/>
            lead the army quite so near to the wall. 42. Gobryas then <lb/>
            said, "My sovereign, there are many ways; but I thought <lb/>
            that you desired to march as near to the city as possible, that <lb/>
            you might show them that your army is now numerous and of <lb/>
            fine appearance; because, when you had a less force, you <lb/>
            marched up to the walls, and they saw that we were not very <lb/>
            numerous; and now, though the Assyrian king is in some de­ <lb/>
            gree prepared, as be said that he would be prepared, to give <lb/>
            you battle, I know that, when he sees your strength, his pre­ <lb/>
            parations will appear to him to be very insufficient."</p>
          <p>43. Cyrus, in reply, said, "You seem to me, Gobryas, to <note type="footnote">1 In sect. 37, it is said, that the fortresses had been already strength­ <lb/>
            ened with garrisons. We may suppose that Xenophon intended to <lb/>
            say that some addition was now made to the strength of the garri­ <lb/>
            sons, but we may well ask why he did not so express himself. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            wonder that, when I came with a less army, I led it up to the <lb/>
            very walls; 44. but that now, when I have a greater force, I <lb/>
            am unwilling to march near them: but do not be surprised at <lb/>
            my determination," continued he, " for to lead up to a place, <lb/>
            and to march by it, is not the same thing. All commanders <lb/>
            advance upon a place with their men in such order that they <lb/>
            may be most efficient for fighting; and those who are wise will <lb/>
            retreat so as to go off in the safest manner, not in the quickest; <lb/>
            45. but it is necessary to march past a place with the carriages <lb/>
            extended in a line, and with the rest of the baggage in loose <lb/>
            order; and all this line must be covered by armed troops, <lb/>
            and the baggage-train must nowhere appear to the enemy un­ <lb/>
            protected by a force; 46. and, marching in this manner, the <lb/>
            strength of the army must of necessity be extended in a com­ <lb/>
            paratively slender and weak line. If then the enemy should <lb/>
            have a mind, from within the walls, to make an attack on <lb/>
            any part in a close body, they would engage, wherever <lb/>
            they might make their assault, with much more effect than <lb/>
            those upon the march; 47. and to men that are marching in a <lb/>
            train, succours must be brought from a great distance; but, <lb/>
            to those that march out from within their walls, the distance <lb/>
            is short to the nearest point of the enemy, either to retire to it <lb/>
            or to return from it. 48. But if we do not pass by at less dis­ <lb/>
            tance than we have our line now extended on the march, they <lb/>
            will see our numbers ; and the whole multitude, by reason of <lb/>
            the armed men covering it, appears terrible; 49. and if, while <lb/>
            we are marching thus, they attack us in any part, we shall, from <lb/>
            seeing them from a distance, not be taken unprepared; but they <lb/>
            will rather, my friends," said he, “forbear to attack us, when <lb/>
            they would have to march a great distance from their walls, <lb/>
            unless they think themselves, with their whole force, superior to <lb/>
            our whole force ; for retreat will be perilous to them."</p>
          <p>50. As he said this, he appeared to those present to speak <lb/>
            with judgment, and Gobryas led the way, as he directed him ; <lb/>
            and while the army was moving past the city, he always, as <lb/>
            he drew off, made that part of it that was left in the rear the <lb/>
            strongest.</p>
          <p>51. When, marching on thus, he had arrived in the due <lb/>
            number of days,1 at the confines of the Assyrians and Medes, <note type="footnote">1<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐν τ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι̃ς γιγνουέυ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ις</foreign>n<foreign xml:lang="grc">̔̕̕̕̕μέο̡</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ις</foreign>.] This is Fischer's interpretation </note><note type="footnote"> m 2 </note> <pb n="164"/>

          <p>The reinforcement, for which Cyrus had sent to Persia, comes to join <lb/>
            Cyaxares, who proceeds with it to the camp of Cyrus. Cyrus goes with <lb/>
            his cavalry to meet Cyaxares, who expresses displeasure at Cyrus's pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, but is at length conciliated, and accompanies Cyrus to the camp. <lb/>
            Attention shown to Cyaxares. Cyrus addresses his troops respecting the <lb/>
            mode in which the allies should be treated.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN this matter was concluded, he sent to Cyaxares, <lb/>
            and requested him, in a letter, to come to the army, that they <lb/>
            might consult what use to make of the forts which they had <lb/>
            taken; and that, after surveying the army, he might advise, <lb/>
            with regard to the rest of their proceedings, what he thought <lb/>
            proper for them to do next: “ And tell him," said he, “that <lb/>
            if he wishes, I will come and encamp with him." The mes­ <lb/>
            senger set out to deliver this message. 2. Cyrus meanwhile <lb/>
            gave orders to prepare the Assyrian king's tent, which the <lb/>
            Medes had chosen for Cyaxares, in the most handsome possible <lb/>
            manner, not only with the other furniture which they had, <lb/>
            but also to introduce into the women's apartment the two <lb/>
            women, and together with them the female musicians, that <lb/>
            had been selected for Cyaxares. The men that received these <lb/>
            orders executed them accordingly.</p>
          <p>3. When he that was sent to Cyaxares had delivered his mess­ <lb/>
            age, Cyaxares, after listening to him, decided that it was best <lb/>
            for the army to remain on the borders ; for the Persian troops, <lb/>
            for whom Cyrus had sent, had arrived, and consisted of <lb/>
            forty thousand archers and peltasts. 4. As he saw that these <lb/>
            troops did hurt, in many ways, to the Median territory, he <lb/>
            thought it would be better to get rid of them, rather than ad­ <lb/>
            mit another multitude. The Persian general therefore, who <note type="footnote">and appears to be right. Some have translated, " on the following <lb/>
            days,” </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            had brought this force from Persia, having inquired of Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, according to the letter of Cyrus,1 whether he had need <lb/>
            of the army, and Cyaxares telling him that he had none, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded that very day, as he heard that Cyrus was at hand, to <lb/>
            conduct the army to him.</p>
          <p>5. The next day Cyaxares set forward with the Median <lb/>
            horse that remained with him; and Cyrus, as soon as he per­ <lb/>
            ceived him approaching, taking the Persian horse, who were <lb/>
            now very numerous, with all the cavalry of the Medes, Arme­ <lb/>
            nians, and Hyrcanians, and such of the other allies as were <lb/>
            best horsed and armed, rode to meet him, and to show Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares his force.</p>
          <p>6. Cyaxares, when he saw a great many splendid and excel­ <lb/>
            lent troops attending Cyrus, and but a small and compara­ <lb/>
            tively mean retinue accompanying himself, felt it as something <lb/>
            dishonourable; and great concern fell upon him. When Cy­ <lb/>
            rus, alighting from his horse, came up to him, intending to <lb/>
            kiss him according to custom, Cyaxares indeed also alighted, <lb/>
            but turned from him, and did not kiss him, but burst openly <lb/>
            into tears. 7. Cyrus in consequence ordered all the rest that <lb/>
            were there to retire and wait; while he himself, taking Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares by the right hand, and conducting him out of the road <lb/>
            under some palm-trees, ordered Median quilts to be spread <lb/>
            for him, and, making him sit down, sat down himself by him, <lb/>
            and spoke thus :</p>
          <p>8. “O uncle," said he, " tell me, I beg you, by the gods, for <lb/>
            what reason you are angry with me, and what disagreeable <lb/>
            thing you have seen, that you take thus amiss ?" Cyaxares <lb/>
            then answered, "It is, Cyrus," said he, " that I, who am re­ <lb/>
            garded as sprung from a long line of ancestors, as far back as <lb/>
            the memory of man can reach, and from a father who was a <lb/>
            king, and who am myself esteemed as a king, should see my­ <lb/>
            self marching thus meanly and unbecomingly, and you, with <lb/>
            my retinue, and other forces, appearing here in power and <lb/>
            magnificence. 9. I should think it hard to be placed in such <lb/>
            circumstances even by enemies, and find, it much harder (0 <lb/>
            Jupiter !) to be placed in them by those by whom I ought least <lb/>
            of all to be thus treated; for I think that I could sink into <lb/>
            the earth ten times more willingly than be seen with this poor <lb/>
            attendance, and behold my own people thus slighting and <note type="footnote"> I iv. 5. 31. </note> <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. V. </note> <lb/>
            scorning me; for I am not ignorant, not only that yon are <lb/>
            more powerful than myself, but that my own slaves meet me <lb/>
            in greater power, and are in such a condition as to be rather <lb/>
            able to do me harm, than liable to suffer it at my hands." 10. <lb/>
            As he said this, he was still more overcome by his tears, so <lb/>
            that he drew tears also into the eyes of Cyrus.1</p>
          <p>Cyrus, after pausing a little, said, " In this, Cyaxares, you <lb/>
            neither say truly nor judge rightly, if you think that the <lb/>
            Medes, by my presence, are put into such a condition as to <lb/>
            have the power of doing you harm. Yet I do not wonder <lb/>
            that you feel some displeasure. 11. But whether you are <lb/>
            justly or unjustly offended at the Medes, I shall forbear to <lb/>
            consider; for I know you would be displeased to hear me make <lb/>
            an apology for them. But for a ruler to show anger towards <lb/>
            all his people at once, I regard as a grave error; for, by <lb/>
            threatening a multitude, he must of necessity make that mul­ <lb/>
            titude his enemies, and, by exhibiting resentment at them all <lb/>
            together, be must inspire them with unity of feeling against <lb/>
            him. 12. Hence it was, be assured, that I would not send <lb/>
            these men away without me, being afraid lest something might <lb/>
            happen through your anger that might afflict us all. This <lb/>
            point, however, with the aid of the gods, may be comfortably <lb/>
            settled while I am present. But that you should think your­ <lb/>
            self injured by me, is a circumstance at which I am greatly <lb/>
            concerned, and shall feel sorry, if, while I have been striving, <lb/>
            as much as was in my power, to do all possible service to my <lb/>
            friends, I am now thought to have done quite the contrary. <lb/>
            13. But let us not thus charge one another at random; let us, <lb/>
            if possible, consider fairly what offence there is on my part. I <lb/>
            have a proposal, then, to make to you, the fairest that can <lb/>
            be between friends: if I shall appear to have done you any <lb/>
            harm, I will confess that I have acted wrong ; but if I appear <lb/>
            neither to have done nor to have wished you any harm, will <lb/>
            not you, on the other hand, confess that you have not been <lb/>
            wronged by me ?” 14. "I must," said he, "of necessity." " But <lb/>
            if I plainly appear to have done you service, and to have been <lb/>
            zealous to do you all the service that I could, shall I not de­ <lb/>
            serve commendation from you, rather than reproach ?" " It <lb/>
            is but just," said he. is. " Come then," said Cyrus, "and let <figure type="illustration">

              us consider all the things that I have done, one by one ; for <lb/>
              thus it will appear, most evidently, which of them was good <lb/>
              and which was ill. 16. Let us begin from the commencement <lb/>
              of this military command of mine, if this be, in your opinion, <lb/>
              to go back far enough. When you perceived that a large <lb/>
              force of your enemies was assembled, and that they were about <lb/>
              to make an attempt upon you and upon your country, you <lb/>
              sent immediately to the public council of Persia to solicit as­ <lb/>
              sistance, and to me individually to desire me to endeavour, if <lb/>
              any Persians marched to join you, to come as their com­ <lb/>
              mander. Was not I, by you, persuaded to this undertaking, <lb/>
              and did I not come, and bring you as many and as brave men <lb/>
              as I could ?" 17. “You did come," said he. " First, then," <lb/>
              said he, " tell me whether in this proceeding you had to attri­ <lb/>
              bute to me any wrong towards you, or rather benefit ? ”“It <lb/>
              is plain," said Cyaxares, " that in this particular I must im­ <lb/>
              pute benefit to you." is. And then," said Cyrus, "when <lb/>
              the enemies advanced, and we had to engage them, did you <lb/>
              perceive that at that juncture I spared any pains, or shrunk <lb/>
              from facing any danger?" " No, by Jove," said Cyaxares, <lb/>
              " not in the least." 19. And when, with the assistance of <lb/>
              the gods, the victory was ours, and the enemy retreated, I ex­ <lb/>
              horted you that we should jointly pursue them, take joint re­ <lb/>
              venge upon them, and, if anything honourable or beneficial <lb/>
              should befall us, jointly share it; can you charge me in any of <lb/>
              these points with any unreasonable regard for myself ? " 20. <lb/>
              At this question Cyaxares was silent, and Cyrus again spoke <lb/>
              thus: " But if it is more agreeable to you to be silent than to <lb/>
              answer this question, tell me," said he, " whether you thought <lb/>
              yourself injured, because, when you did not consider it safe to <lb/>
              pursue, I did not allow you to share in the danger, but only <lb/>
              desired you to send me some of your cavalry? For if I <lb/>
              wronged you in making this request, especially after having <lb/>
              devoted myself to you as an ally, let this fact be demonstrated <lb/>
              by yourself." 21. When Cyaxares kept silence at this inquiry <lb/>
              also, " If you will not reply to this," said Cyrus, " tell me then <lb/>
              whether I did you any wrong, when you gave me for answer, <lb/>
              that, as you saw the Medes indulging themselves in pleasure, <lb/>
              you were unwilling to put a stop to it, and oblige them to run <lb/>
              again into danger; and whether you think that I put any <lb/>
              hardship upon you, when, forbearing from all resentment <pb n="168"/>
              <note type="margin"> [ B. V. </note> <lb/>
              towards you, I again made you a request, than which I <lb/>
              knew there was nothing more easy for you to grant to me, or <lb/>
              more easy to be imposed on the Medes; for I merely asked <lb/>
              you to allow any of them, that wished, to follow me; 22. and <lb/>
              when I had obtained this favour from you, I had effected <lb/>
              nothing unless I could persuade them; I went therefore, and <lb/>
              persuaded them, and those with whom I prevailed I took, and <lb/>
              marched away with them with your permission. If you con­ <lb/>
              sider this to be deserving of blame, it is not blameless, it <lb/>
              would appear, to take from you what you yourself grant. 23. <lb/>
              Thus, then, we set forward; and when we were out in the <lb/>
              field what was done by us there that was not apparent ? Was <lb/>
              not the camp of the enemy taken ? Were not many of those, <lb/>
              that had advanced upon you, killed ? and of the enemies that <lb/>
              remained alive, were there not many despoiled of their arms, <lb/>
              and many of their horses ? The property of those that before <lb/>
              plundered and ravaged yours, you now see your friends plun­ <lb/>
              dering and ravaging, and bringing some of it to you, and some <lb/>
              to those that are under your dominion. 24. But, what is the <lb/>
              most important and honourable of all, you see your own terri­ <lb/>
              tory enlarged, and that of your enemies diminished; you see <lb/>
              the fortresses of the enemy occupied by your own troops, and <lb/>
              yours, that had been taken and annexed to the Assyrian do­ <lb/>
              minion, now, on the contrary, yielded to you. 25. Of these <lb/>
              things whether any be evil, or whether any be not good, I <lb/>
              know not how I can say that I desire to learn ; but nothing <lb/>
              hinders me from hearing; tell me accordingly what your <lb/>
              opinion is concerning them.'</p>
          <p>Cyrus, having spoken thus, was silent. Cyaxares, in an­ <lb/>
            swer, said, “ Indeed, Cyrus, I do not know how I can say <lb/>
            that what you have done is ill, but be well assured," said he, <lb/>
            "that these services of yours are of such a kind, that the <lb/>
            more numerous they appear, the more they distress me. 26. I <lb/>
            should rather wish to enlarge your territory with my forces, <lb/>
            than to see mine thus enlarged by yours; for these acts, <lb/>
            to you that perform them, are glorious, but on me they seem <lb/>
            in some degree to throw dishonour. 27. Wealth, also, I feel <lb/>
            that I should be better pleased to bestow upon you, than to <lb/>
            receive it from you as you now offer it to me; for I see my­ <lb/>
            self enriched by you with such gifts that I feel, as it were, <lb/>
            made poorer; and if I were to see my subjects, in some de- <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            gree, injured by you, I believe that I should feel less concern­ <lb/>
            ed than I am now, when I see them receiving great benefits <lb/>
            at your hands. 28. If I appear to you to think unreasonably <lb/>
            in this respect, do not contemplate these things with reference <lb/>
            to me, but transfer them all to yourself, and then consider <lb/>
            how they appear. For if any one should caress your dogs, <lb/>
            which you keep to protect you and yours, and make them <lb/>
            more familiar with himself than with you, would he please <lb/>
            you by such attention ? 29. Or if this appear to you but a <lb/>
            trifling matter, consider this: if any one should treat your <lb/>
            servants, whom you have procured to guard and attend you, <lb/>
            in such a manner, that they become more willing to be his <lb/>
            servants than yours, would you think yourself obliged to him <lb/>
            for his kindness ? so. And again, with reference to a matter <lb/>
            on which men most set their affections, and cherish with the <lb/>
            deepest regard, if any one should pay such court to your wife, as <lb/>
            to make her love him better than you, would he delight you <lb/>
            with such a service ? Far from it, I think," added he; " nay, <lb/>
            I know that, in acting thus, he would do you the greatest of <lb/>
            injuries. 31. But that I may mention what is most applicable <lb/>
            to my own case, if any one should pay such attention to the <lb/>
            Persians that you have conducted hither, that they would be­ <lb/>
            come more willing to follow him than to follow you, would <lb/>
            you think that man your friend ? I believe you would not, <lb/>
            but would think him more your enemy, than if he killed great <lb/>
            numbers of them. 32. Or if any friend of yours, when you <lb/>
            might tell him, in a friendly way, that he might take as much <lb/>
            of what belonged to you as he pleased, should, on hearing this, <lb/>
            go and take all that he could, and enrich himself with what <lb/>
            belonged to you, while you would not have enough for moder­ <lb/>
            ate use, could you possibly think such a one an unexception­ <lb/>
            able friend ? 33. Yet I seem now to have been treated by <lb/>
            you, if not in the same, yet in a very similar, manner; for <lb/>
            what you say is true; when I told you to take such of the <lb/>
            troops as were willing to go, you went off with my whole <lb/>
            force, and left me deserted; and now you bring me what you <lb/>
            have captured with my own army ; and you enlarge my terri­ <lb/>
            tory with the aid of my own power; while I, having had no <lb/>
            share in obtaining these advantages, seem to give myself up, <lb/>
            like a woman, to receive favours; and you, in the eyes of <lb/>
            others as well as my own subjects here, appear to be a man, <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. V </note> <lb/>
            and I to be unworthy to rule. 34. Do you consider such acts <lb/>
            as benefits, Cyrus ? Be sure that if you had any concern for <lb/>
            me, there is nothing of which you would be so careful not to <lb/>
            rob me as my dignity and honour. What advantage is it to <lb/>
            me, to have my land extended and myself brought into con­ <lb/>
            tempt ? For I do not hold my dominion over the Medes by <lb/>
            being in reality superior to them all, but rather from their es­ <lb/>
            timation that we1 are, in every way, superior to themselves."</p>
          <p>35. Cyrus, interposing while Cyaxares was yet. speaking, <lb/>
            said, " I entreat you, uncle, by all the gods, if I ever before <lb/>
            gratified you in anything, gratify me now in what I shall ask <lb/>
            of you. 36. Desist from censuring me for the present, and <lb/>
            when you have had experience of us, how we stand affected <lb/>
            towards you, then, if what has been done by me appears to <lb/>
            have been done for your service, when I salute you, salute me <lb/>
            in return, and regard me as having been of advantage to you ; <lb/>
            but if otherwise, then blame me." " Perhaps, indeed," said <lb/>
            Cyaxares, " you speak reasonably; and I will do so." " Well <lb/>
            then," said Cyrus, "shall I kiss you ?" "If you please," said <lb/>
            he. “And you will not turn from me, as you did just <lb/>
            now?" "I will not," said he. Cyrus then kissed him.</p>
          <p>37. As soon as the Medes and Persians, and the rest, (for <lb/>
            they were all anxious to see what would be the issue of the <lb/>
            affair,) saw this termination to the conference, they were <lb/>
            gratified and delighted.</p>
          <p>Cyaxares and Cyrus, mounting their horses, then rode on <lb/>
            before ; the Medes followed Cyaxares, (for Cyrus gave them <lb/>
            a signal to do so,) and the Persians followed Cyrus ; and after <lb/>
            these went the rest. 38. When they came to the camp, and <lb/>
            had lodged Cyaxares in the tent that was furnished for him, <lb/>
            those to whom orders had been given prepared everything <lb/>
            suitable for him. 39. During the time that Cyaxares was <lb/>
            disengaged, before supper, the Medes went in to him, some of <lb/>
            themselves, but most of them at the direction of Cyrus, and <lb/>
            brought him presents; one a beautiful cup-bearer, another an <lb/>
            excellent cook, another a baker, another a musician; some <lb/>
            brought him cups, and others fine raiment; and almost every <lb/>
            one presented him with something out of what they had <lb/>
            taken; 40. so that Cyaxares changed his opinion, and no <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἡμα̃ς</foreign>.] Cyaxares means himself and his ancestors. He had <lb/>
            previously used the singular number. </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            longer thought either that Cyrus had alienated them from him, <lb/>
            or that the Medes themselves were disposed to pay him less <lb/>
            attention than before.</p>
          <p>41. When it was time for supper, Cyaxares invited Cyrus, <lb/>
            and desired that, since he had not seen him for some time, he <lb/>
            would sup with him ; but Cyrus said, “Do not require me to <lb/>
            do so, Cyaxares. Do you not observe, that all those that are <lb/>
            here with us, attend here at our summons ?1 I should not, <lb/>
            therefore, act properly, if I were to appear to neglect them, <lb/>
            and mind my own pleasure. When soldiers think themselves <lb/>
            neglected, the best of them become much more despondent, <lb/>
            and the worst of them much more presuming. 42. But you, <lb/>
            especially after having come a long journey, take your supper <lb/>
            at once; and if people come to pay their respects to you, re­ <lb/>
            ceive them kindly, and entertain them well, that they may <lb/>
            feel confidence in you. I will go and attend to the business <lb/>
            to which I allude. 43. To-morrow," added he, " in the <lb/>
            morning, all the proper persons shall attend here at your <lb/>
            doors, that we may all consult together, how we are to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed henceforward; and you, being present, will propose for <lb/>
            our consideration, whether it will be proper to continue the <lb/>
            war, or whether the time is come for disbanding the army."</p>
          <p>44. Cyaxares then went to supper; and Cyrus, assembling <lb/>
            such of his friends as were best able to judge, and to act with <lb/>
            him if it should be necessary, addressed them to this effect : <lb/>
            " What we at first prayed for, my friends, is now, by the <lb/>
            favour of the gods, in our hands; for, wherever we march, we <lb/>
            are masters of the country; we see our enemies weakened, <lb/>
            and ourselves increased in numbers and strength ; 45. and if <lb/>
            they, who have now joined us as allies, be still willing to <lb/>
            continue with us, we shall be much more likely to command <lb/>
            success, whether we have occasion to act by force, or find it <lb/>
            advisable to proceed by persuasion ; that it may be the reso­ <lb/>
            lution of as many of our allies as possible, therefore, to stay <lb/>
            with us, is not more my concern to effect than yours. 46. <lb/>
            But as, when fighting is necessary, he that overcomes the <lb/>
            greatest number is thought to be the most valorous; so, when <lb/>
            it is necessary to use persuasion, he that makes the greatest <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠμῶν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ιρὁμενοι</foreign>.] Compare sect. 1, where it is said that <lb/>
            Cyrus had invited Cyaxares to a conference with respect to their <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [ B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            number to be of his opinion, may justly be esteemed the most <lb/>
            eloquent and serviceable. 47. Do not, however, enter on that <lb/>
            business, as if you expected to give us a specimen of the sort <lb/>
            of speech that you use to each individual, but exert such in­ <lb/>
            fluence that those who are persuaded by each of you may dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish themselves by what they do. 48. You, then, attend <lb/>
            to these matters; and I will try to make it my care that the <lb/>
            soldiers, while they deliberate about continuing the war, may <lb/>
            be supplied, as far as I can, with everything necessary."</p>

          <p>The allies, assembling before the tent of Cyaxares, entreat Cyrus not to dis­ <lb/>
            band the army. Cyaxares comes forth, and it is decided to continue the <lb/>
            war. Cyrus advises that the fortresses of the enemy should be taken from <lb/>
            them, and new ones erected; his advice is approved. Cyrus chooses <lb/>
            ground for his winter-quarters. The Persian cavalry is augmented in <lb/>
            number, and chariots armed with scythes are constructed. Araspes falls <lb/>
            in love with Panthea; Cyrus sends him as a spy among the enemy. Ab­ <lb/>
            radatas, the husband of Panthea, joins her, and assists Cyrus in preparing <lb/>
            chariots. Cyrus builds towers on wheels.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING passed the day in this manner, and taken their <lb/>
            suppers, they went to rest. The next day, in the morning, <lb/>
            all the allies came to the tent-door of Cyaxares; and, while <lb/>
            Cyaxares, who had heard that there was a great number of <lb/>
            people at his door, was dressing, Cyrus's friends presented to <lb/>
            him several people, who entreated him to stay, some intro­ <lb/>
            ducing Cadusians, some Hyrcanians, some Sacians, and one Go­ <lb/>
            bryas; and Hystaspes presented the eunuch Gadatas, who <lb/>
            also solicited Cyrus to remain. 2. Cyrus, who knew before <lb/>
            that Gadatas had been almost killed with fear lest the army <lb/>
            should be disbanded, laughed, and said, "It is evident, Ga­ <lb/>
            datas, that you have been persuaded by Hystaspes here to en­ <lb/>
            tertain such feelings as you express." 3. But Gadatas, lifting <lb/>
            up his hands to heaven, vowed that indeed he was not per­ <lb/>
            suaded by Hystaspes to entertain such feelings; "but I know,” <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            said be, " that if you depart, my affairs will fall utterly to <lb/>
            ruin. It was on this account," added he, “that I had some <lb/>
            talk with Hystaspes, and asked him whether he knew what <lb/>
            your intention was concerning the dismissal of the army." <lb/>
            4. Cyrus then said, " I have therefore, it appears, brought an <lb/>
            unjust charge against Hystaspes." Unjust indeed, Cyrus, <lb/>
            by Jupiter," exclaimed Hystaspes; for I merely told Ga­ <lb/>
            datas that it would be impossible for you to continue in the <lb/>
            field, as your father had sent for you." 5. " What do you <lb/>
            say?" said Cyrus, “ Durst you spread abroad such an asser­ <lb/>
            tion, whether I would or not?" “ Yes, indeed," said he; <lb/>
            for I see that you are exceedingly desirous to go about <lb/>
            among the Persians as an object to be gazed upon, and to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit to your father how you performed everything." Then <lb/>
            Cyrus said, “And are not you desirous to go home ? ” " No, <lb/>
            by Jove," said Hystaspes, “nor will I go, but stay and com­ <lb/>
            mand here, till I make our friend Gadatas master of the As­ <lb/>
            syrian king." 6. Thus did they jest, with a mixture of <lb/>
            seriousness, one with another.</p>
          <p>Cyaxares then came forth in a magnificent dress, and seated <lb/>
            himself on a Median throne. When all had assembled whose <lb/>
            presence was required, and silence was made, Cyaxares spoke <lb/>
            thus : “ Friends and allies, since I am present, and am older <lb/>
            than Cyrus, it is perhaps proper for me to open the coun­ <lb/>
            cil. It appears then to me, that it is now time to deliberate, <lb/>
            in the first place, whether it be proper to proceed with the <lb/>
            war, or at once to disband the army. Let any one who <lb/>
            wishes, therefore," added he, " say what he thinks on this <lb/>
            subject." 7. Upon this the Hyrcanian first spoke : “Friends <lb/>
            and allies, I do not know whether there is any need of words, <lb/>
            where facts themselves declare what is best to be done ; for <lb/>
            we all know that, by keeping together, we do more harm to <lb/>
            our enemies than we suffer from them ; but, when we were <lb/>
            asunder, they treated us as was most agreeable to them, and <lb/>
            most grievous to us." 8. After him the Cadusian general <lb/>
            said, “Why should we speak of separating and going each of <lb/>
            us to our homes, when it is not for our interest to separate, as <lb/>
            it appears, even while we continue in the field ; we ourselves, <lb/>
            at least, attempted an enterprise, apart from your main <lb/>
            body, and paid the penalty of it, as you all know." 9. After <lb/>
            him, Artabazus, he who had once said that he was related to <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            Cyrus, 1 spoke thus: " I differ in opinion, Cyaxares, from <lb/>
            those who have already spoken, so far as this: they say, that <lb/>
            we ought to continue on military service, remaining here <lb/>
            but I say that it was when I was at home that I was on mill <lb/>
            tary service; 10. for I had often to go out with succour, when <lb/>
            our property was driven off; I had frequently trouble with <lb/>
            regard to our fortresses, as being liable to attacks; and I was <lb/>
            continually in fear, and kept myself on guard; and all this I <lb/>
            did at my own expense. But now I am in possession of the <lb/>
            fortresses of the enemy; I am in no fear of them ; I feast on <lb/>
            what belongs to them, and I drink at the enemy's cost; since, <lb/>
            then, there is war for me at home, and feasting here, it does not <lb/>
            seem advisable to me to disband this common force." 11. After <lb/>
            him Gobryas said, " Friends and allies, thus far I applaud the <lb/>
            faith of Cyrus ; for he has been false in nothing that he pro­ <lb/>
            mised ; but, if he quit the country, it is plain that the Assyrian <lb/>
            will be at rest, and not suffer the punishment due to him for the <lb/>
            injuries which he has endeavoured to do you, and which he <lb/>
            has in fact done to me; and I, in my turn, shall again suffer <lb/>
            punishment at his hands for having become a friend to you."</p>
          <p>12. After all these Cyrus spoke. " Nor has it escaped my <lb/>
            consideration, friends," said he, " that, if we disband the <lb/>
            army, our own power will be. diminished, and that of the <lb/>

            Why then did I request Cyaxares to propose a debate re­ <lb/>
            specting the separation of the army ? It was, you may be <lb/>
            certain, because I was in fear for the future ; for I know that <lb/>
            there are adversaries advancing upon us, that we shall not be <lb/>
            able, if we keep the field as at present, to resist. 14. The <lb/>
            winter is coming on, and if we have tents for ourselves, we <lb/>
            have none, by Jove, either for our horses, or for our attend­ <lb/>
            ants, or for the common soldiers; and, without these, we <note type="footnote"> 1 i. 4. 27. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gobryas hints that Cyrus will not have fully performed his pro­ <lb/>

            shall be unable to prosecute the war. The provisions, wher­ <lb/>
            ever we have gone, have been consumed by us, and where we <lb/>
            have not been, the enemy have carried them off, for fear of us, <lb/>
            to their fortresses, so that they have them, and we are unable <lb/>
            to procure them. 15. Which of us then is so brave or so <lb/>
            strong, that he can carry on war, while struggling at the same <lb/>
            time with hunger and cold ? If therefore we have a pros­ <lb/>
            pect of continuing the war thus, I say that we ought rather <lb/>
            to disband the army of our own accord, than be dispersed, <lb/>
            against our will, by irremediable difficulties. But, if we re­ <lb/>
            solve still to persevere with the war, I say that we ought to take <lb/>
            the following course: We ought to endeavour, as soon as <lb/>
            possible, to take from the enemy as many of their strong <lb/>
            places as we can, and to erect as many places of strength as <lb/>
            we can for ourselves ; for, if this be done, that side will have <lb/>
            provisions in the greatest abundance, who can secure and lay <lb/>
            up the most, and the side that is inferior in strength will be <lb/>
            besieged. 16. But now we are in a similar case with men <lb/>
            who are sailing on the ocean; for they sail forward per­ <lb/>
            petually, but do not leave the part over which they have <lb/>
            sailed at all more their own, than that over which they have <lb/>
            not sailed; but, if we get fortresses, they will alienate the terri <lb/>
            tory from the enemy, and everything on our side will be calm <lb/>
            and undisturbed. 17. As for what some of you may perhaps <lb/>
            fear, in case you should be placed in garrisons at a distance <lb/>
            from your territory, you need be apprehensive of nothing of <lb/>
            the kind ; for we, since we are even now away from our own <lb/>
            country, will take upon us to guard those parts of yours that <lb/>
            are the nearest to the enemy; and you may occupy the parts <lb/>
            of Assyria bordering on yourselves, and cultivate them; is. <lb/>
            for, if we can guard and preserve those parts that are near <lb/>
            the enemy, you, who occupy the parts at a distance from them, <lb/>
            will live in much peace; since they will not, I should think, <lb/>
            neglect dangers that are close upon them, and form designs <lb/>
            against you that are far off ? ”</p>
          <p>19. When these suggestions were made, all the rest, as well <lb/>
            as Cyaxares, stood up and declared that they would heartily <lb/>
            join in executing them. Gadatas and Gobryas said, that if <lb/>
            the allies would give them leave, they would each build a for­ <lb/>
            tress which might be in the interest of the allies. 20. Cyrus, <lb/>
            therefore, when he saw them all so zealous to do what he had <pb n="176"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            proposed, said, in conclusion, " If then we resolve to execute <lb/>
            what we say ought to be done, we must as soon as possible <lb/>
            procure machines to demolish the strong-holds of the enemy, <lb/>
            and builders to erect fortresses of our own." 21. Accordingly <lb/>
            Cyaxares promised to construct and supply one machine, <lb/>
            Gadatas and Gobryas another, and Tigranes another; and <lb/>
            Cyrus said that he would endeavour to furnish two.1 22. <lb/>
            When these matters were settled, they procured artificers to <lb/>
            make the machines, and each prepared the materials necessary <lb/>
            for their fabric, and men, such as seemed the best qualified <lb/>
            for the office, were appointed to have the charge of the work.</p>
          <p>23. Cyrus, when he found that some time would be occu­ <lb/>
            pied in these affairs, encamped the army in such a situation as <lb/>
            he thought most healthy and most accessible for everything <lb/>
            necessary to be brought to it. He also did whatever was re­ <lb/>
            quisite for making it strong, that those who remained there <lb/>
            might always be in safety, though he himself might encamp <lb/>
            at a distance with the main body of the army. 24. Having <lb/>
            inquired likewise of those whom he supposed to be best ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with the country, from what parts of it the army <lb/>
            might be best supplied, he led out the troops from time to time <lb/>
            in foraging parties, both that he might procure the greatest <lb/>
            possible abundance of provisions for the army, that his men, <lb/>
            inured to labour by these excursions, might gain health and <lb/>
            vigour, and that, by marching, they might preserve in their <lb/>
            memories the order that they were to keep. 25. Such were <lb/>
            the occupations in which Cyrus employed himself.</p>
          <p>Deserters now came from Babylon, with some prisoners, <lb/>
            who brought word that the Assyrian king was gone towards <lb/>
            Lydia. carrying with him many talents of gold and silver, and <lb/>
            other treasures, and rich furniture of all kinds. 26. The <lb/>
            most part of the soldiery supposed that he was conveying his <lb/>
            treasures out of the way for fear; but Cyrus, feeling convinced <lb/>
            that he was gone to collect, if he could, a force against him, <lb/>
            made vigorous preparations for opposition, in the belief that <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύο</foreign> some copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλληυ</foreign>, which seems a prefer­ <lb/>

            machines, when Cyaxares, who had plenty of means at command, <lb/>
            and was now inclined to be munificent, furnished only one. Fischer <lb/>

            he should still have to fight. He accordingly made up the <lb/>
            complement of Persian cavalry, getting some horses from the <lb/>
            prisoners, and some from his friends ; for such gifts he accept­ <lb/>
            ed from all, refusing nothing, neither a fine weapon nor a <lb/>
            steed, if any person presented him with one. 27. Chariots, <lb/>
            likewise, he fitted up, both out of those that were taken, and <lb/>
            by whatever other means he could.</p>
          <p>The Trojan way1 of managing chariots,"that was practised <lb/>
            of old, and the way of managing them that is yet in use <lb/>
            amongst the Cyrenæans, he abolished; for formerly the peo­ <lb/>
            ple of Media, Syria, and Arabia, and all those of Asia,2 used <lb/>
            the same method in managing their chariots which the Cyre­ <lb/>
            næans now use; 28. as he was of opinion, that when the <lb/>
            bravest of the men were mounted upon chariots, men who <lb/>
            naturally constituted the chief strength of the army, they <lb/>
            acted the part only of skirmishers at a distance, and contributed <lb/>
            nothing of any importance to the attainment of victory. For <lb/>
            three hundred chariots take three hundred combatants, and <lb/>
            these chariots require twelve hundred horses ; and their drivers, <lb/>
            doubtless, are men in whom these brave warriors can best <lb/>
            confide, and there are three hundred others, who do the enemy <lb/>
            not the least harm. 29. This mode of managing chariots <lb/>
            therefore he abolished ; and in place of it provided a sort of <lb/>
            war chariot, with wheels of great strength, so as not to be <lb/>
            easily broken, and with long axletrees, as anything broad is <lb/>
            less liable to be overturned. The seat for the drivers he <lb/>
            made like a turret, of strong pieces of timber ; the height of <lb/>
            these seats was up to the elbows of the drivers, so that the <lb/>
            horses could be managed by reaching over the seats ; and he <lb/>
            covered the drivers, all but their eyes, with complete armour. <lb/>
            so. To the axletrees, on each side of the wheels, he fixed steel <lb/>
            scythes,3 of about two cubits in length; and others below, <lb/>
            under the axle tree, pointing to the ground; intending with <lb/>
            these chariots to break through the line of the enemy. As <lb/>
            Cyrus, at that time, contrived these chariots, so, to this day, <note type="footnote"> I The Trojan chariots carried two men, a driver and a combatant; <lb/>
            the latter, when be had to fight, leaped down from the vehicle, and <lb/>
            fought on the ground, as appears from II. xi. 91 ; xvi. 426 ; Scheffer, <lb/>
            R. V. 2. 15. The Cyrenæan chariots were manned in the same <lb/>
            way; but the fighting men remained in them in the field.

            they use them in the king's territory. He had likewise camels <lb/>
            in great number, some collected from his friends, and others <lb/>
            taken from the enemy, all assembled together. 31. Thus were <lb/>
            these matters arranged.</p>
          <p>Being desirous to send a spy into Lydia, and to learn what <lb/>
            the Assyrian king was doing, he conceived that Araspes, who <lb/>
            had the beautiful woman under his care, was a proper person <lb/>
            to go upon that enterprise; for, with Araspes, things had taken <lb/>
            a turn as follows. Being seized with a strong affection for <lb/>
            the woman, he was led to make proposals to her concerning a <lb/>
            union. 32. But she repulsed him, and continued faithful to <lb/>
            her husband, though he was absent; for she loved him very <lb/>
            much; yet she did not accuse Araspes to Cyrus, being un­ <lb/>
            willing to make a quarrel between friends. 33. But when <lb/>
            Araspes, thinking that he would thus further the attainment <lb/>
            of what he desired, threatened that if she would not submit <lb/>
            willingly, she should do so against her will, she, from dread of <lb/>
            violence, concealed the matter no longer, but sent a eunuch to <lb/>
            Cyrus, with orders to tell him everything. 34. Cyrus, when <lb/>
            he heard it, laughing at him who had said that he was above <lb/>
            the power of love, sent Artabazus with the eunuch, desiring <lb/>
            him to tell Araspes, that he was to use no violence to such a <lb/>
            woman ; but that if he could prevail with her by persuasion, <lb/>
            he would make no objection. 35. But Artabazus, coming to <lb/>
            Araspes, reproached him, calling the woman a. deposit that <lb/>
            had been trusted to him, and telling him of his impiety, in­ <lb/>
            justice, and inability to control his passion; so that Araspes <lb/>
            shed many tears for grief, sunk down with shame, and became <lb/>
            almost dead with fear, lest he should suffer some penalty at <lb/>
            the hands of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>36. Cyrus, being informed of his distress, sent for him, and <lb/>
            spoke to him by himself alone. " I find, Araspes," said he, <lb/>
            “ that you are in fear of me, and very much ashamed. But <lb/>
            lay aside these feelings, for I have heard that gods have been <lb/>
            conquered by love; I know how much men, that have been <lb/>
            accounted extremely wise, have suffered from love; and I <lb/>
            laid it to my own charge, that if I associated with beautiful <lb/>
            people, I should not have strength of mind enough to be in­ <lb/>
            sensible to them. And I am the cause of what has befallen <lb/>
            you, for I shut you up with this irresistible object." 37. <lb/>
            Araspes said, in reply, " You are in this matter too, Cyrus, as <pb n="179"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            you are in others, mild, and disposed to forgive men's errors; <lb/>
            but other men," added he, " overwhelm me with grief; for, <lb/>
            since the rumour of my misfortune has gone abroad, my ene­ <lb/>
            mies exult over me, and my friends come to me, and advise <lb/>
            me to keep myself out of the way, lest I suffer some severity <lb/>
            at your hands, as having done you great wrong."</p>
          <p>38. Cyrus then said, “Know, therefore, Araspes, that, by <lb/>
            means of this very report, it is in your power to oblige me <lb/>
            greatly, and to do very much service to our allies." " Would <lb/>
            that it might happen," said Araspes, "that I might again have <lb/>
            an opportunity of being of service to you !” 39. "If, then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " you would pretend to flee from me, and go over <lb/>
            to the enemy, I think that you would be trusted by them." <lb/>
            " I know, by Jove," said Araspes, " that I should give occa­ <lb/>
            sion to have it said even by my friends that I fled from you." <lb/>
            40. " You might then return to us," said Cyrus, " with a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the enemy's affairs; for I believe that, from giving <lb/>
            credit to you, they would make you a sharer in their debates and <lb/>
            counsels, so that nothing of what we desire to know would be <lb/>
            concealed from you." " I will go then," said he, " at once ; <lb/>
            for the supposition that I have made my escape from you, as <lb/>
            being about to receive punishment at your hands, will be one <lb/>
            of the things that will gain me credit."</p>
          <p>41. “ Will you be able, then," said Cyrus, "to leave the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful Panthea?” “Yes, Cyrus," said he, " for I have plainly <lb/>
            two souls; I have now learned this point of philosophy by <lb/>
            the aid of that wicked sophist Love ; for a single soul cannot <lb/>
            be good and bad at the same time, or affect, at the same time, <lb/>
            both noble actions and dishonourable ones, or wish and not <lb/>
            wish the same things at the same time; but it is plain that. <lb/>
            there are two souls,1 and, when the good one prevails, noble <lb/>
            acts are done; when the ill one prevails, dishonourable acts <lb/>
            are attempted. But the good one, since it has found a sup­ <lb/>
            porter in you, has now the superiority, and to a very great de­ <lb/>
            gree." 42. c'If you think it proper, then, to go," said Cyrus, "you <lb/>
            must, in order to gain the greater credit with the enemy, act <lb/>
            in this manner: you must tell them the state of our affairs, <lb/>

            possible discouragement to what they intend to do; and it <lb/>
            would be some discouragement if you were to say, that we are <lb/>
            preparing to effect an entrance at some point of their territory; <lb/>
            for, when they hear this, they will be less likely to assemble <lb/>
            their whole force together, every one being in fear for what <lb/>
            he has at home. 43. And stay with them," he concluded, " as <lb/>
            long as you can; for what they do when they are nearest <lb/>
            to us, will be the most for our purpose to know; and advise them, <lb/>
            also, to form themselves into such order as may be thought <lb/>
            the best; for, when you come away, and are supposed to have <lb/>
            a knowledge of their order, they will be under a necessity to <lb/>
            adhere to that order, as they will be afraid of making a change <lb/>
            in it; or, if they do make a change, they will instantly throw <lb/>
            themselves into confusion."</p>
          <p>44. Araspes, accordingly, taking with him such of his ad­ <lb/>
            herents as he most trusted, and making such communications to <lb/>
            certain persons as he thought would conduce to the success <lb/>
            of his enterprise, took his departure.</p>
          <p>45. Panthea, as soon as she heard that Araspes was gone, <lb/>
            sent to Cyrus, and said, "Be not afflicted, Cyrus, that Araspes <lb/>
            Is gone over to the enemy; for, if you will allow me to send <lb/>
            to my husband, I engage that there will come to you a much <lb/>
            more faithful friend than Araspes. I know that he will join <lb/>
            you with all the force that he can bring ; for the father of the <lb/>
            king now reigning was his friend, but the present king at­ <lb/>
            tempted once to part my husband and myself from each other; <lb/>
            and, regarding him therefore as an insolent tyrant, I know <lb/>
            that he would joyfully revolt from him to such a man as you <lb/>
            are." 46. Cyrus, hearing these assurances, desired her to send <lb/>
            to her husband. She accordingly sent; and when Abradatas re­ <lb/>
            cognised the tokens brought from his wife, and learned how other <lb/>
            matters stood, he marched joyfully away to join Cyrus, having <lb/>
            with him about a thousand1 horse. When he came up to the <lb/>
            Persian sentinels, he sent to Cyrus to let him know who he was. <lb/>
            Cyrus immediately gave orders to conduct him to his wife. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἈμΦἰτοὐς χιλίους</foreign>.] This is Dindorf's reading. Schneider, <lb/>

            mutually embraced, as may be supposed, at a meeting so un­ <lb/>
            expected. Panthea then told him of the integrity and discre­ <lb/>
            tion of Cyrus, and of his compassion towards her. Abrada.. <lb/>
            tas, on hearing this, said, “ And how can I act, Panthea, so as <lb/>
            to show my gratitude to Cyrus for you and for myself?” <lb/>
            " How else, said Panthea, " but by endeavouring to behave <lb/>
            towards him as he has behaved towards you ?” 48. Upon this, <lb/>
            Abradatas went to Cyrus, and, as soon as he saw him, taking <lb/>
            him by the right hand, he said, " In return for the benefits <lb/>
            which you have bestowed upon us, Cyrus, I can say nothing <lb/>
            more than that I give myself to you as a friend, a servant, <lb/>
            and an ally; and in whatever enterprises I see you engage, I <lb/>
            will endeavour to be as efficient a supporter to you in them as <lb/>
            I can." 49. Cyrus said, " I accept your kindness, and take <lb/>
            leave of you for the present, that you may go to supper with <lb/>
            your wife; at some other time, you must be my guest in my <lb/>
            tent, together with your friends and mine."</p>
          <p>50. Soon after, Abradatas, observing Cyrus engaged about <lb/>
            the chariots armed with scythes, and about the horses and <lb/>
            horsemen that were to be clothed in armour, endeavoured, out <lb/>
            of his own body of horse, to fit up chariots, such as his were, <lb/>
            to the number of a hundred; and he prepared to lead them, <lb/>
            riding in a chariot himself. 51. His own chariot he formed <lb/>
            with four poles, and for eight horses; (his wife Panthea, out <lb/>
            of what she had with her, made him a breastplate of gold, <lb/>
            and a golden head-piece, as well as arm-pieces;) 1 and the <lb/>
            horses of his chariot he equipped with brazen mail. 52. In <lb/>
            this manner did Abradatas occupy himself.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, observing his chariot with four poles, conceived that <lb/>
            it might be possible to make one with eight, so as to draw the <lb/>
            lower story of the machines with eight yoke of oxen; this <lb/>
            story, with its wheels, was about eighteen feet from the <lb/>
            ground. 53. Towers of this kind, following in the line of the <lb/>
            army, seemed to him likely to be a great support to his own <lb/>
            troops, and a great means of doing mischief to the body of the <lb/>
            enemy. Upon these stories he made galleries and parapets; <lb/>
            and upon each tower he mounted twenty men. 54. When <note type="footnote"> 1 The words in the parenthesis are generally thought spurious or <lb/>

            factured by some meddler from c. iv. sect. 2. </note> <pb n="182"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            everything about the towers was settled for him, he made trial <lb/>
            of their draught; and the eight yoke of oxen drew a tower, <lb/>
            and the men upon it, with more ease than each single yoke <lb/>
            drew the common baggage weight; for the weight of baggage <lb/>
            was about five and twenty talents1 to each yoke; but the <lb/>
            draught of a turret, with boards as thick as those of a tragic <lb/>
            stage, and with twenty men and their arms, was but fifteen <lb/>
            talents for each yoke. 55. When he found that the draught <lb/>
            was easy, he prepared to take these towers with the army, <lb/>
            considering that to secure advantage in war was safe, just, and <lb/>
            likely to lead to success.</p>

          <p>The ambassadors from the Indian king, on their return, are sent to learn <lb/>
            the state of affairs among the Assyrians. Preparations of Cyrus. The <lb/>
            report brought by the Indian ambassadors excites some alarm among the <lb/>
            Persians, which Cyrus allays by a speech to them. It is resolved to <lb/>
            march at once against the enemy; and Cyrus instructs his men how they <lb/>
            should prepare themselves.</p>
          <p>1. AT this time there came an embassy from the Indian <lb/>
            king, bringing presents, and stated that the Indian sent the <lb/>
            following message : " I am pleased, Cyrus, that you have told <lb/>
            me what you wanted; I am desirous to be your friend, and I <lb/>
            send you presents; if you wish for anything else, send for it. <lb/>
            Orders have been given to those who come from me to do <lb/>
            whatever you desire of them."</p>
          <p>2. Cyrus, hearing this, said, " I desire then, that some of <lb/>
            you, remaining here, where you have pitched your tents, may <lb/>
            take care of the presents, and live as is most agreeable to you. <lb/>
            But go forward, three of you, to the enemy, as if you came from <lb/>
            the Indian king to treat of an alliance, and, informing your­ <lb/>
            selves of what they are saying and doing there, bring me and the <lb/>
            Indian monarch an account of it as soon as is possible. If you <lb/>
            serve me well in this matter, I shall feel yet more obliged to <lb/>
            you, than for your coming and bringing me presents; for <lb/>
            spies that appear like men of mean condition, can neither learn <note type="footnote"> 1 Mr. Hussey, Essay on Ancient Weights, &amp;c., p. 43, gives the <lb/>
            Attic talent as nearly 57 lbs. avoirdupois. </note> <pb n="183"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            nor communicate anything more than what every one knows; <lb/>
            but such men as you are can often gain a knowledge of what <lb/>
            is designed." 3. The Indians heard this proposal with plea­ <lb/>
            sure, and, after being entertained on the occasion by Cyrus, <lb/>
            prepared their baggage and went off the next day, promising <lb/>
            faithfully to learn as much as they could of the enemy's plans, <lb/>
            and to return as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>4. Cyrus made all other preparations for the war in a <lb/>
            magnificent manner, as a man who was meditating no mean <lb/>
            enterprise, and not only attended to what was approved by <lb/>
            the allies, but also excited among his friends a mutual emula­ <lb/>
            tion that they might appear each as handsomely armed as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, each most skilled in horsemanship, most expert in throw­ <lb/>
            ing the javelin, most skilful in the use of the bow, and most <lb/>
            ready to endure fatigue. 5. This he effected by leading them <lb/>
            out to hunt, and rewarding such as were most meritorious in <lb/>
            the several exercises. The officers that he observed most <lb/>
            anxious that their men should excel, he animated by praising <lb/>
            them, and by gratifying them in every way that he could. <lb/>
            6. Wherever he made a sacrifice, or solemnized a festival, lie <lb/>
            celebrated games on the occasion, in all the exercises that <lb/>
            men practise with a view to war, and gave magnificent re­ <lb/>
            wards to the conquerors ; and great alacrity prevailed through­ <lb/>
            out the army.</p>
          <p>7. Almost everything that Cyrus wished to take with him <lb/>
            to the field was now completed, except the machines ;for the <lb/>
            Persian cavalry were made up to ten thousand; the chariots, <lb/>
            armed with scythes, that he himself had equipped, were now <lb/>
            a full hundred; those that Abradatas of Susa undertook to <lb/>
            provide, like those of Cyrus, were also a complete hundred; <lb/>
            s. and the Median chariots, which Cyrus had persuaded Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares to alter from the Trojan and Libyan1 form, were made <lb/>
            up to another hundred. Men were also appointed for the ca­ <lb/>
            mels ; two archers to each. Most of the troops, too, felt in <lb/>
            such spirits as if they were already quite victorious, and as if <lb/>
            the power of th 3 enemy was nothing.</p>
          <p>9. While they were in this temper, the Indians, whom Cy­ <lb/>
            rus had sent to get intelligence from the enemy, returned, and <lb/>
            said that Crœsus had been chosen leader and commander of <note type="footnote">1 See chap. i. sect. 27. Libyan is the same as Cyrenæan, Cyrene <lb/>
            being in Africa or Libya. </note> <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. VI </note> <lb/>
            all the enemy's forces ; that it had beem determined by all the <lb/>
            princes in their alliance that each should join the army with <lb/>
            his whole force; that they should contribute large sums of <lb/>
            money, and expend them in hiring such troops as they could, <lb/>
            and in making presents to those to whom it was proper to <lb/>
            make them; 10. that a great number of Thracians, armed with <lb/>
            short swords, 1 were already hired; that the Egyptians were <lb/>
            under sail to join them, the number of whom, they said, <lb/>
            amounted to a hundred and twenty thousand, armed with <lb/>
            shields that reached down to their feet, and large spears, such <lb/>
            as they use at this day, and small swords; they said that <lb/>
            there was also a force of Cyprians ; that all the Cilicians, the <lb/>
            people of both Phrygias, the Lycaonians, Paphlagonians, <lb/>
            Cappadocians, Arabians, Phœnicians, and Assyrians, with <lb/>
            the prince of Babylon, had already arrived ; that the Ionians, <lb/>
            the Æolians, and all the Greek colonies in Asia, were obliged <lb/>
            to attend Crœsus ; 11. that Crœsus had sent to Lacedæmon, to <lb/>
            propose an alliance; that the army was assembled on the <lb/>
            river Pactolus, and was about to advance to Thymbrara, <lb/>
            where the place of assembly still is for all the barbarians of <lb/>
            Lower Syria that are subject to the king; 2 and that orders <lb/>
            had been given to all, to bring thither provisions for sale. <lb/>
            The prisoners gave nearly the same account; for Cyrus had <lb/>
            contrived that some of his own men should be taken by the <lb/>
            enemy, in order that he might learn something from them ; <lb/>
            and he sent out spies in the garb of slaves, pretending to be <lb/>
            deserters.</p>
          <p>12. When the army of Cyrus heard this news, every one, <lb/>
            as was natural, was under concern; they went about more <lb/>
            sedately than usual, and did not appear at all cheerful; they <lb/>
            collected in groups, and all places were full of people, asking <lb/>
            each other questions, and discoursing together concerning <lb/>
            these matters.</p>
          <p>13. As Cyrus perceived that alarm was spreading through <lb/>
            the army, he called together the commanders of the several <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΜαχαιροΦόρους</foreign>.] The Thracians, as well as the Sarmatians and <lb/>
            the Getee, (Ovid, Trist. v. 7, 19,) fought with knives or short swords, <lb/>
            (cultris,) which were attached to their sides, and called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάχαιραι</foreign>. <lb/>

            bodies, with all those from whose dejection any harm might <lb/>
            arise, or whose cheerfulness might be of good effect, and gave <lb/>
            notice to the inferior officers, that if any others of the soldiers <lb/>
            wished to come and hear his speech, they should not hindei <lb/>
            them. When they were assembled, he said,</p>
          <p>14. "Friends and allies, I have called you together, be­ <lb/>
            cause I observed that, since these accounts have come from <lb/>
            the enemy, some of you appear like men that are afraid: <lb/>
            for if any of you are really afraid because the enemy are as­ <lb/>
            sembling, it appears to me extremely surprising; and also, <lb/>
            that since we are at this time collected in much greater force <lb/>
            than when we defeated them, and, with the help of the <lb/>
            gods, are now better equipped than before, you, seeing this to <lb/>
            be the case, are not in the highest spirits. 15. In the name <lb/>
            of the gods !” continued he, " how would you, who are afraid <lb/>
            now, have felt, if people had brought you word that such an <lb/>
            array as is now on our side was advancing against us, and <lb/>
            you had heard, first of all, that they who had defeated us be­ <lb/>
            fore were coming upon us again, thinking of the victory <lb/>
            which they then obtained ; 16. then, that they, who at that time <lb/>
            repelled the discharge of missiles from the archers and javelin- <lb/>
            men, were now coming, with multitudes more like themselves ; <lb/>
            next, that as these heavy-armed men, at that time, conquered <lb/>
            our foot, so, now, their cavalry, fully equipped, were advancing <lb/>
            against our horse, and that, laying aside bows and javelins, <lb/>
            each of them, wielding one strong lance, was resolved to ride <lb/>
            up to us, in order to contend hand to hand; 17. that there <lb/>
            are besides chariots coming, which will not stand still as <lb/>
            heretofore, turned away as for flight, 1 but that the horses of <lb/>
            these chariots are covered with mail, the drivers stand in <lb/>
            wooden towers, covered on all the upper parts of their bodies <lb/>
            with corslets and helmets, while steel scythes are fixed to the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀπεϭτραμμένα ὤϭπερ εἰς Φυγήν</foreign>.] The fighter entered the chariot <lb/>
            at the back, and, consequently, when he had quitted it to combat <lb/>
            on the ground, the driver wheeled it round with its back towards <lb/>
            the enemy, the better to allow the fighter to retreat, if he should be <lb/>
            obliged or inclined to do so. This is the sense in which Weiske <lb/>
            and Bornemann understand the words, and which appears to be the <lb/>
            true sense. Schneider, referring to iii. 3. 64, and vii. 1. 29, supposed <lb/>
            that the allusion was to the position of the chariots behind the <lb/>
            front line ; but this supposition does not account for the use of the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεϭτραμμένα</foreign>. </note> <pb n="186"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            axle-trees, in order to cut at once through the ranks of the <lb/>
            enemy; is. that they have camels, too, on which they will <lb/>
            ride up to us, and of one of which a hundred horses would <lb/>
            not endure the sight; 19. and that they are advancing, more­ <lb/>
            over, with certain towers, from which they can support their <lb/>
            own people, and, by discharging their weapons upon us, hinder <lb/>
            us from fighting with those on even ground ;-if any one told <lb/>
            you that the enemies were possessed of these advantages, how, <lb/>
            I say, would you, who are afraid now, have felt then ? But, <lb/>
            when it is told you that Crœsus is chosen the enemy's general, <lb/>
            he who was so much less courageous than the Syrians, inas­ <lb/>
            much as the Syrians were beaten before they fled, but Croe­ <lb/>
            sus, when he saw them beaten, instead of supporting his allies, <lb/>
            took to flight and went off; 20. and when it is also told you <lb/>
            that the same enemies do not think themselves sufficient to <lb/>
            engage us, but are hiring others, in the belief that they will <lb/>
            fight for them better than themselves ;-if these things, such <lb/>
            as they are, appear terrible to any of you, and the state of our <lb/>
            own affairs weak, I think, my friends, that we ought to send <lb/>
            such persons over to the enemy, for, by being there, they may <lb/>
            do us more service than by remaining amongst us !"</p>
          <p>21. When Cyrus had said this, Chrysantas the Persian <lb/>
            stood up and spoke thus : " Do not wonder, 0 Cyrus ! that <lb/>
            some of us have gathered gloom on our countenances from hav­ <lb/>
            ing heard these accounts; for they have not been thus affect­ <lb/>
            ed from fear, but from grief ; just as if," continued lie, "when <lb/>
            people were longing and expecting to dine, some work should <lb/>
            be mentioned to them, that must be done before they dined, <lb/>
            no one of them, I believe, would be pleased to hear of it. <lb/>
            So we, while we are in present expectation of enriching our­ <lb/>
            selves, and hear that there is some work left that we must <lb/>
            perform, have our countenances overcast, not from fear, but <lb/>
            from wishing that the work were already done. 22. But, <lb/>
            since we are not only to contend for Syria, where there is <lb/>
            corn in abundance, and flocks, and fruitful palm trees, but <lb/>
            for Lydia also, in which there is abundance of wine, abundance <lb/>
            of figs, and abundance of oil, and which the sea washes, from <lb/>
            which more valuable things are imported into it than any one <lb/>
            of us ever saw, we are, when we think on such prospects, no <lb/>
            longer dejected, but conceive the highest possible courage, in <lb/>
            order that we may the sooner enjoy these precious possessions of <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2. ] </note> <lb/>
            Lydia." Thus spoke Chrysantas; and all the allies were <lb/>
            pleased with his observations, and applauded them.</p>
          <p>23. " Indeed, my friends," said Cyrus, " it appears to me <lb/>
            that we should march upon the enemy as soon as we can, so <lb/>
            that we may in the first place, if possible, take them by sur­ <lb/>
            prise, by forcing our way to the parts where their provisions <lb/>
            are deposited ;and besides, the sooner we come upon them, <lb/>
            the fewer preparations shall we find made by them, and the <lb/>
            greater deficiencies existing. 24. This I give as my judg­ <lb/>
            ment ; if any one think any other course safer or easier for us, <lb/>
            let him inform us."</p>
          <p>After many had concurred in opinion that it was proper to <lb/>
            march, as soon as possible, upon the enemy, no one offered a <lb/>
            remark to the contrary. Cyrus, in consequence, began an ad­ <lb/>
            dress to them to the following effect:</p>
          <p>25. “Friends and allies, our minds, our bodies, and the arms <lb/>
            that we are to use, have been, with the help of the gods, long <lb/>
            since provided for us; it is now necessary for us to procure pro­ <lb/>
            visions for a march for not less than twenty days, both for our­ <lb/>
            selves, and as many beasts as we may require ; for, upon calcu­ <lb/>
            lation, I find that our journey will occupy more than fifteen <lb/>
            days, during the course of which we shall find no sort of provi­ <lb/>
            sions ; for they have been carried off, partly by ourselves, and <lb/>
            partly by the enemy, as far as they could. 26. We must therefore <lb/>
            collect a sufficient quantity of food, without which we can nei­ <lb/>
            ther fight nor live ; but of wine, only so much as is enough to <lb/>
            accustom us to drink water ; for a great part of the way is <lb/>
            entirely unprovided with wine, for which even were we to put <lb/>
            up a very great quantity of it, it would not suffice us. 27. <lb/>
            That we may not, therefore, by being suddenly left without <lb/>
            wine, fall into diseases, we must act thus; let us at once begin <lb/>
            to drink water with our food; for, by doing so now, we shall <lb/>
            make no very great change ; 28. since, whoever lives on <lb/>
            barley-meal, eats his barley-cake made up with water; and he <lb/>
            that feeds on wheaten bread, eats his loaf kneaded up with <lb/>
            water ; and all boiled meats are cooked with a great quantity <lb/>
            of water. But if, after our meal, we drink a little wine upon <lb/>
            it, our appetite, not having less than usual, rests satisfied. <lb/>
            29. We must however proceed to diminish the quantity that <lb/>
            we drink after our food, until we become insensible water- <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[ B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            drinkers; for an alteration, little by little, brings any nature <lb/>
            to bear a total change; a circumstance which the gods them­ <lb/>
            selves teach us, by leading us gradually, from the midst of <lb/>
            winter, to bear violent heat; and, from the heat, to bear severe <lb/>
            cold; and we, in imitation of them, ought, by practice, to <lb/>
            reach the end that we would attain. so. A weight of bed- <lb/>
            clothes you may spare, and spend the price of them on pro­ <lb/>
            visions ;1 for an extraordinary quantity of provisions may <lb/>
            not be without its use; but if you should be deficient in bed- <lb/>
            clothes, you need not fear that you will sleep uncomfortably; <lb/>
            if it prove otherwise, blame me. Of wearing apparel, a great <lb/>
            abundance is of advantage to him that has it, both in health <lb/>
            and sickness. 31. Meats should be provided, such as are acid, <lb/>
            sharp, and salt; for they create appetite, and afford the most <lb/>
            lasting nourishment. And when we come into those parts of <lb/>
            the country that are untouched, where it is probable that we <lb/>
            shall find corn, we ought to be ready provided 2 with hand­ <lb/>
            mills, with which we may prepare our corn ; for this is the <lb/>
            lightest of the instruments used in making bread. 32. We ought <lb/>
            likewise to carry with us such things as sick people want; for <lb/>
            their bulk is very small, and we may, if such fortune befall us, <lb/>
            be very much in want of them. We must also have store of <lb/>
            straps ; for most things, both about men and horses, are fast­ <lb/>
            ened by straps, and, when they wear out, or break, we shall <lb/>
            have to stand still, unless some of us carry spare straps. 33. <lb/>
            Whoever has learned to polish a lance, it will be well for him <lb/>
            not to forget a rasp, and it will be well for him to carry a <lb/>
            file ; for he that whets his spear, whets his courage at the <lb/>
            same time; as it is a sort of shame, that one who sharpens <lb/>
            his lance, should himself be spiritless. We should likewise <lb/>
            have plenty of timber with us, for the chariots and carriages ; <lb/>
            for in many departments of action, there will be many things <lb/>
            defective. 34. We ought to have, too, the instruments most <lb/>
            necessary for all these works, for artificers are not found <lb/>
            everywhere, nor will a few of them be able to do what will <lb/>
            be required every day. For every carriage we should have a <figure type="illustration">

              shovel and a mattock; and for every beast of burden, an axe <lb/>
              and a bill ;1 for these instruments are useful to every one in <lb/>
              particular, and are often serviceable for general use. 35. As <lb/>
              to what is necessary for subsistence, therefore, you who are <lb/>
              officers of the men in arms, examine those that are under you ; <lb/>
              for we must overlook nothing of the supplies that each man <lb/>
              may require, as we shall need them.2 As to the things which <lb/>
              I order the men to provide for the beasts of burden, you who <lb/>
              have the care of the baggage-train, examine into their condi­ <lb/>
              tion, and oblige the man that has them not, to procure them. <lb/>
              3G. You, also, who are officers of the pioneers, get a list from <lb/>
              me of such as have been expelled3 from the javelin-men, the <lb/>
              archers, and the slingers; and those that come from among <lb/>
              the javelin-men, you must oblige to march with an axe for <lb/>
              cutting wood ; those from among the archers, with a mattock ; <lb/>
              and those from among the slingers, with a shovel. These <lb/>
              must march, carrying these instruments, in troops before the <lb/>
              carriages, in order that, if it be necessary to clear the way, <lb/>
              you may presently set to work, and that I, if I want anything <lb/>
              done, may know from whence I must get men for my use. <lb/>
              37. I will take with me also smiths, carpenters, and leather­ <lb/>
              cutters, of an age for service, with all their proper tools, so <lb/>
              that if anything is wanted in the army in such arts, it may <lb/>
              not be left undone. These shall be detached from the troops <lb/>
              under arms, but shall be in an appointed place, ready to do <lb/>
              service for hire, in what they understand, for any one that <lb/>
              wishes to engage them. 38. If any trader desires to attend us, <lb/>
              with a view to selling any article, he shall, if he be found selling <lb/>
              anything during the specified number of days for which the <lb/>
              men are to bring provisions, be deprived of all that he has ; <lb/>
              but when those days are past, he may sell as he pleases. And <lb/>
              whoever of these traders shall be found to offer the greatest sup­ <lb/>

          <p>Description of the order of march, and arrangement of the carriages ana <lb/>
            baggage. Cyrus takes some prisoners, and questions them as to the con­ <lb/>
            dition of the enemy. Araspes returns and brings him further information. <lb/>
            Disposition of the troops of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>i. THE officers, after listening to this exhortation, proceed­ <lb/>
            ed to make their preparations ; and Cyrus offered sacrifice. <lb/>
            When the omens from the victims were favourable, he set for­ <lb/>
            ward with the army, and encamped the first day at as short a <lb/>
            distance from home as he could, that if any one had forgotten <lb/>
            anything, lie might return for it; and that if any one found <lb/>
            himself in want of anything, he might provide it. 2. Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, with the third part of the Modes, stayed behind, that <lb/>
            affairs at home might not be left without a governor.</p>
          <p>Cyrus marched with the utmost despatch, keeping the <lb/>
            cavalry in front, but making the explorers and scouts, from <lb/>
            time to time, mount up before, on places from which they <lb/>
            could most conveniently look forward. Behind the cavalry <lb/>
            he brought up the baggage, forming, where the country was <lb/>
            level, several lines of the carriages and beasts of burden, As <lb/>
            the body of foot followed next, if any of the baggage train fell <lb/>
            behind, those of the officers that were at hand took care that <lb/>
            it might not be hindered from making its way. 3. But, <lb/>
            where the road was more contracted, the armed infantry, <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            ranging the baggage train in the middle, marched on each <lb/>
            side of it; and if any obstruction came in the way, those of <lb/>
            the soldiers, again, that were near that part, attended to it. <lb/>
            The several companies marched for the most part with their <lb/>
            own baggage next them, for orders had been given to those <lb/>
            who had charge of the baggage to march each near his own <lb/>
            company, unless some unavoidable necessity prevented ; 4. <lb/>
            and the baggage-captain of each centurion carried, on the <lb/>
            march, his own ensign, known to the men of their several <lb/>
            companies ; so that they marched in close order, and every <lb/>
            officer took great care of his own men's baggage, that it might <lb/>
            not be left behind ; and, by observing this order, they had <lb/>
            no need to seek for each other, and all things were at hand <lb/>
            and in greater safety, and the'soldiers could more readily <lb/>
            obtain what they wanted.</p>
          <p>5. But as soon as the scouts in advance thought that they <lb/>
            observed men in the plain collecting forage and wood, and <lb/>
            saw beasts of burden laden with other such things, and others <lb/>
            feeding, and then looking forward to a greater distance <lb/>
            thought that they perceived smoke, or dust, rising up into the <lb/>
            air, they could pretty well conclude, from all these indications, <lb/>
            that the army of the enemy was somewhere near at hand. <lb/>
            6. The captain of the scouts, therefore, immediately sent a <lb/>
            messenger to Cyrus to tell him what they saw.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, on receiving this information, directed the scouts to <lb/>
            remain in the same places of observation, and to give him an <lb/>
            account, from time to time, of whatever new appearance they <lb/>
            might observe. He also sent a company of horse forward, <lb/>
            and ordered them to endeavour to capture some of the men <lb/>
            that were in the plain, that they might ascertain more accu­ <lb/>
            rately what was the real state of affairs. Those who received <lb/>
            these orders acted accordingly. 7. Ti e rest of his army he <lb/>
            caused to halt where they were, so that the men might pro­ <lb/>
            vide themselves with whatever he thought necessary before <lb/>
            they came to close quarters with the enemy ; and, first of <lb/>
            all, he gave notice that they should take their dinners, and <lb/>
            then wait in their posts to attend to further orders. 8. When <lb/>
            they had dined, he called together the officers of the horse, <lb/>
            foot, and chariots, as well as those of the machines, baggage- <lb/>
            train, and carriages ; and they assembled accordingly.</p>
          <p>9. Those who had made an excursion into the plain, having <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            taken some prisoners, now brought them up. The prisoners, <lb/>
            being questioned by Cyrus, told him, that they were from the <lb/>
            enemy's camp, and, having passed their advanced guard, had <lb/>
            come out, some for forage and some for wood ; for, by reason <lb/>
            of the great number of the army, everything was scarce. <lb/>
            10. Cyrus, on hearing this, said, "And how far is the army <lb/>
            from hence?" They told him, about two parasangs. Cyrus <lb/>
            then asked, " Is there any talk amongst them concerning us ? ” <lb/>
            “ Yes, by Jove," said they, " a great deal, to the effect that <lb/>
            you are already advancing close upon them." " Well then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, "did they rejoice at hearing of our approach?” <lb/>
            This he asked for the sake of those who stood by. " No, in­ <lb/>
            deed, said they, "they did not rejoice, but were very much <lb/>
            troubled." 11. And what," asked Cyrus, "are they now <lb/>
            doing ?”“ They are forming in order of battle," said they, "and <lb/>
            both yesterday and the day before they were engaged in the <lb/>
            same employment." " And who is it that is arranging them ? ” <lb/>
            inquired Cyrus. " Crœsus himself," said they, " and with <lb/>
            him a certain Greek, and another besides, who is a Mede, <lb/>
            and who was said to be a deserter from you." Cyrus then ex­ <lb/>
            claimed, " 0 supreme Jupiter, may it be my fortune to take <lb/>
            this mail as I desire !"</p>
          <p>12. He now ordered them to take away the prisoners, and <lb/>
            turned to the by-standers as if he were going to say something. <lb/>
            But at that instant there came another man from the captain <lb/>
            of the scouts, who told him a great body of horse was visible <lb/>
            in the plain, " and we conjecture," said he, " that they are <lb/>
            riding forward with an intention to take a view of the army; <lb/>
            for, in advance of this body, there is another party, of about <lb/>
            thirty horse, that are riding on in compact order, directly <lb/>
            over against us, perhaps with a design to seize, if they can, <lb/>
            our place of observation, and we are but a single decad upon <lb/>
            that station." 13. Cyrus then ordered a detachment of the <lb/>
            cavalry, that always attended him, to ride up close to the <lb/>
            place of observation, out of the enemy's sight, and to keep <lb/>
            themselves quiet there. " And whenever our decad," said he, <lb/>
            “ quits the station, rush forth and attack those that mount it; <lb/>
            and, that the enemy's greater body may not annoy you, you, <lb/>
            Hystaspes,” added he, " take a thousand horse, and march <lb/>
            forth, and show yourself over against the enemy's body; but <lb/>
            do not pursue to any place out of sight, but, after taking <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            care that the stations may remain in your own possession, <lb/>
            advance onwards. And if any ride towards you holding up <lb/>
            their right hands, receive them as friends.</p>
          <p>14. Hystaspes then went away and armed himself. Those <lb/>
            that attended Cyrus set off immediately, as he had directed, - <lb/>
            and, on this side of the places of observation, Araspes, with <lb/>
            his followers, met them, he who had been some time before <lb/>
            sent out as a spy, and who had been the guardian of the <lb/>
            Susian woman. 15. Cyrus, as soon as he saw him, leaped <lb/>
            from his seat, met him, and took him by the right hand. The <lb/>
            rest, knowing nothing of the matter, were, as was natural, <lb/>
            surprised at it, till Cyrus said, " My friends, one of the most <lb/>
            deserving of men has returned to us ; for it is now fit that <lb/>
            every one should know what he has done. This man went <lb/>
            away, not from having sunk under any disgrace, or from any <lb/>
            fear of my displeasure, but from being sent by me, in order <lb/>
            that, learning the state of the enemy's affairs for us, he might <lb/>
            bring us a clear account of them. 16. What I promised2 <lb/>
            you therefore, Araspes, I remember, and, in conjunction with <lb/>
            all these that are here, will bestow it on you. And it is just <lb/>
            that you, my friends, should all pay him honour as a brave <lb/>
            man ; for, to do us service, he both threw himself into dan­ <lb/>
            gers, and incurred that reproach under which he laboured." <lb/>
            17. Upon this they all saluted Araspes, and gave him their <lb/>
            right hands.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, at length, telling them that enough was done, said, <lb/>
            " Give us an account, Araspes, of what it is proper for us to <lb/>
            know; and neither abate anything of the truth, nor extenuate <lb/>
            the strength of the enemy ; for it is better that we should <lb/>
            think it greater, and find it less, than hear it to be less, and <lb/>
            find it greater." is. "I acted, indeed," said Araspes, "in <lb/>
            such a manner as to learn with the greatest certainty what <lb/>
            the strength of the army is, for I assisted in person at their <lb/>
            arrangements." "You know then," said Cyrus, "not only <lb/>
            their numbers, but their order too." “ I do, indeed," said <lb/>

            then," said he, "thirty in depth, both infantry and cavalry, <lb/>
            except the Egyptians, and they extend in front about forty <lb/>
            stadia, for I took great care to know what ground they occu­ <lb/>
            pied." 20. As to the Egyptians, then," said Cyrus, "how <lb/>
            are they ranged, for you said ' except the Egyptians ?’ ” “ The <lb/>
            commanders of ten thousand drew up each body of ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand, a hundred on each side;1 for they said, that this was <lb/>
            the customary arrangement of their troops at home; but <lb/>
            Crœsus reluctantly allowed them to form in this manner, <lb/>
            for he was desirous to out-flank your army as much as pos­ <lb/>
            sible." " And why," said Cyrus, "does he desire to do so?" <lb/>
            "Why, by Jove," said Araspes, "in order to surround you <lb/>
            with the part that extends beyond your line." "But they <lb/>
            shall see," rejoined Cyrus, “whether the encompassers will <lb/>
            be themselves encompassed. 21. We have, however, heard <lb/>
            what it was proper for us to ascertain from you ; and you, <lb/>
            my friends, must act in this manner :</p>
          <p>" As soon as you go from hence, examine the equipments <lb/>
            both of your horses and yourselves; for, frequently, from a <lb/>
            deficiency in a small matter, both man, and horse, and chariot, <lb/>
            become useless. To-morrow, in the morning, whilst I am <lb/>
            sacrificing, you must first take your breakfasts, both men and <lb/>
            horses, that whatever opportunity of action may present itself, <lb/>
            we may not fail to take advantage of it. You, Araspes, keep <lb/>
            the right wing as you do now, and you, the other commanders of <lb/>
            ten thousand, retain the stations which you now occupy; for, <lb/>
            when a chariot-race is going to begin, there is no longer time <lb/>
            for any chariot to shift its horses ; and give orders to the <lb/>
            several centurions and captains to form in line, making each <lb/>
            company two deep.”2 Each company consisted of four-and­ <lb/>
            twenty men.</p>
          <p>22. One of the commanders of ten thousand then said, "And <lb/>
            when we are ranged but so many deep, are we likely to be <lb/>
            strong enough against phalanxes of so great a depth ? ” <note type="footnote"> 1 The squares being solid, with a hundred men on each side, <lb/>
            each would contain ten thousand men. According to the number <lb/>
            given in ch. 2, sect. 10, there would be twelve of these squares. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There would thus be twelve men in front, there being only two <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note>Cyrus replied, “ As to phalanxes that are too deep to <lb/>
            reach the enemy with their weapons, what injury can they <lb/>
            possibly do to the enemy, or what service to their fellow-com­ <lb/>
            batants ? 23. Those soldiers that are ranged a hundred in <lb/>
            depth," added he, " I would rather choose to have ranged ten <lb/>
            thousand in depth, for, by that means, we should engage with <lb/>
            a still smaller number, and have the fewer to engage; but from <lb/>
            the number with which I shall deepen our phalanx, I think <lb/>
            that I shall render the whole efficient and self-supporting. <lb/>
            24. The javelin-men I shall range behind those armed with <lb/>
            corslets, and behind the javelin-men the archers; for how <lb/>
            could any one place those in front who themselves confess <lb/>
            that they can sustain no encounter hand to hand ? But when <lb/>
            they have those armed with corslets in front of them, they <lb/>
            will stand; and the one line hurling their javelins, and the <lb/>
            other discharging their arrows, over the heads of those ranged <lb/>
            before them, will do execution upon the enemy; and as far as <lb/>
            any one does harm to the enemy, it is plain that so far he re­ <lb/>
            lieves his fellow-combatants. 25. Last of all, I will place those <lb/>
            that are called the rear; for as there is no value in a house, <lb/>
            without a strong foundation of stone, and without men to form a <lb/>
            roof, so there is no profit from an army without such as will <lb/>
            be of service both in front and rear.1 26. You then,” said <lb/>
            he, “form as I order you; and you, commanders of the jave­ <lb/>
            lin-men, form your companies in the same manner behind <lb/>
            these ; and you, captains of the archers, form, in like manner, <lb/>
            behind the javelin-men. 27. You, general, who command <lb/>
            the rear, with your men placed last, give orders to those <lb/>
            under you, to keep each his eye on those before him, to <lb/>
            encourage those that do their duty, to threaten severely <lb/>
            such as are deficient in courage ; and, if any one turn about, <lb/>
            with intention to desert, to punish him with death. For <lb/>
            it is the business of those who are placed in front, to en­ <lb/>
            courage, both by words and actions, those who follow; <lb/>
            and you, who are placed in the rear of all, must inspire <lb/>

              Euphratas, who command those that belong to the machines, <lb/>
              take care that the oxen that draw the towers follow as close <lb/>
              to the main body as possible. 29. You, Dauchus, who have <lb/>
              charge of the baggage, bring up all that train behind the <lb/>
              towers, and let your officers severely punish those who ad­ <lb/>
              vance or fall behind unseasonably. 30. You, Carduchus, who <lb/>
              have the care of the carriages that convey the women, place <lb/>
              these in the rear, behind the baggage-train; for all these, fol­ <lb/>
              lowing each other, will present the appearance of a great mul­ <lb/>
              titude, and will give us an opportunity of forming an am­ <lb/>
              buscade ; and, if the enemy attempt to surround us, will <lb/>
              oblige them to take a greater circuit; and the more ground <lb/>
              they encompass, so much the weaker must they of necessity <lb/>
              be. 31. You, therefore, act according to these instructions. <lb/>
              But you, Artaozus and Artagerses, keep, each of you, your <lb/>
              body of a thousand foot behind these. 32. You, Pharnuchus <lb/>
              and Asiadatas, do not join your troops of a thousand cavalry, <lb/>
              of which you each have the command, with the main line, <lb/>
              but arm by yourselves, behind the women's carriages, and <lb/>
              then come to us, together with the rest of the commanders; <lb/>
              but you must prepare yourselves as if you were to be the first <lb/>
              to engage. 33. You, who have the charge of the men with <lb/>
              the camels, form behind the women's carriages ; and do what­ <lb/>
              ever Artagerses may desire you. 34. As for you, leaders of <lb/>
              the chariots, after you have cast lots, let him among you, who <lb/>
              obtains that post, range his hundred chariots in front, before <lb/>
              the main line, and let the other hundreds of chariots attend <lb/>
              the main body ranged in a long train, one advancing on the <lb/>
              right side of the army, and the other on the left."</p>
          <p>35. Thus Cyrus directed. But Abradatas, king of Susa, <lb/>
            said, " I take it voluntarily upon myself, Cyrus, to hold that <lb/>
            station in front, over against the line of the enemy, unless you <lb/>
            have anything else in view." 36. Cyrus, admiring his spirit, <lb/>
            and taking him by the right hand, asked the Persians, that <lb/>
            had the command of the other chariots, saying, "Do you <note type="footnote"> 1 ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ως πρώτους δεῆσον άγωνίζεσϑαι</foreign>.] " QUasi primis," h. e. antè <lb/>

            Fischer. Why Pharnuchus and Asiadatas were to be so well pre­ <lb/>
            pared, appears from vii. 1. 22; namely, that they might attack the <lb/>
            advancing enemy on the flank. </note> <pb n="197"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            agree to this ? ” As they replied, that it would not be hon­ <lb/>
            ourable in them to yield the post, he made them all cast lots, <lb/>
            and Abradatas obtained by lot the station which he had offered <lb/>
            to take, and took his place opposite to the Egyptians. 37. The <lb/>
            officers having then gone away, and attended to the particu­ <lb/>
            lars which I have mentioned,1 took their suppers, and, after <lb/>
            placing the sentinels, went to rest.</p>

          <p>The appearance of the troops under arms. Abradatas equipped by Pan­ <lb/>
            thea ; their conversation and parting; Cyrus animates his officers by an <lb/>
            other speech.</p>
          <p>1. NEXT day, early in the morning, Cyrus offered sacrifice; <lb/>
            and the rest of the army, after taking their breakfast, and <lb/>
            making their libations, proceeded to equip themselves with fine <lb/>
            coats, in great number, and with many fine corslets and hel­ <lb/>
            mets. The horses, likewise, they armed with forehead-pieces <lb/>
            and breastplates; the single horses with thigh-pieces, and <lb/>
            those in the chariots with plates upon their sides ; so that the <lb/>
            whole army glittered with brass, and shone with purple gar­ <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>2. The chariot of Abradatas, that had four poles and eight <lb/>
            horses, was most handsomely adorned; and, when he was <lb/>
            going to put on his linen corslet, which was the dress of his <lb/>
            countrymen, Panthea brought him a golden helmet, and arm- <lb/>
            pieces, broad bracelets for his wrists, a purple habit that <lb/>
            reached to his feet, and hung in folds at the bottom, and a <lb/>
            crest of a violet colour. These things she had made, hav­ <lb/>
            ing, without the knowledge of her husband, taken the measure <lb/>
            of his armour. 3. He wondered when he saw them, and in­ <lb/>
            quired of Panthea, " Have you had these arms made for me, <lb/>
            wife, at the sacrifice of your own ornaments?” " Not in­ <lb/>
            deed, said Panthea, "at the sacrifice of the most valuable <lb/>
            one; for you yourself, if you appear to others as you appear <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προεῐπον</foreign>.] Schneider proposes to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">προεῐπεν</foreign>, sc. Cyrus; <lb/>
            which, as Bornemann observes, would be a great improvement. </note> <pb n="198"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            to me will be my greatest ornament." Saying this, she put <lb/>
            on him the armour; while, though she endeavoured to conceal <lb/>
            them, the tears flowed down her cheeks.</p>
          <p>4. When Abradatas, who was before a malt of striking ap­ <lb/>
            pearance, was equipped in these arms, he appeared eminently <lb/>
            handsome, as well as noble, such indeed being his nature. <lb/>
            Having taken the reins from the driver, he was preparing to <lb/>
            nount the chariot, when Panthea, desiring all that were present <lb/>
            to retire, said, 5. " 0 Abradatas, if there ever was a woman <lb/>
            who had more value for her husband, than for her own soul, I <lb/>
            think you know that I am such a character. Why, then, need <lb/>
            I speak of every single circumstance ? for I think that actions <lb/>
            have been shown you, on my part, more convincing than <lb/>
            any words which can now be spoken. 6. But, though I stand <lb/>
            thus affected towards you, as you know, I swear, by my friend­ <lb/>
            ship and your own, that I certainly would rather choose to be <lb/>
            put under ground together with you, while you approve your­ <lb/>
            self a brave man, than to live dishonoured with you in dis­ <lb/>
            honour; so much have I judged both you and myself worthy <lb/>
            of the noblest distinctions. 7. I consider too, that we owe a <lb/>
            great debt of gratitude to Cyrus, because, when I was a cap­ <lb/>
            tive, and selected for himself, he neither thought fit to take <lb/>
            me as a slave, nor as a free-woman under an ignominious name ; <lb/>
            but he took and kept me for you, as if I had been his brother's <lb/>
            wife. 8. Besides, when Araspes, who was my guard, went <lb/>
            away from him, I promised him, that, if he would allow me <lb/>
            to send to you, you would come to him, and be to him a much <lb/>
            more faithful and deserving friend than Araspes."</p>
          <p>9. Thus she spoke ; and Abradatas, struck with admiration <lb/>
            at her words, and laying his hand gently upon her head, lifted <lb/>
            up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, saying, " 0 supreme Jupiter, <lb/>
            grant me to prove myself a husband worthy of Panthea, and <lb/>
            a friend worthy of Cyrus, who has done us so much honour!"</p>
          <p>10. Having said this, he mounted the chariot by the door of <lb/>
            the driver's seat; and when, after he had got up, the driver shut. <lb/>
            the door of the seat, Panthea, who had now no other way to <lb/>
            salute him, kissed the seat of the chariot. The chariot then <lb/>
            moved on; and she followed him unperceived, till Abradatas, <lb/>
            turning about, and seeing her, said, " Take courage, Panthea! <lb/>
            Farewell; and now return. 11. Her eunuchs and women- <lb/>
            servants immediately took her up and conveyed her to her <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            carriage; and, laying her down, concealed her with the awn­ <lb/>
            ing. The people, though Abradatas and his chariot formed a <lb/>
            noble spectacle, cared not to look at him, till Panthea was gone.</p>
          <p>12. When Cyrus had found favourable omens in the sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and the army had been arranged for him as he had di­ <lb/>
            rected, he occupied places of observation, one in advance of <lb/>
            another, and, calling the leaders together, addressed them <lb/>
            thus: 13. " Friends and fellow-soldiers, the gods show us the <lb/>
            same propitious omens in our sacrifices, as when they gave us <lb/>
            victory before ; and I wish to put you in mind of some par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, that you may, while you bear them in remem­ <lb/>
            brance, march with greater courage to the encounter. 14. <lb/>
            You have practised the exercises of war much more than <lb/>
            our enemies have ; you have been bred up together, and have <lb/>
            been united in the same army, a much longer time than our <lb/>
            enemies have been ; you have been fellow-conquerors together, <lb/>
            while most of our enemies have been fellow-sharers in defeat; <lb/>
            and of those on both sides, that have not yet seen a battle, <lb/>
            those who are on the enemy's side, know that they have <lb/>
            'for their supporters men that are deserters of their posts, <lb/>
            but you, that are on our side, know that you take the field <lb/>
            with men zealous to assist their friends. 15. It is natural, <lb/>
            then, that they who have confidence in each other, should una­ <lb/>
            nimously stand and fight; but those who distrust each other <lb/>
            must necessarily be severally contriving how they may soon­ <lb/>
            est withdraw. 16. Let us march then, my friends, upon the <lb/>
            enemy, with our armed chariots against those of the enemy <lb/>
            unarmed, and with our cavalry in like manner, both men and <lb/>
            horses, armed against those of the enemy unarmed, in the re­ <lb/>
            solution to come to a close engagement. 17. As for the in­ <lb/>
            fantry, the rest are such as you have encountered already, but <lb/>
            the Egyptians are both armed and disposed alike inefficiently ; <lb/>
            for they have shields too large to act or see with, and, being <lb/>
            ranged a hundred in depth, it is evident they will hinder one <lb/>
            another from fighting, except only a very few. is. If they <lb/>
            trust that they shall force us back by an impetuous onset, they <lb/>
            must first sustain the charge of our horse, and steel driven <lb/>
            upon them by the force of horses ;1 and if any of them with­ <lb/>
            stand this, how will they be able to engage our cavalry, our <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σιδήρῳ ύφ ἳππων ίσχυριζομένῳ</foreign>.] The scythes attached to the <lb/>

            men on the towers will support us, and, by hurling their wea­ <lb/>
            pons on the enemy, will cause them, instead of fighting, to be <lb/>
            perplexed how to act. 19. If you think that you are still in <lb/>
            want of anything, tell it me; for, with the help of the gods, <lb/>
            we shall be in want of nothing. 20. If any one of you wishes <lb/>
            to say anything, let him speak; if not, betake yourselves to <lb/>
            your devotions, and, having made your prayers to the <lb/>

          <p>The army of Cyrus marches against the enemy under favourable omens. <lb/>
            When the two armies are in sight of each other, Cyrus rides round <lb/>
            among his men, and shows them how he intends to commence the en­ <lb/>
            gagement. Crœsus attacks Cyrus with his army in three divisions; his <lb/>
            wings are routed at the first onset. Death of Abradatas. Firmness of <lb/>
            the Egyptians; they repulse the Persians, but are attacked in the rear <lb/>
            by Cyrus, and forced to surrender. What gave the Persians an advantage <lb/>
            in this battle.</p>
          <p>1. THE officers, after praying to the gods, went off to their <lb/>
            posts The attendants brought meat and drink to Cyrus, and <lb/>
            those that were with him, while they were yet engaged in <lb/>
            sacrificing. Cyrus, standing as he was,l and first making an <lb/>
            offering to the gods, took his dinner, and distributed portions, <lb/>
            from time to time, to such as were most in need. Having then <lb/>
            made a libation, and prayed, he drank, and the rest that were <lb/>
            with him followed his example. Afterwards, having made <note type="footnote"> ' Without changing his position; without sitting down, as he <lb/>

            supplication to Jupiter Patrius, to be their leader and sup­ <lb/>
            porter, he mounted his horse, and ordered those about him to <lb/>
            mount theirs. 2. All those who were with Cyrus were furn­ <lb/>
            ished with the same equipments as himself; purple coats, <lb/>
            brazen corslets, brazen helmets, white crests, short swords, <lb/>
            and each with a single spear made of the corneil-tree. Their <lb/>
            horses were armed with brazen forehead-pieces, breastplates, <lb/>
            and shoulder-pieces, which also served as thigh-pieces to the <lb/>
            rider.1 The arms of Cyrus, however, so far differed from the <lb/>
            others, that theirs were lackered over with a gold colour, but <lb/>
            those of Cyrus shone like a mirror.</p>
          <p>3. When he was mounted, and stood considering which way <lb/>
            he should go, it thundered on the right; when he exclaimed, <lb/>
            "We will follow thee, 0 supreme Jupiter!" He then set <lb/>
            forward with Chrysantas, the commander of the cavalry, and <lb/>
            his body of cavalry, upon his right hand, and Arsamas, with <lb/>
            his body of foot, upon his left. 4. He directed them to look <lb/>
            to his standard, and follow at an even pace ; the standard was <lb/>
            a golden eagle on a long lancet This continues to be the <lb/>
            standard of the Persian king to this day. Before they came <lb/>
            in sight of the enemy, he made the army halt three times.</p>
          <p>5. After they had advanced about twenty stadia, they be­ <lb/>
            gan to observe the army of the enemy coming against them; <lb/>
            and when they were all in view of each other, and the enemy <lb/>
            found that they far outflanked them on both wings, they made <lb/>
            their own line halt, (for otherwise there was no fetching a com­ <lb/>
            pass,) and wheeled round to enclose the enemy, causing their <lb/>
            line, on each side, to take the form of the letter gamma? so <lb/>
            that they might commence the action from every part at once.</p>
          <p>6. Cyrus, seeing this manoeuvre, did not slacken his pace <lb/>
            on account of it, but led forward just as before ; and observing <lb/>
            how far round on each side they fetched their compass, in <note type="footnote">1 " It is necessary to equip the horse with a forehead-piece, a <lb/>

            which they wheeled and extended their wings, “ Do you ob­ <lb/>
            serve," said he, " Chrysantas, where they make their circuit ?” <lb/>
            "Yes, indeed," said Chrysantas, "and I wonder at it, for to <lb/>
            me they seem to draw off their wings very far from their own <lb/>
            line." 7. “ Yes, by Jove," said Cyrus, "and from ours too."1 <lb/>
            "Why so?" said Chrysantas. " Plainly," said Cyrus, "be­ <lb/>
            cause they are afraid, that if their wings come near us, while <lb/>
            their main body is yet at a distance, we shall charge them." <lb/>
            "Then," said Chrysantas, "how will they be able to support <lb/>
            one another, when they are at such a distance from each <lb/>
            other?" "It is plain," said Cyrus, "that when their wings <lb/>
            have gained so much ground as to be over against the flanks <lb/>
            of our army, they will wheel about, so as to form in line, and <lb/>
            advance upon us from every side at once, in order to attack us <lb/>
            on all quarters simultaneously." 8. " Do you think, then," <lb/>
            said Chrysantas, " that they lay their plans well?" “Yes, <lb/>
            with regard to what they see ; but with regard to what they <lb/>
            do not see,2 they plan worse than if they advanced upon us in <lb/>
            a column. But you, Arsamas, lead on quietly with your in­ <lb/>
            fantry, as you observe that I do ; and you, Chrysantas, follow <lb/>
            with your cavalry at the same pace with Arsamas. I shall <lb/>
            ride off to the place where I think it proper to begin the en­ <lb/>
            gagement, and, as I pass along, I shall see how our several <lb/>
            divisions stand. 9. When I reach the place, and when we <lb/>
            are fast approaching each other, I will begin the pasan ; and <lb/>
            do you hasten forward. When we engage the enemy, you <lb/>
            will perceive it, for there will, I suppose, be no small noise; <lb/>
            and Abradatas will then proceed to charge the enemy with his <lb/>
            chariots, for such directions shall be given him ; you must <lb/>
            follow, keeping as close as possible behind the chariots, for we <lb/>
            shall thus fall upon the enemy while they are most in disorder <lb/>
            I will myself come up, as soon as I can, to pursue them, if the <lb/>
            gods please." <note type="footnote"> 1 With regard to this compass or circuit of the Assyrian army, <lb/>
            and the recession of the wings from the Persian force, we must slip­ <lb/>
            pose, with Bornemann, that Croesus made such movements, and <lb/>
            extensions of his line, as to keep his wings from coming in contact <lb/>
            with the enemy before the centre was ready to attack, so that he <lb/>
            might assail Cyrus in front and on the flanks simultaneously. No <lb/>

            these manoeuvres. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The troops and camels ranged behind the baggage. Poppo. </note></p><pb n="203"/>

            TER THE PRESERVER AND LEADER , he set forward. Making <lb/>
            his way between the chariots and corslet-men, he would say, <lb/>
            as he looked on some of those in the ranks, " My friends, how <lb/>
            pleasing is it to see your faces !” To others, again, he would <lb/>
            say, " Do you not consider, my friends, that our present con­ <lb/>
            test is not merely for victory to-day, but to maintain the vic­ <lb/>
            tory that you gained before, and for all good fortune here­ <lb/>
            after. 11. Henceforward, soldiers, we shall have no cause to <lb/>
            blame the gods, for they have put it in our power to acquire <lb/>
            many great advantages; but, my friends, let us prove our­ <lb/>
            selves brave men." 12. Coming up to others, he spoke thus: <lb/>
            " My friends, to what nobler association can we ever invite <lb/>
            one another than to the present? For it is now in our power, <lb/>
            by being brave men, to confer upon each other many great <lb/>
            benefits." 13. To others, again, he said, " You know, my <lb/>
            friends, I believe, that the prizes offered to those who con­ <lb/>
            quer, are to pursue, to strike, to kill, to get gain, to win <lb/>
            praise, to be free, to rule; but for cowards, evidently, the re­ <lb/>
            verse of all these. Whoever, therefore, loves himself, let him <lb/>
            fight as I fight, for I shall not willingly allow in myself any­ <lb/>
            thing weak or dishonourable." 14. When he came up with <lb/>
            such as had been in battle with him before, he said: “ And to <lb/>
            you, my friends, what need I say ? for you know what sort of <lb/>
            day the brave, and what sort of day cowards, pass in the <lb/>
            field."</p>
          <p>15. When he came, as he passed along, over against Abra­ <lb/>
            datas, he stopped; and Abradatas, delivering the reins to the <lb/>
            driver, went up to him, and several others of those that were <lb/>
            posted near, belonging both to the infantry and the chariots, <lb/>
            ran to him ; and as they gathered round him, he said, " The <lb/>
            gods, as you desired, Abradatas, have granted to you, and <lb/>
            those with you, to hold a chief place amongst all the allies; <lb/>
            and, when you have to engage, remember that the Persians <lb/>
            are to see you, and to follow you, and not suffer you to engage <lb/>
            alone." 16. Abradatas replied, “ Affairs with us, Cyrus, seem <lb/>
            to promise well, but the flanks give me some uneasiness; for <lb/>
            I see that the wings of the enemy are stretched out in great <lb/>
            strength, with chariots and every kind of force ; but on our side <lb/>
            there is nothing opposed to them but chariots ; so that," con­ <lb/>
            tinued he, “ had I not obtained this post by lot, I should be <pb n="204"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            ashamed to be here; so much do I think myself in the safest <lb/>
            post." 17. Cyrus replied, "If things are well with you, be <lb/>
            at ease as to the rest; for, with the help of the gods, I will <lb/>
            show you those flanks of ours entirely clear of enemies. And <lb/>
            do not you, I conjure you, attack the enemy, before you see <lb/>
            those men fleeing of whom you are now afraid." Thus boast­ <lb/>
            ingly did he express himself as the battle was coming on, <lb/>
            though, at other times, he was little inclined to boasting. <lb/>
            "But," added he, " when you see those men fleeing, be sure <lb/>
            that I am at hand, and rush upon the enemy, for you will then <lb/>
            deal with them while they are most disheartened, and your <lb/>
            own men in the best spirits. is. But, while you have still <lb/>
            time, Abradatas, ride along, by all means, by your own <lb/>
            chariots, and exhort your people to the attack, inspiring them <lb/>
            with courage by your looks, and animating them with hopes. <lb/>
            And, that you may appear the bravest of all that belong to <lb/>
            the chariots, excite emulation in your men ; for, be assured, <lb/>
            that if things now fall out well, all will say, for the future, <lb/>
            that nothing is more profitable than bravery." Abradatas <lb/>
            then mounted and rode along the line, and did as Cyrus had <lb/>
            suggested.</p>
          <p>19. Cyrus, moving on again, and coming to the left wing, <lb/>
            where Hystaspes was with the half of the Persian cavalry, <lb/>
            calling him by his name, said, " Hystaspes, you now see work <lb/>
            for your activity; for, if we get beforehand with the enemy <lb/>
            in killing them, not a man of us will be killed." 20. Hys­ <lb/>
            taspes, laughing, replied, " We will take care of those in front <lb/>
            of us; give those upon the flanks in charge to others, that <lb/>
            they may not want occupation." Cyrus then said, " I am <lb/>
            going to those myself. But remember this, Hystaspes: to <lb/>
            whichsoever of us the gods may give victory, if the enemy <lb/>
            make a stand anywhere, let us always join in with our forces <lb/>
            to charge those who resist."</p>
          <p>21. Having spoken thus, he moved on, and when, in his <lb/>
            progress, be came to the flank,1 and to the commander of the <lb/>
            chariots there, he said to him, " I am come to your support; <lb/>
            but when you perceive us attacking the extremity,2 endeavour <lb/>
            yourselves, at the same time, to force a way through the <lb/>
            enemy, for you will be much safer when you are without their <note type="footnote"> I The left flank. </note><note type="footnote">2 The right extremity or wing of the army. </note> <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            line, than while you are enclosed within it." 22. Then, pass­ <lb/>
            ing on again, when he came behind the women's carriages, he <lb/>
            ordered Artagerses and Pharnuchus, each with his thousand <lb/>
            men, one of foot and the other of horse, to remain there; <lb/>
            " And when you perceive me," said he, "attacking those op­ <lb/>
            posite our right wing, do you likewise charge those that are <lb/>
            opposite you. You will assail them in flank, where 1 a body <lb/>
            of men is weakest, keeping yourselves in a phalanx, that you <lb/>
            may be as strong as possible. The enemy's, cavalry, as you <lb/>
            see, are the hindmost; advance the body of camels every­ <lb/>
            where upon them, and be assured that, before you come to <lb/>
            engage, you will see the enemy made ridiculous." 23. Cyrus, <lb/>
            having concluded these instructions, proceeded to the right <lb/>
            wing.</p>
          <p>Crœsus, judging that his main body, with which he himself <lb/>
            marched, was now nearer to the enemy than his extended <lb/>
            wings, gave the signal to the wings to advance no farther, <lb/>
            but to wheel round in the place where they were. As soon <lb/>
            as they stood facing towards the army of Cyrus, he gave them <lb/>
            the signal to march upon the enemy. 24. Thus three dense <lb/>
            bodies advanced upon the army of Cyrus ; one in front, and, <lb/>
            of the other two, one against the right wing, and the other <lb/>
            against the left; so that great alarm pervaded all Cyrus's <lb/>
            army. For, as a small brick placed within a large one, so <lb/>
            was the army of Cyrus enclosed by the enemy, with their <lb/>
            cavalry, their heavy-armed men, their peltasts, archers, and <lb/>
            chariots, on every side except the rear. 25. Yet when Cyrus <lb/>
            gave the signal, they all turned and faced the enemy; and <lb/>
            there was a deep silence in every part, from apprehension re­ <lb/>
            specting the event. As soon as Cyrus thought it the proper <lb/>
            time, he began the paean, and the whole army sung it with <lb/>
            him. 26. Afterwards they raised the battle-shout to Mars; <lb/>
            and Cyrus started forward, and instantly taking the enemy in <lb/>
            flank with his cavalry, engaged hand to hand with them as <lb/>
            soon as possible. The foot immediately followed him in close <lb/>
            order, and swept round the enemy on every side; so that they <lb/>
            had very much the advantage; for they were attacking a di­ <lb/>
            vision in flank; hence a precipitate flight soon took place <lb/>
            among the enemy. 27. As soon as Artagerses perceived that <note type="footnote"> 1 Dindorf's text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὣσπερ</foreign>, but we must doubtless read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῂπερ</foreign> with <lb/>
            Zeune, Schneider, Bornemann, and others. </note> <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            Cyrus was engaged, he commenced an attack upon the left, <lb/>
            making the camels advance, as Cyrus had ordered; and the <lb/>
            enemy's horses, even when at a great distance, were not able <lb/>
            to endure them, but some of them, being maddened, ran away, <lb/>
            some started from their ranks, and others fell foul of one ano­ <lb/>
            ther ; for thus are horses always affected by camels. 28. <lb/>
            Artagerses, with his men in good order, charged the enemy <lb/>
            that were in confusion ; and the chariots, both to the right <lb/>
            and left, made their onset at the same time. Many of the <lb/>
            enemy that escaped from the chariots, were killed by those <lb/>
            that pursued in column,1 and many that escaped from these <lb/>
            were cut off by the chariots.</p>
          <p>29. Abradatas then delayed no longer, but shouting aloud, <lb/>
            " Follow me, friends !" rushed on, without sparing his horses, <lb/>
            but drawing much blood from them with the goad. The <lb/>
            other charioteers dashed forward with him. The chariots of <lb/>
            the enemy instantly fled before them, some of them taking up <lb/>
            their fighting men, and others leaving them. so. Abradatas <lb/>
            forced his way directly through them, to the Egyptian pha­ <lb/>
            lanx, and those that were ranged nearest him joined him in <lb/>
            the charge. Upon many other occasions it has been seen, <lb/>
            that a troop can never be stronger than when it is formed of <lb/>
            fellow-combatants that are friends; and it was seen upon this <lb/>
            occasion; for the companions and associates of Abradatas <lb/>
            supported him in his onset; but the other drivers, when they <lb/>
            saw the Egyptians stand their ground in a close body, turned <lb/>
            aside to the chariots that were fleeing, and pursued them. 31. <lb/>
            As the Egyptians were unable to separate themselves, because <lb/>
            those on each side of them remained firm, Abradatas and his <lb/>
            troop, wherever they directed their charge, overthrew those <lb/>
            who stood upright with the impetus of their chariots, and <lb/>
            crushed those who fell, both men and arms, with the hoofs of <lb/>
            their horses and their wheels; and whatever the scythes <lb/>
            caught, whether arms or bodies of men, they cut through with <lb/>
            resistless force. 32. In this indescribable confusion, the <lb/>
            wheels being jolted by heaps of every description, Abradatas, <lb/>
            and some of those who joined in the charge with him, were <lb/>
            thrown from their vehicles; and here, while they proved <lb/>
            themselves brave men, they were cut down and killed. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπὸ τῶν κατὰ κέρας έπομένων</foreign>.] Fischer seems rightly to under­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note>The Persians who followed close after them, rushing in <lb/>
            where Abradatas and his friends had made their charges, cut <lb/>
            to pieces such as were in disorder; but, where the Egyptians <lb/>
            remained unbroken, (and there were many in this condition,) <lb/>
            they advanced to attack the Persians. 33. Then ensued a <lb/>
            terrible combat of lances, javelins, and swords; but the <lb/>
            Egyptians had the advantage, both from their numbers and <lb/>
            their arms, for their lances were strong and of great length, <lb/>
            (such as they still use,) and their large shields were a better <lb/>
            defence to their persons, than corslets and smaller shields; <lb/>
            and being set against their shoulders, assisted them in push­ <lb/>
            ing against the enemy. Locking their shields together, there­ <lb/>
            fore, they advanced and pushed forward. 34. The Persians, <lb/>
            holding out their small sort of shields at arm's length, were <lb/>
            not able to withstand them, but retreated with their faces to­ <lb/>
            ward the enemy, giving and receiving blows, till they came <lb/>
            to the machines. When they came thither, the Egyptians <lb/>
            were again galled from the towers. Those who were in the <lb/>
            rear of all, would not suffer either the archers or javelin-men <lb/>
            to flee, but, holding up their swords at them, forced them to <lb/>
            shoot and to throw. 35. There then followed great havoc of <lb/>
            men, great clashing of arms and weapons of all kinds, and <lb/>
            great noise of people, some calling to each other, some mak­ <lb/>
            ing exhortations, and some invoking the gods.</p>
          <p>3G. At this time, Cyrus, in pursuit of those that had been <lb/>
            opposed to him, came up; and when he saw the Persians <lb/>
            driven from their post, he was grieved; and, knowing that he <lb/>
            could not sooner stop the progress of the enemy forward, <lb/>
            otherwise than by riding round to their rear, he commanded <lb/>
            those that were with him to follow, and rode round to the <lb/>
            rear; where his men fell upon them as their backs were <lb/>
            turned, and killed a great many. 37. The Egyptians, as soon <lb/>
            as they perceived this, cried out, that the enemy was behind <lb/>
            them, and faced about amidst the blows. Here infantry and <lb/>
            cavalry fought promiscuously, and a man falling under Cyrus's <lb/>
            horse, and being trampled upon, struck his sword into the <lb/>
            horse's belly; and the horse, thus wounded, plunged and <lb/>
            threw Cyrus off. 38. In this juncture, it might be seen of <lb/>
            what advantage it was for a commander to have the love of <lb/>
            those around him; for all immediately cried out, fell on, and <lb/>
            fought, pushed, and were pushed, struck, and were struck ; <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            and one of the attendants of Cyrus, leaping from his horse, <lb/>
            mounted Cyrus upon him. 39. When Cyrus was on horse­ <lb/>
            back, he perceived that the Egyptians were now exposed to <lb/>
            attacks on every side, for Hystaspes was come up with the <lb/>
            Persian horse as well as Chrysantas; but he would not now <lb/>
            suffer them to fall upon the phalanx of the Egyptians, but or­ <lb/>
            dered them to gall them with arrows and javelins from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance. Then, in riding round, as he came up to the machines, <lb/>
            he thought proper to mount one of the towers, to see whether <lb/>
            any other division of the enemy still made a stand and <lb/>
            fought. 40. When he had ascended, he saw the whole plain <lb/>
            full of horses, men, and chariots, some fleeing, others pursu­ <lb/>
            ing, some victorious, others defeated; but he could see no <lb/>
            division, except that of the Egyptians, any longer keeping <lb/>
            their ground; who, when they were at a loss what to do, <lb/>
            formed themselves into a circle, so that their arms faced the <lb/>
            enemy, and sat down under the shelter of their shields ; they <lb/>
            no longer acted, but suffered many grievous wounds.</p>
          <p>41. Cyrus, being struck with admiration at their conduct, <lb/>
            and concerned that men of such bravery should perish, made <lb/>
            all those retreat that were engaged around them, and suffered <lb/>
            none to continue fighting. He then sent to them a herald, to ask <lb/>
            " whether they all preferred to die for men that had deserted <lb/>
            them, or to be saved with the reputation of being brave men ?” <lb/>
            They replied, " How then can we obtain safety, and preserve <lb/>
            our reputation as brave men ?" 42. Cyrus rejoined, "Because <lb/>
            we see that you are the only men that stand your ground, and <lb/>
            are disposed to fight." " But then," said the Egyptians, " by <lb/>
            what honourable means can we save ourselves Cyrus in <lb/>
            reply said, " If you save yourselves, without betraying any <lb/>
            of your allies; delivering up your arms to us, and becoming <lb/>
            friends to those who prefer to save you, when it is in their <lb/>
            power to destroy you.” 43. Having heard this, they asked, <lb/>
            “ If we become your friends, how will you think fit to treat <lb/>
            us?" Cyrus replied, " I shall think fit both to do you good <lb/>
            offices, and to receive them from you." The Egyptians then <lb/>
            again asked, c'What good offices ?" Cyrus replied, " As long <lb/>
            as the war continues, I will give you larger pay than you now <lb/>
            receive; and when we have peace, I will give to every one <lb/>
            of you that will stay with me lands, cities, women, and ser­ <lb/>
            vants." 44. The Egyptians, hearing this offer, begged him to <pb n="209"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            grant them an exemption from serving in the war with him <lb/>
            against Crœsus; “ for to him alone," said they, " were they <lb/>
            known ;" 1 but, consenting to the other proposals, they gave <lb/>
            and received assurances of friendship. 45. The Egyptians, who <lb/>
            then remained there, continue to this day faithful to the king; <lb/>
            and Cyrus gave them cities, some inland, which are still <lb/>
            called the cities of the Egyptians, and Larissa and Cyllene, <lb/>
            which are situate on the sea near Cuma, and which their pos­ <lb/>
            terity still occupy.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, having accomplished these affairs, retreated, as it <lb/>
            was now growing dark, and encamped at Thymbrara. 46. <lb/>
            In this battle, the Egyptians only, of all the enemy's people, <lb/>
            at all distinguished themselves; and of those on the side of <lb/>
            Cyrus, the Persian cavalry were thought to have been the <lb/>
            best; hence the same sort of arms, with which Cyrus then <lb/>
            equipped his cavalry continue in use to this day. 47. The <lb/>
            chariots armed with scythes, too, were greatly approved; so <lb/>
            that that engine of war continues still to be used by the <lb/>
            successive kings of Persia. 48. The camels did no more than <lb/>
            frighten the horses ; they that mounted them did no execution <lb/>
            upon the cavalry, nor were any of the men themselves killed <lb/>
            by the cavalry, for no horse would come near them. 49. <lb/>
            This animal, then, was reckoned of use; but no respectable <lb/>
            man will breed camels for his own riding, nor exercise them <lb/>
            with a view to fighting on their backs ; so that, returning to <lb/>
            their old condition, they continue in the baggage train.</p>

            diately fled, with his army, to Sardes. The other nations <lb/>
            went off in the night, each as far as they could, on their way <lb/>
            homeward. 2. As soon as it was day, Cyrus led his army <lb/>
            towards Sardes; and when he came up to the walls of that <lb/>
            city, he raised machines, and provided ladders, as if he de­ <lb/>
            signed to attack the fortifications. 3. But while he was <lb/>
            making these preparations, he caused a party of Chaldæans <lb/>
            and Persians, the following night, to mount that part of the <lb/>
            fortifications of Sardes that was thought the most difficult of <lb/>
            ascent, a certain Persian leading the way, who had been a <lb/>
            slave to one of the guards in the citadel, and knew the <lb/>
            descent down to the river and the ascent from it. 4. When <lb/>
            it was known that the heights above were taken, all the <lb/>
            Lydians fled from the walls, to whatever part of the city they <lb/>
            severally could. Cyrus, as soon as it was day, entered the <lb/>
            city, and gave orders that no one of his men should stir from <lb/>
            his post. 5. Crœsus, shutting himself up in his palace, called <lb/>
            out for Cyrus, but Cyrus left men to watch Crœsus, and <lb/>
            going off himself to the citadel, which was taken, and finding <lb/>
            the Persians keeping guard in the citadel, as was their duty, <lb/>
            but the arms of the Chaldæans abandoned, (for they them­ <lb/>
            selves had run down to plunder the houses,) he immediately <lb/>
            summoned their officers, and told them to quit the army at <lb/>
            once; 6. " for I could not bear," said he, “ to see disorderly <lb/>
            men get the advantage of others; and know," added he, <lb/>
            " that I was preparing to make you, who had followed me in <lb/>
            the field, enviable in the eyes of all the Chaldceans ; but now," <lb/>
            continued he, “ do not wonder if somebody,1 superior to you <lb/>
            in strength, happen to meet with you as you go off." 7. The <lb/>
            Chaldæans, on hearing this denunciation, were in great fear, <lb/>
            entreated him to lay aside his anger, and said that they <lb/>
            would restore all the booty. He replied, "that he was <lb/>
            not in any want of them; but," said he, "if you would wish <lb/>
            me to feel no further displeasure, give up all that you have <lb/>
            taken to those that have kept guard in the citadel; for, when <lb/>
            the rest of the soldiers find that those who have been orderly <lb/>
            have the advantage, all will go well with me." 8. The Chal­ <lb/>
            dæans did as Cyrus had commanded them, and those who had <lb/>
            been obedient got much booty of every kind. Cyrus, hav- <note type="footnote"> J Meaning himself, or such as he should appoint, who would tako <lb/>

            ing caused his men to encamp in that part of the city that <lb/>
            he thought most convenient, gave them orders to remain <lb/>
            there with their arms, and take their dinners.</p>
          <p>9. Having made these arrangements, he ordered Crœsus <lb/>
            to be brought before him. Crœsus, as soon as he saw Cyrus, <lb/>
            said, “Hail, master, for, from henceforth, fortune appoints <lb/>
            you to receive that name, and me to call you by it." 10. <lb/>
            ., Hail to you also, Crœsus,” said Cyrus, "for we are both of <lb/>
            us men. But Crœsus,” added he, " would you be willing to <lb/>
            give me some advice?" "I should be willing, Cyrus," said <lb/>
            he, "to think of anything good for you, for I conceive that it <lb/>
            would also be good for myself." 11. “ Hear then, Crœsus,” said <lb/>
            he; “ knowing that the soldiers, after having undergone <lb/>
            many fatigues, and incurred many dangers, consider them­ <lb/>
            selves now in possession of the richest city in Asia, next to <lb/>
            Babylon, I think it fit that they should receive some recom­ <lb/>
            pense; for I am sure," continued he, "that, unless they re­ <lb/>
            ceive some fruit of their labours, I shall not have them long <lb/>
            obedient to my orders ; I am not however willing to give the <lb/>
            city up to them to plunder; for I believe that it would thus <lb/>
            be destroyed; and, in plundering, I know very well that the <lb/>
            worst men would have the advantage." 12. Crœsus, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing this remark, said, "Allow me to signify to such of the <lb/>
            Lydians as I think fit, that I have prevailed with you not to <lb/>
            allow any plundering, nor to suffer our wives and children to <lb/>
            be taken from us ; and have promised you, in return, that you <lb/>
            shall certainly receive from the Lydians, of their own accord, <lb/>
            whatever there is of worth and value in Sardes; 13. for, <lb/>
            when they hear of this arrangement, I know that there will <lb/>
            be brought to you everything that is of value here, in the <lb/>
            possession either of man or woman ; and, nevertheless, in <lb/>
            another year, the city will be again full of things of value in <lb/>
            great abundance; but, if you plunder it, the arts, which they <lb/>
            call the sources of what is valuable, will be ruined. 14. But <lb/>
            you will still be at liberty, after you have seen what is brought <lb/>
            to you, to consider whether you shall plunder the city or <lb/>
            not. Send, however,” added he, "in the first place, to my own <lb/>
            treasures, and let your guards take them from my guards."</p>
          <p>Cyrus agreed to act in all these particulars as Croesus sug­ <lb/>
            gested. 15. "But, tell me, by all means," said he, "what <lb/>
            results the communications from the oracle at Delphi pro­ <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            duced; for Apollo is said to have received much attention <lb/>
            from you, and it is reported that you acted in everything in <lb/>
            obedience to his directions." 16. Indeed, Cyrus," said he, <lb/>
            " I could wish that it had been so; but I have gone on, from <lb/>
            the very first, acting in direct opposition to Apollo." " How <lb/>
            so?" said Cyrus ; "instruct me; for what you say is very <lb/>
            strange." 17. Because, in the first place," said he, "neg­ <lb/>
            lecting to consult the god as to what I wanted, I made trial of <lb/>
            him whether he was able to tell truth. But as to such a pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding, not only a god, but even men of honour and integrity, <lb/>
            when they find themselves distrusted, have no kindness for <lb/>
            those that distrust them. is. However, after he knew that I <lb/>
            was doing extremely absurd1 things, and that I was at a great <lb/>
            distance from Delphi, I sent to consult him whether I should <lb/>
            have children. 19. He at first made me no answer; but when, <lb/>
            by sending him many offerings of gold, and many of silver, <lb/>
            and making many sacrifices, I had rendered him, as I thought, <lb/>
            propitious, he then, as I asked him what I should do to have <lb/>
            children, gave me an answer, and said, ‘ that I should have <lb/>
            them.' 20. I accordingly had children ; for neither in this <lb/>
            did he deal falsely with me; but, when I had them, they <lb/>
            were of no profit to me, for one of them has continued dumb, <lb/>
            and he that was the best of them perished in the flower of his <lb/>
            age.2 Being oppressed with affliction at the fate of my sons, <lb/>
            I sent again, and inquired of the god what I should do, in <lb/>
            order to pass the remainder of my life in the happiest man­ <lb/>
            ner ; and he made answer,</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">'Know thyself, Crœsus; then shalt thou live blest.'</title>
          </ab>
          <p>21. When I heard this oracle, I was delighted; for I thought <lb/>
            he granted me happiness, commanding me to do the easiest <lb/>
            thing possible ; since, as to other men, it was possible to know <lb/>
            some and not others, but I thought that every man knew <lb/>
            what he was himself. 22. After this, during the whole time <lb/>
            that I continued in peace, I had nothing to charge upon for­ <lb/>
            tune subsequently to the death of my son. And, when I was <lb/>
            persuaded by the Assyrian king to attack you, though I fell <lb/>
            into all sorts of danger, I yet came off safe, without incurring <note type="footnote"> 1 Boiling a tortoise and a lamb together in a brazen caldron: <lb/>

            any serious evil; nor can I, in this matter, at all blame the <lb/>
            god; for, even after I found myself unable to cope with you, <lb/>
            I escaped, with the help of the god, without injury, both my­ <lb/>
            self and those that were with me. 23. But being then again <lb/>
            corrupted by the riches which I possessed, by those who en­ <lb/>
            treated me to be their chief, by the presents which they made <lb/>
            me, and by men that, in flattery, told me that if I would take <lb/>
            upon me the command, all would obey me, and I should be <lb/>
            the greatest of mankind; being puffed up, I say, by discourses <lb/>
            of this kind, when all the kings around chose me as their <lb/>
            leader in the war, I accepted the command, as if I were qua­ <lb/>
            lified to be the greatest of men, not indeed knowing myself, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as I imagined myself able to contend against you ; 24. <lb/>
            you who, in the first place, are sprung from the gods, who <lb/>
            are also descended from a line of kings, and who have prac­ <lb/>
            tised, from your boyhood, everything honourable. But of <lb/>
            my own ancestors, the first that reigned, I have heard, <lb/>
            became a king and a freeman at the same time. Having been, <lb/>
            therefore," added he, “ thus ignorant of myself, I have justly <lb/>
            suffered the penalty. But now, Cyrus, I do know myself <lb/>
            25. And do you think that Apollo will still prove to have <lb/>
            spoken truth, that I shall be happy by knowing myself? I <lb/>
            ask for this reason, that you seem to me likely to judge best, <lb/>
            as to this point, at present, for you can fulfil the prediction."</p>
          <p>26. Cyrus then said, “ Give me your opinion, Crœsus, on <lb/>
            this matter; for, reflecting on your former happiness, I feel <lb/>
            compassion for you, and permit you to have your wife whom <lb/>
            you had before, as well as your daughters, (for I hear that <lb/>
            you have daughters,) your friends, servants, and table that <lb/>
            you used to keep; but battles and wars I prohibit you." 27. <lb/>
            "By Jupiter, then," said Crœsus, "deliberate no longer as to <lb/>
            answering me concerning my happiness, for I tell you at once <lb/>
            that if you do these things for me that you say you will, I <lb/>
            shall now live in the enjoyment of that kind of life which <lb/>
            others have thought the happiest; and I concurred in opinion <lb/>
            with them." 28. Cyrus then asked, " Who is there that en­ <lb/>
            joys such a happy course of life?" “ My own wife, Cyrus," <lb/>
            said he; "for she shared equally with me in all good, soothing, <lb/>
            and agreeable things; but in cures about the result of my <lb/>
            present proceedings, and about wars and battles, she had no <lb/>
            share. Thus, in my opinion, you provide for me as I pro- <pb n="214"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            vided for her whom I loved most of all human beings; so that <lb/>
            I think I owe Apollo further tokens of gratituder" 29. Cyrus, <lb/>
            hearing him speak thus, admired his good humour; and ever <lb/>
            after took him with him wherever he went, either from thinking <lb/>
            that he was of service to him, or deeming it safest to do so. <lb/>
            Thus then they went to rest.</p>

          <p>Cyrus, hearing of the death of Abradates, prepares a magnificent funeral <lb/>
            for him. Panthea kills herself. Cyrus raises a noble monument to both <lb/>
            of them.</p>
          <p>1. THE next day Cyrus, calling together his friends and <lb/>
            the officers of the army, directed some of them to receive the <lb/>
            treasures, and others to select from amongst all the riches that. <lb/>
            Crœsus should deliver up, first, such portions for the gods as <lb/>
            the Magi should direct, and then to take the rest, and putting <lb/>
            it into chests, place it on the waggons ; and so, distributing the <lb/>
            waggons among them by lot, to carry it with them wherever <lb/>
            they went, that, when opportunity served, they might receive <lb/>
            each his due share. The officers acted accordingly.</p>
          <p>2. Cyrus, then, calling to some of his attendants that were at <lb/>
            hand, " Tell me," said he, " has any one of you seen Abra­ <lb/>
            dates ? for I wonder that he, who used to come so often to us <lb/>
            before, is now nowhere to be seen." 3. One of the attendants <lb/>
            replied, “ He is no longer alive, 0 king, but died in the battle <lb/>
            as he was charging with his chariot upon the Egyptians. All <lb/>
            the rest, they say, except his particular companions, turned <lb/>
            aside, when they saw the dense mass of the Egyptians. 4. <lb/>
            His wife is now said to have taken up his dead body, to have <lb/>
            placed it in her own carriage in which she rode, and to have <lb/>
            brought it hither to some place by the river Pactolus; 5. and <lb/>
            they state that her eunuchs and servants are digging a grave <lb/>
            for the deceased upon a certain hill. They also say that his <lb/>
            wife, after having decked him with such ornaments as she <lb/>
            had, is sitting upon the ground with his head upon her knees." <lb/>
            6. Cyrus, hearing this account, struck his thigh, sprung upon <lb/>
            his horse immediately, and, taking with him a thousand cavalry, <lb/>
            rode away to the scene of affliction. 7. He directed Gadata? <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            and Gobryas, at the same time, to bring whatever ornaments <lb/>
            they could, suitable for a deceased friend and man of worth, <lb/>
            and to follow him; and he ordered the officer, who had the <lb/>
            charge of the cattle that followed the army, to drive both oxen <lb/>
            and horses, and a large number of sheep, to the place where <lb/>
            they should discover him to be, that they might be sacrificed <lb/>
            in honour of Abradates.</p>
          <p>8. When lie saw the woman sitting upon the ground, and <lb/>
            the dead body lying by her, he shed tears at the afflicting sight, <lb/>
            and said, “ Alas ! thou brave and faithful soul! hast thou <lb/>
            then left us ?" At the same time, he took him by the right <lb/>
            hand, and the hand of the deceased came away, for it had <lb/>
            been cut off with a sword by the Egyptians. 9. He, at sight <lb/>
            of this, was still more grieved; while the woman uttered a <lb/>
            shriek, and, taking the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, fitted it to <lb/>
            its proper place again, as well as she could, and said, 10. <lb/>
            " The rest of the body, Cyrus, is in the same condition; but <lb/>
            why should you see it ? And I know that he has met this <lb/>
            fate, in no small degree, through my means, and perhaps not <lb/>
            less, Cyrus, through yours ; for I, fool that I was ! exhorted <lb/>
            him earnestly to act in such a manner that he might appear <lb/>
            to you a friend worthy of esteem; and he himself, I know, <lb/>
            never thought of what he should suffer, but what he could do <lb/>
            to please you. He died, therefore," she added, “ without re­ <lb/>
            proach, and I, who encouraged him, sit here alive!" 11. <lb/>
            Cyrus wept for some time in silence, and then said, “ He has <lb/>
            died, 0 woman, a most honourable death, for he has died vic­ <lb/>
            torious ! You, receiving these ornaments from me, adorn him <lb/>
            with them ; (Gobryas and Gadatas had now come up, bring­ <lb/>
            in, abundance of rich decorations;) and, continued he, “ be <lb/>
            assured that he shall not want honour in other respects; <lb/>
            numbers of men shall raise him a monument worthy of us ; <lb/>
            and such sacrifices shall be offered in his honour as are suit­ <lb/>
            able for a brave man. 12. You," added he, “ shall not be left <lb/>
            destitute, but I, for the sake of your modesty and every other <lb/>
            virtue, will pay you honour in other ways, and will also <lb/>
            place with you one who shall convey you wherever you <lb/>
            please; only make it known to me to whom you desire to be <lb/>
            conveyed." 13. Panthea replied, “ Be of good courage, Cy­ <lb/>
            rus ; I will not conceal from you to whom I desire to go."</p>
          <p>14. Having said this, he went away, feeling great pity for <pb n="216"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            the woman, that she should have lost such a husband, and for <lb/>
            the man, that he should have left such a wife, never to see her <lb/>
            more. Panthea then desired her eunuchs to retire, " until," <lb/>
            said she, " I have lamented my husband as I wish." Her <lb/>
            nurse she requested to stay, and charged her, when she was <lb/>
            dead, to wrap her and her husband in one garment. The <lb/>
            nurse, after having repeatedly begged her not to act thus, but <lb/>
            making no impression on her, and seeing that she was grow­ <lb/>
            ing angry, sat down weeping. Panthea, having before pro­ <lb/>
            vided herself with a sword, stabbed herself, and laying her <lb/>
            head upon her husband's breast, died. The nurse uttered a <lb/>
            lamentable cry, and covered them both as Panthea had di­ <lb/>
            rected.</p>
          <p>15. Cyrus, when he heard what the woman had done, was <lb/>
            struck with grief, and hastened to see if he could be of any <lb/>
            service. The eunuchs, three in number, as soon as they saw <lb/>
            what had occurred, drew their swords and killed themselves, <lb/>
            standing, at the time, where she had ordered them. 16. [The <lb/>
            monument is said to have been formed of a mound extending <lb/>
            to the place where the eunuchs fell; upon the pillar above, <lb/>
            they say, the names of the man and woman are inscribed in <lb/>
            Assyrian characters ; below, they relate that there are three <lb/>
            pillars, and that they are inscribed, OF THE EUNUCHS.] 1 17. <lb/>
            Cyrus, as he approached the scene of death, was struck with <lb/>
            admiration of the woman, and went away, lamenting her fate. <lb/>
            He attended, as was proper, to the dead, that they might re­ <lb/>
            ceive every honour; and the monument, as they say, was <lb/>
            raised to a very great height. <note type="footnote"> 1 There is much doubt respecting the genuineness of the original <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Adusius artfully puts an end to the disputes among the Carians. Hys­ <lb/>
            taspes subdues Phrygia Minor. Cyrus leaves Sardes, accompanied by <lb/>
            Crœsus; he subdues, on his march, the Phrygians, Cappadocians, and <lb/>
            Arabians; he directs his course towards Babylon.</p>
          <p>i. SOON after, the Carians, dividing into factions, and going <lb/>
            to war with one another, both parties, as they had their abodes <lb/>
            in places of strength,1 called for the interference of Cyrus. <lb/>
            Cyrus, still remaining at Sardes, prepared engines and batter­ <lb/>
            ing-rams to demolish the walls of those that should refuse to <lb/>
            submit; and sent Adusius, a Persian, a man not incompetent <lb/>
            in other respects, or unskilled in war, and of very agreeable <lb/>
            manners, into Caria, assigning him a body of troops ; 2. and the <lb/>
            Cilicians and Cyprians very readily joined him in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition ; in consideration of which service he never sent a <lb/>
            Persian as governor over the Cilicians or Cyprians, as their <lb/>
            native princes satisfied him; he, however, received tribute <lb/>
            from them, and required them to furnish troops whenever he <lb/>
            needed them. 3. Adusius, at the head of his force, advanced <lb/>
            into Caria; and deputies from both parties of the Carians <lb/>
            came to him, ready to admit him into their fortresses to the <lb/>
            detriment of their opponents.</p>
          <p>Adusius acted towards both parties in the following man­ <lb/>
            ner. With whichever side he conferred, he told them that <lb/>
            they advanced more reasonable arguments than their adversa­ <lb/>
            ries, and that they must conceal from their antagonists that <lb/>
            he and they had become friends, as he would thus be better <lb/>
            able to surprise their adversaries unprepared. He thought it <lb/>
            right that pledges of faith should be given, and that the Ca­ <lb/>
            rians should swear that they would admit him and his people <lb/>
            into their fortresses without treachery, and for the benefit of Cy­ <lb/>
            rus and the Persians; and that he himself should swear to enter <lb/>
            their fortresses without treachery, and for the benefit of those <lb/>
            that admitted him. 4. Having done this, he arranged with <lb/>
            both parties, each without the knowledge of the other, to <lb/>
            admit him the same night; and, during that night, he hastily <note type="footnote"> 1 Their fortresses seem to have been nearly equal in strength ; so <lb/>
            that neither party could get the better of the other. </note> <pb n="218"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            entered within their walls, and possessed himself of the forti­ <lb/>
            fications of both. When day came, he took a position between <lb/>
            them, with his troops about him, and summoned the proper <lb/>
            persons on both sides to attend; who, when they saw each <lb/>
            other, were indignant, thinking themselves deceived on both <lb/>
            sides. 5. Adusius, however, addressed them to this effect: <lb/>
            "I swore to you, men of Caria, that I would, without treach­ <lb/>
            ery, enter your fortifications, for the benefit of those that ad­ <lb/>
            mitted me; if therefore I shall cut off either party, I shall <lb/>
            think that I have effected this entrance to the damage of the <lb/>
            Carians; but if I establish peace between you, and security <lb/>
            for both parties to cultivate their lands, I shall consider I am <lb/>
            come for your benefit. From this day, therefore, it is for you <lb/>
            to join in intercourse with each other in a friendly manner, <lb/>
            to cultivate your lands without fear, to give and receive each <lb/>
            other's daughters in marriage; and if any attempt, contrary <lb/>
            to these regulations, to do wrong to others, Cyrus and we will <lb/>
            be their enemies." 6. In consequence, the gates of the for­ <lb/>
            tresses were thrown open, the roads were filled with people <lb/>
            going to meet one another, and the fields were covered with <lb/>
            labourers ; they celebrated festivals in common, and all was <lb/>
            full of peace and cheerfulness.</p>
          <p>7. At this time there came messengers from Cyrus, to in­ <lb/>
            quire whether he wanted either a reinforcement or engines. <lb/>
            Adusius replied, " That he was at liberty to use even his <lb/>
            present forces elsewhere." And, at the same time that he <lb/>
            said this, he led the body of his troops away, leaving gar­ <lb/>
            risons in the fortresses. The Carians entreated him to stay, <lb/>
            and, upon his refusal, they sent to Cyrus, requesting him <lb/>
            to send Adusius to them as their governor.</p>
          <p>8. Cyrus, meanwhile, had sent Hystaspes away with an army <lb/>
            to Phrygia on the Hellespont; and, when Adusius arrived, he <lb/>
            ordered him to follow with his army in the way that Hys­ <lb/>
            taspes was gone before, that the Phrygians might more readily <lb/>
            submit to Hystaspes, when they heard that there was another <lb/>
            army marching towards them. 9. The Greeks, that dwelt upon <lb/>
            the sea-coast, obtained, by making many presents, exemption <lb/>
            from admitting the Barbarians within their walls, but engaged <lb/>
            to pay a tribute, and serve in the field wherever Cyrus should <lb/>
            command them. 10. The king of Phrygia strengthened him­ <lb/>
            self, as intending to keep possession of his fortresses, and not <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            to submit, and sent word to that effect. But when the com­ <lb/>
            manders under him revolted from him, and he was altogether <lb/>
            deserted, he at last surrendered to Hystaspes, on the under­ <lb/>
            standing that he should submit to the judgment of Cyrus. <lb/>
            Hystaspes, leaving strong Persian garrisons in the forts, <lb/>
            went away, and, together with his own men, carried off con­ <lb/>
            siderable numbers of the Phrygians, both cavalry and pel­ <lb/>
            tasts. 11. Cyrus sent orders to Adusius to join Hystaspes, <lb/>
            and to bring with him such of the Phrygians as had taken <lb/>
            his side, with their arms ; but from such as had shown an in­ <lb/>
            clination to fight, to take away both their horses and arms, <lb/>
            and oblige them all to attend the army with slings. Adusius <lb/>
            and Hystaspes acted according to his orders.</p>
          <p>12. Cyrus then set forward from Sardes, leaving there a <lb/>
            numerous garrison of infantry, and taking with him Crœsus, <lb/>
            and a great many waggons loaded with abundance of valuable <lb/>
            property of every kind. Crœsus brought him an exact ac­ <lb/>
            count in writing of what was in each waggon, and, delivering <lb/>
            the writings to Cyrus, said, "By having these, Cyrus," you <lb/>
            will know who delivers correctly the things that he conveys, <lb/>
            and who does not." 13. Cyrus said, "You have done well, <lb/>
            Croesus, in taking this forethought; however, those will con­ <lb/>
            vey the treasures for me, who are also worthy to possess <lb/>
            them ; so that if they embezzle any of them, they will embezzle <lb/>
            what belongs to themselves." As he spoke thus, he delivered <lb/>
            the writings to his friends and officers, that they might know <lb/>
            which of those who had charge of the property delivered it to <lb/>
            them safe, and which of them did not. 14. He also took with <lb/>
            him, under arms, such of the Lydians as he saw equipping <lb/>
            themselves handsomely with arms, horses, and chariots, and <lb/>
            using all their endeavours to do what they thought would <lb/>
            please him ; but the horses of such as he saw follow him with <lb/>
            dissatisfaction, he gave to the Persians that first took the <lb/>
            field with him, and burned their arms; and these also he <lb/>
            obliged to attend the army with slings. 15. Indeed, all those <lb/>
            that he disarmed, of the several nations that became subject <lb/>
            to him, he obliged to practise the sling, regarding it as quite <lb/>
            a servile weapon: for slingers, in conjunction with other <lb/>
            forces, may sometimes be of very great use; but an army <lb/>
            consisting wholly of slingers would not, by themselves, with- <pb n="220"/>

            many of the horses, that belonged to the prisoners, he dis­ <lb/>
            tributed amongst the body of his allies. He arrived at Baby­ <lb/>

          <p>Cyrus draws his army round the city of Babylon, but, after seeing the <lb/>
            strength of the place, retires. He then forms broad and deep trenches, <lb/>
            as if with a view to a siege ; at length, by drawing off the water of the <lb/>
            Euphrates into the trenches, he surprises the Babylonians while sunk in <lb/>
            revelry and sleep. Arrangement of affairs in the city. Cyrus artfully <lb/>
            signifies to his friends that he ought but seldom to show himself in public. <lb/>
            Speech of Artabazus on this point, showing how Cyrus had for a long <lb/>
            time past been occupied. Cyrus's views supported by Chrysantas. Cyrus <lb/>
            chooses a body-guard of eunuchs, and appoints officers of the palace and <lb/>
            a garrison for the city. His speech to his friends on the general discipline <lb/>
            to be instituted.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN Cyrus reached Babylon, he ranged his whole <lb/>
            army round the city, and then rode round it himself, with his <lb/>
            friends, and the principal men of the allies. 2. When he had <lb/>
            taken a view of the walls, he prepared to draw off the army <lb/>
            from before the city; and a deserter coming off, told him, that <lb/>
            they intended to fall upon him when he was leading the army <lb/>
            away. "For, as they surveyed it from the walls," said he, <lb/>
            "your line appeared to them to be but weak." Nor was it <lb/>
            strange that such was the case; for, as his men encompassed <lb/>
            a great extent of wall, his line was, of necessity, of little <lb/>
            depth. 3. Cyrus, having heard this, took his stand in the <lb/>
            centre of his army, with those that were about him, and gave <lb/>
            orders that the heavy-armed men, drawing back their line <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περσω̃ν ἱππέας</foreign>.] That is, horsemen armed after the Persian <lb/>
            manner. </note> <pb n="221"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            from each extremity,1 should move towards that part of the <lb/>
            army that stood still, till each wing came over against him­ <lb/>
            self and the centre. 4. As they made this movement, those <lb/>
            who kept their place felt more confidence, from being of double <lb/>
            depth ; and those that changed their place felt more confidence <lb/>
            likewise, for they that stood were of course next to the <lb/>
            enemy. When, moving thus from each wing, they had united <lb/>
            the extremities, they stood their ground with much more <lb/>
            firmness; those who had altered their position by reason of <lb/>
            those in front, and those in front by reason of those who had <lb/>
            come up behind them; 5. and as the line was thus drawn <lb/>
            back, the best soldiers were necessarily in the front and rear, <lb/>
            while the worst were ranged in the middle.2 A disposition of <lb/>
            this kind seemed to be well adapted both for fighting and to <lb/>
            prevent flight; and the horse and light-armed men from the <lb/>
            wings came up always so much nearer the commander-in- <lb/>
            chief, as the line became less extended by being doubled in <lb/>
            depth. 6. When they were thus collected together, they re­ <lb/>
            treated, as long as weapons could reach them from the walls, <lb/>
            with their face toward the enemy; but when they were out <lb/>
            of the reach of the weapons, they wheeled about, and moving <lb/>
            forward at first but a few steps, wheeled again to the left, and <lb/>
            halted facing the walls ; and the farther they drew off, the <lb/>
            less frequently they faced about; and when they thought <lb/>
            themselves safe, they marched off without stopping till they <lb/>
            reached their tents.</p>
          <p>7. When they had encamped, Cyrus summoned to him the <lb/>
            principal officers, and said, "Friends and allies, we have taken <lb/>
            a view of the city round about, and I am unable to see how <lb/>
            any enemy can take walls of such strength and height by <lb/>
            assault. But the greater the number of men in the city is, <note type="footnote">1 See Anab. i. 10. 9. ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναπτύσσειν</foreign> must doubtless be interpreted <lb/>
            in the same way in both passages; part of the men were drawn back <lb/>
            from the wings, (from one only in the manoeuvres described in the <lb/>
            Anabasis,) and ranged in the rear to deepen the line. Fischer <lb/>
            observes that the line would be tripled in depth by the movements <lb/>
            here described. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We are to suppose, it would seem, that in the line of troops <lb/>
            drawn round the city, the best men were posted in front. When <lb/>
            the wings drew back, and passed behind the front, a portion of the <lb/>
            best men would then be thrown into the rear; and from what <lb/>
            Xenophon says here, we must conceive that they were sent rear­ <lb/>
            most of all, behind the inferior troops. </note> <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            go much the sooner, (since they do not come out to fight,) I <lb/>
            conceive that they may be reduced by famine. Unless you <lb/>
            have some other method to propose, therefore, I think that <lb/>
            the people must be besieged and taken by that means." 8. <lb/>
            Cbrysantas then said, " Does not this river, that is above two <lb/>
            stadia in breadth, run through the midst of the city ?" <lb/>
            "Yes, indeed," said Gobryas, and is of so great a depth, <lb/>
            that two men, one standing upon the other, would not reach <lb/>
            above the water; so that the city is still better defended by <lb/>
            the river than by its walls." 9. Cyrus then said, " Chry­ <lb/>
            santas, let us think no more of what is beyond our power; 1 <lb/>
            it must be our business, as soon as possible, to dig as broad <lb/>
            and as deep a trench as we can, measuring out the proper <lb/>
            portion for each division, so that we may want the fewer men <lb/>
            to keep guard."</p>
          <p>10. Measuring out, accordingly, the ground around the <lb/>
            wall, and leaving a space by the side of the river sufficient <lb/>
            to hold large towers, he dug on each side of the wall a very <lb/>
            deep trench, and the men threw up the earth towards them­ <lb/>
            selves.2 11. He then, in the first place, built towers upon <lb/>
            the bank of the river, laying their foundation with palm-trees <lb/>
            not less than a hundred feet in length ; for there arc some <lb/>
            that grow even to a yet greater length ; and palm-trees <lb/>
            that are pressed by a weight, bend up under it, like asses <lb/>
            used to carrying loads. 12. He placed these below, with this <lb/>
            object, that he might make it appear, as much as possible, <lb/>
            that he was preparing to blockade the city, and in order that, <lb/>
            if the river forced its way into the ditch, it might not carry <lb/>
            off the towers. He raised likewise a great many other towers <lb/>
            upon the earth which was thrown up, that he might have as <lb/>
            many places as possible for stationing men on guard. Thus the <lb/>
            troops of Cyrus employed themselves. is. But those who <lb/>
            were on the walls laughed at this blockade, as being furnished <lb/>
            with provisions for more than twenty years. Cyrus, hearing <note type="footnote"> 1 Let us make no attempt to ford the river. </note><note type="footnote"> I The men threw up the earth on that side of the trench which <lb/>

            this, divided his army into twelve parts, as if he intended that <lb/>
            each part should keep guard one month in the year. 14. <lb/>
            When the Babylonians heard this, they laughed yet more <lb/>
            than before; reflecting that Phrygians, Lydians, Arabians, <lb/>
            and Cappadocians were to keep guard over them, men who <lb/>
            were better affected to them than to the Persians.</p>
          <p>is. The trenches were now dug; and Cyrus, when he <lb/>
            heard that there was a festival in Babylon, in which all the <lb/>
            Babylonians drank and revelled the whole night, took, during <lb/>
            the time of it, a number of men with him, and, as soon as it <lb/>
            was dark, opened the trenches on the side towards the <lb/>
            river. 16. When this was done, the water ran off in the night <lb/>
            into the trenches, and the bed of the river through the city <lb/>
            allowed men to walk along it. 17. When the river was thus <lb/>
            prepared, Cyrus gave orders to the Persian captains of thou­ <lb/>
            sands, of infantry and cavalry, to attend him, each with his <lb/>
            thousand drawn up two abreast, and the rest of the allies to <lb/>
            follow in the rear, ranged as they used to be before. is. <lb/>
            They accordingly came; and he, causing those that attended <lb/>
            his person, both foot and horse, to go down into the dry chan­ <lb/>
            nel of the river, ordered them to try whether the bed of the <lb/>
            river was passable. 19. When they reported that it was pass­ <lb/>
            able, he called together the officers both of infantry and <lb/>
            cavalry, and spoke to them as follows :</p>
          <p>20. "The river, my friends, has yielded us a passage into <lb/>
            the city; and let us boldly enter, fearing nothing within, but <lb/>
            considering that these people, on whom we are now going to <lb/>
            fall, are the same that we defeated when they had allies with <lb/>
            them, and were all awake, sober, armed, and in order. 21. <lb/>
            We shall now fall upon them at a time when many of them <lb/>
            are asleep, many intoxicated, and all in confusion ; and when <lb/>
            they discover that we are in the city, they will, by reason of <lb/>
            their consternation, be yet more unfit for service than they <lb/>
            are now. 22. But if any one apprehend, (what is said to be <lb/>
            terrible to those that enter a city,) lest, mounting to the tops <lb/>
            of their houses, they throw down missiles upon us from every <lb/>
            side, be quite at ease as to this point; for, if any of them <lb/>
            climb upon the houses, we have the god Vulcan to fight on <lb/>
            our side; their porches are easily set on fire, their doors are <lb/>
            made of the palm tree, and anointed over with bitumen, a <lb/>
            most combustible material. 23. We have torches in abund- <pb n="224"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            ance, that will presently take fire; we have plenty of pitch <lb/>
            and tow, that will soon raise a strong flame; so that the peo­ <lb/>
            ple must, of necessity, flee from their houses at once, or at <lb/>
            once be burnt. 24. Come then ; take your arms, and, with <lb/>
            the help of the gods, I will lead you on. You, Gobryas and <lb/>
            Gadatas," added he, “ show us the ways; for you are ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with them, and, when we are in, conduct us by the <lb/>
            readiest approach to the palace." 25. " Indeed," said they <lb/>
            that were with Gobryas, " it would not be at all wonderful <lb/>
            if the doors of the palace were open, for the whole city seems <lb/>
            to-night to be in a revel; but we shall meet with a guard in <lb/>
            front of the gates, for there is always one placed there." “ We <lb/>
            must not then be remiss," said Cyrus, " but march, that we <lb/>
            surprise them as little prepared as possible."</p>
          <p>26. As soon as these words were spoken, they went for­ <lb/>
            ward ; and, of those that met them, some were struck down <lb/>
            and killed, some fled, and some raised a shout. They that <lb/>
            were with Gobryas joined in the shout with them, as if they <lb/>
            were revellers themselves, and, marching on the shortest way <lb/>
            that they could, arrived at the palace. 27. Those who at­ <lb/>
            tended Gadatas and Gobryas, found the doors of the palace <lb/>
            shut; those who were appointed to attack the guards, fell upon <lb/>
            them, as they were drinking at a large fire, and dealt with <lb/>
            them as with enemies. 2s. As a great clamour and noise en­ <lb/>
            sued, those who were within beard the tumult, and as the <lb/>
            king ordered them to see what was the matter, some of them <lb/>
            threw open the gates and rushed out. 29. Those who were <lb/>
            with Gadatas, as soon as they saw the gates unclosed, burst <lb/>
            in, and, pursuing those who fled, and dealing blows amongst <lb/>
            them, came up to the king, and found him in a standing pos­ <lb/>
            ture with his sword drawn. so. The party of Gadatas and <lb/>
            Gobryas, being numerous, mastered him; those who were <lb/>
            with him were killed, one holding up something before him, <lb/>
            another fleeing, and another defending himself in whatever <lb/>
            way he could. 31. Cyrus sent troops of horse through the <lb/>
            streets, bidding them kill those that they found abroad, and <lb/>
            ordering some, who understood the Assyrian language, to tell <lb/>
            those who were in the houses to remain within, and to say <lb/>
            that, if any were found abroad, they would be killed. 32 <lb/>
            These directions they obeyed. Gadatas and Gobryas now <lb/>
            came up, who first paid their adoration to the gods, because <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            they had taken revenge upon their impious king, and then <lb/>
            kissed the hands and feet of Cyrus, shedding many tears in <lb/>
            the midst of their joy and satisfaction.</p>
          <p>33. When day came, and they that held the towers of the <lb/>
            city perceived that the place was taken and the king dead, <lb/>
            they gave up the towers. 34. Cyrus immediately took pos­ <lb/>
            session of them, and sent commanders, with garrisons, into <lb/>
            them. He gave up the dead to their relatives to bury, and <lb/>
            ordered heralds to make proclamation, that all the Babylonians <lb/>
            should bring out their arms, and gave notice, at the same time, <lb/>
            that in whatever house any arms should be found, all the peo­ <lb/>
            ple in it should be put to death. They accordingly brought <lb/>
            out their arms, and Cyrus had them deposited in the towers, <lb/>
            that they might be ready, if he should ever want to use them.</p>
          <p>35. When these matters had been settled, he first sum­ <lb/>
            moned the Magi, and directed them to select the first-fruits of <lb/>
            the spoil for the gods, with certain portions of ground for <lb/>
            sacred use, as from a city taken by the sword. He next dis­ <lb/>
            tributed houses and palaces to those whom he regarded as <lb/>
            sharers with him in what had been performed. He made the <lb/>
            assignments in the manner that had been determined,1 the best <lb/>
            things to the most deserving; and if any thought that they <lb/>
            had less than they merited, he desired them to come and state <lb/>
            their case to him. 36. He gave notice to the Babylonians <lb/>
            to cultivate their land, to pay their tribute, and to serve those <lb/>
            under whom they were placed. The Persians, who shared <lb/>
            with him in everything, and such of the allies as chose to re­ <lb/>
            main with him, he ordered to communicate with those whom <lb/>
            they took under them as masters.</p>
          <p>37. Soon after, Cyrus, desiring now to make such arrange­ <lb/>
            ments for himself as he thought becoming a king, resolved to <lb/>
            effect his object with the concurrence of his friends ; his inten­ <lb/>
            tion being to appear in public rarely and with dignity, yet so <lb/>
            as to incur as little unpopularity as possible. He took his <lb/>
            measures, therefore, in the following manner. Taking his <lb/>
            station, in the morning, in some place which he thought <lb/>
            eligible, he received any one that wished to speak with him, <lb/>
            and, after giving him his answer, dismissed him. 38. The <lb/>
            people, as soon as they knew that he would receive them, re­ <lb/>
            sorted to the place in unmanageable multitudes, and there was <note type="footnote">1 See ii. 3. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            a great strife and contention among them as they struggled to <lb/>
            effect an approach ; while the attendants, making distinctions as <lb/>
            well as they could, let them in. 39. When any of his friends, <lb/>
            having pushed their way through the crowd, appeared before <lb/>
            him, Cyrus, holding out his hand, drew them to him, and <lb/>
            spoke to them thus : " Wait here, my friends, till we have de­ <lb/>
            spatched the crowd, and then we will confer at leisure." His <lb/>
            friends accordingly waited, and the crowd flocked in more <lb/>
            and more, till the evening came before he was at leisure to <lb/>
            speak to his friends. 40. Cyrus then said, " Now, my friends, <lb/>
            it is time to separate ; come again to-morrow morning, for I <lb/>
            wish to have some conversation with you." His friends, <lb/>
            hearing this, hurried off with great satisfaction, having long <lb/>
            suffered from all the wants of nature. Thus then they went <lb/>
            to rest.</p>
          <p>41. The next day Cyrus attended at the same place; and a <lb/>
            much greater multitude of people, that were desirous to ap­ <lb/>
            proach him, stood round about, attending much earlier than <lb/>
            his friends. Cyrus, therefore, forming a large circle of Persian <lb/>
            spear-men, bid them let none pass but his friends, and the <lb/>
            generals of the Persians and allies. 42. When these were <lb/>
            met, he spoke to them to this effect:</p>
          <p>" Friends and allies, we have nothing that we can lay to <lb/>
            the charge of the gods, as not having hitherto effected what­ <lb/>
            ever we wished. But if the performance of great actions <lb/>
            be attended with such consequences, that a person cannot <lb/>
            obtain a little leisure for himself, or enjoy the company of his <lb/>
            friends, I bid farewell to such good fortune. 43. You ob­ <lb/>
            served," continued he, "yesterday, that, beginning in the <lb/>
            morning to give audience to those that came, we did not make <lb/>
            an end before the evening; and now you see those and <lb/>
            others, more numerous than those who attended yesterday, are <lb/>
            here ready to give us trouble. 44. If I submit myself, therefore, <lb/>
            to these calls, I imagine that a very small part of me will fall <lb/>
            to your share, and a very small part of you to mine; and of <lb/>
            myself I know very well that I shall have no share at all. <lb/>
            Besides," added he, " there is another ridiculous thing that I <lb/>
            observe. 45. I stand affected to you as it is natural that I <lb/>
            should; but, of those that stand here around, I know one or <lb/>
            two, or, perhaps, none; and these men range themselves in <lb/>
            such a manner, as if they expected that if they can but get <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5 ] </note> <lb/>
            the better of you by pushing, they will obtain what they de­ <lb/>
            sire from me sooner than you will. But I should think it <lb/>
            right that such persons, if any of them want anything of me, <lb/>
            should make their court to you that are my friends, and ask <lb/>
            for an introduction. 46. Somebody, however, may ask, per­ <lb/>
            haps, ‘ Why I did not arrange matters thus from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning, but devoted myself in common to all?' I answer, <lb/>
            Because I knew that the affairs of war are of such a na­ <lb/>
            ture, that a commander ought not to be the last to know <lb/>
            what is proper to be known, or to execute what occasion <lb/>
            may require; and I believed that such commanders, as were <lb/>
            seldom to be seen, omitted many things that ought to be <lb/>
            done. 47. But, since this most laborious war has now <lb/>
            ceased, my own mind seems to me to require some rest. <lb/>
            As I am at a loss, therefore, what to do, that our own affairs <lb/>
            and those of others, of whom we ought to take care, may be <lb/>
            regulated in the best manner, let some one recommend to us <lb/>
            what he thinks most advantageous.”</p>
          <p>48. Thus spoke Cyrus ; and Artabazus, he who had once <lb/>
            said that he was his relation,1 rose up after him and said, <lb/>
            " You have done well, Cyrus, in entering on this subject; for, <lb/>
            while you were yet very young, I conceived an earnest desire <lb/>
            to become your friend, but seeing that you were not at all in <lb/>
            want of me, I felt great reluctance to seek your notice. 49. <lb/>
            But when you happened once to want me, to convey promptly <lb/>
            the orders of Cyaxares to the Medes, I conceived that, if I <lb/>
            performed this service for you with zeal, I should become <lb/>
            your intimate friend, and have liberty to converse with you <lb/>
            as long as I pleased. so. The service was indeed executed in <lb/>
            such a way that you gave me your commendation. But soon <lb/>
            after the Hyrcanians (first of all) became our friends, when <lb/>
            indeed we were much in want of supporters; so that, in our <lb/>
            love for them, we almost carried them about in our arms. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when the enemy's camp was taken, you had no <lb/>
            leisure, I imagine, to concern yourself about me; and I ex­ <lb/>
            cused you. 51. Soon after, Gobryas became your friend, and <lb/>
            I was rejoiced that it was so; then Gadatas also; and it now <lb/>
            became a downright labour to gain any share of your atten­ <lb/>
            tion. When again the Sacians and Cadusians became your <note type="footnote"> 1 i. 4. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            allies, it was justly your part to make much of them, for they <lb/>
            had made much of you. 52. When we came back again to <lb/>
            the place from whence we set out, I, seeing you occupied with <lb/>
            your horses, your chariots, and your machines, thought that, <lb/>
            when you were at leisure from all that business, you would <lb/>
            then have leisure to attend to TIle. But when the terrible <lb/>
            news came that all mankind were assembling against us, I <lb/>
            supposed that this would be the decisive struggle; and, if <lb/>
            things succeeded well, I thought myself sure that there would <lb/>
            be abundance of opportunity for enjoying each other's com­ <lb/>
            pany. 53. We have now fought the important battle, and <lb/>
            conquered; we have Sardes and Croesus in our power; we <lb/>
            have taken Babylon ; and have borne down all before us ; and <lb/>
            yet, by Mithras, yesterday, had not I made my way with my <lb/>
            list through the multitude, I had not been able to come near <lb/>
            you ; and, when you had taken me by the hand, and bid <lb/>
            me stay by you, I then stood to be gazed at, for passing the <lb/>
            whole day with you without either meat or drink. 54. Now, <lb/>
            therefore, if any means can be found, that we, who have de­ <lb/>
            served best of you, may have the greatest share of your com­ <lb/>
            pany, it is well; if not, I would wish again to give orders <lb/>
            from you that all should depart, excepting us, that have been <lb/>
            your friends from the beginning."</p>
          <p>55. At this speech Cyrus and many others laughed; and <lb/>
            Chrysantas, the Persian, stood up and spoke thus: "Hitherto, <lb/>
            Cyrus, you very properly presented yourself openly to all. <lb/>
            both for the reasons which you have yourself expressed, and <lb/>
            because we were not the people that you were chiefly to <lb/>
            court; for we attended for our own sakes ; but your business <lb/>
            was, by every method, to gain the multitude, that they <lb/>
            might, with all possible satisfaction, be ready to undergo la­ <lb/>
            bours, and meet dangers with us. 56. But, since you are now <lb/>
            not only in circumstances to effect this object, but are able to <lb/>
            acquire other friends for whom you may have occasion, it is <lb/>
            fit that you have a house yourself; or what enjoyment could <lb/>
            you have in empire, if you were the only person destitute of a <lb/>
            home, than which there is no place more sacred, more agree­ <lb/>
            able, or more dear to men? Besides," added he, "do you <lb/>
            not think that we should be ashamed to see you enduring <lb/>
            hardships abroad, while we ourselves should be in houses, and <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            appear to have the advantage of you ?" 57. When Chry­ <lb/>
            santas had expressed this opinion, many more concurred with <lb/>
            him in it.</p>
          <p>Cyrus accordingly entered upon the possession of the palace, <lb/>
            and those who had brought the treasures from Sardes deliver­ <lb/>
            ed them up to him there. When Cyrus went in, he first <lb/>
            sacrificed to the goddess Vesta, then to Jupiter the king, and <lb/>
            to whatever other deity the Magi directed.</p>
          <p>58. Having completed these proceedings, he now began to <lb/>
            regulate other affairs; and reflecting what his object was, <lb/>
            and that he was taking upon him the government of great <lb/>
            multitudes of men ; that he was preparing to fix his abode in <lb/>
            the greatest city of all that were of note in the world, and <lb/>
            that this city was as hostile to him as any city could be <lb/>
            to a man, he, taking these things into his consideration, <lb/>
            thought himself in want of a guard for his person; 59. and <lb/>
            well knowing that men are at no time so easy to be attacked <lb/>
            as while they are eating, or drinking, or bathing, or upon <lb/>
            their bed, or asleep, he reflected with himself what sort of <lb/>
            people he could have about him, who might be best trusted <lb/>
            on Lach occasions; and he came to the conclusion, that <lb/>
            no man could ever be trusted, who should love another more <lb/>
            than the person that wanted his protection, GO. Such men, <lb/>
            therefore, as had sons or wives, that were agreeable to them, <lb/>
            or youths that were objects of their affection, he deemed to be <lb/>
            under a natural necessity of loving them best; but observing <lb/>
            that eunuchs were destitute of all these ties, he thought <lb/>
            that they would have the greatest affection for those that were <lb/>
            able to enrich them the most, to vindicate them if they were <lb/>
            wronged, and to bestow honours upon them; and he thought <lb/>
            that no one could exceed himself in showing them kindness. <lb/>
            61. In addition to these considerations, eunuchs, being objects <lb/>
            of contempt to other men, are, for this reason, in want of a <lb/>
            master to protect them; for there would be no man that <lb/>
            would not think himself entitled to take advantage of a <lb/>
            eunuch in everything, unless some superior power were to <lb/>
            prevent him; but nothing hinders even a eunuch from being <lb/>
            superior to all in fidelity to his master. 62. What most peo­ <lb/>
            ple are inclined to think, that eunuchs are destitute of all <lb/>
            vigour, did not appear to him to be the case, and he formed <lb/>
            his opinion from other animals; for vicious horses, when they <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            are castrated, give over biting, indeed, and being spiteful, but <lb/>
            are not at all the less fit for service in war; bulls, that are <lb/>
            castrated, lose their fiery spirit and unruliness, but are not <lb/>
            deprived of their strength and fitness for labour; dogs, like­ <lb/>
            wise, when castrated, cease to desert their masters, but are <lb/>
            not at all less fitted for watching and the chase; 63. and men, <lb/>
            also, by being deprived of this desire, become more gentle, <lb/>
            but are not less careful of things that are given them in <lb/>
            charge, or at all worse horsemen, or less able to throw the <lb/>
            javelin, or less desirous of honour; 64. for they have shown, <lb/>
            both in war and in hunting, that they still retain emulation in <lb/>
            their minds. Of fidelity, on the fall of their masters, they <lb/>
            have given the strongest proofs; for none have shown greater <lb/>
            instances of attachment under the misfortunes of their masters <lb/>
            than eunuchs. 65. And if they be thought to lose something <lb/>
            in bodily strength, arms are able to make the weak equal to <lb/>
            the strong in the field of battle. Having adopted these opi­ <lb/>
            nions, he made all the attendants about his person, from the <lb/>
            door-keepers upwards, eunuchs.</p>
          <p>66. But, thinking that this was not a sufficient guard against <lb/>
            the multitude of people that were disaffected towards him, he <lb/>
            considered whom he should take from among all the rest, to <lb/>
            form the most faithful guard for him around the palace. 67. <lb/>
            Knowing, therefore, that the Persians, while at home, were <lb/>
            those that led the hardest of lives by reason of their poverty, <lb/>
            and lived by the severest labour on account of the ruggedness <lb/>
            of their country, and the necessity of working with their own <lb/>
            hands, he thought that these would be the most pleased with <lb/>
            that sort of life that they would lead with him. 68. He <lb/>
            selected from among them, therefore, ten thousand spear-men, <lb/>
            who were to keep guard, night and day, round about the <lb/>
            palace, when he was at home; and, when he went abroad, <lb/>
            were to be his attendants, ranged in military order on each <lb/>
            side of him. 69. Thinking it necessary, too, that there should <lb/>
            be a guard sufficient for the whole city of Babylon, whether <lb/>
            he were present or absent, lie established a strong garrison in <lb/>
            Babylon, and obliged the Babylonians to furnish pay for it, <lb/>
            wishing them to be as poor as possible, that they might be <lb/>
            most humble and most easily managed. 70. These guards, <lb/>
            that were then established about his own person and in Baby­ <lb/>
            lon, are maintained on the same footing to the present day.</p><pb n="231"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note>Taking into his consideration, also, how his whole domi­ <lb/>
            nion might be maintained, and more added to it, he judged <lb/>
            that these mercenaries1 were not so much braver than the <lb/>
            people subjected, as they were fewer in number,2 and deter­ <lb/>
            mined, accordingly, that he ought to retain those brave men, <lb/>
            who had, with the assistance of the gods, secured him victory, <lb/>
            and to take care that they should not grow remiss in the exercise <lb/>
            of valour. 71. But that he might not seem to lay this as an <lb/>
            obligation on them, but that they themselves, deeming such a <lb/>
            course of conduct to be the best, might persevere in what was <lb/>
            honourable, and cultivate it, he called together the Equals-in- <lb/>
            honour, and all the superior officers, and such as appeared to <lb/>
            him most worthy to share in his toils and gains; and, when <lb/>
            they were met, he addressed them to this effect:</p>
          <p>72. " My friends and allies, the greatest thanks are due to <lb/>
            the gods, for having granted us to attain those things of which <lb/>
            we thought ourselves worthy; for we are now masters of a <lb/>
            large and valuable country, and of people who will maintain <lb/>
            us by its cultivation. 73. We have houses, and furniture in <lb/>
            them; and let none of you imagine that, in possessing these <lb/>
            things, he possesses what belongs to another; for it is a per­ <lb/>
            petual law amongst all men, that, when a city is taken from <lb/>
            an enemy, both the persons and property of the inhabitants <lb/>
            belong to the captors. You will not, therefore, possess what <lb/>
            you have, unjustly; but, whatever you suffer the people to <lb/>
            retain, it will be from benevolence that you do not take it away. <lb/>
            74. As to the time to come, my conviction is, that if we resign <lb/>
            ourselves to indolence, and to the luxury of the vicious, who <lb/>
            think labour to be the greatest misery, and to live without <lb/>
            labour to be pleasure, we shall soon become of little value <lb/>
            to ourselves, and shall soon lose all our advantages. 75. <lb/>
            For to have been once brave is not sufficient for continu­ <lb/>
            ing to be so, unless a man constantly keep that object in view. <lb/>
            As other arts, when neglected, become of less worth; and as <lb/>
            bodies in good condition, when we abandon them to inac­ <lb/>
            tivity, again become unhealthy; so prudence, temperance, and <note type="footnote">1 Those mentioned in the preceding section. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cyrus saw that the soldiers of the garrison, however brave and <lb/>
            trustworthy they might be, were yet so far out-numbered by the <lb/>
            people in the city, that they could not put them down, if they raised <lb/>
            a rebellion Fischer. </note> <pb n="232"/>

            courage, when a man ceases to cultivate them, turn thence- <lb/>
            forth again to vice. 7 6. We ought not, therefore, to be remiss, nor <lb/>
            to give ourselves up to present pleasure ; for I think it a great <lb/>
            thing to acquire dominion, but a yet greater to preserve it <lb/>
            after having acquired it. For to acquire has often happened <lb/>
            to him who has displayed nothing but boldness; but to pre­ <lb/>
            serve, after having acquired, is not effected without prudence, <lb/>
            or without self-control, or without much care ; 77. and, know­ <lb/>
            in- that such is the case, it behoves us to practise virtue much <lb/>
            more now, than before we made these valuable acquisitions; <lb/>
            being well assured, that, when a man has most in his posses­ <lb/>
            sion, most people are then ready to envy him, to form designs <lb/>
            against him, and to become his enemies; especially if he hold <lb/>
            possessions and service, as we do at present, from men against <lb/>
            their wills. The gods, we ought to believe, will be with us ; <lb/>
            for we do not possess these dominions unjustly, from having <lb/>
            formed iniquitous designs upon them, but, from having had <lb/>
            designs formed against ourselves, have taken revenge. 78. <lb/>
            But we must secure for ourselves what is next best after this ; <lb/>
            which is, to think ourselves worthy to rule only by being <lb/>
            better than those under our rule. In heat, therefore, and in <lb/>
            cold, in meat and drink, in labours and sleep, we must, of <lb/>
            necessity, allow our dependants a share; but, while we give <lb/>
            them a share, we should first endeavour to appear their supe­ <lb/>
            riors in them.1 79. In the knowledge and practice of military <lb/>
            affairs, however, we must not allow any share at all to such <lb/>
            as we wish to have as labourers and tributaries ; but in exer­ <lb/>
            cises of this kind, we must preserve the ascendency, feeling <lb/>
            convinced that the gods have set these things before men, as <lb/>
            the means of liberty and happiness. And as we have taken <lb/>
            arms from others, so ought we never to be without arms our­ <lb/>
            selves; well knowing, that to those who have always their <lb/>
            arms nearest at hand, what they desire is most at command.</p>
          <p>so. "If any one think thus within himself, ‘ What ad­ <lb/>
            vantage is it to us to have effected what we desired, if we <lb/>
            must still bear hunger and thirst, labour and application ?’ <lb/>
            he ought to learn, that good things give a man so much the <lb/>
            more delight, as he has exerted the more labour beforehand to <lb/>
            attain them ; for labour gives a relish to all good things; and <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, we must endeavour to prove ourselves superior in en­ <lb/>

            without desire in a person to obtain a thing, there is nothing <lb/>
            that can be acquired at such expense as to be pleasant to him. <lb/>
            si. If some divinity has assisted us in providing for ourselves <lb/>
            those things that men most desire, and each individual of us <lb/>
            will so order these things for himself as that they may appear <lb/>
            most pleasant, he will, by acting thus, have so far the advan­ <lb/>
            tage of those who are less supplied with necessaries, that he <lb/>
            will secure the most agreeable food when he is hungry, enjoy <lb/>
            the most agreeable drink when he is thirsty, and, when he <lb/>
            wants rest, experience the most agreeable sleep. 82. For <lb/>
            these reasons, I say, we must now be intent on acting as <lb/>
            brave men, that we may enjoy our advantages in the best and <lb/>
            most agreeable manner, and that we may not experience the <lb/>
            most grievous of all things; for it is not so distressing not to <lb/>
            have acquired advantages, as it is painful to be deprived of <lb/>
            them after having acquired them. 83. Consider, too, what <lb/>
            pretence we can have to desire to be less meritorious than be­ <lb/>
            fore. Is it because we hold dominion ? But it does not be­ <lb/>
            come a prince to be a worse character than those who are <lb/>
            under his command. Or is it because we seem to be more pros­ <lb/>
            perous now than before ? But will any man say that vice is an <lb/>
            ornament to prosperity ? Or is it that, since we have gotten <lb/>
            slaves, we shall punish them if they are vicious ? But how <lb/>
            does it become him that is himself vicious to punish others for <lb/>
            vice and sloth ? 84. Consider further, that we are preparing <lb/>
            to maintain numbers of men, as guards to our houses and <lb/>
            persons ; and how would it be otherwise than disgraceful to <lb/>
            us, if we should think it becomes us to secure safety by means <lb/>
            of others acting as guards, and should not act the part of <lb/>
            guards to ourselves ? You ought to be well assured, indeed, <lb/>
            that there is no other guard so secure as for each of us to be hon­ <lb/>
            ourable and brave. This persuasion must keep you company ; <lb/>
            for, with him who is destitute of virtue, nothing can go well. <lb/>
            85. How then do I say that you should act ? where practise <lb/>
            virtue, and where apply to the exercise of it ? I have nothing <lb/>
            new, my friends, to tell you; but as, among the Persians, the <lb/>
            Equals-in-honour pass their time about the courts, so, I say, <lb/>
            it is our part, being all honoured here, to practise the same <lb/>
            things that are practised there; and it behoves you, keeping <lb/>
            your eyes upon me as you attend here, to observe if I con­ <lb/>
            tinue studious of the things of which I ought to be studious; <pb n="234"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            while I shall keep my eyes intent upon you, and such as I <lb/>
            see practising what is good and excellent, I shall reward. 86. <lb/>
            Our children, also, to whomsoever of us any shall be born, we <lb/>
            may instruct here; for we ourselves shall be better men by <lb/>
            being desirous to show ourselves as the best possible examples <lb/>
            to our children; and our children will not easily become <lb/>
            vicious, even though they incline to be so, when they neither <lb/>
            see nor hear anything unbecoming, but pass their whole time <lb/>
            in honourable and virtuous pursuits."</p>

          <p>Chrysantas expresses his assent to the propositions of Cyrus, and recom­ <lb/>
            mends that all respect and honour should be paid him. Duties of the <lb/>
            palace appointed by Cyrus. His regulations for the frequent attendance <lb/>
            of the noblemen at court. He excites others to a virtuous life by his ex­ <lb/>
            ample. He promotes the exercise of hunting. He encourages splendour. <lb/>
            He prohibits slaves from the use of arms, and all liberal culture. His <lb/>
            power of attaching all classes of people to himself, and rendering them <lb/>
            his friends.</p>
          <p>i. THUS said Cyrus. After him Chrysantas rose, and <lb/>
            spoke as follows: " I have frequently observed, my friends, <lb/>
            at other times, that a good ruler differs in no respect from a <lb/>
            good father; for fathers take thought for their children, in <lb/>
            order that what is for their advantage may never be wanting <lb/>
            to them ; and Cyrus seems to me to recommend to us, on the <lb/>
            present occasion, a course of conduct by which we may con­ <lb/>
            tinue to enjoy the greatest happiness. But what he appears <lb/>
            to me to have stated less fully than was necessary, I will en­ <lb/>
            deavour to explain to those who are not aware of it; 2. for <lb/>
            consider what city belonging to an enemy can possibly be <lb/>
            taken by men who are not obedient to command; or what <lb/>
            friendly city can be preserved by men who are not obedient; <lb/>
            or what army, consisting of disobedient soldiers, can obtain <lb/>
            victory; or how can men be sooner defeated in battle, than <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            when they begin separately to consult each for his own safety ; <lb/>
            or what other important object can be accomplished by such <lb/>
            as do not submit to the direction of their superiors. What <lb/>
            cities can be governed according to laws ? What families can <lb/>
            be preserved ? 2. How do ships arrive at the place to which <lb/>
            they are bound ? By what other means have we obtained the <lb/>
            advantages that we possess, more than by being obedient to <lb/>
            our commander ? By observing this duty, we have reached, <lb/>
            by night and by day, the places to which we had to march ; <lb/>
            by following our commander in compact order, we have been <lb/>
            irresistible; and of whatever has been commanded us, we <lb/>
            have left nothing half-finished. If obedience to command <lb/>
            therefore be of the greatest importance in order to the accom­ <lb/>
            plishment of excellent objects, be assured that it is also of the <lb/>
            greatest importance for preserving what is necessary for us to <lb/>
            preserve. 4. Hitherto most of us have had the command of <lb/>
            none, but have been subject to the command of others; but <lb/>
            now, all of you that are here present, are placed in such a <lb/>
            condition that you have command, some over more, some over <lb/>
            fewer. As you shall think it right, therefore, to rule those <lb/>
            that are under you, so let us submit to those to whom it be. <lb/>
            comes us to submit. We ought so far to distinguish ourselves <lb/>
            from slaves, that slaves do service to their masters against <lb/>
            their wills; while it behoves us, if we desire to be free, to <lb/>
            perform willingly what appears to be of the highest import­ <lb/>
            ance. And you will find," added he, “ that even where a <lb/>
            people are governed without a monarchy, that state which is <lb/>
            most willing to obey its rulers, is always least liable to the <lb/>
            necessity of submitting to its enemies. 5. Let us, therefore, <lb/>
            attend at the palace as Cyrus directs; let us practise those <lb/>
            things by which we may be best enabled to preserve what we <lb/>
            ought to preserve; and let us submit ourselves to Cyrus, to <lb/>
            employ us in whatever service lie may think proper; for we <lb/>
            ought to be well assured, that Cyrus can find nothing in which <lb/>
            he will employ us for his own advantage, and not for ours, <lb/>
            since the same things are profitable for us both, and we have <lb/>
            both the same enemies."</p>
          <p>6. When Chrysantas had spoken thus, many others, both of <lb/>
            the Persians and allies, rose up to speak to the same effect; <lb/>
            and it was determined, that the men of quality should attend, <lb/>
            from time to time. at Cyrus's door, and offer themselves for <pb n="236"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            his service, in whatever way he might think fit, till he him­ <lb/>
            self should dismiss them; and as it was then determined, so <lb/>
            also the people in Asia, that are under the king, continue to <lb/>
            do to the present day, attending at the doors of their princes. <lb/>
            7. And as it has been shown in this book how Cyrus estab­ <lb/>
            lished things, in order to secure dominion to himself and the <lb/>
            Persians, so the kings who have succeeded him, continue to <lb/>
            observe the same institutions to the present time. s. But it <lb/>
            is the same with these regulations as with others; when there <lb/>
            is a better governor, the rules are observed more strictly, and <lb/>
            when there is a worse, more negligently. The men of quality, <lb/>
            therefore, attended at the gates of Cyrus with their horses <lb/>
            and lances, as had been agreed by the chief of those who had <lb/>
            assisted him in the overthrow of the Assyrian empire.</p>
          <p>9. Cyrus next appointed different officers to attend to dif­ <lb/>
            ferent affairs. He had his receivers of the revenues, his pay­ <lb/>
            masters, his overseers of works, keepers of his treasures, <lb/>
            and persons to provide whatever was proper for his table. <lb/>
            He appointed, as masters of his horses and dogs, such as he <lb/>
            thought would maintain those animals in the best condition for <lb/>
            his use. 10. But as to those whom he thought fit to make <lb/>
            joint guardians of his power, he himself took care, that they <lb/>
            should be the most eligible persons possible, and did not assign <lb/>
            the care of the selection to others, but considered it as peculi­ <lb/>
            arly his own business. He knew that if ever he should have <lb/>
            to fight a battle, it was from these that he must choose his <lb/>
            staff and supporters, with whom the greatest dangers must be <lb/>
            faced ; he knew that from these he must appoint commanders <lb/>
            of his infantry and cavalry ; and if he should require generals <lb/>
            to serve where he himself was not present, he knew that it <lb/>
            was out of these they must be sent. 11. Some of them he <lb/>
            knew that he must employ as guardians and satraps of cities <lb/>
            and whole nations; and some of them must be sent as ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, an office which he thought of the greatest consequence <lb/>
            for obtaining what lie might desire without war. 12. If <lb/>
            those, therefore, by whom the most important and most numer­ <lb/>
            ous affairs were to be conducted, should not be such as they <lb/>
            ought to be, he thought that matters would go ill with him ; <lb/>
            but if they should be such as they ought to be, he expected <lb/>
            that all would go well.</p>
          <p>With such sentiments. lie took this care upon him, and con- <pb n="237"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            sidered that the same exercise of virtue was to be observed by <lb/>
            himself; for he thought it impossible for a man who was not <lb/>
            himself such as he should be, to incite others to honourable <lb/>
            and virtuous actions. 13. As he made these reflections, he <lb/>
            thought that leisure, in the first place, was necessary, if he <lb/>
            would have it in his power to attend to affairs of the highest <lb/>
            importance. He indeed thought he must not be negligent of <lb/>
            his revenues ; foreseeing that, in a great government, he must <lb/>
            of necessity be at great expense; but, on the other hand, as <lb/>
            his possessions were very great, he saw that to be always <lb/>
            himself occupied about them would leave him no leisure to <lb/>
            attend to the safety of the whole.</p>
          <p>14. Meditating, accordingly, how the economy of his empire <lb/>
            might be properly arranged, and he, at the same time, might <lb/>
            have leisure, he began to reflect on the order of an army. For <lb/>
            as the captains of ten, in most matters, have the command of <lb/>
            their several decads; the captains of twenty-five of the cap­ <lb/>
            tains of ten; the captains of a thousand of the captains of <lb/>
            twenty-five ;1 and the captains of ten thousand of the cap­ <lb/>
            tains of thousands; so that no one is left without superin­ <lb/>
            tendence, even if the army consists of very many myriads of <lb/>
            men ; and when the general wishes to employ the army on any <lb/>
            service, it is sufficient if he gives his orders to the command­ <lb/>
            ers of ten thousand; 15. as these affairs, therefore, were re­ <lb/>
            gulated, Cyrus accordingly arranged under certain heads his <lb/>
            civil affairs; so that he was enabled, by speaking with a few <lb/>
            persons only, to keep every department of his affairs under <lb/>
            superintendence; and he had consequently more leisure than <lb/>
            another man, who had charge but of a single house or a single <lb/>
            ship. Having thus arranged his own business, he taught <lb/>
            those about him to adopt the same method.</p>
          <p>16. In this manner he secured leisure both for himself and <lb/>
            his ministers; and he then began to study that the partici­ <lb/>
            pators of his cares should be such as they ought to be. In the <lb/>
            first place, whoever were able to subsist by the labour of <lb/>
            others, and did not attend at his gate, he inquired for them, <lb/>
            believing that such as attended would not do anything base or <note type="footnote">1 Bornemann supposes that the taxiarchs, or centurions, are here <lb/>
            omitted, perhaps by the negligence of a transcriber, and that the <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. <lb/>
              </note>dishonourable, both by reason that they would be near their <lb/>
              prince, and that, whatever they did, they would be observed <lb/>
              by the most respectable men. Such as did not attend, he <lb/>
              suspected of absenting themselves, either to indulge in some <lb/>
              vicious passion, some unjust practices, or neglect of duties. <lb/>
              17. We shall first, therefore, state how he obliged such men <lb/>
              to attend. He would desire one of those about him, that were <lb/>
              his chief friends, to take possession of what belonged to the <lb/>
              person that did not attend, declaring that he was taking pos­ <lb/>
              session of his own property. When this was done, they that <lb/>
              were dispossessed would immediately come to complain to <lb/>
              him, as persons that had been wronged. is. Cyrus, for a <lb/>
              long while, would not be at leisure to give such men a hear­ <lb/>
              ing ; and, when he had heard them, would defer the decision <lb/>
              of the matter for a long while. By acting thus, he expected <lb/>
              to accustom them to pay their court to him, incurring, at the <lb/>
              same time, less ill-will from them, than if he had himself <lb/>
              forced them to attend, by inflicting punishments upon them. <lb/>
              19. This was one of his modes of instruction to make men at­ <lb/>
              tend upon him. Another was, to give those that attended <lb/>
              such commissions as were most easy and most profitable. <lb/>
              Another was, never to allow the absent a share in any ad­ <lb/>
              vantage. 20. But his chief method of compulsion was, if a <lb/>
              man was regardless of any other, to take from him what he <lb/>
              had, and to give it to another that he thought would make it <lb/>
              his business to attend on proper occasions. Thus he gained a <lb/>
              useful friend, instead of a useless one; and the present king <lb/>
              still makes inquiry if any one of those be absent whose duty <lb/>
              it is to attend.</p>
          <p>21. In this manner did he conduct himself to those who did <lb/>
            not attend upon him: but those who afforded him their ser­ <lb/>
            vices he thought that he should best excite to honourable and <lb/>
            virtuous actions, if, as he deemed himself rightfully their <lb/>
            prince, he should endeavour to prove himself to those whom <lb/>
            he governed the most accomplished of all men in virtue ; 22. for <lb/>
            he felt convinced, indeed, that men were rendered better by <lb/>
            written laws; but a good prince, he considered, was to men <lb/>
            a living law, because he was able both to direct, to ob­ <lb/>
            serve, and to punish, any one that misconducted himself.</p>
          <p>23. Such being his judgment, he showed himself, in the <lb/>
            first place, most anxious to discharge his duties to the gods, <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1 ]</note> <lb/>
            at the time when he was in the greatest prosperity ; and it was <lb/>
            then that the Magi were first established under him ;1 and he <lb/>
            used to sing a hymn to the gods always at break of day, and <lb/>
            to sacrifice every day to such deities as the Magi directed. <lb/>
            24. The regulations that were thus instituted at that time are <lb/>
            continued under the kings, as they succeed to the throne from <lb/>
            time to time, to the present day. In these respects, accord <lb/>
            ingly, the other Persians were the first to follow his example, <lb/>
            trusting that they should be the more fortunate, if they wor <lb/>
            shipped the gods as he did, who was the most fortunate of all, <lb/>
            and their prince; and they thought that, by acting thus, they <lb/>
            should please Cyrus. 25. But Cyrus accounted the piety of <lb/>
            those about him an advantage to himself; feeling like those <lb/>
            who choose to undertake a voyage in company with men ot <lb/>
            piety, rather than with such as are thought to have been <lb/>
            guilty of anything impious. He also considered, that, if all <lb/>
            his associates were religious, they would be the less likely to <lb/>
            commit any impiety towards each other, or towards him, <lb/>
            who deemed himself the benefactor of such as shared his <lb/>
            power. 26. By manifesting, too, that he esteemed it of great <lb/>
            importance to do no injury to any friend or ally, but to adhere <lb/>
            strictly to justice, he thought that others would abstain the <lb/>
            more from dishonourable gains, and would take care to acquire <lb/>
            property only by just means. 27. He was of opinion, more­ <lb/>
            over, that he should the better inspire other men with a sense <lb/>
            of propriety, if he himself should appear to pay so great a <lb/>
            respect to all, as never to say or do anything unbecoming. 28. <lb/>
            He conjectured that such would be the case from the follow­ <lb/>

            to such persons as men do not fear, they pay more respect to <lb/>

            about him, if lie were seen to bestow greater rewards upon <lb/>
            such as obeyed him without hesitation, than upon such as <lb/>
            seemed to display the greatest and most laborious virtues. so. <lb/>
            In this opinion, and in this practice, he always continued; and <lb/>
            by showing modesty in his own conduct, he caused every one <lb/>
            else to practise it the more readily; for when men see one, that <lb/>
            has it most in his power to behave with insolence, conducting <lb/>
            himself with modesty, those even of inferior rank are the more <lb/>
            solicitous not to be seen doing anything insolent. 31. He <lb/>
            distinguished shame and natural modesty in this manner; <lb/>
            that those who felt shame, avoided what was unbecoming <lb/>
            while they were under observation, but that the naturally <lb/>
            modest avoided it even in secret. 32. He thought, likewise, <lb/>
            that a command of the passions would be best practised, if he <lb/>
            showed that lie himself was not drawn away by present plea­ <lb/>
            sures from the pursuit of what was right, and that he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred labouring for a noble end before all delights. 33. <lb/>
            Observing, therefore, such conduct himself, he established <lb/>
            extreme good order among the inferior officers at his gates, <lb/>
            (who readily submitted to their superiors,) and produced in <lb/>
            them great respect and politeness of demeanour one towards <lb/>
            another. You would not see any one there in anger, break­ <lb/>
            ing out into loud clamour, or expressing pleasure with insult­ <lb/>
            ing laughter; but, as you looked on them, you would have <lb/>
            thought that they lived in reality only with a view to the at­ <lb/>
            tainment of honour. 34. In the practice and contemplation <lb/>
            of such things they passed their days at the doors of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>In order to inure them to exercises suitable for military <lb/>
            men, he led out all those to hunt who, he thought, ought to <lb/>
            take that exercise ; considering this indisputably the best pre­ <lb/>
            paration for warlike employments, as well as the most efficient <lb/>
            exercise in the art of riding ; 35. for it renders men, more than <lb/>
            any other exercise, able to sit firm on horseback, in all sorts <lb/>
            of ground, through pursuing the wild beasts in their flight; <lb/>
            and it makes them, more than any other exercise, capable of <lb/>
            acting on horseback, from their eagerness to gain com­ <lb/>
            mendation in it, and desire of taking their game. 36. By <lb/>
            this exercise he effectually accustomed his associates to be <lb/>
            able to bear a restraint upon themselves, as well as toil, <lb/>
            cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; and the king that now <pb n="241"/>
             <note type="margin">CH 1.] </note> <lb/>
            reigns, together with those about him, continue still the same <lb/>
            practice.</p>
          <p>37. It is evident, therefore, from all that has been said, that <lb/>
            he thought no one had any business with government, who <lb/>
            was not himself better than those whom he governed; and <lb/>
            that by thus exercising those about him, he inured himself, <lb/>
            most of all, to self-command, and to military arts and exercises ; <lb/>
            38. for he led out others to hunt, when there was no necessity <lb/>
            for him to stay at home; and, when there was such neces­ <lb/>
            sity, he used to hunt the beasts that were maintained in his <lb/>
            parks. He never took his dinner till he had well exercised <lb/>
            himself, nor did he ever allow food to be thrown to his horses <lb/>
            before they were exercised; and he invited also the eunuchs <lb/>
            with him to these hunting-matches. 39. He himself, therefore, <lb/>
            greatly excelled in all noble attainments, as did also those who <lb/>
            were about him, by reason of their constant exercise. Such <lb/>
            an example did he show himself to others ; and, besides, whom­ <lb/>
            soever he saw the most zealous in the pursuit of what was <lb/>
            honourable, he rewarded them with presents, with commands, <lb/>
            with the principal seats, and with all kinds of honours; so <lb/>
            that he raised great emulation in all, to strive that each might <lb/>
            appear to Cyrus most worthy of distinction.</p>
          <p>40. We believe that we have also observed in the character <lb/>
            of Cyrus, that he thought that princes ought not to differ from <lb/>
            those under their dominion, merely in being more accom­ <lb/>
            plished than they, but that they ought even to impose upon <lb/>
            them. He at least chose to wear the Median dress himself, <lb/>
            and persuaded his associates to wear it; for, if a man had any <lb/>
            defect in his person, this dress seemed to him adapted to con­ <lb/>
            ceal it, and to make the wearers appear extremely handsome <lb/>
            and tall; 41. for the Medes have a sort of shoe, into which <lb/>
            they may easily and secretly fit something under their feet, so <lb/>
            as to seem taller than they really are. He allowed them also <lb/>
            to colour their eyes, that they might appear to have finer eyes <lb/>
            than they really had, and to paint themselves, that they might <lb/>
            appear of better complexions than they naturally were. 42. <lb/>
            He made it his care, likewise, that they should not be seen <lb/>
            spitting, or blowing the nose, or turning aside to gaze at any­ <lb/>
            thing ; as if they were men that admired nothing. All these <lb/>
            things, he thought, tended in some degree to make them less <lb/>
            likely to lose respect in the eyes of those under their authority. <note type="footnote"> VOL. II, </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note></p><pb n="242"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note>43. Such as he thought worthy to govern, he, of himself, <lb/>
            trained in this manner, both by exercise, and by presiding <lb/>
            over them with dignity. But those whom he trained for <lb/>
            servitude, he never incited to practise any liberal pursuit, or <lb/>
            allowed them to possess arms, but took care that they should <lb/>
            never go without their meat and drink for the sake of such <lb/>
            liberal exercises ; 44. for when, with the cavalry, they were to <lb/>
            drive out the wild beasts into the plains, he ordered food to <lb/>
            be carried to the chase for their use,1 but not for any of the <lb/>
            well-born. When he was on a march, he led them to water <lb/>
            like beasts of burden, and when the time for dinner came, he <lb/>
            used to wait till they had eaten something, that they might <lb/>
            not suffer from excessive hunger.2 So that this class of people, <lb/>
            as well as the nobles, called him their father, for taking care <lb/>
            that, beyond all doubt, they should always continue slaves.3</p>
          <p>45. He thus secured stability for the whole Persian em­ <lb/>
            pire ; and he felt very confident that he himself was. in no <lb/>
            danger of suffering any harm from the conquered,4 for he <lb/>
            thought them spiritless, and saw that they were destitute of <lb/>
            all order; and, besides, none of them ever came near him by <lb/>
            night or day. 46. But such as he observed to be of the better <lb/>
            class, he saw armed and united; some of them he knew to be <lb/>
            captains of horse, some of foot, and many of them he found <lb/>
            to be possessed of such abilities as to be competent to govern ; <lb/>
            these associated much with his own guards, and many of <lb/>
            them were frequently in company with himself, (for it was <lb/>
            necessary that it should be so, if he were to make any use of <lb/>
            them,) and from this sort of persons there was danger in the <lb/>
            greatest degree that he might suffer harm in many ways. 47. <lb/>
            Meditating, therefore, how he might enjoy security also from <lb/>
            these, he did not approve of taking away their arms and <lb/>
            rendering them unfit for war, both deeming it unjust, and be­ <lb/>
            lieving it would tend to a dissolution of his empire; but, on <lb/>
            the other hand, not to admit them to his presence, and to ap­ <lb/>
            pear openly distrustful of them, he thought likely to prove the <note type="footnote"> 1 It would have been foreign to the policy of Cyrus to have <lb/>

            commencement of an insurrection. 48. Instead of any of these <lb/>
            expedients, there was one that he thought to be most for his <lb/>
            security, and most honourable of all, which was, to try if he <lb/>
            could make the nobles more friendly to himself than to one <lb/>
            another. By what means: then, he appears to me to have <lb/>
            come to be loved, I will endeavour to relate.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Cyrus's attention and liberality to his friends. His conversation with <lb/>
            Croesus on this subject. His institution of physicians. His encouragement <lb/>
            of games and contests for prizes.</p>
          <p>1. IN the first place, he displayed, on all occasions, as much <lb/>
            as he could, a humanity of feeling; reflecting that, as it is <lb/>
            not easy for men to love those who seem to hate them, or to <lb/>
            bear good-will to the ill-intentioned, so those that were known <lb/>
            to love and bear good-will, could not be hated by such as <lb/>
            thought themselves beloved by them. 2. Whilst, therefore, he <lb/>
            had not so much power1 to bestow benefits in money, he en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to gain friendship by taking forethought for those <lb/>
            about him, by appearing pleased at their successes, and con­ <lb/>
            cerned at their misfortunes ; but when he had the means of <lb/>
            gratifying his friends with presents, he seems to me to have <lb/>
            been well aware that there is no kindness interchanged by <lb/>
            men with one another, at the same expense, more acceptable <lb/>
            than that of sharing meat and drink with them.</p>
          <p>3. Being of this opinion, he first appointed, with regard to his <lb/>
            table, that of whatever dishes he ate, a number of dishes similar <lb/>
            to these, sufficient for several persons, should always be set <lb/>
            before him ; and all that was placed on the table, except what <lb/>
            himself and his guests consumed, he distributed to those of <lb/>
            his friends of whom he wished to testify remembrance or <lb/>
            love. He sent portions also to those with whose conduct lie <lb/>
            happened to be pleased, whether on guard, in attendance on <lb/>
            himself, or in whatever other employments; thus signifying, <lb/>
            that those who were desirous to please him, could not escape <lb/>
            his notice. 4. He paid the same honour from his table to his <note type="footnote">1 Before he had made his great conquests of Sardis and Babylon. </note> <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            own domestics, when he was inclined to praise any one of <lb/>
            them; and he had all the food of his domestics placed upon <lb/>
            his own table, thinking that this practice would inspire them, <lb/>
            like dogs, with a certain attachment to him. If he wished any <lb/>
            one of his friends to be courted by many people, he sent him <lb/>
            presents from his table; for, even to this day, all pay greater <lb/>
            court to those to whom they see presents sent from the king's <lb/>
            table, regarding them as men in great honour, and capable of <lb/>
            effecting for them whatever they may want. Nor is it on <lb/>
            these accounts only, that have been mentioned, that the things <lb/>
            sent from the king are pleasing, but dishes that come from the <lb/>
            king's table are in reality superior in flavour ; 5. and it is not at <lb/>
            all wonderful that such is the case; for as other arts, in great <lb/>
            cities, are brought to a high degree of excellence, so the meats <lb/>
            on the king's table are dressed in the best possible manner. <lb/>
            In small towns, the same man makes a couch, a door, a <lb/>
            plough, and a table; and frequently the same person is a <lb/>
            builder too, and is very well content if he can thus find cus­ <lb/>
            tomers enough to maintain him; and it is impossible for a <lb/>
            man who works at many things to do them all well; but, in <lb/>
            great cities, because there are numbers that want each parti­ <lb/>
            cular thing, one art alone suffices for the maintenance of each <lb/>
            individual; and frequently indeed, not an entire art, but one <lb/>
            man makes shoes for men, and another for women ; some­ <lb/>
            times it happens, that one gets a maintenance merely by <lb/>
            stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, another by cut­ <lb/>
            ting out upper-leathers1 only, and another by doing none of <lb/>
            these things, but simply putting together the pieces. He, <lb/>
            therefore, that is employed in a work of the smallest compass, <lb/>
            must, of necessity, do it best. 6. Matters relating to the table <lb/>
            are in the very same case; for he that has the same man to <lb/>
            spread the couches, to set out the table, to knead the dough, to <lb/>
            dress sometimes one dish, and sometimes another, must neces- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">χιτω̃νας</foreign>.] The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χιτω̃νες</foreign>, applied to the shoemaker's art, <lb/>
            means " the upper and under leathers " of shoes. At least Aristotle <lb/>

            sarily, I think, fare in each particular as it may happen ; but <lb/>
            where there is employment enough for one man to boil meaL <lb/>
            for another to roast it, for one to boil fish, for another to broil <lb/>
            it, and for another to make bread, (and that not of every sort <lb/>
            either, but it is enough for him to furnish one sort good,) <unclear>each</unclear> <lb/>
            man, in my opinion, must of necessity bring the things that <lb/>
            are thus made to very great perfection. Cyrus therefore, by <lb/>
            such means, greatly exceeded all other people in making pre­ <lb/>
            sents of dishes from his table.</p>
          <p>7. How he excelled in attaching men to him by every other <lb/>
            means, I will now proceed to relate. As he far exceeded <lb/>
            other men in the greatness of his revenues, he exceeded them <lb/>
            still more in the multitude of his presents. Cyrus, therefore, <lb/>
            began this custom; and the practice of making abundance of <lb/>
            presents continues, to this day, among the Persian kings. 8. <lb/>
            Who is known to have richer friends than the king of Persia ? <lb/>
            Who is known to adorn those about him with finer habits <lb/>
            than that monarch ? Whose presents are known to be like <lb/>
            some of those bestowed by this king, bracelets, collars, and <lb/>
            horses with bits of gold? for no one there is allowed to <lb/>
            possess such things but he to whom the king gives them. 9. <lb/>
            What other man can be said to make himself preferred before <lb/>
            brothers, before fathers, before children, by the greatness of <lb/>
            his presents ? What other man has such power to chastise <lb/>
            his enemies, that are distant from him many months' journey, <lb/>
            as the Persian king has ? What other man but Cyrus, after <lb/>
            having overturned an empire, ever died with the title of <lb/>
            FATHER from the people whom he had brought under his <lb/>
            power ? For it is plain that this is a name for one that be­ <lb/>
            stows rather than for one that takes away.</p>
          <p>10. We understand, too, that he gained those men that are <lb/>
            called the eyes and the ears of the king, by no other means, <lb/>
            than by bestowing presents and honours upon them; for, by <lb/>
            being very bountiful to such as told him what was proper for <lb/>
            him to know, he caused numbers of people to watch both <lb/>
            with ears and eyes, to find something to report by which <lb/>
            they might gratify the king. 11. The eyes of the king were <lb/>
            accordingly thought very numerous, and his ears equally <lb/>
            numerous. But if any one thinks that one person only should <lb/>
            be chosen by the king as his eye, he judges erroneously; for <lb/>
            one man would see but few things, and one man would hear <pb n="246"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            but few ; and, if such charge were given to one only, it would <lb/>
            be as if others were ordered to neglect it; besides, whom­ <lb/>
            soever people knew to be this eye, they would be aware that <lb/>
            they must be on their guard against him. But such is not <lb/>
            the case; for the king gives audience to every one that says <lb/>
            he has heard or seen anything worth his attention. 12. Thus <lb/>
            the ears and eyes of the king appear to be very many; <lb/>
            and people are everywhere afraid of saying anything offensive <lb/>
            to the king, just as if he himself could hear them; and of <lb/>
            doing anything offensive, just as if he himself were present. <lb/>
            Not only, therefore, did no one dare to say anything unfavour­ <lb/>
            able of Cyrus to anybody, but every one felt as if he was <lb/>
            always amidst the eyes and ears of the king perpetually at­ <lb/>
            tending him.</p>
          <p>For this disposition of men towards him, I know not what <lb/>
            cause we can better assign, than that he desired to bestow <lb/>
            great benefits in return for small ones. 13. Nor is it to be <lb/>
            wondered at, that he, who was the richest of all, should ex­ <lb/>
            ceed all in the greatness of his presents ; but that one holding <lb/>
            royal dignity should exceed others in service and attention to <lb/>
            his friends, is more worthy of record. He is said to have been <lb/>
            evidently ashamed of nothing so much as of being outdone <lb/>
            in serving his friends, 14. and a saying of his is recorded, <lb/>
            signifying, “ That the business of a good herdsman and that <lb/>
            of a good king were similar; for a herdsman," he said, <lb/>
            “ought to keep the herd in happiness, such as the happiness <lb/>
            of cattle can be, while using them, and that a king ought, in <lb/>
            like manner, to make cities and men happy, while making use <lb/>
            of them." It is no wonder, therefore, if such were his senti­ <lb/>
            ments, that he had an ambition to surpass all other people in <lb/>
            doing service to men.</p>
          <p>15. Cyrus is said to have given the following excellent <lb/>
            lesson to Crœsus, on a certain occasion when Crœsus suggest­ <lb/>
            ed to him that, by making so many presents, he would become <lb/>
            poor, while it was in his power to lay up at home vast trea­ <lb/>
            sures of gold for the use of himself individually. It is said <lb/>
            that Cyrus then asked him, " What sums do you think I <lb/>
            should now have in my possession, if I had been hoarding up <lb/>
            gold, as you bid me, ever since I have been in power ?" 16. <lb/>
            That Crœsus, in reply, named some large sum ; and that Cy­ <lb/>
            rus rejoined, " Well, Crœsus, send, with Hystaspes here, some <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            person in whom you have full confidence; and you, Hys­ <lb/>
            taspes," added lie, " go round among my friends, tell them that <lb/>
            I am in want of money for a certain object, (and, in reality, I <lb/>
            am in want of some,) and bid them supply me with as much <lb/>
            as they respectively can, writing down the sum, sealing up <lb/>
            the writing, and giving it to Crœsus's officer to bring to me." <lb/>
            17. Then, writing down what he had said, and sealing it, he <lb/>
            gave it to Hystaspes to carry to his friends, adding in the <lb/>
            letter to them all, " That they should receive Hystaspes as his <lb/>
            friend." After he had gone round, and Crœsus's officer <lb/>
            brought the letters, Hystaspes said, " 0 Cyrus, my king, you <lb/>
            must now treat me as a rich man, for I come to you with <lb/>
            many gifts in consequence of your letter." is. " This, then," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, "is one treasury for me,1 Crœsus; but look over <lb/>
            the others, and count up what money is ready for me, if I <lb/>
            want to use it." Crœsus, upon calculation, is said to have <lb/>
            found many times the sum that he told Cyrus he might now <lb/>
            have had in his treasury, if he had hoarded. 19. Such being <lb/>
            plainly the case, Cyrus is reported to have said,</p>
          <p>" You see, Crœsus, that I have my treasures too; but you <lb/>
            bid me hoard them up in my own possession, to be envied and <lb/>
            hated for them, and to set hired guards over them, and trust <lb/>
            in them; but by making my friends rich, I consider them as <lb/>
            my treasures, and as guards both to myself and to all things of <lb/>
            value that belong to us, and more trust-worthy ones than if I <lb/>
            were to appoint a guard of hirelings. 20. I will also tell you <lb/>
            another thing; I am not able to get the better of that passion <lb/>
            which the gods have put into the minds of men, and thus <lb/>
            made them all equally poor, but am, like other men, insatiably <lb/>
            desirous of wealth ; 21. I seem, however, to differ from most men <lb/>
            in this respect; that they, when they have acquired more goods <lb/>
            than are sufficient for them, bury some of them in the ground, <lb/>
            allow some to go to decay, and take great trouble about other <lb/>
            portions, counting, measuring, weighing, airing, and watch­ <lb/>
            ing them, and yet, though they have so many things in their <lb/>
            houses, they neither eat more than they are able to bear, for <lb/>
            they would then burst, nor put on more clothes than they can <lb/>
            bear, for they would then be suffocated, but have all their super­ <lb/>
            fluous riches only as so much trouble; 22. whereas, I serve the <note type="footnote"> 1 Meaning Hystaspes. </note> <pb n="248"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII </note> <lb/>
            gods, and am very desirous of getting more; but, when I <lb/>
            have got it, whatever I find to be more than suffices me, I <lb/>
            satisfy the wants of my friends with it, and, by enriching and <lb/>
            benefiting other men with it, I gain their good-will and their <lb/>
            friendship, from which I enjoy security and glory, things that <lb/>
            do not decay, and do not injure by over-abundance; but <lb/>
            glory, the more of it there is, the greater and more noble is it, <lb/>
            and the lighter to bear, and it often makes those that bear it <lb/>
            lighter. 23. That you may be convinced of this, Crœsus," <lb/>
            said he, " I do not consider those who possess most, and keep <lb/>
            guard over most, to be the happiest men; for then guards <lb/>
            upon the walls would be the happiest of all men, since they <lb/>
            have the custody of all that there is in whole cities ; but I count <lb/>
            him the happiest man, who acquires the most with strict re­ <lb/>
            gard to justice, and who uses the most with honour." Such <lb/>
            maxims he evidently practised, in conformity with his words.</p>
          <p>24. Having, besides, observed that most men, if they enjoy <lb/>
            uninterrupted health, take care to have everything in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with it, and lay up what is adapted for the course of life <lb/>
            of men in health, while he saw that they were by no means <lb/>
            solicitous how they should have necessaries if they fell sick, <lb/>
            he thought proper to provide himself with such matters also, <lb/>
            and collected round him, through willingness to bear the ex­ <lb/>
            pense, the very best physicians; and whatever instruments, <lb/>
            medicines, meats, or drinks, any one of them told him would <lb/>
            be of use, there was not one of them that he did not provide <lb/>
            for himself, and treasure up. 25. And when any of those, of <lb/>
            whom it was proper for him to take care, fell ill, he went to <lb/>
            see them, and furnished them with whatever they wanted; <lb/>
            and was thankful to the physicians whenever they wrought a <lb/>
            cure on any one, and took the things with which they effected <lb/>
            it from his store.1 26. These and many other such methods <lb/>
            did he contrive, in order to gain the principal place in the <lb/>
            affections of those by whom he desired to be beloved.</p>
          <p>The things, also, in which he appointed games, and offered <lb/>
            prizes, from a desire to raise an emulation in men with regard <lb/>
            to noble and beneficial objects, gained Cyrus the applause of <lb/>
            being solicitous that what was honourable should be kept in <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_84_fig7.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="249"/>
              <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] <lb/>
              </note>practice. These games indeed created among the nobles a <lb/>
              mutual strife and emulation; 27. and besides, Cyrus establish­ <lb/>
              ed as a law, that in whatever required adjudication, whether <lb/>
              it were a matter of right, or a dispute relating to games, the <lb/>
              parties requiring such decision should have joint recourse to <lb/>
              certain judges ; and it is plain that both the parties at vari­ <lb/>
              ance would aim at obtaining such judges as were the best, and <lb/>
              most friendly to them; and that he who lost his cause would <lb/>
              envy him that gained it, and hate the judges that did not pro­ <lb/>
              nounce in favour of himself; while he that gained his cause <lb/>
              would attribute his success to the justice of it, so that he <lb/>
              would consider he owed nobody any thanks. 28. Those, too, <lb/>
              who wished to have the first place in the friendship of Cyrus, <lb/>
              were, like others in cities, envious of each other, so that most <lb/>
              of them rather wished one another out of the way, than sought <lb/>
              to act in concert together for any good to each other. These <lb/>
              things make it evident by what'means he made all the emi­ <lb/>
              nent men more friendly towards himself than they were to­ <lb/>
              wards one another.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Procession of Cyrus to sacrifice at the temples. The sacrifices followed by <lb/>
            equestrian games. Conversation on riches between Pheraulas and a poor <lb/>
            Sacian, to whom Pheraulas gives all that he had, except what was just <lb/>
            sufficient to procure him food and apparel.</p>
          <p>1. BUT we shall now relate how Cyrus, for the first time, <lb/>
            marched in procession out of the palace; for the majesty of <lb/>
            this procession seems to me to have been one of those arts that <lb/>
            made his government not to be despised. In the first place, <lb/>
            then, before he commenced the procession, he summoned to <lb/>
            him those, both of the Persians and his other allies, that held <lb/>
            commands, and distributed to them Median robes ; and it was <lb/>
            then that the Persians first put on the Median robe. After <lb/>
            distributing these, he told them, that he intended to march in <lb/>
            procession to those portions of ground that had been set apart <lb/>
            for the gods, and to offer a sacrifice, accompanied by them. <lb/>
            2. “ Be present, therefore," said lie, " at the gates, before the <lb/>
            rising of the sun, dressed in these robes, and form yourselves <pb n="250"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            as Pheraulas the Persian shall give you directions from me ; <lb/>
            and, when I lead the way, follow in the places assigned you. <lb/>
            But if it shall appear to any of you that we may march in a <lb/>
            better order than that in which we shall now go, let him in­ <lb/>
            form me as soon as we return, for we ought to dispose every­ <lb/>
            thing as may appear to you to be most becoming and eligible." <lb/>
            3. When he had distributed the finest robes to the greatest <lb/>
            men, he produced other Median robes ; for he had provided <lb/>
            them in great numbers, and was sparing neither in purple <lb/>
            habits, nor in those of a murrey colour, nor in scarlet, nor <lb/>
            in dark red. Having distributed a certain number of these <lb/>
            to each of the commanders, he bid them adorn their friends <lb/>
            with them, “ as I," said he, " adorn you." 4. One of those <lb/>
            that were present then asked him, "But when will you, <lb/>
            Cyrus, adorn yourself?" " Do I not appear to you," replied <lb/>
            he, “ already adorned in adorning you ? Certainly," added <lb/>
            he, " if I am but able to serve my friends, whatever robe I <lb/>
            wear, I shall appear graceful in it." 5. They accordingly <lb/>
            went away, and, sending for their friends, adorned them with <lb/>
            the robes.</p>
          <p>Cyrus, regarding Pheraulas, one of the inferior class of <lb/>
            people, as a man of good understanding, a lover of beauty and <lb/>
            order, and not negligent in trying to please him, (the same <lb/>
            that had formerly spoken for every one being rewarded ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his desert,) sent for him, and consulted with him <lb/>
            how he might make this procession most pleasing in the eyes of <lb/>
            their friends, and most intimidating to such as were disaffected.</p>
          <p>6. And when, after consideration, they came to the same con­ <lb/>
            clusion, he ordered Pheraulas to take care that the procession <lb/>
            should be made, the next morning, in the manner on which <lb/>
            they .had decided as most eligible. " I have directed every <lb/>
            one," said he, “ to obey you as to his place in the procession ; <lb/>
            and that they may attend to your directions the more cheer­ <lb/>
            fully, take these coats," said he, " and carry them to the com­ <lb/>
            manders of the guards; give these riding cloaks1 to the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κασα̃ς</foreign>.] In giving this word the sense of saga militum equestria, <lb/>

            a passage of Agatharchides in Photius's Bibl. p. 445. Fischer, how­ <lb/>

            officers of the cavalry, and these other coats to the commanders <lb/>
            of the chariots." 7. He accordingly took them and carried <lb/>
            them off. When the commanding officers saw him, they said <lb/>
            to him, "You are a great man, Pheraulas, since you are to <lb/>
            order us what we must do." "Not only so, by Jupiter, as it <lb/>
            appears," said Pheraulas, “ but I am to be a baggage-bearer <lb/>
            too: at least I now bring you these two cloaks, one for your­ <lb/>
            self, the other for some one else; but take which of them you <lb/>
            please." 8. He that received the cloak in consequence forgot <lb/>
            his envy, and immediately consulted him which he should <lb/>
            take. Pheraulas, giving his opinion which was the best, <lb/>
            added, "If ever you accuse me of having given you your <lb/>
            choice, you shall find me, when I officiate again, a different <lb/>
            sort of manager ;”1 and, having made his distribution as he was <lb/>
            ordered, he immediately gave his attention to the affairs of the <lb/>
            procession, that everything might be arranged in the best <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>9. On the morrow, everything was fairly arranged before <lb/>
            day-light; there were rows of troops standing on each side of <lb/>
            the way, as they yet stand at this day, wherever the king is to <lb/>
            ride forth ; and within these rows none but men of high rank <lb/>
            are allowed to come; and there were men posted with scourges <lb/>
            in their hands, who struck any that made a disturbance. There <lb/>
            stood in front, before the gates, four thousand of the guards <lb/>
            drawn up four deep ; and two thousand on each side of the <lb/>
            gates. 10. The cavalry also were in attendance, having <lb/>
            alighted from' their horses, and with their hands passed <lb/>
            through their robes, as they still pass them at this day when <lb/>
            the king takes a view of them. The Persians stood on the <lb/>
            right hand, and the other allies on the left hand side of the <lb/>
            way. The chariots, in the same manner, stood half of them <lb/>
            on each side. 11. When the gates of the palace were thrown <lb/>
            open, there were first led forth some very beautiful bulls, four <lb/>
            abreast, consecrated to Jupiter, and such of the other gods as <lb/>
            the Magi directed ; for the Persians think that they ought to <note type="footnote"> in that notion by the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφιππίους</foreign>, which, he says, " will then <lb/>
            have its proper signification." But surely <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφιππίους</foreign>,may be under­ <lb/>

            led for a sacrifice to the sun. After these was led forth a <lb/>
            chariot with white horses, with golden yokes on their necks; <lb/>
            crowned,2 and sacred to Jupiter; and after this another <lb/>
            chariot with white horses, crowned like the preceding. After <lb/>
            this a third chariot was led forth, its horses adorned with <lb/>
            scarlet coverings, and behind it followed men carrying fire3 <lb/>
            upon a large altar. 13. After these Cyrus himself made his <lb/>
            appearance in his chariot from the gates, with his tiara up­ <lb/>
            right on his head,4 and a vest of a purple colour, half mixed <lb/>
            with white, (this mixture of white none else is allowed to <lb/>
            wear;) and having on his legs loose trousers of a scarlet <lb/>
            colour, and a robe wholly purple. He had also a band about <lb/>
            his turban; and his relatives had likewise this mark of dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, and retain it to this day. 14. His hands he kept out <lb/>
            of their coverings.5 With him rode his driver, a tall man, but <lb/>
            shorter than himself, whether in reality, or from whatever <lb/>
            cause, but Cyrus certainly appeared much the taller. All the <lb/>
            people, on seeing him, paid adoration, either from some hav­ <lb/>
            ing been before appointed to begin it, or from being struck <lb/>
            with the pomp, and thinking that Cyrus appeared exceedingly <lb/>
            tall and handsome; but no Persian ever paid Cyrus adoration <lb/>
            before. 15. When the chariot of Cyrus advanced, the four <lb/>
            thousand guards preceded it, and the two thousand6 attended <lb/>
            on each side of it. The wand-bearers7 about his person fol- <note type="footnote"> 1 "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρμα λευκὸν χϱυσόζυγον</foreign>.] Currus, cujus equorum cervicibus juga <lb/>

            were led the horses kepi for Cyrus himself, with bits of gold, <lb/>
            covered with striped cloths, in number about two hundred. <lb/>
            Next to these marched two thousand spear-men; next to these <lb/>

            Median cavalry; after these the Armenian ; then the Hyr­ <lb/>
            canian ; then the Caducian ; then the Sacian. Behind the <lb/>
            cavalry went the chariots, ranged four abreast; and Arta­ <lb/>
            bates, a Persian, had the command of them.</p>
          <p>19. As he marched along, abundance of people, outside of <lb/>
            the lines of soldiers,2 attended him, petitioning Cyrus about <lb/>
            different matters. Sending to them, therefore, some of the <lb/>
            wand-bearers who attended him, three on each side of his <lb/>
            chariot, for the very purpose of delivering messages, he bid <lb/>
            them tell them, " That if any of them wanted anything of <lb/>
            him, they should make known to some of the cavalry officers <lb/>
            what they required, and they," he said, " would communicate <lb/>
            it to him." They immediately drew back, and went to the <lb/>
            horsemen, and consulted to which of them they should sever­ <lb/>
            ally apply. 20. But Cyrus, sending to those of his friends to <lb/>
            whom lie wished the greatest court to be paid by the public, <lb/>
            called them severally to him, and said to them, " If any of <lb/>
            those that follow by my side communicate anything to you, <lb/>
            give no attention to any one that appears to you to say nothing <lb/>
            of importance, but whoever seems to desire what is just, give <lb/>
            me information of it, that we may consult together, and settle <lb/>
            his business for him." 21. Others, when he called them, <note type="footnote"> I Oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τοι γενόμενοι</foreign>.] Those that were first organized. See iN,. <lb/>

            rode up with despatch, and obeyed, contributing to the sup­ <lb/>
            port of Cyrus's authority, and showing that they obeyed with <lb/>
            promptitude; but one Daipharnes, a man somewhat uncouth <lb/>
            in his manners, thought that, if he did not obey hastily, he <lb/>
            should appear more independent. 22. Cyrus accordingly per­ <lb/>
            ceiving this, sent one of the wand-bearers to him, before he came <lb/>
            up and spoke to him, bidding him tell Daipharnes, that he had <lb/>
            no more occasion for him ; and he never sent for him after­ <lb/>
            wards. 23. But as one who was called later, rode up to him <lb/>
            sooner than he, Cyrus gave him one of the horses that fol­ <lb/>
            lowed in his train, and ordered one of the eunuchs to conduct <lb/>
            the horse for him wherever he should direct. This appeared, to <lb/>
            those that saw it, to be a very great honour; and after this <lb/>
            many more people paid their court to this man.</p>
          <p>24. When they came to the sacred enclosures, they sacrificed <lb/>
            to Jupiter, and made a holocaust of the bulls; then to the <lb/>
            Still, and made a holocaust of the horses ; then sacrificing cer­ <lb/>
            tain victims to the Earth, they did with them as the Magi <lb/>
            directed. Afterwards they sacrificed to the heroes, the guar­ <lb/>
            dians of Syria.</p>
          <p>25. After this, the country thereabouts being very fine, he <lb/>
            marked out a piece of ground of about five stadia, and told <lb/>
            them, nation by nation, to put their horses to their speed. <lb/>
            He himself rode with the Persians, and had greatly the superi­ <lb/>
            ority, for he had given great attention to horsemanship. Of <lb/>
            the Medes, Artabates had the best; for Cyrus had given him <lb/>
            a horse; of the Syrians, their commander; of the Armenians, <lb/>
            Tigranes; of the Hyrcanians, the son of the commander <lb/>
            of the horse; of the Sacians, a private youth, with his horse, <lb/>
            left the other horses behind by almost half the course.</p>
          <p>26. Cyrus is then said to have asked the young man, if he <lb/>
            could accept of a kingdom in exchange for his horse ? and the <lb/>
            young man is said to have replied, "I would not accept a <lb/>
            kingdom for him, but I would consent to gain a worthy <lb/>
            man's favour for him." 27. " Come then," said Cyrus, "and <lb/>
            I will show you where, if you throw even with your eyes <lb/>
            shut, you will not miss a worthy man." " Show me then, by <lb/>
            all means," said the Sacian, " for I shall throw with this clod, <lb/>
            taking one up. 28. Cyrus then pointed to a place where a <lb/>
            great many of his friends were collected, and the man, shut­ <lb/>
            ting his eyes, threw his clod, and hit Pheraulas who was <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            riding by; for Pheraulas happened then to be despatched with <lb/>
            some orders from Cyrus, and, when he was struck, did not <lb/>
            even turn aside, but went forward upon the business with <lb/>
            which he was commissioned. 29. The Sacian, on opening his <lb/>
            eyes, asked whom he had hit. " None, by Jove," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            " of those that are present." " But surely," rejoined the young <lb/>
            man, “ it was none of those that are absent." " Yes, indeed," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, " you hit that man who is riding on at full speed <lb/>
            yonder by the chariots." so. " And how is it that he does <lb/>
            not turn back?" said he. "It is some madman," replied <lb/>
            Cyrus, " as it appears." The young man, hearing this, went <lb/>
            off to see who it was, and found Pheraulas with his chin <lb/>
            covered with dirt and blood, for the blood had gushed from his <lb/>
            nose when he was struck. 31. When the young man came <lb/>
            up with him, he asked him, " Whether he had received a <lb/>
            blow?" Pheraulas answered, " Yes, as you see." "I make <lb/>
            you a present, then," said the young man, " of this horse." <lb/>
            Pheraulas asked, "For what?" When the Sacian gave him <lb/>
            an account of the matter, and, in conclusion, added, " And I <lb/>
            believe I have not failed to hit a worthy man," 32. Phe­ <lb/>
            raulas rejoined, " But if you had been wise, you would have <lb/>
            given it to !i richer man than I am; but I now accept it, and <lb/>
            beseech the gods, who have caused me to be hit by you, to <lb/>
            grant that I may not make you repent of your present to me ; <lb/>
            and now," added he, “mount my horse, and ride off upon <lb/>
            him, and I will soon join you." Thus they separated.</p>
          <p>Amongst the Caducians, Rathonices had the superiority. <lb/>
            33. Cyrus also put the chariots severally to their speed; and <lb/>
            to all the victors he gave oxen and cups, that they might <lb/>
            sacrifice and feast. He himself took the ox that was his <lb/>
            prize, but his share of the cups he gave to Pheraulas, because <lb/>
            lie thought that he had arranged the procession from the <lb/>
            palace very happily.</p>
          <p>34. This mode of procession, then settled by Cyrus, con­ <lb/>
            tinues to be the king's procession to this day, except that the <lb/>
            victims are omitted when he is not going to sacrifice. When <lb/>
            these ceremonies were at an end, they returned again to the <lb/>
            city, and those who had houses assigned them, quartered in <lb/>
            the houses, and they that had not, in companies.</p>
          <p>35. Pheraulas, inviting the Sacian that presented him with <lb/>
            the horse, not only entertained him with other things in abund- <pb n="256"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            anie, but, after they had supped, filled the cups that he had <lb/>
            received from Cyrus, drank to him, and made him a present <lb/>
            of them. 36. The Sacian, observing a great many fine cover­ <lb/>
            ings for couches, a great deal of fine furniture, and a large <lb/>
            number of domestics, "Tell me," said he, "Pheraulas, were <lb/>
            you one of the rich men when you were at home?" 37. <lb/>
            What sort of rich men do you mean?" said Pheraulas: <lb/>
            "I was one of those that lived directly by the work of their <lb/>
            own hands; for my father, maintaining me but poorly by his <lb/>
            own labour, bred me up in the discipline of the boys; but, <lb/>
            when I became a youth, not being able to maintain me in <lb/>
            idleness, he took me into the country, and ordered me to work. <lb/>
            38. Here I maintained him in return, as long as he lived, <lb/>
            digging and sowing, with my own hands, a little piece of land, <lb/>
            not indeed an ungrateful one, but the most just in the world ; <lb/>
            for the seed that it received it returned me handsomely and <lb/>
            justly with interest, though not very great; yet sometimes, <lb/>
            out of its generosity, it gave me back double of what it re­ <lb/>
            ceived. Thus I lived at home: but now Cyrus has given <lb/>
            me all these things that you see." 39. The Sacian then said, <lb/>
            "Happy are you, as well in other respects as in this, that, <lb/>
            from being poor, you have become rich ! for I think that you <lb/>
            must possess your riches with the more pleasure, as you have <lb/>
            become rich after having earnestly longed for riches." 40. <lb/>
            Pheraulas replied, "And do you think, Sacian, that I live <lb/>
            with the more pleasure the more I possess ? Do you not <lb/>
            know," said he, " that I neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, with <lb/>
            a particle more pleasure now than when I was poor ? But, <lb/>
            by having this abundance, I gain merely this, that I have to <lb/>
            guard more, to distribute more to others, and to have the <lb/>
            trouble of taking care of more; 41. for a great many domes­ <lb/>
            tics now demand of me their food, their drink, and their <lb/>
            clothes ; some are in want of physicians ; one comes and brings <lb/>
            me sheep that have been torn by wolves, or oxen killed by <lb/>
            falling over a precipice, or tells me of a distemper that has fall­ <lb/>
            en on the cattle : so that I seem to myself," said Pheraulas, “in <lb/>
            possessing abundance, to have more afflictions thUD I had before <lb/>
            in possessing but little." 42. "But certainly," said the Sacian, <lb/>
            “ when all is well, you have, in seeing your numerous posses <note type="footnote"> 1 For even the poor, who are content with their lot, may be called <lb/>
            rich. Fischer. </note> <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            sions, many times more pleasure than I." Pheraulas replied, "It <lb/>
            is not so pleasant, Sacian, to possess riches, as it is annoying <lb/>
            to lose them; and you will find that what I say is true; for <lb/>
            none of those that possess riches are forced to lose their rest <lb/>
            by the pleasure attending them; but of those that lose them, <lb/>
            you will see none that are able to sleep for concern." 43. <lb/>
            " No, by Jupiter," said the Sacian, " nor will you see any of <lb/>
            those that are obtaining wealth able to sleep for pleasure." <lb/>
            44. " You say the truth," said Pheraulas, " for if to possess <lb/>
            riches were as pleasant as to obtain them, the rich would very <lb/>
            much exceed the poor in happiness. But, Sacian," continued <lb/>
            he, "it is obligatory on him that possesses abundance to ex­ <lb/>
            pend abundance, both on the gods, on his friends, and on <lb/>
            strangers. Whoever, therefore, is greatly pleased with the <lb/>
            possession of riches, will, be assured, feel much annoyed at <lb/>
            the expenditure of them." 45. " By Jupiter," said the Sa­ <lb/>
            cian, " I am not one of those ; but I think it a happiness for <lb/>
            a man having abundance to spend abundance." 46. " Why, <lb/>
            then," said Pheraulas, " in the name of all the gods, do you <lb/>
            not, this instant, become happy, and make me also happy? <lb/>
            For take all these things, keep them, and use them as you <lb/>
            please; maintain me only as a stranger, or yet more sparingly <lb/>
            than a stranger ; since it will be enough for me to share with <lb/>
            you in what you have." "You jest," said the Sacian. 47. <lb/>
            Pheraulas asserted, with an oath, that he spoke seriously. <lb/>
            " I will also obtain you, Sacian, something more from Cyrus: <lb/>
            namely, that you shall not attend at his doors, or go with him <lb/>
            to the field, but that you shall stay at home in the midst of <lb/>
            your riches. My present proposal I will carry into effect for <lb/>
            your sake and my own ; and, if I gain any additional property <lb/>
            by my attendance upon Cyrus, or by any military expedition, <lb/>
            I will bring it to you, that you may still have the command of <lb/>
            more ; only do you," said he, "free me from this care; for, if I <lb/>
            can but have leisure from these occupations, I think that you <lb/>
            will be of service in many ways both to me and to Cyrus." 48. <lb/>
            After thus conversing, they made an arrangement accordingly, <lb/>
            and carried it into effect. The one thought himself made happy <lb/>
            by having the command of great riches, and the other esteemed <note type="footnote"> 1 Something in addition to the oxen and cups which the Sacian <lb/>
            had already received from Cyrus. Fischer. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            himself the most fortunate of all men, inasmuch as he should <lb/>
            have a steward who would secure him leisure to do whatever <lb/>
            was agreeable to him.</p>
          <p>49. The disposition of Pheraulas was very companionable, <lb/>
            and nothing appeared to him so pleasing or profitable, to be­ <lb/>
            stow attention upon, as mankind; for man, he thought, was <lb/>
            of all creatures the best and most grateful; because he saw <lb/>
            that those who were commended by any one, readily gave <lb/>
            commendation in return; that they strove to do kindness to <lb/>
            such as had done kindnesses to them ; that they were benevo­ <lb/>
            lently disposed towards those whom they knew to be benevo­ <lb/>
            lently disposed towards them ; that they could not hate those <lb/>
            whom they knew to feel love for them; and that they were <lb/>
            much more inclined than any other creatures to pay a tribute <lb/>
            of respect to their parents, both while living and after death. <lb/>
            All other animals he regarded as more ungrateful and less <lb/>
            mindful of kindnesses than man. 50. Thus Pheraulas was <lb/>
            greatly delighted, that, by being freed from the care of other <lb/>
            possessions, he should be at liberty to attend to his friends; and <lb/>
            the Sacian was greatly delighted, because he was to have much <lb/>
            and to spend much. The Sacian loved Pheraulas, because he <lb/>
            was always bringing him something; and Pheraulas loved the <lb/>
            Sacian, because he was willing to take all; and because, <lb/>
            though he had the charge of more and more, he yet gave him <lb/>
            no additional trouble. Thus did these two men live.</p>

            sit down, but attended; but when they were alone, he supped <lb/>
            with him; for he was pleased with his conversation ; and, in <lb/>
            return, Gadatas was honoured with many valuable presents, <lb/>
            both by Cyrus himself, and by others upon Cyrus's account.</p>
          <p>3. When those who were invited to supper came, he did <lb/>
            not make every one sit down where he chanced to be, but the <lb/>
            man that he most esteemed he placed upon his left hand, as <lb/>
            if this side were more exposed to treacherous designs than the <lb/>
            right. The next in his esteem he placed upon the right hand; <lb/>
            the third again upon his left, and the fourth upon his right; <lb/>
            and, if there were more, he proceeded in the same manner. <lb/>
            4. He thought it right that it should be shown how far he <lb/>
            esteemed every one; because, where men think that he who <lb/>
            excels others will neither have his praises published, nor <lb/>
            receive rewards, it is plain that they feel no emulation with <lb/>
            respect to each other; but where he that excels is seen to <lb/>
            have some advantage, there all appear to contend with the ut­ <lb/>
            most zeal. 5. Thus Cyrus made those known that were <lb/>
            highest in his esteem; beginning first with their place, as <lb/>
            they sat or stood by him. Yet this appointed place of sitting <lb/>
            he did not make perpetual, but made it a rule, that a man <lb/>
            might advance, by honourable conduct, to a more honourable <lb/>
            seat; or, if he grew negligent of his duties, might sink down <lb/>
            to a less honourable. Cyrus also felt ashamed if he who had <lb/>
            the principal seat, did not appear to have received the greatest <lb/>
            number of valuable things at his hand. These practices, <lb/>
            that were established in the time of Cyrus, we find constantly <lb/>
            observed to the present day.</p>
          <p>6. When they were at supper, it did not seem at all <lb/>
            wonderful to Gobryas, that everything should be in great <lb/>
            abundance with a man who had the command of many; <lb/>
            but that Cyrus, who had achieved such great exploits, <lb/>
            should, if he found that he had got anything delicate, con­ <lb/>
            sume no portion of it alone, but take the trouble of requesting <lb/>
            those who were present to share it, appeared very striking; <lb/>
            and frequently he saw him send to some of his absent friends <lb/>
            such things as he happened to be pleased with himself; 7. <note type="footnote">s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            so that after they had supped, and Cyrus had sent away from <lb/>
            his table all that plenty that was upon it, Gobryas said, " Hi­ <lb/>
            therto, Cyrus, I thought that you most excelled other men in <lb/>
            being most skilful in commanding an army; but now, I swear <lb/>
            by the gods that I think you excel more in benevolence than <lb/>
            in generalship." 8. " By Jupiter," said Cyrus, “I have much <lb/>
            more pleasure in showing deeds of kindness than of military <lb/>
            skill." " How so ? " said Gobryas. " Because," said he, “ I <lb/>
            must show the one by doing mischief to men, and the other by <lb/>
            doing them good."</p>
          <p>9. Afterwards, when they had drunk a little, Hystaspes put <lb/>
            this question to Cyrus: “Would you be offended, Cyrus," <lb/>
            said he, " if I should ask you something that I am desirous to <lb/>
            learn from you?" " No, by the gods," said Cyrus; " on the <lb/>
            contrary, I should feel displeased if I found that you did not <lb/>
            mention what you wish to ask." " Tell me, then," said he <lb/>
            " when you have called me, did I ever refuse to come ?" <lb/>
            " Do not talk foolishly," said Cyrus. " Or when I obeyed <lb/>
            you, did I ever obey slowly?" " Certainly not." " Have I <lb/>
            ever neglected to do anything that you have ordered me ? ” <lb/>
            " I accuse you of nothing of the kind," said Cyrus. " And, <lb/>
            as to what I have done, have you ever accused me of having <lb/>
            done anything otherwise than with alacrity and pleasure ? ” <lb/>
            " That," said Cyrus, "least of all." 10. “In the name of all <lb/>
            the gods, then, Cyrus," said he, " on what account is it, that <lb/>
            you have written down1 Chrysantas as to be placed in a <lb/>
            more honourable seat than myself?" "Shall I tell you?" <lb/>
            said Cyrus. " By all means," said he. “ And you will not <lb/>
            be offended with me when you hear the truth ?" 11. No, I <lb/>
            shall be pleased," said he, " if I find that I am not wronged." <lb/>
            " Then," said he, " Chrysantas here, in the first place, never <lb/>
            waited my call, but, before he was called, was ready for my <lb/>
            service; and he then did, not only what he was ordered, but <lb/>
            whatever he himself thought best for us to be done. When it <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἔγϱαψας</foreign>.] Hystaspes uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">γϱάφειν</foreign> in jest, as if Cyrus <lb/>
            had made written laws, appointing each guest his proper seat. Others <lb/>
            however think that a list of the guests had previously been given to <lb/>
            Gadatas with their names in the order in which they were to sit. <lb/>
            But no allusion is made to any such list at the beginning of the <lb/>
            chapter; and, from sect. 1 and 2, it rather appears that Cyrus as­ <lb/>
            signed the guests their places when they took their seats. Borne­ <lb/>

            was necessary to say anything to our allies, he suggested to <lb/>
            me what he thought was proper for me to say ; and what he <lb/>
            saw that I wished our allies to know, but was ashamed to say <lb/>
            concerning myself, he stood forward to express as his own <lb/>
            opinion.1 So that, in regard to such matters, what hinders <lb/>
            him from being esteemed of more use to me, even than my­ <lb/>
            self? As to himself, he always says that whatever he has is <lb/>
            sufficient for him; but for me he is always to be seen look­ <lb/>
            ing out, to find what acquisition may be of service to me ; <lb/>
            and at any good fortune that befalls me, he is much more <lb/>
            delighted and pleased than myself." 12. To this Hystaspes <lb/>
            replied, " By Juno, Cyrus, I am pleased that I have asked <lb/>
            you these things." " On what account, chiefly ? " said Cyrus. <lb/>
            " Because I also will endeavour to practise them. Only there <lb/>
            is one thing," said he, " that I do not know; and that is, how <lb/>
            I must make it evident that I rejoice at your good fortune, <lb/>
            whether I must clap my hands, or laugh, or what I must do ?” <lb/>
            Artabazus upon this said, "You must dance the Persian <lb/>
            dance ;”2 a remark at which a laugh arose.</p>
          <p>is. As the entertainment proceeded, Cyrus put this ques­ <lb/>
            tion to Gobryas: " Tell me," said he, " Gobryas, do you think <lb/>
            that you should give your daughter to one of the present com­ <lb/>
            pany now, with more pleasure than when you first became ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with us?" " Shall I then speak the truth?" said <lb/>
            Gobryas. " Yes, by Jupiter," said Cyrus, "since no question <lb/>
            requires a false answer." " Be assured then," said he, " that <lb/>
            I should give her with much more pleasure now." " And <lb/>
            can you tell why?" said Cyrus. "I can." "Tell me then." <lb/>
            14. " Because I then saw them bearing toils and dangers with <lb/>
            alacrity; but I now see them bearing prosperity with discre­ <lb/>
            tion. And to me, Cyrus, it appears more difficult to find a <lb/>
            man that bears prosperity well, than one that bears adversity <lb/>
            well; for prosperity creates presumption in most men, but <lb/>
            adversity brings sobriety to all." 15. Cyrus then said, " Do <note type="footnote"> 1 Alluding especially to the speeches of Chrysantas given ii. 2. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            you hear, Hystaspes, this saying of Gobryas?" "Yes, by <lb/>
            Jove," said he, " I do ; and, if he utter many such, he shall <lb/>
            much sooner have me as a suitor for his daughter, than if he <lb/>
            were to show me a great number of cups." 16. " Indeed," <lb/>
            said Gobryas, "I have a great many such in writing;1 which <lb/>
            I shall not grudge you, if you take my daughter for a wife ; <lb/>
            but my cups," said he, " since you seem not to like them, I <lb/>
            do not know but I shall give to Chrysantas here, especially <lb/>
            since he has stolen your seat from you."</p>
          <p>17. “Well,” said Cyrus, " if you, Hystaspes, and any of <lb/>
            the rest that are here, will acquaint me when any one of you <lb/>
            is seeking a wife, you will then find what sort of a helper I <lb/>
            shall be to you." is. But if a man wishes to dispose of a <lb/>
            daughter," said Gobryas, " to whom must one tell it ?” “ To <lb/>
            me also," said Cyrus; “ for I am a very extraordinary <lb/>
            man in this art." "What art?" said Chrysantas. 19. <lb/>
            " That of knowing what match will suit each particular man.” <lb/>
            “In the name of all the gods, then," said Chrysantas, c'tell <lb/>
            me what wife you think will best suit me." 20. " In the first <lb/>
            place," said Cyrus, " she must be short; for you are short <lb/>
            yourself; and if you marry a tall wife, and would ever kiss <lb/>
            her when she is standing, you must leap up like a little dog." <lb/>
            " You very properly take thought as to this particular," said <lb/>
            Chrysantas, " for I am by no means a good jumper." 21. <lb/>
            “ In addition," said Cyrus, " one that is very flat-nosed would <lb/>
            suit you." " Why should that be the case?" "Because," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, "you have a prominent nose, and prominency <lb/>
            would best suit flatness." " Do you say, then, that a fasting <lb/>
            wife would best suit one that has feasted plentifully, as I have <lb/>
            now?" "Yes, by Jove," said Cyrus, "for the stomachs of <lb/>
            the full are prominent, and those of the fasting are flat." 22. <lb/>
            " But, in the name of all the gods," said Chrysantas, " can you <lb/>
            tell what wife will suit a cold king ?"2 At this Cyrus burst <lb/>
            into a laugh, as did also the others. While they were laugh- <note type="footnote"> I See sect. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψυχϱῳ̃</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλε</foreign>ĩ.] There is an ambiguity in the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχϱός</foreign>, <lb/>
            which may be applied either to one who makes frigid jokes, or to <lb/>
            one who is averse to love or marriage; for Cyrus, who was so ready <lb/>
            to give wives to others, had not yet taken one himself. The answer <lb/>
            to be expected to Chrysantas's question was, " A warm one;" <lb/>
            hence the laugh which followed it. Bornemann. </note> <pb n="263"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            ing, Hystaspes said, 23. " Of all that belongs to your royal <lb/>
            dignity, Cyrus, I envy you most for this." "For what?" <lb/>
            said Cyrus. " That though cold,' you can excite laughter." <lb/>
            “ And would not you give a great deal, then," said Cyrus, <lb/>
            " that these things had been said by you, and that it should be <lb/>
            told to her, by whom you wish to be held in esteem, that you <lb/>
            are a facetious man ?" Such were the jests that passed among <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>24. Soon after, Cyrus produced a woman's attire for Ti­ <lb/>
            granes, and bid him give it his wife, because she bravely <lb/>
            attended her husband in the field. To Artabazus he gave a <lb/>
            golden cup; to the Hyrcanian, a horse; and many other <lb/>
            noble presents he bestowed. " But to you, Gobryas," said he, <lb/>
            " I will give a husband for your daughter." 25. " And shall <lb/>
            not I," said Hystaspes, " be the husband that you will give, that <lb/>
            I may get those writings ?"2 “ Have you fortune enough," <lb/>
            said Cyrus, "to match that of the girl?" “Yes, by Jove,' <lb/>
            said he, " I have a fortune worth several times as much <lb/>
            as hers." “ And where," asked Cyrus, " is this fortune of <lb/>
            yours?" “ There," replied Hystaspes, "where you, who are <lb/>
            my friend, are sitting." " That is sufficient for me," said <lb/>
            Gobryas; and, holding out his right hand at once, " Give <lb/>
            him to me, Cyrus," said he, " for I accept him." 26. Cyrus <lb/>
            then, taking the right hand of Hystaspes, presented it to <lb/>
            Gobryas, who took it. Immediately after, he made a great <lb/>
            many noble presents to Hystaspes, that he might send them to <lb/>
            the damsel. 27. And, drawing Chrysantas to him, he kissed <lb/>
            him ; when Artabazus said, “ By Jupiter, Cyrus, you have <lb/>
            not given me my cup of the same gold3 with the present <lb/>
            which you have made Chrysantas." " But I will give you <lb/>
            one of the same," said he. Hystaspes asked, "When?" <lb/>
            ‘ Thirty years hence," said he. " Be prepared for me, then," <lb/>
            said he, " as I intend to wait, and not to die before the time." <lb/>
            Thus the entertainment ended, and, when they rose, Cyrus <lb/>
            rose with them, and conducted them to the door.</p>
          <p>28. The next day he sent home all those of the allies that <note type="footnote"> I Even if you are to be considered cold, frigidus ad venerem, you <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            had voluntarily attended him, excepting such as desired to <lb/>
            settle near him, to whom he gave lands and houses, which <lb/>
            the descendants of those who then staid still possess ; they <lb/>
            were mostly Medes and Hyrcanians. To those that went <lb/>
            away, he gave many presents, and dismissed them, both <lb/>
            officers and soldiers, without giving them any cause to com­ <lb/>
            plain. 29. In the next place, he divided the treasure that he <lb/>
            had taken at Sardes among the soldiers that were about him. <lb/>
            To the commanders of ten thousand, and to the inferior of­ <lb/>
            ficers that were with him, he gave choice presents, according <lb/>
            to the merit of each. The rest he divided into portions, and <lb/>
            giving a share to each of the commanders of ten thousand, he <lb/>
            permitted them to distribute it in the same manner as he had <lb/>
            distributed to them. so. These other portions they accord­ <lb/>
            ingly distributed, each officer examining into the merits of the <lb/>
            officers under him ; and what remained at last, the captains of <lb/>
            five, inquiring into the merits of the private soldiers under <lb/>
            them, gave away according to the desert of each. Thus they <lb/>
            all received their just share.</p>
          <p>31. When they had received what was then given them, <lb/>
            some of them spoke of Cyrus in this manner: “ Surely he <lb/>
            has abundance, when he gives so much to each of us." <lb/>
            Others said, " What is the abundance that he has ? Cyrus's <lb/>
            disposition is not such that he should heap up treasure for <lb/>
            himself; but he is more pleased to give it away than to keep <lb/>
            it." 32. Cyrus, hearing of this talk, and the opinions formed <lb/>
            of him, called his friends and all the principal persons toge­ <lb/>
            ther, and spoke to this effect: " My friends, I have seen men <lb/>
            that were willing to be thought possessed of more than they <lb/>
            really had, and who expected, by that means, to appear the <lb/>
            more generous; but such persons seem to me drawn into <lb/>
            the very reverse of what they intend; for that a man should <lb/>
            seem to possess abundance, and yet should not appear to do <lb/>
            service to his friends in proportion to his substance, seems to <lb/>
            me to fix upon him the character of illiberality. 33. There <lb/>
            are some," continued he, " on the other hand, who wish that <lb/>
            what they have may be concealed; and those also appear to <lb/>
            me to be faulty to their friends; for frequently friends that <lb/>
            are in want do not tell their necessities to their companions, <lb/>
            from being ignorant of what they have, and are thus de­ <lb/>
            ceived. 34. But it is in my opinion, the part of a straight- <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            forward man to let his means be known, and strive to gain a <lb/>
            character for generosity according to them. I intend, there­ <lb/>
            fore," he added, " to show you all that is possible for you to <lb/>
            see of what I have ; and of what you cannot see, to give you <lb/>
            an account." 35. Having spoken thus, he showed them some <lb/>
            portions of many valuable treasures; and of others, laid <lb/>
            up so as not to be easily seen, he gave them an account; and, <lb/>
            in conclusion, said, 36. " All these things, my friends, you must <lb/>
            consider not more mine than yours; for I have collected them, <lb/>
            not that I may spend them myself, or that I may wear them <lb/>
            out; for I should not be able to do so; but that I may always <lb/>
            have something to give to him among you that achieves any­ <lb/>
            thing honourable, and that if any one of you feels in want of <lb/>
            anything, he may come to me and take what he happens <lb/>
            to need."</p>

          <p>Description of the march of Cyrus into Persia. Cyrus visits Cyaxares, who <lb/>
            offers him his daughter, with Media for her dowry. Agreement made <lb/>
            between Cyrus and the Persians, at the suggestion of Cambyses, respect­ <lb/>
            ing the tenure and administration of the kingdom of Persia. Cyrus <lb/>
            marries the daughter of Cyaxares.</p>
          <p>i. BUT when affairs in Babylon appeared to him so favour­ <lb/>
            ably settled, that he might absent himself from thence, he <lb/>
            prepared, and directed others to prepare, for a journey into <lb/>
            Persia. When he thought that he had enough of such things <lb/>
            as he was likely to want, he took his departure. 2. We shall <lb/>
            now give an account, how his army, though of such magni­ <lb/>
            tude, encamped, and resumed its march, in good order, and <lb/>
            how each part at once arranged itself in its proper place.</p>
          <p>Wherever the king encamps, those who are about his per­ <lb/>
            son occupy the ground under tents, both winter and summer. <lb/>
            3. Cyrus at once adopted the custom of pitching his own tent <lb/>
            fronting the east. He then directed, first, at what distance, <lb/>
            from the royal tent the guards should pitch theirs; and next <lb/>
            appointed the bakers their station on the right, and the cooks <lb/>
            their station on the left. For the horses,1 he appointed a place <note type="footnote"> 1 The horses that were used in conveying the baggage. </note><pb n="266"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            on the right, and for the other beasts of burden on the left. <lb/>
            The other parts of the army were so disposed, that each knew <lb/>
            its own ground both as to dimension and position. 4. When <lb/>
            they are to prepare for marching, each man packs up such <lb/>
            baggage as he is appointed to use, while others place it upon <lb/>
            the beasts of burden; so that all the baggage-carriers come <lb/>
            up, at the same time, to the baggage appointed them to carry, <lb/>
            and all, at the same time, place it, severally, upon their beasts. <lb/>
            So that the same time suffices for one and for all the tents to re­ <lb/>
            move. 5. The case is the same with regard to the pitching <lb/>
            of the tents. In order, too, that everything necessary may <lb/>
            be done at its proper time, it is appointed to each man, in <lb/>
            like manner, what he is to do; and, by this means, the same <lb/>
            time suffices for doing things in one part and in all. 6. And <lb/>
            as the attendants, that made ready the provisions, had each <lb/>
            his proper station, so they that carried arms had their stations <lb/>
            in the encampment suitable to the sort of arms which they <lb/>
            severally bore; they knew what their station was, and all <lb/>
            arranged themselves in it without hesitation. 7. For Cyrus <lb/>
            thought the proper arrangement of things an excellent prac­ <lb/>
            tice in a house; for when a person wants anything, it is <lb/>
            known whither he must go to get it; but the judicious ar­ <lb/>
            rangement of the several divisions of an army he esteemed a <lb/>
            much nobler thing, inasmuch as the occasions for using what <lb/>
            is wanted, in affairs of war, are more sudden, and the miscar­ <lb/>
            riages arising from such as are dilatory in them are of worse <lb/>
            consequence; and he saw that the most valuable advantages <lb/>
            in war arose from having all things ready for the occasion. <lb/>
            Upon these accounts, therefore, he paid the utmost attention <lb/>
            to propriety of arrangement.</p>
          <p>8. First, then, he located himself in the middle of the camp, <lb/>
            as being the most secure position; then those in whom he <lb/>
            chiefly confided, he had, according to his custom, immediately <lb/>
            about himself. Next to these, he had in a circle the horse­ <lb/>
            men and charioteers; 9. for he thought that a secure station <lb/>
            was necessary for these, because they are encamped without <lb/>
            having any of the arms in readiness with which they fight,1 <lb/>
            and require a considerable time to arm themselves, if they are <lb/>
            to act to any purpose. 10. To the right and left of himself <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare iii. 3. 26 ; vi. 4. 1 </note> <pb n="267"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            and the cavalry, was the station of the peltastu. The station <lb/>
            of the archers was before and behind himself and the horse­ <lb/>
            men. 11. The heavy-armed men, and such as had large <lb/>
            shields, he ranged in a circle round all, as a rampart, that, if <lb/>
            there should be occasion for the cavalry to equip themselves, <lb/>
            those who were best able to make a stand, being placed before <lb/>
            them, might secure them time to arm in safety. 12. As the <lb/>
            heavy-armed men slept in order around him, so did the pel­ <lb/>
            tasts and archers; in order that, if it should be necessary to <lb/>
            act in the night-time, as the heavy-armed men were prepared <lb/>
            to repel such as closed with them, so the archers and javelin- <lb/>
            men, if any attacked them, might promptly discharge their <lb/>
            javelins and arrows in defence of the heavy-armed. 13. All <lb/>
            the generals had ensigns on their tents; and as, in cities, <lb/>
            intelligent servants know the houses of most people, and <lb/>
            especially of the most respectable, so the inferior officers of <lb/>
            Cyrus knew the positions of the chief leaders in the camp, <lb/>
            and could distinguish the ensigns that belonged to each of <lb/>
            them; so that whomsoever Cyrus might want, they had not <lb/>
            to seek for him, but could run the shortest way to each of <lb/>
            them. 14. From the several divisions being kept distinct, too, <lb/>
            it was much more readily observed when any one was orderly, <lb/>
            and when any one failed to do what was ordered. Such an <lb/>
            arrangement being maintained, he was of opinion, that if any <lb/>
            body attacked him, whether by night or day, the assailant <lb/>
            would fall into his camp as into an ambuscade.</p>
          <p>15. He thought it a part of strategy, not only for a man to be <lb/>
            able to draw out a phalanx cleverly, or to increase its depth, <lb/>
            or to form the men from the wings in line,1 or to wheel round <lb/>
            skilfully if the enemy appeared on the right, the left, or the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐκ κέϱατος εἰς φάλαγγα καταστη̃σαι</foreign>.] Of this phrase none of the <lb/>
            commentators give any satisfactory explanation. Fischer suggests <lb/>
            that it may signify to lengthen the line, to extend it on the <lb/>
            wing; but it will then mean nothing more than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκτε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναι</foreign>, which pre­ <lb/>
            cedes : or that it may signify to take cavalry from the wings, and <lb/>
            range them among the light and heavy-armed Infantry ; but for <lb/>
            this interpretation the text affords no ground. Again, if we sup­ <lb/>
            pose that it means to take men from the wing, and place them in <lb/>
            the main body, it will be much the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαθὺναι</foreign>, which also pre­ <lb/>
            cedes. However, we must imagine that Xenophon meant the words <lb/>
            to be taken in some such signification as to unite the wing more <lb/>
            closely, by some manoeuvre, to the main body, or to incorporate it <lb/>
            with the main body. </note> <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            rear; but he thought it also a part of strategy to divide one <lb/>
            battalion into severall when it was necessary, to post each <lb/>
            division where it might be most of service, and to use de­ <lb/>
            spatch where it might be requisite to anticipate the enemy. <lb/>
            All these qualifications, and such as these, he considered to be <lb/>
            necessary in a skilful tactician; and he paid equal attention <lb/>
            to them all. On the march, he proceeded in such order as <lb/>
            was adapted to circumstances ; but in pitching his camp, he <lb/>
            disposed his troops, for the most part, as has been described.</p>
          <p>17. When, in the course of their march, they came to Media, <lb/>
            Cyrus turned aside to visit Cyaxares. When they had em­ <lb/>
            braced each other, Cyrus first told Cyaxares that there was <lb/>
            a private house, and palaces, set apart for him in Babylon ; <lb/>
            that when he came thither, he might take up his abode in his <lb/>
            own home; and he also made him a great many other hono­ <lb/>
            rary presents. is. Cyaxares received them, and sent to him <lb/>
            his daughter with a crown of gold, bracelets, a collar, and a <lb/>
            Median robe as magnificent as could be made; and the dam­ <lb/>
            sel put the crown upon Cyrus's head. 19. Cyaxares then <lb/>
            said, " Cyrus, I give you the damsel herself, too, who is my <lb/>
            own daughter, for your wife. Your father married my father's <lb/>
            daughter, and you are her son. This is she, whom, when you <lb/>
            were a boy, and amongst us, you used to nurse; and when <lb/>
            any one asked her whom she would marry, she used to say, <lb/>
            ‘ Cyrus.' With her I give you all Media as her dowry, for <lb/>
            I have no legitimate male issue." 20. Thus he spoke, and <lb/>
            Cyrus replied, " 0 Cyaxares, I am delighted with the family, <lb/>
            the damsel, and the presents; and, with the consent," he <lb/>
            added, " of my father and mother, I am ready to accept your <lb/>
            offer." Thus, indeed, Cyrus expressed himself; yet he pre­ <lb/>
            sented the damsel with whatever he thought would gratify <lb/>
            Cyaxares. Having done so, he continued his march to Persia.</p>
          <p>21. When, in due course, he arrived at the borders of Per­ <lb/>
            sia, he left the rest of the army there; but he himself, with <lb/>
            his intimate friends, went forward to the city, taking with <lb/>
            him such numbers of beasts for sacrifice as were sufficient for <lb/>
            all the Persians to slaughter and make feasts. He took with <lb/>
            him also such presents as were suitable for his father and <lb/>
            mother, and the rest of his friends; as well as others adapted <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">̀Διασπα̃ν</foreign> ] Distrahere in plura agmma aciem. Bornemann. </note> <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            for the magistrates and elder men, and for all the Equals-in- <lb/>
            honour. He gave likewise to all the Persians, both men and <lb/>
            women, such presents as the king still makes when he comes <lb/>
            into Persia. 22. After this Cambyses assembled the elder <lb/>
            Persians, and such of the magistrates as held the highest offices, <lb/>
            (he invited also Cyrus,) and spoke to this effect:</p>
          <p>"I have justly an affection both for you, men of Persia, <lb/>
            and for thee, Cyrus ; for over you I am king, and thou, Cyrus, <lb/>
            art my son. It is right for me, therefore, to lay before you <lb/>
            whatever I consider to be of advantage for each of you. 23. <lb/>
            With respect to the time past, you have advanced the inter­ <lb/>
            ests of Cyrus, by granting an army, and by constituting him <lb/>
            the commander of it; and Cyrus, in the conduct of that army, <lb/>
            has, with the help of the gods, rendered you, 0 Persians, <lb/>
            famous amongst all men, and honoured throughout all Asia; <lb/>
            while of those that served with him, he has enriched the most <lb/>
            deserving, and has provided pay and maintenance for the <lb/>
            multitude, and, by instituting a Persian cavalry, has given <lb/>
            the Persians a share in the command of the plains. 24. For <lb/>
            the future, therefore, if you retain the same feelings, you <lb/>
            will be the authors of many advantages to each other; but if <lb/>
            either you, Cyrus, elevated with your present good fortune, <lb/>
            shall attempt to rule the Persians, like other nations,1 only for <lb/>
            your own benefit; or if you, citizens, envying him his power, <lb/>
            shall endeavour to deprive him of his command, be assured <lb/>
            that you will hinder each other from enjoying many blessings. <lb/>
            25. That such may not be the case, therefore, but that good <lb/>
            fortune may attend you, it seems proper to me," continued he, <lb/>
            " that we should offer a sacrifice in common, and, calling the <lb/>
            gods to witness, should engage, you, Cyrus, on your part, that <lb/>
            if any one make war upon the Persian territory, or attempt <lb/>
            to overthrow the Persian laws, you will assist, in their de­ <lb/>
            fence, with your whole force; and that you, Persians, on <lb/>
            your side, if any one attempt to deprive Cyrus of his author­ <lb/>
            ity, or if any of those under his power attempt to revolt, you <lb/>
            will yield such assistance, in defence of yourselves and of Cy- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐπι πλεονεξί̩α̩ ὤσπερ τω̃ν ἄλλων</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϱχεις ἐθνω̃ν</foreign>. Bornemann <lb/>
            observes that Persia was not accounted a tributary country, though <lb/>
            the people were probably expected to make presents to the king, as <lb/>
            appears from Herod. iii. 97; and adds that there is no reason why <lb/>
            we should not understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ πλεονεξία̩</foreign> as having reference to <lb/>
            tribute. </note> <pb n="270"/>

            rus, as he shall demand 26. Whilst I live, the royal dignity <lb/>
            amongst the Persians is mine; when I am dead, it will doubt­ <lb/>
            less belong to Cyrus, if he is alive. And when he comes into <lb/>
            Persia, it should be a point of religion with you, that he <lb/>
            should make such sacrifices for you as I now make; but, <lb/>
            when he is abroad, I think it will be well for you, if that mem­ <lb/>
            ber of our family who appears to you to be the most worthy <lb/>
            perform the sacrifices to the gods."</p>
          <p>When Cambyses had spoken thus, his proposals were ap­ <lb/>
            proved both by Cyrus and the Persian magistrates; and as <lb/>
            they thus agreed at that time, calling the gods to witness, so <lb/>
            the Persians and the king continue still to act one towards <lb/>
            another. After these affairs were ended, Cyrus took his de­ <lb/>
            parture.</p>
          <p>When he arrived in Media, on his return, he married, with <lb/>
            she consent of his father and mother, the daughter of Cyax­ <lb/>
            ares, of whom there is still a report that she was extremely <lb/>
            beautiful. [Some writers say that he married his mother's <lb/>
            sister; but she must doubtless have been a woman far ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in years.] 1 Having married her, he soon departed. <lb/>

          <p>Cyrus appoints governors of the provinces, and exhorts them to adopt a <lb/>
            similar system of government to that which he himself had adopted in the <lb/>
            city. He appoints inspectors to make a yearly progress through the pro­ <lb/>
            vinces, attended by a body of troops. His regulations for the conveyance <lb/>
            of letters. His dominion being extended throughout Asia from Syria to <lb/>
            Egypt, he decides on living sometimes at Babylon, sometimes at Susa, <lb/>
            and sometimes at Ecbatana.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN he was at Babylon, it seemed proper to him to <lb/>
            send satraps to govern the conquered nations. But the com­ <lb/>
            manders of the garrisons in the fortresses, and the command­ <lb/>
            ers of thousands in the forces throughout the country, he <lb/>
            allowed to obey the orders of no one but himself. He used <note type="footnote"> The original of the words in brackets is condemned by Borne­ <lb/>

            thority, as a gloss that has crept from the margin into the text. </note> <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            this foresight, on consideration that, if any one of the satraps, <lb/>
            by reason of his wealth, and the number of his people, should <lb/>
            grow insolent, and attempt to withdraw his obedience from <lb/>
            him, he might immediately meet with opposers on the spot. <lb/>
            2. Desiring, therefore, to make this arrangement, he deter­ <lb/>
            mined first to call together those whom it concerned, and to <lb/>
            declare his intentions to them, that they who went might know <lb/>
            on what conditions they went; for he thought that they would <lb/>
            thus more readily submit; but that if any of them should be <lb/>
            first appointed rulers, and should then be informed of his <lb/>
            determination, they would be likely to be discontented at <lb/>
            it, imagining it to be made from want of confidence in them.</p>
          <p>3. Having assembled them accordingly, he addressed them <lb/>
            to this effect: " My friends, in the cities that have been con­ <lb/>
            quered, there are garrisons, and governors over them, whom <lb/>
            we left there at the time; and, when I came away, I gave <lb/>
            them orders to employ themselves about no other object than <lb/>
            merely to preserve the fortresses; these men therefore, since <lb/>
            they have honourably guarded what was intrusted to them, I <lb/>
            shall not deprive of their posts; but it is my purpose to send <lb/>
            other governors, who shall take upon them the rule of the in­ <lb/>
            habitants, and who, receiving the revenues, shall pay the gar­ <lb/>
            risons, and discharge whatever else is necessary. 4. And to <lb/>
            those of you who remain here, and to whom I shall give em <lb/>
            ployment, by sending them1 to any of these nations to transact <lb/>
            business, I think it proper that lands and houses should be as <lb/>
            signed there, that the tribute may from thence be sent hither, <lb/>
            and that when they go thither they may reside in their own <lb/>
            dwellings." 5. Thus he spoke; and to many of his friends <lb/>
            he gave houses and people to serve them throughout all the <lb/>
            conquered cities. These lands, situate some in one country <lb/>
            and some in another, remain to this day in possession of the <lb/>
            descendants of those who then received them, though they <lb/>
            themselves reside with the king. 6. “We ought," he then <lb/>
            proceeded, “ to look out for such satraps, to go to these coun­ <lb/>
            tries, as will think of sending us hither whatever is excellent <lb/>
            and valuable in each country, that we, who are here, may <lb/>
            have a share of what is good everywhere ; especially as we, if <note type="footnote">1 Extraordinary legates or commissioners are meant, who might <lb/>

          <p>7. With these words he concluded his speech; and then <lb/>
            from such of his friends as he knew were desirous to go upon <lb/>
            the terms expressed, he selected such as he thought most <lb/>
            eligible, and sent out, as satraps, Megabyzus to Arabia, Arta&lt; <lb/>
            batas to Cappadocia, Artacamas to the Greater Phrygia, Chry­ <lb/>
            santas to Lydia and Ionia, Adusius to Caria, as the Carians <lb/>
            themselves had desired, and Pharnuchus to Phrygia on the <lb/>
            Hellespont, and Æolia. 8. To Cilicia, to Cyprus, and to the <lb/>
            Puphlagonians, he sent no Persian satraps, because they seem­ <lb/>
            ed to have joined him of their own accord1 in his expedition <lb/>
            against Babylon; to them, however, he appointed also a tri­ <lb/>
            bute to pay; 9. and as Cyrus then ordered, so there are, at <lb/>
            this day, garrisons belonging to the king in the fortresses, and <lb/>
            commanders of thousands appointed by the king over those <lb/>
            garrisons, and enrolled in the king's list.</p>
          <p>10. All the satraps that were sent out, he directed to imi­ <lb/>
            tate whatever they saw him practise ; in the first place, to <lb/>
            form out of the Persians and allies that attended them a <lb/>
            number of horsemen and charioteers ; to oblige such as had <lb/>
            land and palaces to attend at his doors, and, observing a dis­ <lb/>
            creet behaviour, to offer themselves to the service of the <lb/>
            satrap, if occasion should require; to discipline at his doors <lb/>
            the sons of those men, according to his own practice; and to <lb/>
            take those that attended at his doors out with him to hunt, <lb/>
            and exercise himself and those about him in military occupa­ <lb/>
            tions. 11. And whosoever," said he, "in proportion to his <lb/>
            ability, produces me the most chariots, and the most and the <lb/>
            best horsemen, I will reward him, as an excellent fellow- <lb/>
            soldier, and as an excellent fellow-guardian of the empire for <lb/>
            both the Persians and myself. Let the best men with you, <lb/>
            as with me, be honoured with the principal seats; and let <lb/>
            your table, like mine, maintain, in the first place, your domes­ <lb/>
            tics, and let it be also sufficiently furnished for your friends to <lb/>
            partake of it, and to allow you every day to honour any one <lb/>
            that may have done a worthy action. 12. Provide yourselves <lb/>
            parks, and maintain wild beasts; and neither set meat at any <lb/>
            time before yourselves without having taken exercise, nor <lb/>
            throw food to your horses until they have taken it. For I, <note type="footnote">1 See vii. 4. 1. </note> <pb n="273"/>

            who am but a single individual, cannot, with all the virtue <lb/>
            that belongs to human nature, secure the possessions of you <lb/>
            all; but it is my part, as an honourable man, with honourable <lb/>
            men about me, to be a support to you ; and it is your parts, <lb/>
            likewise, as honourable men, with other honourable men about <lb/>
            you, to be supporters to me. 13. I desire that you would ob­ <lb/>
            serve also, that of all these directions that I now give you, I <lb/>
            give none to those that are of servile condition; and that <lb/>
            whatever I say you ought to do, I endeavour myself also to <lb/>
            practise. As I, therefore, exhort you to imitate me, so do <lb/>
            you instruct those that hold command under you to imi­ <lb/>
            tate you."</p>
          <p>14. Cyrus having thus regulated affairs at that time, all the <lb/>
            garrisons under the king are, in consequence, still maintained <lb/>
            in the same method; all doors of the commanders are at­ <lb/>
            tended in like manner; all houses, great and small, are regu­ <lb/>
            lated in a similar way; the most deserving men in all com­ <lb/>
            panies are honoured with the principal seats; all marches are <lb/>
            conducted in the same order; and in every nation a great <lb/>
            multitude of affairs is included under the management of a <lb/>
            few governors.</p>
          <p>15. Having instructed them how they were severally to <lb/>
            manage these affairs, and having given each of them a body of <lb/>
            troops, he sent them away, giving them all notice to be pre­ <lb/>
            pared, as an expedition would be undertaken in the following <lb/>
            year, and a review of men and arms, horses and chariots.</p>
          <p>16. We have heard also of the following regulation, that <lb/>
            Cyrus having, as they say, begun it, it continues in force to <lb/>
            the present day. A certain person, at the head of an army, <lb/>
            makes a progress through the country every year, in order that, <lb/>
            if any one of the satraps want assistance, he may afford it; and <lb/>
            that, if any one grow rebellious, he may humble him; and <lb/>
            that, if any neglect the payment of his tribute, or the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of the inhabitants, or to see that the land be cultivated, or <lb/>
            omit to fulfil any other of his duties, he may rectify such <lb/>
            matters ; or, if he is unable to do so himself, may report the <lb/>
            affair to the king ; who, when he hears of it, considers how to <lb/>
            deal with the offender. And those to whom allusion is so <lb/>
            often made, when it is said that the king's son, or the king's <lb/>
            brother, or the king's eye, is coming down, and who some­ <lb/>
            times do not make their appearance, (for each of them returns <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            whenever1 the king sends orders,) are those who make these <lb/>
            progresses.</p>
          <p>17. We have likewise been informed of another contrivance <lb/>
            of his, which was suited to the extent of his empire, and by <lb/>
            means of which he could speedily learn in what state the most <lb/>
            remote parts of it were ; for, ascertaining how long a journey <lb/>
            a horse could accomplish in a day, being ridden at such a pace <lb/>
            as to keep his strength, he built stables at that distance, and <lb/>
            put horses in them, and persons to take care of them ; and he <lb/>
            appointed, at each of these stations, a proper person to receive <lb/>
            letters that were brought, and to deliver them to other mes­ <lb/>
            sengers ; and to take in the tired horses and men, and furnish <lb/>
            fresh ones. is. They say that sometimes this conveyance <lb/>
            was not interrupted even during the night, but that a night <lb/>
            messenger immediately succeeded the day one. In this man­ <lb/>
            ner some say that they make their way swifter than cranes ; <lb/>
            but though they are wrong in that assertion, yet it is manifest <lb/>
            that this is the quickest of all modes of travelling for men by <lb/>
            land ; and it is right that a sovereign should have immediate <lb/>
            intelligence of everything, and give immediate attention to it.</p>
          <p>19. When the year was ended, Cyrus assembled his army at <lb/>
            Babylon, and it is said that there were in it cavalry to the <lb/>
            number of a hundred and twenty thousand, chariots armed <lb/>
            with scythes to the number of two thousand, and infantry to <lb/>
            the number of a hundred and twenty thousand. 20. This <lb/>
            force being in readiness for him, he proceeded on that expe­ <lb/>
            dition, in which he is reported to have subdued all those na­ <lb/>
            tions which extend from the entrance into Syria to the Red <lb/>
            Sea. After this, his expedition to Egypt is said to have <lb/>
            taken place, and to have brought Egypt into subjection. 21 <lb/>
            In consequence the Red Sea bounded his empire on the east, <lb/>
            the Euxine Sea on the north, Cyprus and Egypt on the west, <lb/>
            and Ethiopia on the south. The extreme parts of these <lb/>
            countries are uninhabitable, some from heat, some from cold, <lb/>
            some from too great abundance of water, others from a <lb/>
            scarcity of it. <figure type="illustration">

            tries, spent the winter season, seven months, at Babylon, be­ <lb/>
            cause the climate there is warm; the spring season, three <lb/>
            months, at Susa; and the middle of summer, two months, at <lb/>
            Ecbatana. By this means they say that he enjoyed a per­ <lb/>

            so affected towards him, that every nation thought they failed <lb/>

            things either grew, or were bred, or manufactured, in their <lb/>
            country; every city acted in the same manner; and every <lb/>
            private man thought that he should enrich himself, if he <lb/>
            could but oblige Cyrus; for Cyrus, accepting from every <lb/>
            one that of which the givers had abundance, bestowed on <lb/>
            them, in return, what he saw that they needed.</p>

          <p>Cyrus is admonished by a dream to prepare for death. His address, when <lb/>
            he was dying, to his children and friends.</p>
          <p>i. TIME thus advancing, Cyrus, now growing old, made a <lb/>
            journey into Persia for the seventh time during his reign, when <lb/>
            his father and mother had probably been for some time dead. <lb/>
            Cyrus made the usual sacrifices, led the dance among the <lb/>
            Persians according to the practice of the country, and dis­ <lb/>
            tributed to every one presents, as he had been accustomed. <lb/>
            2. Afterwards, as he was sleeping in the royal palace, he had <lb/>
            the following dream. A being, of more than human dignity, <lb/>
            seemed to advance towards him, and to say, “ Cyrus, prepare <lb/>
            thyself, for thou art now going to the gods!" After seeing <lb/>
            this vision, he awoke, and seemed almost to be certain that his <lb/>
            end was drawing near. 3. He therefore immediately took <lb/>
            victims, and sacrificed on the summit of a mountain, as is the <lb/>
            custom in Persia, to Jupiter Patrius, the sun, and the rest of <lb/>
            the gods, uttering this prayer:</p>
          <p>" 0 Jupiter Patrius, thou sun, and all ye gods ! receive this <lb/>
            sacrifice, as an acknowledgment for assistance in the achieve­ <lb/>
            ment of many honourable deeds, and as an offering of grati­ <lb/>
            tude to you for having signified to me by victims, by signs <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            from heaven, by birds, and I y omens, what it became me to do. <lb/>
            and what it became me not to do. Abundant thanks are due <lb/>
            to you, that I have been sensible of your care and protection; <lb/>
            and have never in the course of my prosperity been elated in <lb/>
            thought above what became a man. I beseech you now to <lb/>
            grant happiness to my children, my wife, my friends, and my <lb/>
            country; and to myself, a death similar to the life which you <lb/>
            have given me."</p>
          <p>4. Having concluded these ceremonies, and having returned <lb/>
            home, be felt inclined to rest, and lay down. At the proper <lb/>
            hour, the attendants, whose business it was, came to him, and <lb/>
            signified that he should bathe. He told them that he had <lb/>
            rested very well. Other attendants, at the proper hour, <lb/>
            brought him his meal, but his appetite was not inclined for <lb/>
            food, but he seemed thirsty, and drank with pleasure. 5. As <lb/>
            he was similarly affected on the second and third days, he sent <lb/>
            for his sons, who happened to have attended him, and were <lb/>
            then in Persia. He summoned likewise his friends and the <lb/>
            magistrates of Persia. When they were all come, he began <lb/>
            to speak to them in this manner:</p>
          <p>6. “ My children, and all of you, my friends, who are pre­ <lb/>
            sent, the termination of my life is now at hand, as I certainly <lb/>
            know from many indications. It behoves you, when I am <lb/>
            dead, to speak and act with reference to me, in every way, as <lb/>
            a happy man. For, when I was a child, I seem to have <lb/>
            profited by what is thought becoming in children, when I was <lb/>
            a youth, from what is thought becoming in young men, and <lb/>
            when I was a man, from what is thought becoming in men, <lb/>
            I have always, too, seemed to feel my strength increase with <lb/>
            the advance of time, so that I have not found myself weaker <lb/>
            in my old age than in my youth, nor do I know that I have <lb/>
            attempted or desired anything in which I have not been suc­ <lb/>
            cessful. 7. By my means, I have seen my friends made <lb/>
            happy, and my enemies enslaved: and I leave my country, <lb/>
            previously undistinguished in Asia, now in the highest honour. <lb/>
            Of what I have acquired, moreover, I know of nothing that I <lb/>
            have not preserved. But though, in time past, I succeeded <lb/>
            according to my wishes, yet an apprehension attending me, <lb/>
            lest I should hereafter see, hear, or suffer some trouble, has <lb/>
            not allowed me to think altogether highly of myself, or to feo <lb/>
            extravagantly delighted. 8. Now, whenever I die, I leavu <pb n="277"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            you, my children, whom the gods have given to be born to <lb/>
            me, surviving, and I leave my country and my friends happy. <lb/>
            Why, then, should I not always, with justice, be remembered <lb/>
            as fortunate ?</p>
          <p>a. " But I must likewise declare to whom I leave my king­ <lb/>
            dom, lest, the succession being left doubtful, it should here­ <lb/>
            after cause disturbance among you. I love you both, my <lb/>
            children, equally; but to plan for the future, and to take the <lb/>
            lead in whatever occasion may require, I commit to the elder, <lb/>
            who has, as is natural, greater experience. 10. I was myself <lb/>
            so instructed by my country and yours, to give place to those <lb/>
            elder than myself, not only brothers, but fellow-citizens, both <lb/>
            in walking, sitting, and conversing; and thus have I in­ <lb/>
            structed you, my children, from your youth, to pay honour to <lb/>
            your elders in preference to yourselves, and to receive honour <lb/>
            from the younger in preference to them. Submit then to this <lb/>
            arrangement, as I speak according to what is ancient, custom­ <lb/>
            ary, and legal. 11. You, therefore, Cambyses, possess the <lb/>
            throne, for the gods give it you, and I, as far as is in my <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>" You Tanaoxares, I appoint to be satrap of the Medes, <lb/>
            Armenians, and Cadusians; and in giving this office to you, <lb/>
            I think that while I leave to your elder brother the greater <lb/>
            power and the title of king, I allot to you a station of greater <lb/>
            happiness;1 for what human pleasure you will want, I do not <lb/>
            see; all that appears to delight mankind will be at your com­ <lb/>
            mand. 12. But to desire objects difficult of execution, to be <lb/>
            anxious about many affairs, to be unable to remain quiet, from <lb/>
            being excited by an emulation of my actions to form designs <lb/>
            against others, and to be exposed to machinations, are things <lb/>
            which must more necessarily affect the king than yourself, <lb/>
            and which, be assured, must cause many interruptions to <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>13. "As for you, Cambyses, you must be aware that it is not <lb/>
            this golden sceptre that must preserve your kingdom, but that <lb/>
            faithful friends are to kings the safest and most trustworthy <lb/>
            sceptre. But do not imagine that men are by nature made faith­ <lb/>
            ful ; (for the same persons would then appear faithful to all, as <lb/>
            other natural productions appear the same to all;) but every <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐδαιμονίαν ἀλυποτέραν</foreign>.] " A happiness more free from <lb/>
            trouble.” </note> <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            one must make faithful friends for himself; and the acquisi­ <lb/>
            tion of them is by no means to be effected with violence, but <lb/>
            rather by beneficence. 14. If, therefore, you shall seek to <lb/>
            make others joint-guardians of your kingdom with yourself, <lb/>
            begin with no one sooner than with him who is of the same <lb/>
            blood with yourself. Fellow-citizens are more united to us <lb/>
            than strangers, and those who eat with us than those who live <lb/>
            at a distance from us. But how can those who are sprung <lb/>
            from the same stock, who have been nourished by the same <lb/>
            mother, who have grown up in the same house, who have <lb/>
            been beloved by the same parents, and who have called upon <lb/>
            the same mother and father, be otherwise than the most closely <lb/>
            united to us of all men ? 15. The advantages, therefore, for <lb/>
            which the gods lead brothers to union, see that you never <lb/>
            render vain ; but build upon them other friendly acts ; and <lb/>
            thus will your friendship always be impregnable. He that <lb/>
            cares for his brother cares for himself. To whom is a brother, <lb/>
            become great, so much an ornament as to a brother ? Or who <lb/>
            else will be honoured, on account of a man high in power, so <lb/>
            much as his brother? Or whom will any one fear to injure so <lb/>
            much as a powerful man's brother?1 16. Let no one, there­ <lb/>
            fore, obey his wishes with greater alacrity, or support him <lb/>
            with greater zeal, than yourself; for to no one can his good <lb/>
            or ill fortune be more a matter of concern than to you. Take <lb/>
            this also into consideration: can you hope for greater ad­ <lb/>
            vantages from obliging any one than from obliging your <lb/>
            brother ? Or could you, by assisting any other, secure a <lb/>
            more powerful ally ? Whom is it more disgraceful not to love <lb/>
            than a brother ? Whom, of all men, is it more laudable to <lb/>
            prefer in honour than a brother? Indeed, Cambyses, it is <lb/>
            only when a brother is advanced to the chief place of honour <lb/>
            by a brother, that no envy arises on the part of other men.</p>

              what it did. is. Have you never observed as to the souls of <lb/>
              those who have suffered a violent death,1 what terrors they <lb/>
              strike into those who are stained with their blood, and what <lb/>
              avenging deities they send upon impious offenders ? Do you <lb/>
              suppose, too, that honours paid to the dead would still con­ <lb/>
              tinue, if their souls were utterly without influence? 19. For <lb/>
              my part, my sons, I have never been persuaded that the soul <lb/>
              lives only as long as it is in a mortal body, and dies when it is <lb/>
              separated from it; for I see that it is the soul which keeps <lb/>
              mortal bodies alive, as long as it remains in them. 20. Nor do <lb/>
              I feel convinced that the soul will be devoid of sense when it <lb/>
              is separated from the senseless body; but it is probable that <lb/>
              when the mind is separated, unmixed, and pure, it is then also <lb/>
              most intelligent. When the frame of man is dissolved, every <lb/>
              part of him is seen returning to that which is of the same <lb/>
              nature with itself, except the soul, which alone is seen neither <lb/>
              present nor departing. 21. Reflect too," continued he, "that <lb/>
              nothing more closely resembles the death of man than sleep; <lb/>
              but it is in sleep that the soul of man appears most divine, and <lb/>
              it is then that it foresees something of the future; for then, as <lb/>
              it seems, it is most free. 22. If, therefore, these things are <lb/>
              as I think, and the soul leaves the body, do what I request of <lb/>
              you from regard to my soul; but if it be not so, and the soul, <lb/>
              remaining in the body, dies with it, yet, from fear of the gods, <lb/>
              who are eternal, who behold all things and can do all things, <lb/>
              who maintain this order of the universe unimpaired, undecay­ <lb/>
              ing, and without defect, neither do, nor meditate, on any occa­ <lb/>
              sion, anything impious or unjust.</p>
          <p>23. "Next to the gods, have respect to the whole race of <lb/>
            mankind, rising up in perpetual succession; for the gods do <lb/>
            not shroud you in obscurity, but there is a necessity that <lb/>
            your actions should always live in the view of all. If they <lb/>
            seem to be virtuous and free from injustice, they will render <lb/>
            you powerful among all men; but if you meditate what is un­ <lb/>
            just against each other, you will lose credit with all men; <lb/>
            for none could any longer place confidence in you, though he <lb/>
            should have the strongest inclination to do so, when he sees <lb/>

            ought to conduct yourselves towards one another, it is well; <lb/>
            if not, learn it from those who lived before us, for this is the <lb/>
            best mode of learning. Many parents have lived in affection <lb/>
            with their children, and many brothers with their brothers; <lb/>
            and some have acted towards each other an entirely opposite <lb/>
            part; to whichsoever of these you shall find their conduct to <lb/>
            have been beneficial, you will determine well in choosing it for <lb/>
            your imitation. But on these subjects I have perhaps said <lb/>
            sufficient.</p>
          <p>25. “ When I am dead, my children, do not enshrine my <lb/>
            body in gold, or in silver, or in any other substance; but re­ <lb/>
            store it to the earth as soon as possible; for what can be more <lb/>
            desirable than to be mixed with the earth, which gives birth <lb/>
            and nourishment to everything excellent and good ? I have <lb/>
            always hitherto borne an affection to men, and I feel that I <lb/>
            should now gladly be incorporated with that which is beneficial <lb/>
            to men. 26. And now," he added, " my soul seems to be leaving <lb/>
            me, in the same manner as, it is probable, it begins to leave <lb/>
            others. If, therefore, any one of you is desirous of touching <lb/>
            my right hand, or is willing to see my face, while it has life, <lb/>
            let him come near to me ; but when I shall have covered it, I <lb/>
            request of you, my sons, let no man, not even yourselves, look <lb/>
            upon my body. 27. Summon however all the Persians, and <lb/>
            the allies, to my tomb, to rejoice for me, as I shall then be safe <lb/>
            from suffering any evil, whether I be with the divine nature, <lb/>
            or be reduced to nothing. As many as come, do not dismiss until <lb/>
            you have bestowed on them whatever favours are customary <lb/>
            at the funeral of a rich man. 28. And remember this, as my <lb/>
            last admonition: by doing good to your friends, you will be, <lb/>
            able also to punish your enemies. Farewell, dear children, <lb/>
            and say farewell to your mother as from me; farewell, all <lb/>
            my friends, present and absent." Having said this, and <lb/>
            taken every one by the right hand, he covered his face and <lb/>

          <p>Conclusion. Gradual degeneracy of the Persians after the death of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>i. THAT Cyrus's empire was the finest and most extensive of <lb/>
            all those in Asia, it testifies for itself. It was bounded on the <lb/>
            east by the Erythræan Sea, on the north by the Euxine Sea, <lb/>
            on the west by Cyprus and Egypt, on the south by Ethiopia; <lb/>
            and, though of such an extent, was governed by the single <lb/>
            mind of Cyrus; and those who were subject to him, he treated <lb/>
            with esteem and regard, as if they were his own children, <lb/>
            while his subjects themselves respected Cyrus as a father. 2. <lb/>
            But when Cyrus was dead, his sons soon fell into dissension, <lb/>
            cities and nations speedily revolted, and everything changed <lb/>
            for the worse. That what I say is true, I will begin to show <lb/>
            by speaking of things relating to the gods.</p>
          <p>I know that, in former times, the king, and those that were <lb/>
            under him, if they took an oath, observed it, or if they made <lb/>
            engagements, adhered to them, even in regard to persons who <lb/>
            had committed the greatest offences. 3. Had they not been <lb/>
            such characters, and borne such a reputation, no person would <lb/>
            have trusted them,2 as no one any longer trusts them now, <lb/>
            since their impiety is known ; so neither should the generals <lb/>
            of the troops that went up with Cyrus3 have trusted them on <lb/>
            that occasion, but, relying on their ancient character, they <lb/>
            put themselves into their hands, and being taken to the <note type="footnote"> Whether this chapter be genuine or spurious, has been much <lb/>
            disputed. David Schulze wrote a dissertation (Hal. 1806) to prove <lb/>
            it spurious, which Bornemann answered, (Lips. 1819,) but without <lb/>
            satisfying Beck or Lange, who, with Valckenaer ad Xen. Mem. p. <lb/>
            238, ed. Ern., decidedly pronounce it a forgery. For my own part, <lb/>
            I think, with Fischer, (ad sect. 9,) that the affected elegance, but <lb/>
            dry uniformity, of its style, so different from that of the rest of the <lb/>
            book, and of Xenophon in general, are sufficiently decisive against <lb/>
            its genuineness. That Athenæus (xii. 2) should quote it as genuine, <lb/>
            may seem somewhat strange, but will prove nothing but that it ex­ <lb/>
            isted before Athenæus wrote, leaving it not at all the less a forgery. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ</foreign>’ av <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶς αὐτοις ἐπίστευεν</foreign>, which are in Hutchin­ <lb/>

            king, had their heads cut off; and many of the Barbarians <lb/>
            engaged in that expedition also perished, some deluded by one <lb/>
            promise and some by another.</p>
          <p>4. They are also greatly degenerated in regard to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing particulars ; for formerly, if any one hazarded his life <lb/>
            for his king, or subdued a city or nation, or performed any <lb/>
            other honourable or serviceable action, he was distinguished <lb/>
            with honour; but now, if any one betrays his father, as <lb/>
            Mithridates betrayed Ariobarzanes ; or if any one, like Leo­ <lb/>
            mithres, having left his wife and children, and his friends' <lb/>
            children, as hostages with the king of Egypt, and having <lb/>
            violated the most solemn oaths, appears to have served the <lb/>
            king by that means, he is loaded with the highest honours. <lb/>
            5. All the people of Asia, being spectators of these pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, give themselves up to impiety and injustice; for <lb/>
            whatever be the character of the rulers of a state, that <lb/>
            of their subjects will be for the most part similar. It is <lb/>
            thus that they have become more lawless than they were <lb/>
            formerly.</p>
          <p>G. With respect to money, too, they show themselves more <lb/>
            unprincipled in the following ways. They seize, not only <lb/>
            such as have committed many crimes, but such as have done <lb/>
            no wrong, and compel them, for no just cause, to pay fines; <lb/>
            so that those who appear to possess much property, live under <lb/>
            no less apprehension than those who have been guilty of many <lb/>
            offences; they are neither willing to come into the society of <lb/>
            the more powerful, nor do they dare to join the army of the <lb/>
            king. 7. Thus, whoever goes to war with the Persians, may <lb/>
            fix his abode in the country, just as he pleases, without fight­ <lb/>
            ing, in consequence of their impiety towards the gods, and <lb/>
            their injustice towards men. In this respect their minds are <lb/>
            altogether in a worse condition than formerly.</p>
          <p>8. I will now show that they do not take the same care as <lb/>
            formerly to exercise their bodies. It was customary with <lb/>
            them not to spit, or blow the nose; a rule which, it is mani­ <lb/>
            fest, they did not observe in order to spare the moisture in <lb/>
            their bodies, but from a desire to harden their bodies by exer­ <lb/>
            cise and perspiration. The custom of not spitting or blowing <lb/>
            the nose, indeed, still continues, but that of taking exercise is <lb/>
            wholly disregarded 9. Originally, too, it was their practice <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            to make only one meal1 a day, that they might employ the rest <lb/>
            of the day in business and exercise, and the custom of taking <lb/>
            one meal is still observed; but, commencing their meal at the <lb/>
            same time as those who dine earliest, they continue eating and <lb/>
            drinking till the latest sitters-up go to bed.</p>
          <p>10. It was likewise a rule among them, not to bring pro­ <lb/>
            choides2 to their banquets ; evidently thinking that abstinence <lb/>
            from drinking to excess would tend less to impair their bodies <lb/>
            and their minds ; and the custom of not bringing such vessels <lb/>
            still continues; but they drink to such excess, that instead of <lb/>
            bringing in, they are themselves carried out, since they are no <lb/>
            longer able to walk out upright.</p>
          <p>11. It was also a custom of the country, not to eat or drink <lb/>
            when they were journeying from one place to another, or to be <lb/>
            seen doing what are the necessary consequences of both. <lb/>
            Abstinence in these particulars still continues; but they make <lb/>
            their journeys so short, that no one can any longer wonder <lb/>
            that they abstain from yielding to those calls of nature.</p>
          <p>12. Formerly they went out hunting so often, that those ex­ <lb/>
            peditions were sufficient exercises for themselves and their <lb/>
            horses; but, since King Artaxerxes and his courtiers have <lb/>
            yielded to the influence of wine, they have neither gone out <lb/>
            so frequently themselves, nor have sent out others, to the <lb/>
            chase; and if some, from a fondness for exercise, have gone <lb/>
            out hunting with their horsemen about them, the other Per­ <lb/>
            sians have manifestly envied and hated them for presuming to <lb/>
            seem superior to themselves.</p>
          <p>is. To educate the youth at the gates of the palace is still <lb/>
            the custom ; but the attainment and practice of horsemanship <lb/>
            are extinct, because they do not go where they can gain ap­ <lb/>
            plause by exhibiting skill in that exercise. Whereas, too, in <lb/>
            former times, the boys, hearing causes justly decided there, <lb/>
            were considered by that means to learn justice, that custom is <note type="footnote">' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μονοσιτει̃ν</foreign>.] That is, to take only one principal meal in the <lb/>
            day, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃πνον</foreign> for that they took a meal in the early part <lb/>
            of the day, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄριστν</foreign>, is shown by many passages of the Cyro­ <lb/>

            means agreed. Hesychius, Gataker, (Miscell. Crit. v. 5,) Bornemann, <lb/>
            interpret it matulæ; but Athenæus, (xi. p. 469, c.,) Brisson, (de Reg. <lb/>
            Pers. Princip. p. 218,) Sturz, and others, think that large cups are <lb/>
            meant. </note> <pb n="284"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII, </note> <lb/>
            altogether altered; for they now see those gain their causes <lb/>
            who offer the highest bribes. 14. Formerly, also, boys were <lb/>
            taught the virtues of the various productions of the earth, in <lb/>
            order that they might use the serviceable, and avoid the <lb/>
            noxious; but now they seem to be taught those particulars <lb/>
            that they may do as much harm as possible; at least there are <lb/>
            nowhere so many killed or injured1 by poison as in that <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>15. They are, moreover, far more luxurious now than in the <lb/>
            time of Cyrus, for then they still adhered to the institutions <lb/>
            and temperance of the Persians, combined with the dress and <lb/>
            delicacy of the Medes ; but now they have suffered the tem­ <lb/>
            perance of the Persians to become extinct, while the effeminacy <lb/>
            of the Modes they retain. 16. Of their luxury I wish to give <lb/>
            some illustrations. In the first place, it is not sufficient for <lb/>
            them to have soft couches spread for them, but they place the <lb/>
            feet of their couches upon carpets, that the floor may offer no <lb/>
            hard resistance, but that the carpets may yield. Of meats <lb/>
            cooked for their tables, whatever were invented in former <lb/>
            times, not one is discontinued ; but they are always contriv­ <lb/>
            ing new dishes, as well as sauces, for they have cooks to find <lb/>
            out varieties in both. 17. In winter, it is not sufficient for <lb/>
            them to have their heads, their bodies, and their feet covered, <lb/>
            but they have hair-gloves for their hands, and coverings for <lb/>
            the fingers. In summer, the shade of trees and of rocks does <lb/>
            not satisfy them ; but, under these, men stand near them con­ <lb/>
            triving additional shaded is. If they possess a great number <lb/>
            of cups, they are proud of possessing them; and if they be <lb/>
            evidently acquired by unjust means, they are not at all <lb/>
            ashamed, for dishonesty and a sordid love of gain are greatly <lb/>
            increased among them.</p>
          <p>19. It was once the custom of the country, that they should <lb/>
            never be seen travelling on foot, for no other reason, but that <lb/>
            they might become more skilful horsemen; now they have <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὔτε ἀποθνήσκουσιν</foreign> ovre <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφθείϱονται</foreign>.] Some have taken the <lb/>
            former verb in the sense of se interficiunt, and the latter in the sense <lb/>
            of ab aliis occiduntur. But Camerarius very properly gave them the <lb/>
            senses of moriuntur and perniciosè læduntur; the only senses that at <lb/>
            all accord with the context. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By the aid of fans and umbellæ, which may be seen represented <lb/>

            more coverings on their horses than on their couches; for they <lb/>
            are not so desirous of skill in horsemanship, as of sitting at <lb/>
            their ease. 20. With regard to the affairs of war, therefore, <lb/>
            how can it be otherwise than probable that they should now <lb/>
            be inferior in every respect to what they were at first ? It <lb/>
            was customary, in past times, that those who possessed lands <lb/>
            should furnish horsemen from them for the army, and that the <lb/>
            soldiers in garrison, if it should be necessary to take the field, <lb/>
            should fight as paid troops in defence of the country; but now <lb/>
            the great men enrol porters, bakers, cooks, cup-bearers, <lb/>
            bathers, men who set dishes on the table and remove them, <lb/>
            men who assist people to bed and to get up, dressers who <lb/>
            anoint people, paint their faces, and trick them out in other <lb/>
            ways, and all such characters, in the cavalry, that they may <lb/>
            serve instead of themselves. 21. Of these, accordingly, the num­ <lb/>
            ber makes a show; but there is no profit in them for war, as <lb/>
            events indeed prove, for their enemies find a residence in <lb/>
            their country more easily than their friends. 22. Cyrus, <lb/>
            having broken them of the custom of skirmishing at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, armed with breastplates both them and their horses, <lb/>
            gave every one a javelin in his hand, and trained them to <lb/>
            close fight; but now they neither skirmish from a distance <lb/>
            nor engage hand to hand. 23. The foot have yet shields, <lb/>
            bills, and swords, as if they were going to battle under Cyrus, <lb/>
            but neither will they venture to come to an engagement. 24. <lb/>
            Nor do they any longer use the chariots armed with scythes <lb/>
            for the purpose for which Cyrus intended them; for he, by <lb/>
            distinguishing the charioteers with honours, and making them <lb/>
            brave, had such as would attack a body of heavy-armed in­ <lb/>
            fantry ; but the Persians of the present day, scarcely knowing <lb/>
            the men in the chariots, imagine that those who are unexer­ <lb/>
            cised will be as serviceable as those that have practised; 25. <lb/>
            they do, indeed, make an attack, but, before they penetrate <lb/>
            the enemy's ranks, some unintentionally fall out, and others <lb/>
            jump out, so that the chariots and horses, being without <lb/>
            drivers, frequently do more injury to their, friends than to their <lb/>
            enemies. 26. But since they are sensible of the condition of <lb/>
            their troops, they yield to others, and none of them engage in <lb/>
            a war without the aid of the Greeks, whether when they con­ <lb/>
            tend with one another, or when the Greeks take the field <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            against them ; for they resolve not to make war with Greeks <lb/>
            without the assistance of Greeks.</p>
          <p>27. I think that I have now executed what I undertook; <lb/>
            for I suppose it has been proved that the Persians, and those <lb/>
            incorporated with them, are less regardful of piety towards <lb/>
            the gods, less just towards their relations, less equitable in <lb/>
            their dealings with ottiers, and less vigorous in war, in the <lb/>
            present than in former times. If any one thinks differently <lb/>
            from me, he will, on considering their conduct, find it verify <lb/>
            my statement</p>

          <p>The power of Athens considerably restored by the aid of Alcibiades. De <lb/>
            feat and death of the Spartan admiral Mindarus in the battle of Cyzicus. <lb/>
            Pharnabazus assists the Lacedæmonians. Banishment of Hermocrates, <lb/>
            the Syracusan, and his colleagues. Repulse of Agis before the walls of <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>1. AFTER these things, 1 but not many days later, Thymo­ <lb/>
            chares came from Athens with a few ships; and immediately <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians and Athenians again engaged by sea, and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, under the command of Hegesandridas, <lb/>
            gained the victory.</p>
          <p>2. A little subsequent to this, Dorieus, the son of Diagoras, <lb/>
            sailed from Rhodes into the Hellespont with fourteen ships, <lb/>
            at the beginning of winter, at day-break. And the day­ <lb/>
            watch of the Athenians having observed him, gave notice to <lb/>
            the generals, who put out against him with twenty ships; <lb/>
            but Dorieus having escaped them to the shore, ran his ships <lb/>
            aground on Rhœteum, as he was clearing2 it. 3. When the <note type="footnote">1 i. e. after the defeat of Mindarus by the Athenian commanders, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            Athenians had come to close quarters with them, they fought <lb/>
            both from their ships and from the shore; until the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians sailed away to Madytus to the rest of their force with­ <lb/>
            out having gained any advantage. 4. Now Mindarus had a <lb/>
            sight of the battle, as he was sacrificing to Athena at Ilium, <lb/>
            and went down to the sea to support them; and having <lb/>
            launched his own galleys, sailed off to rescue those of Dorieus. <lb/>
            5. But the Athenians, putting out against him, engaged him off <lb/>
            Abydus, along the beach, from morning till evening. And <lb/>
            while they were alternately victorious and vanquished, Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades sailed up into the straits with eighteen ships. 6. Upon <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians fled to Abydus; when Pharnabazus <lb/>
            came to their aid, and advancing on his horse into the sea <lb/>
            fought as long as was possible, and cheered on the rest of his <lb/>
            men, both horse and foot. 7. And the Peloponnesians having <lb/>
            closed in with their ships and formed them in line, engaged <lb/>
            near the shore. So the Athenians sailed away, having taken <lb/>
            thirty of the enemy's vessels unmanned, and having recovered <lb/>
            those which they had themselves lost; and went to Sestus. <lb/>
            8. Thence, with the exception of forty ships, they departed in <lb/>
            different directions beyond the Hellespont to collect money; <lb/>
            while Thrasylus, being one of the generals, sailed to Athens <lb/>
            to carry tidings of these things, and to ask for land forces <lb/>
            and ships.</p>
          <p>9. After these events Tissaphernes came to the Hellespont; <lb/>
            and on Alcibiades' coming to him with a single galley, taking <lb/>
            him tokens of friendship and presents, he arrested and con­ <lb/>
            fined him at Sardis, alleging that the king commanded him <lb/>
            to make war upon the Athenians. 10. But thirty days after­ <lb/>
            wards, Alcibiades in company with Mantitheus, who had <lb/>
            been taken prisoner in Caria, being provided with horses <lb/>
            escaped from Sardis by night to Clazomenæ. 11. Now the <lb/>
            Athenians at Sestus, finding that Mindarus was about to sail <lb/>
            against them with sixty ships, retreated by night to Cardia. <lb/>
            Thither Alcibiades also came from Clazomenae, with five gal­ <lb/>
            leys and a small vessel. And on hearing that the ships of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians had set sail from Abydus for Cyzicus, he himself <lb/>
            came to Sestus by land, and ordered his ships to sail thither. <lb/>
            12. On his arrival, when he was now on the point of putting out <lb/>
            for an engagement, Theramenes too sailed in with twenty ships <lb/>
            from Macedonia, and at the same time Thrasybulus also with <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            twenty more from Thasus, both of them having collected sup­ <lb/>
            plies of money, 13. Alcibiades told these also to pursue him, <lb/>
            having taken down their large sails; and himself sailed to <lb/>
            Parium: and all their ships being united at Parium, to the <lb/>
            number of eighty-six, put out to sea the following night, and <lb/>
            the next day, about breakfast time, arrived at Proconnesus. <lb/>
            There they heard that Mindarus was at Cyzicus, and Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus with his land force. 14. That day, then, they remain­ <lb/>
            ed there; and the day following, Alcibiades, having called an <lb/>
            assembly, told them in his address that it was necessary for <lb/>
            them to fight both by sea and by land, and even against forti­ <lb/>
            fied places; "for," said he, "we have no money, but the <lb/>
            enemy receive abundance of it from the king." 15. Now the <lb/>
            day previous, after they had come to their moorings, he had <lb/>
            brought together all the vessels and the smaller craft to his own <lb/>
            position, in order that no one might report to the enemy the <lb/>
            number of his ships ; and had made proclamation that who­ <lb/>
            ever should be caught sailing over to the opposite coast, death <lb/>
            was the penalty. 16. After the assembly he made prepara­ <lb/>
            tions for a naval action, and set sail for Cyzicus under a heavy <lb/>
            rain. When he was near Cyzicus, the weather having cleared <lb/>
            up and the sun broken out, he descries the ships of Mindarus, <lb/>
            to the number of sixty, exercising at a distance from the har­ <lb/>
            bour, and intercepted from it by his fleet. 17. The Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians, on seeing the galleys of the Athenians, both much <lb/>
            more numerous than before, and near the harbour, fled to the <lb/>
            land; and having anchored their ships together gave battle to <lb/>
            their opponents, as they came up. is. Now Alcibiades, having <lb/>
            sailed round with twenty of his vessels, disembarked on the <lb/>
            shore. Mindarus seeing this, disembarked also, and was <lb/>
            killed fighting on the land, while those that were with him <lb/>
            took to flight. And the Athenians went away to Procon­ <lb/>
            nesus, with all the ships, except those of the Syracusans; but <lb/>
            these the Syracusans themselves had fired. 19. Thence the next <lb/>
            day the Athenians sailed to Cyzicus; and the inhabitants ad­ <lb/>
            mitted them, the Peloponnesians and Pharnabazus having <lb/>
            evacuated the place. 20. After remaining there twenty days, <lb/>
            and levying large contributions from the inhabitants, without <lb/>
            doing any other harm to the town, Alcibiades sailed away to <lb/>
            Proconnesus, and thence to Perinthus and Selymbria. 21. The <lb/>
            Perinthians admitted the armament into their city: the Selym­ <note type="footnote"> <unclear>OL</unclear>. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <pb n="290"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. I. </note> <lb/>
            brians did not admit them, but gave them money. 22.. Thence <lb/>
            they came to Chrysopolis in the territory of Chalcedon, which <lb/>
            they fortified, and established a custom-house in it, and took <lb/>
            tithes of the vessels coming from the Pontus. They also <lb/>
            left there a guard of thirty ships, with two of the generals, <lb/>
            Theramenes and Eumachus, to keep an eye on the place and <lb/>
            on the outward-bound vessels, and to inflict whatever other <lb/>
            injury they could on the enemy. The rest of the generals <lb/>
            departed for the Hellespont.</p>
          <p>23. Now a despatch from Hippocrates, second in command to <lb/>
            Mindarus, which had been sent to Lacedoemon, was intercept­ <lb/>
            ed and brought to Athens, containing these words : " Our suc­ <lb/>
            cess is gone ; Mindarus is dead; the men are hungry; we are <lb/>
            at a loss what to do."</p>
          <p>24. But Pharnabazus exhorted all the force of the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians and the allies not to be disheartened for timber, as <lb/>
            there was abundance of it in the king's country, so long as <lb/>
            their persons were safe; and he gave them a garment each, <lb/>
            and supplies for two months ; and having armed the seamen <lb/>
            he posted them as guardians of his own maritime territory. <lb/>
            25. And having assembled the generals and captains from the <lb/>
            cities, he urged them to build themselves galleys at Antan­ <lb/>
            drus, as many as they had severally lost; both giving them <lb/>
            money, and telling them to take their timber from Ida. 26 <lb/>
            While they were building their ships, the Syracusans together <lb/>
            with the Antandrians completed a part of the fortifications of <lb/>
            the place, and while serving in the garrison made themselves <lb/>
            most agreeable of all the force. For these reasons the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans enjoy both the character of benefactors and the right <lb/>
            of citizenship at Antandrus. Pharnabazus then, having ar­ <lb/>
            ranged these things, went to the succour of Chalcedon.</p>
          <p>27. In the mean time news was brought to the generals of the <lb/>
            Syracusans, that they were banished from home by the people. <lb/>
            They called together therefore their own soldiers, Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates taking the lead, and deplored their misfortune, as being <lb/>
            all banished contrary to the law; and exhorted them to be <lb/>
            zealous in future, as they had been in time past, and brave men <lb/>
            in obeying the orders given them from time to time; and they <lb/>
            urged them to choose commanders, till those chosen in their own <lb/>
            places should have arrived. 28. The men with acclamations de­ <lb/>
            sired them to command them , especially the captains, soldiers, <pb n="291"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            and pilots. They replied, that they must not act seditiously <lb/>
            against their own country; though, if any one brought any <lb/>
            charge against them, they said they ought to give them a <lb/>
            hearing: " remembering in how many sea-fights you have by <lb/>
            yourselves gained the victory, and how many ships you have <lb/>
            taken, and in how many instances, in conjunction with the <lb/>
            rest, you have proved yourselves invincible under our com­ <lb/>
            mand, holding the best position both through our valour and <lb/>
            your zeal, exhibited both by land and by sea." 29. When no one <lb/>
            brought any charge against them, they remained, at their request, <lb/>
            till the generals should arrive who had been chosen in their <lb/>
            stead, namely, Demarchus the son of Pidocus, Myscon the son of <lb/>
            Menecrates, and Potamis the son of Gnosias. And most of the <lb/>
            captains having sworn to restore them on their return to Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse, let them depart wherever they pleased, with eulogies on <lb/>
            all of them ; 30. but the associates of Hermocrates, in particular, <lb/>
            most felt the loss of his attention, zeal, and affability. For <lb/>
            whichever of the captains, pilots, and soldiers he considered <lb/>
            most apt, every day, morning and evening, he assembled <lb/>
            them in his own tent, and communicated to them whatever he <lb/>
            intended to speak or do, and instructed them, urging them <lb/>
            to express their views, in some cases impromptu, in others after <lb/>
            deliberation. 31. By these means Hermocrates enjoyed a ge­ <lb/>
            neral reputation in the council, being thought both to speak <lb/>
            and to form plans in the most able manner. Now Hermocrates <lb/>
            had accused Tissaphernes at Lacedæmon, Astyochus also sup­ <lb/>
            porting him with his evidence, and was thought to have spoken <lb/>
            the truth ; and at the present time, coming to Pharnabazus, he <lb/>
            received money from him before asking for it, and began to <lb/>
            prepare mercenaries and galleys, with a view to his return to <lb/>
            Syracuse. In the mean time, the successors of the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans came to Miletus, and took the command of the fleet <lb/>
            and the army.</p>
          <p>32. Now a sedition having arisen in Thasos at this time, the <lb/>
            partisans of Lacedæmon, and the Lacedæmonian harmost,l <lb/>
            Eteonicus, are driven out. Pasippidas, the Lacedæmonian, <lb/>
            being charged with having effected this in conjunction with <lb/>
            Tissaphernes, was banished from Sparta; and Cratesippidas <lb/>
            was sent out to the fleet which he had raised from the allies, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρμοστής</foreign>.] The title of the governors sent to any foreign de­ <lb/>
            pendency of Sparta. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            and took the command of it at Chios. 33. About this period, <lb/>
            whilst Thrasylus was at Athens, Agis, in making a foray <lb/>
            from Decelea, came to the very walls of Athens; and Thra­ <lb/>
            sylus, having led out the Athenians and the rest who were in <lb/>
            the city, drew them all up by the Lycean gymnasium, pre­ <lb/>
            pared to engage them if they came up to him. 34. Seeing this, <lb/>
            Agis quickly withdrew, and some few of his men, such as <lb/>
            were in the rear of all, were killed by the light-armed. The <lb/>
            Athenians therefore, in consequence of these things, were <lb/>
            still more zealous supporters of Thrasylus, with regard to the <lb/>
            objects of his coming; and voted that he should muster a <lb/>
            thousand heavy infantry, a hundred horse, and fifty triremes. <lb/>
            35. But when Agis saw from Decelea many corn-ships running <lb/>
            into Piræus, he said that it was of no use for him and his <lb/>
            troops to have been now for so long a time excluding the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians from the command of their land, unless some one <lb/>
            should also stop those from whom the sea-borne corn was im­ <lb/>
            ported ; and that the best thing would be to send Clearchus <lb/>
            the son of Ramphias, who was the proxenus of the Byzantines, <lb/>
            to Chalcedon and Byzantium. 36. When this resolution had <lb/>
            been adopted, fifteen ships having been manned from Megara <lb/>
            and from the rest of the allies, he took his departure. And <lb/>
            three of his ships were destroyed in the Hellespont, by the <lb/>
            nine Athenian ones, which were always there on the look-out <lb/>
            for vessels; the rest fled to Sestus, and thence arrived safe at <lb/>
            Byzantium. 37. And so the year ended in which the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians, having made an expedition against Sicily, under the <lb/>
            command of Hannibal, with an army of a hundred thousand <lb/>
            men, took in the course of three months two Grecian cities, <lb/>
            Selinus and Himera. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν ἐπὶ πα̃σιν</foreign>.] Or the preposition may perhaps signify " at <lb/>

          <p>Thrasylus sails to Samos. Takes Colophon, but is defeated with severe !oss <lb/>
            at Ephesus. Takes four Syracusan vessels off Lesbos. Joins the other <lb/>
            Athenian armament at Sestus. During the winter the united forces, un­ <lb/>
            der the command of Alcibiades, attack Abydos, and defeat Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            who came to succour the place.</p>
          <p>1. THE next year, being the ninety-third Olympiad, at which <lb/>
            the two-horsed chariot of Evagoras, the Elean, gained the <lb/>
            prize, (this being a new addition to the games,) and in the <lb/>
            foot-race Eubotas the Cyrenæan—while Euarchippus was <lb/>
            ephor at Sparta, and Euctemon archon at Athens — the <lb/>
            Athenians fortified Thoricus. And now Thrasylus, having <lb/>
            taken the vessels voted for him, and made targeteers of five <lb/>
            thousand of the seamen, sailed out at the beginning of sum­ <lb/>
            mer to Samos. 2. After remaining there three days, he sailed <lb/>
            to Pygela, where he both ravaged the country and attacked <lb/>
            the wall. Now some troops from Miletus, having come to the <lb/>
            succour of the Pygelans, pursued the Athenian light-armed, <lb/>
            while they were dispersed about. 3. But the targeteers, and <lb/>
            two divisions of the heavy-armed, having gone to the support <lb/>
            of their light-armed, slew all who had come from Miletus, <lb/>
            except a few, and took about two hundred shields, and erected <lb/>
            a trophy. 4. The next day they sailed to Notium, and thence, <lb/>
            after making their preparations, proceeded to Colophon, the <lb/>
            inhabitants of which place surrendered to them. The follow­ <lb/>
            ing night they made an inroad into Lydia, when the corn was <lb/>
            ripe, and burnt many villages, and took money and slaves, <lb/>
            and other booty to a great amount. 5. Now Stages the Persian <lb/>
            was in the neighbourhood ; and when the Athenians from the <lb/>
            camp were scattered about, plundering on their own account, <lb/>
            he took prisoner one of the horsemen who had come to their <lb/>
            support, and slew seven. 6. After this, Thrasylus withdrew <lb/>
            his force to the sea, with a view of sailing to Ephesus. Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes, being aware of this object, began to collect a large <lb/>
            army, and to despatch horsemen with orders for all to come <lb/>
            to Ephesus, to the aid of Diana. 7. Thrasylus, the seventeenth <lb/>
            day after his inroad into the country, sailed to Ephesus, and <lb/>
            having landed his heavy infantry near Mount Coressus, and <lb/>
            his cavalry and targeteers, and all the rest, near the marsh on <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            the other side of the tswn, at day-break he brought up both <lb/>
            his divisions. 8. The townsmen went out to defend themselves, <lb/>
            with their allies: whom Tissaphernes had brought, and the <lb/>
            Syracusans, both those from the former twenty ships and <lb/>
            from five others, which happened to have arrived at that <lb/>
            time, being lately come with Eucles the son of Hippo, and <lb/>
            Heraclides the son of Aristogenes, and two from Selinus. 9. <lb/>
            These all marched, in the first instance, against the heavy in­ <lb/>
            fantry at the foot of Coressus; and after routing them, and <lb/>
            slaying about a hundred of them, and pursuing them down to <lb/>
            the sea, they turned against those by the marsh. There, too, <lb/>
            the Athenians fled, and there fell of them about three hun- <lb/>
            Ired. 10. The Ephesians set up a trophy there, and another near <lb/>
            Coressus. And to the Syracusans and Selinuntines, who had <lb/>
            behaved most bravely, they gave rewards for their valour, <lb/>
            both publicly, and, in many instances, privately; and granted <lb/>
            free permission to live there to any who might ever wish it; <lb/>
            while to the Selinuntines, since their city had been destroyed, <lb/>
            they gave the rights of citizenship also. 11. The Athenians, <lb/>
            after taking back their dead under treaty, sailed away to Notium, <lb/>
            and having buried them there sailed for Lesbos and the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont. 12. While lying at anchor at Mitylene in Lesbos, they <lb/>
            saw the five and twenty Syracusan ships sailing by from <lb/>
            Ephesus; and putting out against them, they took four with <lb/>
            their crews, and chased the rest to Ephesus. is. All the rest <lb/>
            of the prisoners Thrasylus sent off to Athens ; but Alcibiades <lb/>
            the Athenian, who was a cousin and fellow-exile of Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades, he set at liberty. He then sailed to Sestus, to join <lb/>
            the rest of the armament. 14. From that place the whole force <lb/>
            crossed over to Lampsacus. And the winter now came on, <lb/>
            during which the Syracusan prisoners who were confined in <lb/>
            the quarries of Piræus, having dug through the rock, made <lb/>
            their escape, and went to Decelea, or in some instances to <lb/>
            Megara. 15. Now at Lampsacus, when Alcibiades wished to <lb/>
            embody all the army, the former soldiers would not join in the <lb/>
            game ranks with those of Thrasylus, considering that they <lb/>
            themselves were unvanquished, while the others had come <lb/>
            after being vanquished. There, then, they all spent the <lb/>
            winter, fortifying Lampsacus, and making an expedition <lb/>
            against Abydos. 16. Pharnabazus came to the rescue of that <lb/>
            place with a large body of horse, and was defeated in battle <pb n="295"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            and put to flight. Alcibiades pursued him with his cavalry and <lb/>
            a hundred and twenty of his heavy infantry, commanded by <lb/>
            Menander, till darkness rescued him. 17. After this battle the <lb/>
            soldiers united with one another, and greeted those with <lb/>
            Thrasylus. They went out also during the winter on other <lb/>
            expeditions against the continent, and ravaged the king's <lb/>
            country. 18. It was at this same time, too, that the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians dismissed under treaty from Malea those of the Helots <lb/>
            who had revolted and established themselves at Coryphasium. 1 <lb/>
            About the same time also the Achæans at Heraclea in Tra­ <lb/>
            chis betrayed the new settlers, while all of them were drawn <lb/>
            up for battle against the Ætæans, who were hostile to them; <lb/>
            so that there fell of them to the number of seven hundred, <lb/>
            with Labotas the harmost from Lacedæmon. 19. And so this <lb/>
            year ended, in which the Medes, having revolted from Darius, <lb/>
            king of Persia, again submitted to him.</p>

          <p>The Athenians attack Chalcedon, which had revolted. Hippocrates, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian harmost, falls in a vain attempt to defend it. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians make peace with the Chalcedonians and Pharnabazus, who had <lb/>
            come to the rescue of their town. They fail in an assault upon Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, but get possession of it by the treason of some of the inhabitants.</p>
          <p>i. THE next year the temple of Athena at Phocæa was <lb/>
            ournt by a thunder-bolt falling on it. When the winter <lb/>
            came to an end, while Pantacles was ephor, and Antigenes <lb/>
            archon, at the beginning of spring, two and twenty years of <lb/>
            the war having now elapsed, the Athenians sailed with all their <lb/>
            armament to Proconnesus. 2. Thence they advanced against <lb/>
            Chalcedon and Byzantium, and encamped near the former <lb/>
            place. The Chalcedonians, having notice of the approach of the <lb/>
            Athenians, deposited all their exposed property with the Bithy­ <lb/>
            nian Thracians who lived near their city. s. But Alcibiades, <lb/>
            taking a few of his heavy infantry and his cavalry, and com­ <lb/>
            manding the fleet to coast along in a line with him, came to <note type="footnote"> 1 TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κορυφάσιον</foreign>.] The Lacedæmonian name for Pylus. See <lb/>
            Thucydides, iv. 3. </note> <pb n="296"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            the Bithynians, and demanded back the property of the <lb/>
            Chalcedonians; else, he said, he would proceed to hostilities <lb/>
            with them. So they gave it back. 4. And when Alcibiades, <lb/>
            having much booty, and having exchanged pledges of friend­ <lb/>
            ship with them, was come to the camp, he proceeded with all <lb/>
            his force to circumvallate Chalcedon from sea to sea, and as <lb/>
            much of the river1 as he could with a wooden wall. 5. Upon <lb/>
            that, Hippocrates, the Lacedæmonian harmost, led his soldiers <lb/>
            out of the city to give him battle ; and the Athenians drew <lb/>
            up against him; while Pharnabazus, outside of the walls of <lb/>
            circumvallation, came to his support with an army and a <lb/>
            numerous cavalry. 6. Hippocrates therefore and Thrasylus, <lb/>
            each with his heavy-armed, fought for a long time; until Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades, with some heavy infantry and his cavalry, came to the <lb/>
            assistance of the latter. And Hippocrates was killed, and those <lb/>
            who were with him fled into the city. 7. At the same time <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, not being able to effect a conjunction with <lb/>
            Hippocrates, owing to the difficulties of the ground, the river <lb/>
            .id the wall of circumvallation being near, retreated to the <lb/>
            precinct of Hercules in the Chalcedonian territory, where his <lb/>
            camp was. 8. After this, Alcibiades went to the Hellespont <lb/>
            and the Chersonesus to raise money; but the rest of the <lb/>
            generals made an arrangement with Pharnabazus, with re­ <lb/>
            gard to Chalcedon, that Pharnabazus should give the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans twenty talents, and conduct an Athenian embassy up to <lb/>
            the king. 9. And they took oaths to Pharnabazus, and adminis­ <lb/>
            tered them to him, that the Chalcedonians should give tribute, <lb/>
            as much as they had been accustomed, to the Athenians, and <lb/>
            pay up the arrears due; and that the Athenians should not <lb/>
            make war on the Chalcedonians until the ambassadors from <lb/>
            the king arrived. 10. Now Alcibiades was not present at this <lb/>
            interchange of oaths, but was in the neighbourhood of Be­ <lb/>
            lymbria ; after taking which place he came to Byzantium, <lb/>
            with the inhabitants of the Chersonesus in full force, and <lb/>
            some soldiers from Thrace, and more than three hundred <lb/>
            horse. 11. Pharnabazus, thinking that he also ought to take the <lb/>
            oaths, was waiting for him at Chalcedon till he should come <lb/>
            from Byzantium ; but when he came, he said he would not take <lb/>
            them, unless Pharnabazus also took them to him. 12. After <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ποταμου̃</foreign>.] i. e. the Chalcedon, which ran through a vallev <lb/>

            this he took them at Chrysopolis before commissioners from <lb/>
            Pharnabazus—Metrobates and Arnapes,—and Pharnabazus <lb/>
            took them at Chalcedon before commissioners from Alcibi­ <lb/>
            ades-Euryptolemus and Diotimus,—both taking the public <lb/>
            oath, and giving mutually on their private account also assur­ <lb/>
            ances of friendship. 13. Pharnabazus then departed imme­ <lb/>
            diately, and told the ambassadors who were going to the king <lb/>
            to meet him at Cyzicus. The Athenians who were sent were <lb/>
            Dorotheus, Philodices, Theogenes, Euryptolemus, and Man­ <lb/>
            titheus; and with them Cleostratus and Pyrrolochus from <lb/>
            Argos; there also went, as an embassy from the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, Pasippidas and .some others; and with them Hermo­ <lb/>
            crates also.' being now exiled from Syracuse, and his brother <lb/>
            Proxenus. 14. So Pharnabazus escorted these, while the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were besieging Byzantium, after circumvallating it, and <lb/>
            were skirmishing and making assaults on the wall. 15. In the <lb/>
            town was Clearchus the Lacedæmonian harmost, and with <lb/>
            him some of the periœci, and a few of the newly enfran­ <lb/>
            chised, and a body of Megarians, with their commander <lb/>
            Helixus of Megara, and another of Bœotians, with their com­ <lb/>
            mander Cœratadas. 16. When the Athenians could produce no <lb/>
            effect by force, they persuaded some of the Byzantines to betray <lb/>
            the place to them. 17. But Clearchus, the harmost, not thinking <lb/>
            that any one would do that, after arranging everything in the <lb/>
            best way he could, and intrusting, the command of the town to <lb/>
            Coeratadas and Helixus, crossed over to Pharnabazus on the <lb/>
            other side of the straits, to get from him money to pay the <lb/>
            soldiers, and to collect vessels, of which there were some in <lb/>
            the Hellespont, left as guard-ships by Pasippidas, and others <lb/>
            at Antandrus, besides those which Hegesandridas (sailing as <lb/>
            a passenger with Mindarus) had on the coast of Thrace ; and <lb/>

            troops into the market-place; but since the enemy were in <lb/>
            possession on all sides, having nothing that they could do, <lb/>
            they gave themselves up. 22. These, then, were sent off to <lb/>

            who was to have the government of the whole sea-board, <lb/>
            and to join the Lacedæmonians in the war; and he was <lb/>

            Athenian ambassadors heard this, and saw Cyrus, they wished, <lb/>
            if possible, to go up to the king; but if not, to go back home. <lb/>
            5. But Cyrus told Pharnabazus either to deliver up the ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors to him, or not to send them back home at present, as <lb/>
            he wished the Athenians not to know what measures were <lb/>
            being taken. 6. So Pharnabazus detained the ambassadors for <lb/>
            some time; telling them at one time, that he would take them <lb/>
            up to the king; at another, that he would send them back <lb/>
            home in a way they would not object to. 7. But when three <lb/>
            years had passed, he begged Cyrus to let them go; saying <lb/>
            that he had sworn to take them back to the sea, since he had <lb/>
            not taken them to the king. So they sent them to Ariobarzanes, <lb/>
            and ordered him to escort them ; and he conducted them back <lb/>
            to Cios in Mysia, whence they sailedback to the rest of the <lb/>
            armament.</p>
          <p>s. Now Alcibiades, wishing to return home with his troops, <lb/>
            put out immediately for Samos; and thence, taking twenty <lb/>
            of the ships, he sailed to the Ceramic Gulf on the coast of <lb/>
            Caria. 9. Thence, after collecting a hundred talents, he came <lb/>
            to Samos. Thrasybulus, with thirty ships, set out for Thrace, <lb/>
            and subdued both the other places in that quarter which had <lb/>
            gone over to the Lacedæmonians, and Thasos, which was being <lb/>
            ravaged both by wars, and seditions, and famine. 10. Thra <lb/>
            sylus, with the rest of the army, sailed home to Athens: but <lb/>
            before his arrival the Athenians chose as their generals, <lb/>
            Alcibiades, who was in banishment, and Thrasybulus, who was <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καστωλόν</foreign>.] Mentioned by Stephanns Byzantinus as a town i: <lb/>

            were at home.</p>
          <p>11. Now Alcibiades sailed with his treasures from Samos to <lb/>
            Paras, with twenty ships; and thence put out straight for <lb/>
            Gythium, to watch the triremes which he heard the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were equipping there, to the number of thirty, and <lb/>
            to observe, with regard to his return home, how the state was <lb/>
            affected towards him. 12. When he saw that it was well dis­ <lb/>
            posed to him, and had chosen him general, and that in private <lb/>
            his friends were sending for him, he sailed into Piræus on the <lb/>
            day on which the city was celebrating the Plynteria, when <lb/>
            the statue of Athena was covered over; which some con­ <lb/>
            sidered as an unfavourable omen both for him and for the <lb/>
            state. For none of the Athenians would venture to transact <lb/>
            any serious business on this day. 13. As he was sailing to shore, <lb/>
            the multitude both from Piræus and from the city crowded to <lb/>
            the ships, wondering, and wishing to see Alcibiades; saying, <lb/>
            some of them, " that he was the best of the citizens, and alone <lb/>
            had pleaded his own defence, as having been not justly <lb/>
            banished, but plotted against by men who were less able than <lb/>
            himself, and who spoke in a more unprincipled manner, and <lb/>
            carried on the government for their own private gain; <lb/>
            whereas he always promoted the general good, both with his <lb/>
            own resources, and with the power of the state.1 14. And <lb/>
            when, on that well-known occasion, he wished to be brought to <lb/>
            trial immediately, when the charge was just brought against <lb/>
            him of having been guilty of impiety with regard to the <lb/>
            mysteries; his enemies, putting off what seemed to be a fair <lb/>
            demand, deprived him of his country in his absence. 15. At <lb/>
            which time, submitting through helplessness, he was compelled <lb/>
            to court his bitterest enemies, being continually in danger of <lb/>
            perishing from day to day : and though he saw those nearest <lb/>
            to him, his fellow-citizens and kinsmen, and the whole state, <lb/>
            taking a wrong course, he had no means of helping it, being <lb/>
            prevented by exile. 16. Further, they declared that such a man <lb/>

            Alcibiades did not land immediately, for fear of his enemies ; <lb/>
            but standing on the deck, looked out to see if his friends were <lb/>
            there. 19. When he saw Euryptolemus, the son of Peisianax, <lb/>
            who was his own cousin, and the rest of his connexions and <lb/>
            his friends with them, he then landed and went up the city, <lb/>
            with a body of men prepared not to allow it, if any one should <lb/>
            meddle with him. 20. In the council and the assembly he de­ <lb/>
            fended himself from the charge of impiety, and declared that <lb/>
            he had been unjustly treated: and when much to this effect <lb/>
            had been spoken, and no one contradicted him, (for the as­ <lb/>
            sembly would not have borne it,) he was declared absolute <lb/>
            commander of all the forces, as being alone able to maintain <lb/>
            the original power of the state. And whereas the Athenians <lb/>
            before conducted the mysteries by sea, 1 on account of the <lb/>
            war, he conducted them by land, leading out all the soldiers. <lb/>
            21. After this Le enrolled a force of fifteen hundred heavy foot <lb/>
            and a hundred and fifty horse, with a hundred ships: and <lb/>
            the third month after his return home, he sailed out against <lb/>
            Andros, which had revolted from the Athenians ; and with <lb/>
            him were sent Aristocrates and Adimantus, the son of <lb/>
            Leucolophidas, who had been chosen as commanders by land. <lb/>
            22. Alcibiades disembarked the army at Gaurium in the An­ <lb/>
            drian territory ; and when the Andrians came out against them, <lb/>
            they routed them, and shut them up within their city, and <lb/>
            killed some few of them, and the Lacedæmonians who were <lb/>
            there. 23. He then erected a trophy, and after remaining there <lb/>
            three days, sailed to Samos; from which place, as the base <lb/>
            of his operations, he carried on the war. <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατἀ θάλατταν</foreign>.] Because they had not dared to travel by the <lb/>

          <p>Lysander, the Spartan admiral, is assisted by Cyrus in equipping his fleet. <lb/>
            Alcibiades goes to meet Thrasybulus at Phocæa. During his absence <lb/>
            Antiochus, contrary to his orders, engages the enemy, and loses fifteen <lb/>
            vessels. The Athenians depose Alcibiades and appoint Conon in his <lb/>
            stead.</p>
          <p>i. A SHORT time previous to these events, when the period <lb/>
            for Cratesippidas being admiral had expired, the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians sent out Lysander in that office. He, after coming to <lb/>
            Rhodes, and taking thence some vessels, sailed to Cos and <lb/>
            Miletus, and thence to Ephesus, where he remained with <lb/>
            seventy ships, till Cyrus arrived at Sardis. 2. When he was <lb/>
            come, he went up to him with the ambassadors from Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon. There, then, they told him of Tissaphernes, how he <lb/>
            had acted; and begged Cyrus himself to be very zealous in <lb/>
            prosecuting the war. 3. Cyrus said, that both his father had <lb/>
            given him such instructions, and he had himself no other <lb/>
            views ; but would carry them all out; and that he had come <lb/>
            with five hundred talents; and if these should fail, he would <lb/>
            make use of his own money which his father had given him ; <lb/>
            and if that also were insufficient, he would cut up even the <lb/>
            throne on which he sat, which was made of silver and gold. <lb/>
            4. They commended these sentiments, and desired him to agree <lb/>
            to give an Attic drachma1 a sailor; informing him that if <lb/>
            that were made the pay, the sailors of the Athenians would <lb/>
            desert their ships, and so he would have to expend less money. <lb/>
            5. He told them that they said well, but it was not possible for <lb/>
            him to act differently to what the king had commanded; and <lb/>
            the agreement was to this effect, that he should give thirty <lb/>
            minæ a month for each ship, whatever number the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians might wish to maintain. 6. Lysander was silent at the <lb/>
            time; but after supper, when Cyrus had drunk his health,2 <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δραχμὴν 'Αττικήν</foreign>.] The sum mentioned by Thucydides, vi. 31 <lb/>

            himself. </note> <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            and asked him what he could do to oblige him most, he said, <lb/>
            “ If you would add to the pay an obolus a sailor.” 7. From <lb/>
            this time the pay was four oboli, but before it had been only <lb/>
            three. And he both paid up the arrears, and further gave a <lb/>
            month's pay in advance; so that the armament was much <lb/>
            more full of spirits. 8. The Athenians, on hearing these things, <lb/>
            were disheartened, and sent ambassadors to Cyrus through <lb/>
            Tissaphernes. 9. But he would not admit them, though Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes begged him, and urged him to provide (as he him­ <lb/>
            self used to do, at the suggestion of Alcibiades) that none <lb/>
            of the Greeks might be powerful, but all weak, through their <lb/>
            party quarrels amongst themselves. 10. When the fleet had <lb/>
            been organized by him, Lysander hauled up his ships at <lb/>
            Ephesus, ninety in number, and kept quiet, refitting them, <lb/>
            and refreshing the crews.</p>
          <p><unclear/> 1 Now Alcibiades, hearing that Thrasybulus had come out <lb/>
            of the Hellespont, and was fortifying Phocæa, sailed across to <lb/>
            him, leaving in command of the fleet Antiochus, the master on <lb/>
            board his own ship, with instructions not to sail against Ly­ <lb/>
            sander's fleet. 12. But Antiochus, going with his own ship and <lb/>
            another from Notium into the harbour of Ephesus, sailed along <lb/>
            by the very prows of Lysander's ships. 13. Launching in <lb/>
            the first instance but a few of his vessels, Lysander gave <lb/>
            him chase; but when the Athenians came to support Antio­ <lb/>
            chus with more ships, then indeed he drew up his whole <lb/>
            number, and sailed against them. Afterwards the Athenians <lb/>
            also launched the rest of their triremes at Notium, and put <lb/>
            out to sea, as each cleared the shore. 14. Upon this they en­ <lb/>
            gaged, the Lacedæmonians being in line, but the Athenians <lb/>
            with their ships dispersed, until they took to flight after <lb/>
            losing fifteen triremes. Of the men the greater part escaped, <lb/>
            but some were taken prisoners. After taking possession of <lb/>
            the ships and erecting a trophy on Notium, Lysander sailed <lb/>
            across to Ephesus, and the Athenians to Samos. 15. After this, <lb/>
            Alcibiades came to Samos, and put out with all his ships to <lb/>
            the harbour of Ephesus, and drew them up before the mouth <lb/>
            of it, in case any one might wish to give him battle. But <lb/>
            when Lysander did not put out against him, because he was <lb/>
            inferior to him by many ships, he sailed back to Samos. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, a little after, take Delphinium and Eion. <lb/>
            6. And the Athenians at home, when news of the sea-fight was <pb n="304"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            brought, were angry with Alcibiades, thinking he had lost <lb/>
            the ships through carelessness and intemperance; and they <lb/>
            chose ten other generals, Conon, Diomedon, Leon, Pericles, <lb/>
            Erasinidas, Aristocrates, Archestratus, Protomachus, Thrasy­ <lb/>
            lus, and Aristogenes. 17. Alcibiades therefore, being in ill <lb/>
            favour with the army also, took one trireme, and sailed away <lb/>
            to the Chersonesus, to his own castle. is. And subsequently <lb/>
            Conon came from Andros, with the twenty ships he had under <lb/>
            him, as voted by the Athenians, and sailed to Samos to join <unclear/> <lb/>
            he fleet. In the place of Conon they sent Phanosthenes to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Α</foreign>ndros, with four ships. 19. He, having fallen in with two <lb/>
            Thurian triremes, took them with their crews; and the <lb/>
            Athenians threw all the prisoners into irons ; but on Dorieus, <lb/>
            their commander, (who was a Rhodian, and had formerly <lb/>
            been outlawed by the Athenians while living as a citizen <lb/>
            amongst them, with sentence of death passed upon him and <lb/>
            his kinsmen,) they had compassion, and released him without <lb/>
            even exacting a ransom from him. 20. When Conon came to <lb/>
            Samos, and found the fleet out of spirits, having completely <lb/>
            manned seventy ships instead of the former number, which <lb/>
            was more than a hundred, and putting out to sea with these <lb/>
            in conjunction with the other generals, he landed in different <lb/>
            parts of the enemy's country, and ravaged it. 21. And so the <lb/>
            year ended, in which the Carthaginians made an expedition <lb/>
            to Sicily, with a hundred and twenty triremes, and a land­ <lb/>
            force of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and reduced <lb/>
            Agrigentum by famine; for though they were defeated in <lb/>
            battle, they sat down before it seven months.</p>

            Athens, Pityas being ephor, and Callias archon at Athens, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians sent Callicratidas to the fleet, Lysander's <lb/>
            period of command having now expired, and twenty-two years <lb/>
            of the war. 2. When Lysander gave up the ships, he told <lb/>
            Callicratidas that he did so while in command of the sea, <lb/>
            and after gaining the victory in a naval action. Callicratidas <lb/>
            told him to coast along from Ephesus, with Samos, where the <lb/>
            Athenian fleet was, on his left hand, and give up the ships at <lb/>
            Miletus; and then he would confess that he had command of <lb/>
            the sell. 3. When Lysander declined being so officious while <lb/>
            another man was in office, Callicratidas himself, in addition to <lb/>
            the vessels he had received from Lysander, manned from <lb/>
            Chios and Rhodes, and other places belonging to the allies, <lb/>
            fifty ships besides. Having combined all these, to the num­ <lb/>
            ber of a hundred and forty, he made preparations for meeting <lb/>
            the enemy. 4. But finding that he was factiously opposed by <lb/>
            the friends of Lysander, who not only served him without any <lb/>
            zeal, but also spread it abroad in the different states that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians very greatly erred in changing their admirals <lb/>
            so often-in the place of those who had grown fit for the <lb/>
            office, and had just acquired a knowledge of naval matters, <lb/>
            and knew how to behave to people in those parts, sending <lb/>
            men who were unacquainted with the sea, and unknown to <lb/>
            people there,-and so1 were in danger of incurring some dis­ <lb/>
            aster on this account; finding this, I say, Callicratidas assem­ <lb/>
            bled those of the Lacedemonians who were there, and ad­ <lb/>
            dressed them as follows:</p>
          <p>5. “ I am contented to remain at home ; and whether Lysan­ <lb/>
            der or any one else professes to be more experienced in naval <lb/>

            to report the state of things here."</p>
          <p>6. When no one dared to express any opinion, but that he <lb/>
            should obey those at home, and do what he came for, lie went <lb/>
            to Cyrus, and asked for pay for the seamen : but he told him <lb/>
            to wait two days. 7. Callicratidas, annoyed at being put off, <lb/>
            and at having to go repeatedly to his doors, grew angry, and <lb/>
            said that the Greeks were most miserable men, in having to <lb/>
            fawn on Barbarians for money: and, declaring that if he got <lb/>
            safe home, to the best of his ability he would reconcile the <lb/>
            Athenians and Lacedæmonians, he sailed away to Miletus. <lb/>
            8. There, after sending triremes to Lacedæmon for money, he <lb/>
            convened an assembly of the Milesians, and spoke thus: <lb/>
            " For me, Milesians, it is necessary to obey the rulers at home : <lb/>
            and on you I call to be most zealous in the war, inasmuch as, <lb/>
            through living amongst the Barbarians, you have suffered ere <lb/>
            now most evil at their hands. 9. And you ought to take the <lb/>
            lead of the rest of the allies, in order that we may do the <lb/>
            quickest and the greatest mischief to the enemy, until those <lb/>
            come from Sparta whom I have sent to fetch pecuniary <lb/>
            supplies. 10. For what there were here Lysander, before he <lb/>
            took his departure, gave back to Cyrus, as being more than <lb/>
            were wanted. And Cyrus, when I went to him, continually <lb/>
            put off giving me an audience; and I could not persuade <lb/>
            myself to be repeatedly going to his doors. 11. But I promise <lb/>
            you, that in return for the benefits conferred on us while we <lb/>
            are expecting our supplies from home, I will repay you with <lb/>
            becoming gratitude. Come then, let us, with the help of the <lb/>
            gods, show the Barbarians, that without paying court to <lb/>
            them, we are able to avenge ourselves on our enemies." <lb/>
            12. When he had thus spoken, many rose, and especially those <lb/>
            who were charged with being opposed to him, (for they <lb/>
            were afraid,) and proposed a grant of money, themselves also <lb/>
            promising more from their own private resources. Having <lb/>
            received the supplies, and obtained from Chios five drachmae <lb/>
            for each of the sailors, he sailed against Methymna in Lesbos, <lb/>
            which was hostile to them. 13. When the Methymnæans would <lb/>
            not surrender, but had an Athenian garrison in the place, and <lb/>
            those at the head of affairs were on the Athenian side, he <lb/>
            assaulted the town, and took it by storm. 14. The whole of the <lb/>
            property, then, was plundered by the soldiers; but all the <pb n="307"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            slaves Callicratidas collected into the market-place; and when <lb/>
            the allies urged him to sell the Methymnasans also, he said <lb/>
            that whilst he was commander none of the Greeks should be <lb/>
            enslaved, so far as he could prevent it. 15. The next day he set <lb/>
            at liberty the free-men, and the Athenian garrison, and sold <lb/>
            all the slaves 1 that were of servile origin ; and told Canon <lb/>
            that he would stop his dallying with the sea. At day-break, <lb/>
            observing him putting out to sea, he gave chase, cutting him <lb/>
            off from the passage to Samos, that he might not flee thither. <lb/>
            16. Conon had fast-sailing ships for his flight, because the best <lb/>
            seamen had been picked out of many vessels, and put into a <lb/>
            few : and he takes refuge at Mitylene in Lesbos, and with him <lb/>
            two of the ten generals, Leon and Erasinides. Callicratidas <lb/>
            sailed in with them into the harbour, pursuing them with a <lb/>
            hundred and seventy ships.</p>
          <p>17. Being thus stopped by the enemy before he could go any <lb/>
            farther, Conon was compelled to engage in the harbour, and <lb/>
            lost thirty ships, the crews, however, escaping to the shore. <lb/>
            The rest of his vessels, forty in number, he hauled up under <lb/>
            the wall. 18. Callicratidas anchored in the harbour, and block­ <lb/>
            aded him there, having command of the passage out. He <lb/>
            sent also by land for the Methymnæans in full force, and car­ <lb/>
            ried over the troops from Chios; while pecuniary supplies <lb/>
            reached him from Cyrus. 19. When Conon was thus besieged <lb/>
            both by land and sea, and could from no quarter obtain sup­ <lb/>
            plies of provisions, while the number of men in the place was <lb/>
            large, and the Athenians did not come to rescue him, through <lb/>
            not hearing of the circumstances; he launched the two fast­ <lb/>
            est sailers of his fleet, and manned them before day-break, <lb/>
            picking the best rowers out of all the ships, and removing the <lb/>
            soldiers into the hold, and putting up the curtains.2 20. During <lb/>
            the day, then, they thus continued ; and in the evening, when <lb/>
            it was dark, he landed them, so as not to be seen by the enemy <lb/>
            in doing it. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἀνδράποδα τὰ δου̃λα</foreign>, i. e. in opposition to those who had <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> On the fifth day, having put on board a moderate stock <lb/>
            of provisions, when it was now noon, and the blockading <lb/>
            squadron were paying little attention, and some of them were <lb/>
            refreshing themselves, they sailed out of the harbour, one <lb/>
            of them making all speed for the Hellespont, the other for the <lb/>
            open sea. 21. The blockaders, as they severally cleared, cutting <lb/>
            their cables and bestirring themselves, prepared to go after <lb/>
            them in disorder, for they happened to have been at breakfast on <lb/>
            shore ; and having gone on board, they gave chase to the one <lb/>
            which had rushed into the open sea, and overtook it at sun­ <lb/>
            set ; and after defeating it in action, took it in tow, and led it <lb/>
            back to the camp, crew and all. 22. But the ship which had <lb/>
            fled for the Hellespont escaped, and arriving at Athens, <lb/>
            brought tidings of the siege. And Diomedon went with <lb/>
            twelve ships to the rescue of Canon thus besieged, and came <lb/>
            to anchor in the Euripus of Mitylene. 23. Callicratidas immedi­ <lb/>
            ately sailed against him, and took ten of his ships, Diomedon <lb/>
            escaping with his own and another. 24. When the Athenians <lb/>
            heard of these facts, and of the siege, they voted to send suc­ <lb/>
            cours with a hundred and ten ships, compelling all who were <lb/>
            of age to go on board, both slaves and freemen; and in thirty <lb/>
            days they had manned the hundred and ten ships, and set sail; <lb/>
            many even of the knights having gone on board. 25. After­ <lb/>
            wards they put out to Samos, and took thence ten Samian <lb/>
            ships. They mustered also more than thirty others from the rest <lb/>
            of the allies, compelling all to go on board ; and in the same way <lb/>
            with any they happened to have abroad. The total number <lb/>
            amounted to more than a hundred and fifty. 26. On hearing of <lb/>
            this reinforcement being already at Samos, Callicratidas left <lb/>
            where he was fifty ships, with Eteonicus as commander, and <lb/>
            putting to sea with the remaining hundred and twenty, took <lb/>
            his evening meal at the promontory of Malea in Lesbos, over <lb/>
            against Mitylene. 27. The same day the Athenians also hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be taking theirs at the Arginusæ, which lie oppo­ <lb/>
            site Lesbos, near the promontory of Malea, over against Mity­ <lb/>
            lene. 28. Having seen their fires in the night, and some men <lb/>
            having brought him word that they were the Athenians, he <lb/>
            weighed anchor about midnight, that lie might fall on them <lb/>
            unexpectedly; but heavy rain and thunder coming on pre­ <lb/>
            vented his putting out to sea. When the storm had ceased, at <lb/>
            day-break he sailed to the Arginusæ. 29. And the Athenians <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            their left wing put out into the open sea to meet him, drawn <lb/>
            up as follows. Aristocrates, occupying the extreme left, <lb/>
            took the lead with fifteen ships, and then came Diomedon <lb/>
            with fifteen more. Behind Aristocrates was posted Pericles, <lb/>
            and behind Diomedon, Erasinides. By the side of Diomedon <lb/>
            were the Samians with ten ships, drawn up in single line, <lb/>
            and commanded by a Samian, named Hippias. Next were <lb/>
            ten vessels of the Taxiarchs,1 also in single line ; and behind <lb/>
            these the three of the admirals, and whatever others there <lb/>
            were belonging to the allies. 30. The right wing was held by <lb/>
            Protomachus with fifteen ships ; and by the side of him was <lb/>
            Thrasylus with fifteen more; Lysias, with an equal number, <lb/>
            being posted behind Protomachus, and Aristogenes behind <lb/>
            Thrasylus. 31. They were drawn up in this way that they <lb/>
            might not allow any breaking through their line; for they <lb/>
            were worse sailors than the enemy.</p>
          <p>The ships of the Lacedæmonians were all drawn up in <lb/>
            single line, prepared for breaking through the enemy's line, <lb/>
            and tacking about again; for they were better sailors. Their <lb/>
            right wing was held by Callicratidas. 32. He was told by Her­ <lb/>
            mon the Megarian, master of his own vessel, that it was ad­ <lb/>
            visable for him to retire; for the triremes of the Athenians <lb/>
            were far the more numerous. Callicratidas said, that Sparta <lb/>
            would be none the worse governed for his death, while to flee <lb/>
            was disgraceful.</p>
          <p>33. After this the fleets engaged for a long time, at first in a <lb/>
            close body, and afterwards separately. But when Callicratidas, <lb/>
            on his ship's making a charge, fell off into the sea, and was <lb/>
            seen no more, and Protomachus with his division on the right <lb/>
            defeated the enemy's left; upon that the Peloponnesians fled <lb/>
            to Chios, and the greatest part of them even to Phocaea : <lb/>
            while the Athenians sailed back again to the Arginusæ. 34. <lb/>
            There were lost, on the side of the Athenians, twenty-five <lb/>
            ships with their crews, except a few men who were floated <lb/>
            to the shore ; and on that of the Peloponnesians, nine Laco­ <lb/>
            nian vessels, their whole number being, but ten, and of the <lb/>
            rest of the allies more than sixty.</p>
          <p>35. Now it was determined by the generals of the Athenians, <lb/>
            that Theramenes and Thrasybulus, who commanded triremes, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν ταξιάρχων</foreign>. " Who however were properly military officers. <lb/>

            and some of the taxiarchs, should sail with forty-seven ships <lb/>
            to the vessels that were sunk,1 and the men upon them ; while <lb/>
            with the rest they went against the squadron with Eteonicus <lb/>
            blockading Mitylene. But when they wished so to do, a <lb/>
            storm of wind, coming on with violence, prevented them. So <lb/>
            they erected a trophy, and passed the night there.</p>
          <p>36. All the particulars of the sea-fight were reported to Eteo­ <lb/>
            nicus by his boat in attendance; but he immediately sent it <lb/>
            out again, telling those on board to sail out in silence, and to <lb/>
            speak to nobody; but immediately to come back again to <lb/>
            their encampment with crowns on their heads, and crying out, <lb/>
            “ Callicratidas has gained the victory in a sea-fight, and all the <lb/>
            ships of the Athenians are destroyed." 37. They did so: and <lb/>
            he, when they sailed in, offered sacrifices for the good tidings ; <lb/>
            at the same time sending round orders to the soldiers to take <lb/>
            their supper, and to the merchants to put their property on <lb/>
            board their vessels in silence, and sail away to Chios, the <lb/>
            wind being favourable for them, and the triremes likewise as <lb/>
            quickly as possible. He himself led off the land force to Me­ <lb/>
            thymna, after burning his camp. 3S. When the enemy had re­ <lb/>
            treated, and the wind was calmer, Conon launched his ships, <lb/>
            and meeting the Athenians, who had now put out from the Argi­ <lb/>
            nusæ, told them the fact concerning Eteonicus. Thence they <lb/>
            pushed out against Chios; and having effected nothing there, <lb/>
            sailed back for Samos.</p>

          <p>The Athenians depose and bring to trial the victorious generals for not <lb/>
            having taken up their men from the wrecks. Speech of Euryptolemus <lb/>
            in their defence. They are condemned, and six of them, then in the city, <lb/>
            are put to death. The people soon afterwards repent, and impeach their <lb/>
            accusers.</p>
          <p>1. Now the people at home deposed these generals, with the <lb/>
            exception of Conon ; in addition to whom they appointed <lb/>
            Adimantus, and Philocles as the third. Of the generals who <lb/>
            had joined in the sea-fight, Protomachus and Aristogenes did <lb/>

            Pericles, Diomedon, Lysias, Aristocrates, Thrasylus, and <lb/>
            Erasinides, Archedemus, who was at that time the leader of <lb/>
            the commons at Athens, and superintendent of Decelea, im­ <lb/>
            posed a penalty on Erasinides, and accused him in a court of <lb/>
            justice, declaring that he was in possession of a sum of money <lb/>
            from the Hellespont, which belonged to the people. He also <lb/>
            brought a charge against him with reference to his conduct <lb/>
            as general; and the resolution of the court was to imprison <lb/>
            Erasinides. 3. After this the generals made a statement before <lb/>
            the council concerning the naval engagement, and the vio­ <lb/>
            lence of the storm. And when Timocrates said that the others <lb/>
            also ought to be imprisoned and brought before the people, <lb/>
            the council imprisoned them. 4. Afterwards an assembly was <lb/>
            held, in which both others accused the generals, and especially <lb/>
            Theramenes, saying that they ought to be brought to trial for <lb/>
            not having rescued the men on the wrecks. For as evidence <lb/>
            that they blamed no one else for it, he brought forward a <lb/>
            despatch which the generals had sent to the council and the <lb/>
            people, laying the blame in it on nothing else but the storm. <lb/>
            5. After this the generals each made a short defence, (for they <lb/>
            were not formally called on to speak, according to law,) re­ <lb/>
            lating the facts of the case; namely, that they were them­ <lb/>
            selves sailing against the enemy, but gave orders for the <lb/>
            rescue of the men on the wrecks to certain of the captains, <lb/>
            who were able men, and had already held command, namely, <lb/>
            Theramenes and Thrasybulus, and others of the same cha­ <lb/>
            racter. 6. And if they ought to blame any with regard to the <lb/>
            rescue of the men, they could blame none but those to whom <lb/>
            the orders were given. " At the same time," said they, " we <lb/>
            will not, because they accuse us, speak what is false, by say­ <lb/>
            ing that they are to blame; but that it was the violence of <lb/>
            the storm which prevented their rescuing them." As wit­ <lb/>
            nesses of this they offered to bring forward the pilots, and <lb/>
            many others who were on board with them. 7. By thus speak­ <lb/>
            ing they convinced the people ; and many private individuals <lb/>
            rose up and wished to be sureties for them; but it was re­ <lb/>
            solved to adjourn it to another assembly, (for it was then late, <lb/>
            and they could not have seen clearly the show of hands,) and <lb/>
            that the council, having previously deliberated on it, should <lb/>

            fathers and members of families meet together. Theramenes <lb/>
            and his party therefore got ready a number of men at this <lb/>
            festival, dressed in black, and with their heads closely shaved, <lb/>
            to come before the assembly, as kinsmen of those who had <lb/>
            been lost; and they persuaded Callixenus to accuse the <lb/>
            generals. 9. Upon that they held an assembly, at which the <lb/>
            council, with Callixenus as its spokesman, brought in its own <lb/>
            decree, to the following effect.</p>
          <p>"Forasmuch as at the former assembly they have heard <lb/>
            both the accusers of the generals, and the generals speaking <lb/>
            in their own defence; let all the Athenians severally give <lb/>
            their votes by tribes. Let them place for each tribe two <lb/>
            urns; and in each tribe let the herald proclaim, ‘Whoever <lb/>
            thinks that the generals are guilty, for not having rescued the <lb/>
            men who won the victory in the sea-fight, let him put his <lb/>
            ballot into the former of the two urns; whoever thinks they <lb/>
            are not, into the latter.' 10. If they are considered guilty, let <lb/>
            them sentence them to death, and deliver them over to the <lb/>
            Eleven, their goods being confiscated, and a tithe of them re­ <lb/>
            served for the goddess."</p>
          <p>11. Now there came forward into the assembly a man who said <lb/>
            that he had escaped on a meal-tub, and that those who were <lb/>
            perishing gave him a command, in case he should be saved, <lb/>
            to carry word to the people that the generals had not rescued <lb/>
            those who had proved themselves most brave men in their <lb/>
            country's behalf. 12. But Euryptolemus, son of Peisianax, and <lb/>
            some others, summoned Callixenus to stand his trial, declaring <lb/>
            that he had drawn up an illegal decree. Some of the people <lb/>
            approved of this ; but the greater part cried out, that it was <lb/>
            . strange if any one would not allow the people to do as it <lb/>
            pleased. 13. Upon this when Lyciscus had moved that they too <lb/>
            should be tried by the same balloting as the generals, if they <lb/>
            did not let the assembly go its own way; the mob was again <lb/>
            clamorous, and they were compelled to abandon their sum­ <lb/>
            monses. 14. But when some of the presidents refused to put the <lb/>
            question to the vote contrary to the laws, Callixenus again <lb/>
            rose up, and charged them in the same terms; while his sup­ <lb/>
            porters called out that they should summon the recusants. IS. <lb/>
            So the presidents were frightened, and agreed all of them to put <lb/>
            it, with the exception of Socrates the son of Sophroniseus; <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            who said that he would only act according to law. 16. After <lb/>
            this, Euryptolemus mounted the tribune, and spoke in behalf <lb/>
            of the generals, as follows:</p>
          <p>" I have come up here, men of Athens, partly to censure <lb/>
            Pericles, my kinsman and associate, and Diomedon my friend ; <lb/>
            partly to speak in their defence ; and partly to give you such <lb/>
            advice as I think best for the state. 17. I censure them then, be­ <lb/>
            cause, when their colleagues wished to send a despatch to the <lb/>
            council and to you, to the effect that they had commanded Thera­ <lb/>
            menes and Thrasybulus with forty-seven ships to rescue the men <lb/>
            on the wrecks, and they had not done so, they dissuaded them <lb/>
            from it. 18. Consequently they now incur general blame, though <lb/>
            it was only those individuals who did wrong; and in return <lb/>
            for their kindness at that time, they are now plotted against <lb/>
            by the objects of it, and some others, and are in danger of <lb/>
            losing their lives. But not so, if you will be persuaded by <lb/>
            me, and do what is just and right, and by means of which you <lb/>
            will best hear the truth; instead of repenting afterwards, <lb/>
            and finding that you have sinned most grievously against both <lb/>
            the gods and yourselves. 19. I give you, then, advice by which <lb/>
            it is not possible for you to be deceived, either by me or by <lb/>
            any one else; but you will know and punish those who are <lb/>
            guilty, in whatever way you choose to try them, whether all <lb/>
            together, or one by one, allowing them, if not more, yet at <lb/>
            least one day for defending themselves, and not believing <lb/>
            others more than yourselves. 20. You know, men of Athens, <lb/>
            that the decree of Cannonus is a very severe one, which orders, <lb/>
            that if any one wrong the people of the Athenians, he <lb/>
            shall plead his cause in chains before the people, and if <lb/>
            condemned as guilty, shall be put to death, and thrown into <lb/>
            the pit; his goods being confiscated, and a tithe of them being <lb/>
            devoted to the goddess.' 21. By this decree I recommend that <lb/>
            the generals should be tried, and, by heaven, if you think fit, <lb/>
            Pericles, my own kinsmen, first of them: for it were base in <lb/>
            me to prize him more highly than the state. 22. Or, if you pre­ <lb/>
            fer it, try them by this law, which is enacted against sacrilegi­ <lb/>
            ous men and traitors; ‘ that if any one either betray the state, <lb/>
            or steal what is holy, he shall be tried in a court of justice, <lb/>
            and, if condemned, shall be refused burial in Attica; and <lb/>
            that his goods shall be confiscated.' 23. By whichever of <lb/>
            these two laws you please, Athenians, let the men be tried, <pb n="314"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            each singly, and making three distinct parts of the day; <lb/>
            one for your assembling and giving your votes, as to whether <lb/>
            you consider them guilty or not; another for accusing them; <lb/>
            and another for their making their defence. 24. If this be done, <lb/>
            the guilty will incur the heaviest vengeance, and the innocent <lb/>
            will be released by you, men of Athens, and not be put to death <lb/>
            as guilty. 25. You, at the same time, will judge according to the <lb/>
            law, with due regard for religion, and for your oaths ; and will <lb/>
            not aid the Lacedæmonians in the war, by putting to death <lb/>
            without a trial, contrary to the law, those who took from them <lb/>
            seventy ships, and gained the victory over them. 26. And what <lb/>
            are you really afraid of that you are in such a hurry ? Is it, <lb/>
            that you would not put to death, or release, whom you choose, <lb/>
            if you tried them according to law, and not contrary to law, <lb/>
            as Callixenus persuaded the council to bring in its decree be­ <lb/>
            fore the people for deciding by a single balloting ? 1 27. Nay, but <lb/>
            in that case you might perhaps put to death some one who was <lb/>
            innocent; and you will be sorry for it afterwards. But remember <lb/>
            that regret is then but a painful and useless thing ; and, more­ <lb/>
            over, that it is with regard to man's life that you were mistaken. <lb/>
            28. And you would act shamefully, if, in the case of Aristar­ <lb/>
            chus, who tried to abolish the democracy, and then to betray <lb/>
            Œnoe to the Thebans, who were your enemies, you allowed <lb/>
            him a day for defending himself as he wished, and afforded <lb/>
            him all other advantages, according to law; but will deprive <lb/>
            of these very things the generals who did everything accord­ <lb/>
            ing to your wishes, and gained the victory over your enemies. <lb/>
            29. Nay, act not so, Athenians ; but maintaining the laws, which <lb/>
            are your own, and by means of which, more than anything <lb/>
            else, you have attained to the greatest power, without them <lb/>
            attempt to do nothing. But now go back with me to the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances themselves, under which the offences of the gene­ <lb/>
            rals are thought to have been committed. When they re­ <lb/>
            turned to land after being victorious in the sea-fight, Diomedon <lb/>
            advised that all of them should put to sea in single column, <lb/>
            and recover the wrecks and the men upon them; while Era­ <lb/>
            sinides was of opinion that they should all sail as quickly as <lb/>
            possible against the enemy; and Thrasylus represented that <note type="footnote">1 Of the many emendations which have been proposed for this <lb/>
            corrupt passage, I think that of Kœppen the simplest and best, <lb/>
            lamely, to insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναμνήσθητε</foreign>. </note> <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] <lb/>
            </note>both these objects might be secured, if they left some of their <lb/>
            ships there, and with the rest sailed against the enemy. <lb/>
            30. When this course had been adopted, they agreed that each of <lb/>
            the generals, who were eight in number, should leave behind <lb/>
            three vessels of his division, with the ten of the taxiarehs, the <lb/>
            ten of the Samians, and the three of the admirals. These <lb/>
            altogether amount to seven and forty, four for each of the <lb/>
            lost ships, which were twelve in number. 31. Amongst the <lb/>
            Taxiarehs left behind were both Thrasybulus and Thera­ <lb/>
            menes, who in the former assembly was the accuser of the <lb/>
            generals. With the rest of the ships they sailed against those <lb/>
            of the enemy. In which of these things did they not act <lb/>
            ably and well ? It is but right, therefore, that for any mea­ <lb/>
            sures against the enemy which were not well executed, those <lb/>
            who were appointed to act against them should be called to <lb/>
            account; but that those who were appointed to recover the <lb/>
            wrecks, if they did not do what the generals ordered, should <lb/>
            be tried, as to the reasons for their not recovering them. <lb/>
            32. This much, however, I can say for both of them, that it was <lb/>
            the storm which prevented their executing any of the com­ <lb/>
            mands of the generals. As witnesses of this, there are the <lb/>
            men who escaped by their own good fortune, and amongst <lb/>
            them one of our generals, who was saved oil board a ship <lb/>
            that went down ; and whom, though at that time he needed <lb/>
            to be rescued himself, they require to be tried at the same <lb/>
            balloting as those who did not do what they were commanded. <lb/>
            33. Do not now, men of Athens, instead of acting consistently <lb/>
            with your victory and good fortune, behave like men who are <lb/>
            vanql shed and unfortunate; and instead of recognising the <lb/>
            irresistible will of heaven, appear to be unfeeling, by charging <lb/>
            them with treason, instead of want of power, because they <lb/>
            were not able, in consequence of the storm, to do what they <lb/>
            were commanded. Nay, but it were much more just to re­ <lb/>
            ward the conquerors with crowns, than to punish them with <lb/>
            death, at the instigation of evil men."</p>
          <p>34. Having thus spoken, Euryptolemus drew up a resolution <lb/>
            that the men should be tried according to the decree of Can­ <lb/>
            nonus, each separately: whereas that of the council was to <lb/>
            try them all by a single balloting. On these motions being <lb/>
            put to the assembly, at first they decided in favour of that of <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            Euryptolemus; but when Menecles protested on oath,1 and <lb/>
            the motions were again put, they decided in favour of the <lb/>
            council's. Subsequently they condemned the generals who <lb/>
            had fought the battle, eight in number; and the six of them <lb/>
            who were present were put to death. 34. No long time after, <lb/>
            the Athenians repented of their conduct, and passed a decree, <lb/>
            that whoever had been the deceivers of the people, an im­ <lb/>
            peachment of them should be proposed, and they should give <lb/>
            securities, until they were brought to trial; and that Callix­ <lb/>
            enus should be included in their number. Four others also <lb/>
            were impeached, and put in bonds by their securities. But <lb/>
            subsequently, on the occurrence of a certain sedition, in which <lb/>
            Cleophon was killed, these escaped before being brought to <lb/>
            trial. Callixenus was restored at the same time as2 those in <lb/>
            the Piræeus returned into the city ; but being bated by all, he <lb/>
            died of starvation.</p>

          <p>Eteonicus crushes a plot of his destitute forces to plunder Chios. At the <lb/>
            request of the allies, Lysander is sent out as second in command of the <lb/>
            fleet, and after storming Lampsacus, destroys the Athenian fleet at Ægos­ <lb/>
            potami. He puts to death all his prisoners, except Adimantus.</p>
          <p>1. THE soldiers who were at Chios with Eteonicus, so long as <lb/>
            the summer lasted, supported themselves on the fruits of the <lb/>
            season, and by working for hire through the country. But <lb/>
            when winter came on, and they had no food, and were in <lb/>
            want of clothes and shoes, they combined together, and formed <lb/>
            a plot for making an attack upon Chios ; and it was arranged <lb/>
            that such as approved of this should carry a reed, that they <lb/>
            might recognise one another, and ascertain how many they <lb/>
            were. 2. On hearing of the plot, Eteonicus was at a loss how to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομοσαμένου</foreign>. " According to Hud-t-walcher, p. 96, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπω­ <lb/>
            μοσία</foreign> was a protest upon oath, which had the effect of suspending <lb/>
            the force of the decree, until the question of its legality had been <lb/>
            decided.” Thirlwall. 2 See book II. ch. 4. </note> <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] <lb/>
            </note>treat the matter, owing to the great number of the reed­ <lb/>
            bearers. For to take it in hand openly seemed dangerous, <lb/>
            lest they should run to their arms, and take possession of the <lb/>
            city, and, proceeding to hostilities with him, ruin the whole <lb/>
            cause, if they gained the mastery. And, on the other hand, <lb/>
            to put to death allies in great numbers appeared a formidable <lb/>
            thing, lest they should incur a degree of prejudice with the <lb/>
            rest of the Greeks also, and the soldiers should be ill-affected <lb/>
            to the cause. 3. Accordingly he took with him fifteen men with <lb/>
            daggers, and went into the city; and meeting with a man who had <lb/>
            the ophthalmia, as he was coming out of a surgery, with a reed, <lb/>
            in his hand, he slew him. 4. And when a disturbance was made, <lb/>
            and some inquired why the man was killed, Eteonicus ordered <lb/>
            them to spread the report, that it was because he had the reed. <lb/>
            On this report being circulated, all that had the reeds threw <lb/>
            them away, each one who successively heard it being afraid of <lb/>
            being seen with one. 5. Afterwards Eteonicus called the Chians <lb/>
            together, and urged them to contribute a sum of money, that <lb/>
            the sailors might receive their pay, and not form any revolu­ <lb/>
            tionary schemes. They made the contributions ; and at the <lb/>
            same time he gave orders for going on board the ships ; and <lb/>
            visiting them in turns alongside of each vessel, he both en­ <lb/>
            couraged them and gave them much advice, as though he <lb/>
            knew nothing of what had happened, and distributed to each <lb/>
            of them a month's pay. 6. Subsequently the Chians and the <lb/>
            rest of the allies assembled at Ephesus, and resolved, after <lb/>
            consultation on the present state of affairs, to send ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors to Lacedæmon to state these facts, and to ask for Lysan­ <lb/>
            der to be sent to the fleet, as he was in good favour with the <lb/>
            allies, on the strength of his former discharge of the admiral's <lb/>
            office, when he gained the victory in the sea-fight at Notium. <lb/>
            7. Accordingly ambassadors were sent, and with them also mes­ <lb/>
            sengers from Cyrus, speaking to the same effect. The Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians granted them Lysander as second in command, but <lb/>
            Aracus as admiral; for it is not lawful with them for the same <lb/>
            man to be admiral twice. They gave up, however, the fleet to <lb/>
            Lysander, when twenty-five years of the war had now expired.</p>
          <p>8. In the course of this year Cyrus put to death Autoboesaces <lb/>
            and Mitræus, who were sons of the sister of Dariæus,1 the <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς Δαρειαίου ἀδελφη̃ς</foreign>.] Schneider observes that the want of a <lb/>
            correct genealogy renders this passage inexplicable. </note> <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            daughter of Xerxes, the father of Darius, because, when they <lb/>
            met him, they did not thrust their hands through their sleeve, <lb/>
            which they do for the king alone ; the sleeve being longer than <lb/>
            the hand, so that a man who has his hand in it can do no­ <lb/>
            thing. 9. Hieramenes therefore and his wife represented to <lb/>
            Darius, that it was shameful if he overlooked his excessive <lb/>
            presumption ; and accordingly he sent for him, on the plea of <lb/>
            illness, despatching messengers for the purpose.</p>
          <p>10. The following year, when Archytas was ephor, and <lb/>
            Alexius archon at Athens, Lysander, on his arrival at Ephesus, <lb/>
            sent for Eteonicus to Chios with his ships, and combined all the <lb/>
            others, wherever there was one, and both refitted these and <lb/>
            built more at Antandrus. 11. He went also to Cyrus and asked <lb/>
            him for money ; but he told him that all he had received from <lb/>
            the king was expended, and much more beside ; showing him <lb/>
            how much each of the admirals had ; yet he gave him some <lb/>
            notwithstanding. 12. And when Lysander had got the money, <lb/>
            he appointed captains to the galleys, and paid off the arrears <lb/>
            due to the sailors. Meantime the generals of the Athenians <lb/>
            also were raising supplies for the fleet at Samos.</p>
          <p>13. After this, Cyrus sent for Lysander, on the arrival of a <lb/>
            messenger from his father, saying that he was ill, and desired <lb/>
            his presence, being at Thamneria in Media, in the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood of the Cadusians, against whom he had made an expe­ <lb/>
            dition, as they had revolted. 14. When Lysander came, he urged <lb/>
            him not to fight by sea with the Athenians, unless he had by <lb/>
            far the larger fleet. For both the king and himself, he said, <lb/>
            had money in abundance; so that, as far as that was concerned, <lb/>
            he might man many ships. And he assigned to him all the <lb/>
            tribute from the cities, which was his own private revenue ; <lb/>
            and gave him all the money he could spare. And after re­ <lb/>
            minding him what friendship he entertained both towards the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian state, and towards Lysander personally, he <lb/>
            went up the country to his father.</p>
          <p>15. When Cyrus had made over all his income to him, and was <lb/>
            going up the country to his sick father, in obedience to his <lb/>
            summons, Lysander distributed pay to the forces, and put out <lb/>
            for the Ceramic Gulf in Caria. There he attacked a town <lb/>
            which was in alliance with the Athenians, by name Cedreæ, <lb/>
            and on the second day's assault took it by storm, and sold into <lb/>
            slavery the inhabitants, who were a mixed race of Greeks and <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            Barbarians. Thence lie sailed to Rhodes. 16. The Athenians <lb/>
            in the mean time, with Samos as the base of their operations, <lb/>
            were ravaging the king's country, sailing both against Chios <lb/>
            and Ephesus ; and were preparing for a sea-fight, having <lb/>
            chosen as generals, in addition to their present ones, Menan­ <lb/>
            der, Tydeus, and Cephisodotus. 17. And now Lysander sailed <lb/>
            out from Rhodes along the coast of Ionia to the Hellespont, <lb/>
            to attend both to the outward passage of the merchant vessels, <lb/>
            and to the cities which had revolted from them. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians likewise put out from Chios, keeping the open sea; for <lb/>
            Asia was hostile to them. is. Lysander coasted along from <lb/>
            Abydus to Lampsacus, which was in alliance with Athens ; <lb/>
            and the people of Abydus and the rest supported him by land, <lb/>
            under the command of Thorax, a Lacedæmonian. 19. Having <lb/>
            assaulted the town, they took it by storm, and the soldiers <lb/>
            plundered it ; for it was rich, and full of wine, and corn, and <lb/>
            other provisions ; but all the freemen in it Lysander released. <lb/>
            20. The Athenians, sailing in their track, came to anchor at <lb/>
            Eleus in the Chersonesus, with a hundred and eighty ships. <lb/>
            There, then, while they were taking their breakfast, the <lb/>
            tidings of what had happened at Lampsacus reached them, <lb/>
            and they immediately pushed out to Sestus. 21. Thence, after <lb/>
            victualling the ships, they sailed straightway to Ægospotami, <lb/>
            over against Lampsacus; the Hellespont at that point being <lb/>
            about fifteen stades across. There they prepared their evening <lb/>
            meal. 22. The next night, when day was beginning to dawn, Ly­ <lb/>
            sander gave orders to breakfast and go on board their ships. Af­ <lb/>
            ter preparing everything as for an engagement, and putting up <lb/>
            his parapets, he gave command that no one should stir from <lb/>
            his position, or put out to sea. 23. At sun-rise the Athenians <lb/>
            drew themselves up by the harbour with a close front, pre­ <lb/>
            pared for action ; but when Lysander did not advance against <lb/>
            them, and it was now late in the day, they sailed back again <lb/>
            to Ægospotami. 24. Lysander ordered the fastest of his ships <lb/>
            to follow the Athenians, and after they had landed, to observe <lb/>
            what they did, and return to him with the intelligence. And <lb/>
            he did not allow his men to land before these vessels had <lb/>
            arrived. This he did for four days ; while the Athenians <lb/>
            continued putting out against him.</p>
          <p>25. Now Alcibiades observed from his fortress that the Athe- <pb n="320"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            nians were lying at anchor on an open beach, and near no <lb/>
            city, having to fetch their provisions from Sestus, fifteen <lb/>
            stades from the fleet; whereas the enemy were in harbour, <lb/>
            and close to a city, with supplies of everything. He told <lb/>
            them therefore, that they were not lying in a good position; <lb/>
            but he advised them to change their moorings to Sestus, to a <lb/>
            harbour and a city both together; " and when there," said he, <lb/>
            " you will give battle when you please." 26. But the generals, <lb/>
            especially Tydeus and Menander, told him to go away ; for <lb/>
            that they were in command now, and not he. Accordingly <lb/>
            he departed.</p>
          <p>27. When it was now the fifth day that the Athenians sailed <lb/>
            against him, Lysander told those who followed them from him, <lb/>
            that when they had seen them landed, and dispersed about <lb/>
            the Chersonesus, (as they did much more everyday, having <lb/>
            to buy their provisions from a distance, and despising Lysan­ <lb/>
            der, because he did not put out against them,) they should sail <lb/>
            back again to him, and lift up a shield in the middle of the <lb/>
            passage. 28. They did as he had commanded: and immediately <lb/>
            Lysander gave the signal for sailing at their utmost speed; <lb/>
            while Thorax with the land force marched along in a line <lb/>
            with him. Conon, on seeing his advance, gave orders to go <lb/>
            on board the ships and oppose them with all their might. But <lb/>
            as the men were dispersed, some of the vessels had only two <lb/>
            benches manned, others only one, and others were quite empty. <lb/>
            Conon's own ship, however, and seven others about him, to­ <lb/>
            gether with the Paralus, put out to sea with their full equip­ <lb/>
            ment ; but all the rest Lysander took by the land. He also <lb/>
            captured most of the men ashore ; but some of them fled to <lb/>
            the fortified towns. 29. Conon, flying with his nine ships, when <lb/>
            he found that the cause of Athens was utterly ruined, landed <lb/>
            at Abarnis, the headland of Lampsacus, and took thence the <lb/>
            large sails of Lysander's vessels, and himself sailed away with <lb/>
            eight ships to join Evagoras in Cyprus, while the Paralus <lb/>
            went to Athens with tidings of what had happened.</p>
          <p>30. Lysander took back his fleet, and prisoners, and every­ <lb/>
            thing else, to Lampsacus, having captured, besides others of the <lb/>
            generals, Philocles and Adimantus. The day on which he <lb/>
            achieved this, he despatched Theopompus, the Milesian priva­ <lb/>
            teer, to Lacedæmon, to report what had been done; who <pb n="321"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            arrived there on the third day, and communicated the tidings. <lb/>
            31. Afterwards Lysander assembled the allies, and desired them <lb/>
            to deliberate respecting the punishment of the prisoners. <lb/>
            There, then, many accusations were brought forward against <lb/>
            the Athenians, both touching the things in which they had <lb/>
            already offended against all law, and what they had deter­ <lb/>
            mined to do, if victorious in the sea-fight, namely, to cut off <lb/>
            the right hand of all their prisoners ; and because, on their <lb/>
            capture of two galleys, a Corinthian and an Andrian one, they <lb/>
            had thrown all the crews of them down a precipice. It was <lb/>
            Philocles, general of the Athenians, who put these men to <lb/>
            death. 32. Many other statements were also made ; and it was <lb/>
            determined to slay as many of the prisoners as were Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, with the exception of Adimantus, as he alone objected <lb/>
            in the assembly to the decree for cutting off the hands. <lb/>
            He was accused, however, by some of having betrayed the <lb/>
            fleet. Accordingly, Lysander first asked Philocles, who had <lb/>
            thrown the Andrians and Corinthians down the precipice, <lb/>
            what he deserved to suffer for having been the first to treat <lb/>
            Greeks in defiance of the law, and then put him to the <lb/>
            sword.</p>

          <p>The Paralus having carried to Athens the news of their defeat, the citizens <lb/>
            prepare for a siege. After great sufferings they are compelled to surren­ <lb/>
            der, and their walls are demolished by the conquerors.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN he had arranged matters at Lampsacus, he sailed <lb/>
            against Byzantium and Chalcedon ; where the inhabitants <lb/>
            admitted him, after sending away the Athenian garrison <lb/>
            under treaty. The party that had betrayed Byzantium to <lb/>
            Alcibiades, at that time fled to Pontus, and afterwards to <lb/>
            Athens, and became citizens there. 2. The garrison troops of <lb/>
            the Athenians, and whatever other Athenian he found any­ <lb/>
            where, Lysander sent to Athens, giving them safe conduct so <lb/>
            long as they were sailing to that place alone, and to no other; <lb/>
            knowing that the more people were collected in the city and <lb/>
            P iræeus, the sooner there would be a want of provisions. And <note type="footnote"> VOL. II </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            now, leaving Sthenelaus as Lacedæmonian harmost of By­ <lb/>
            zantium and Chalcedon, lie himself sailed away to Lampsacus, <lb/>
            and refitted his ships.</p>
          <p>3. At Athens, on the arrival of the Paralus in the night, the <lb/>
            tale of their disaster was told; and the lamentation spread <lb/>
            from the Piræeus up the long walls into the city, one man passing <lb/>
            on the tidings to another: so that no one went to bed that <lb/>
            night, not only through their mourning for the dead, but <lb/>
            much more still because they thought they should themselves <lb/>
            suffer the same things as they had done to the Melians, (who <lb/>
            were a colony from Lacedæmon,) when they had reduced <lb/>
            them by blockade, and to the Histiæans, Scionæans, Toronæans, <lb/>
            Æginetans, and many others of the Greeks. But the next <lb/>
            day they convened an assembly, at which it was resolved to <lb/>
            block up the harbours, with the exception of one, and to put <lb/>
            the walls in order, and mount guard upon them, and in every <lb/>
            other way to prepare the city for a siege. They, then, were <lb/>
            engaged with these objects.</p>
          <p>5. Lysander, having come with two hundred ships from the <lb/>
            Hellespont to Lesbos, regulated both the other cities in the <lb/>
            sland, and especially Mitylene ; while he sent Eteonicus with <lb/>
            ten ships to the Athenian possessions Thrace-ward, who <lb/>
            brought over all the places there to the Lacedæmonians. 6. And <lb/>
            all the rest of Greece too revolted from Athens, immediately <lb/>
            after the sea-fight, except the Samians; but they massacred <lb/>
            the notables amongst them, and kept possession of the city. <lb/>
            7. Afterwards Lysander sent word to A-is at Decelea, and to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, that he was sailing up with two hundred ships. <lb/>
            And the Lacedemonians went out to meet him " en masse," <lb/>
            and all the rest of the Peloponnesians but the Argives, at the <lb/>
            command of the other Spartan king, Pausanias. 8. When they <lb/>
            were all combined, he took them to the city and encamped <lb/>
            before it, in the academy-the gymnasium so called. 9. Then <lb/>
            Lysander went to Ægina, and restored the city to the <lb/>
            Æginetans, having collected as many of them as he could; <lb/>
            and so likewise to the Melians, and as many others as had <lb/>
            been deprived of their city. After this, having ravaged <lb/>
            Salamis, he came to anchor off the Piræeus, with a hundred <lb/>
            and fifty ships, and prevented all vessels from sailing into it.</p>
          <p>10. The Athenians, being thus besieged by land and by sea, <lb/>
            were at a loss what to do, as they had neither ships, nor allies, <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            nor provisions ; and they thought nothing could save them <lb/>
            from suffering what they had done to others, not in self-de­ <lb/>
            fence, but wantonly wronging men of smaller states, on no <lb/>
            other single ground, but their being allies of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians. 11. Wherefore they restored to their privileges those who <lb/>
            had been degraded from them, and held out resolutely; and <lb/>
            though many in the city were dying of starvation, they spoke <lb/>
            not a word of coming to terms. But when their corn had <lb/>
            now entirely failed, they sent ambassadors to Agis, wishing <lb/>
            to become allies of the Lacedæmonians, while they retained their <lb/>
            walls and the Piræeus, and on these conditions to make treaty <lb/>
            with them. 12. He told them to go to Lacedæmon, for that he <lb/>
            had himself no power to treat. When the ambassadors de­ <lb/>
            livered this message to the Athenians, they sent them to Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon. 13. But when they were at Sellasia, near the Laconian <lb/>
            territory, and the ephors heard what they proposed, which <lb/>
            was the same as they had done to Agis, they bade them re­ <lb/>
            turn from that very spot, and if they had any wish at all for <lb/>
            peace, to come back after taking better advice. 14. When the <lb/>
            ambassadors came home, and reported this in the city, dejec­ <lb/>
            tion fell on all; for they thought they would be sold into <lb/>
            slavery ; and that even while they were sending another em­ <lb/>
            bassy, many would die of famine. 15. But with respect to the <lb/>
            demolition of their walls, no one would advise it: for Arches­ <lb/>
            tratus had been thrown into prison for saying in the council, <lb/>
            that it was best to make peace with the Lacedæmonians on the <lb/>
            terms they offered, which were, that they should demolish ten <lb/>
            stades of each of the long walls ; and a decree was then made, <lb/>
            that it should not be allowed to advise on that subject. 16. Such <lb/>
            being the case, Theramenes said in the assembly, that if they <lb/>
            would send him to Lysander, he would come back with full <lb/>
            knowledge whether it was from a wish to enslave the city that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians held out on the subject of the walls, or to <lb/>
            have a guarantee for their good faith. Having been sent, he <lb/>
            remained with Lysander three months and more, watching to <lb/>
            ee when the Athenians, from the failure of all their food, <lb/>
            would agree to what any one might say. 17. On his return in <lb/>
            the fourth month, he reported in the assembly that Lysander <lb/>
            had detained him all that time, and then told him to go to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon; for he had not power to speak to the questions <lb/>
            he was asked by him, but the ephors. After this he was <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <pb n="324"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            chosen ambassador to Lacedæmon with full powers, together <lb/>
            with nine others. is. Now Lysander had sent, along with some <lb/>
            others who were Lacedæmonians, Aristoteles, an Athenian <lb/>
            exile, to carry word to the ephors that he had answered <lb/>
            Theramenes, that it was they who were empowered to decide <lb/>
            on the question of peace or war. 19. So when Theramenes and <lb/>
            the rest of the ambassadors were at Sellasia, and, being asked <lb/>
            on what terms they had come, replied that they had full <lb/>
            powers to treat for peace; the ephors then ordered them to <lb/>
            be called onward. Upon their arrival they convened an as­ <lb/>
            sembly, at which the Corinthians and Thebans contended <lb/>
            most strenuously, though many others of the Greeks did so <lb/>
            too, that they should conclude no treaty with the Athenians, <lb/>
            but make away with them. 20. The Lacedæmonians, however, <lb/>
            said they would not reduce to bondage a state which had done <lb/>
            great good at the time of the greatest dangers that had ever <lb/>
            befallen Greece; but they offered to make peace, on condi­ <lb/>
            tion of their demolishing the long walls and Piræeus, giving <lb/>
            up all their ships but twelve, restoring their exiles, having <lb/>
            the same friends and foes as the Lacedæmonians, and follow­ <lb/>
            ing, both by land and by sea, wherever they might lead. <lb/>
            21. Theramenes and his fellow-ambassadors carried back these <lb/>
            terms to Athens. On their entering the city, a great multi­ <lb/>
            tude poured round them, afraid of their having returned un­ <lb/>
            successful : for it was no longer possible to delay, owing to the <lb/>
            great numbers who were dying of famine. 22. The next day <lb/>
            the ambassadors reported on what conditions the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians were willing to make peace; and Theramenes, as their <lb/>
            spokesman, said that they should obey the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and destroy the walls. When some had opposed him, but far <lb/>
            more agreed with him, it was resolved to accept the peace. 23. <lb/>
            Subsequently Lysander sailed into the Piræeus, and the exiles <lb/>
            were restored ; and they dug down the walls with much glee, to <lb/>
            the music of women playing the flute; considering that day <lb/>
            to be the beginning of liberty to Greece.</p>
          <p>24. And so ended the year, in the middle of which Dionysius <lb/>
            the son of Hermocrates, the Syracusan, became tyrant; after <lb/>
            the Carthaginians, though previously defeated in battle by <lb/>
            the Syracusans, had reduced Agrigentum through the failure <lb/>
            of their provisions, when the Siceliots had evacuated the city. <pb n="325"/>

            Eudicus being eplior at Sparta, and Pythodorus archon at <lb/>
            Athens; whom the Athenians do not mention in their records, <lb/>
            as he was chosen in the time of the oligarchy, but call the <lb/>
            year that of the anarchy. The circumstances under which <lb/>
            this oligarchy was established were as follows. 2. It was re­ <lb/>
            solved by the people to elect thirty men, who should draw up <lb/>
            a code of laws from those inherited from their fathers, by <lb/>
            which they should regulate their affairs. And the following <lb/>
            men were elected: Polyarches, Critias, Melobius, Hippolo­ <lb/>
            chus, Euclides, Hiero, Mnesilochus, Chremo, Theramenes, <lb/>
            Aresias, Diodes, Phædrias, Chærelaus, Anœtius, Piso, Sopho­ <lb/>
            cles, Eratosthenes, Charicles, Onomacles, Theognis, Æschines, <lb/>
            Theogenes, Cleomedes, Erasistratus, Phido, Dracontides, Eu­ <lb/>
            mathes, Aristoteles, Hippomachus, Mnesithides. 3. When this <lb/>
            had been done, Lysander sailed away to Samos; and Agis <lb/>
            withdrew the land forces from Decelea, and dismissed them to <lb/>
            their several cities.</p>
          <p>4. It was at this period, about the time of the eclipse of the <lb/>
            sun, that Lycophron the Pheræan, wishing to have the rule <lb/>
            over the whole of Thessaly, defeated in battle those of the <lb/>
            Thessalians who opposed him,—the Larissæans and others,­ <lb/>
            and slew many of them.</p>
          <p>5. It was also at the same period that Dionysius, the tyrant of <lb/>
            Syracuse, being defeated in an engagement by the Carthagi­ <lb/>
            nians, lost Gela and Camarina. A short time afterwards, the <lb/>
            Leontines also, who were united with the Syracusans, severed <lb/>
            their connexion with Dionysius and the Syracusans, and <lb/>
            established themselves in their own city. Immediately upon <lb/>
            this the Syracusan cavalry were despatched by Dionysius <lb/>
            against Catana. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ δ᾽ ἐπίοντι ἔτι</foreign>.] I have supplied the apodosis which is want­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> </p>
          <p>6. Now the Samians were besieged by Lysander on every <lb/>
            side; and, on their at first refusing to surrender, he was now <lb/>
            on the point of assaulting the place, when they agreed to <lb/>
            evacuate it with a single dress for each of the freemen, giving <lb/>
            up everything else: and on these terms they marched out of <lb/>
            it. 7. Lysander restored the city and all that was in it to the <lb/>
            original citizens, and appointed ten officers to guard it; after <lb/>
            which he dismissed the fleet of the allies to their several <lb/>
            cities. 8. With the Lacedemonian ships he sailed away to La­ <lb/>
            conia, taking both the beaks of the captured ships, and the gal­ <lb/>
            leys from the Piræeus, all but twelve, with crowns which he re­ <lb/>
            ceived as personal presents from the states, and four hundred <lb/>
            and seventy talents of silver, which remained over from the <lb/>
            revenues assigned him by Cyrus for the prosecution of hos­ <lb/>
            tilities, and whatever else he had gained in the course of the <lb/>
            war. 9. All these things he delivered up to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            at the close of the summer, in which, after continuing twenty- <lb/>
            eight years and six months, the war came to a conclusion. <lb/>
            During these years the following were the ephors enumerated <lb/>
            in the lists : first -ZEnesias, in whose year of office the war be­ <lb/>
            gan, in the fifteenth year of the thirty years' treaty after the <lb/>
            reduction of Eubœa; 10. and after him the following ; Brasidas, <lb/>
            Isanor, Sostratidas, Hexarchus, Agesistratus, Angenidas, Ono­ <lb/>
            macles, Zeuxippus, Pityas, Pleistolas, Cleinomachus, IIarchus, <lb/>
            Leon, Chæridas, Patesiadas, Cleosthenes, Lycarius, Eperatus, <lb/>
            Onomantius, Alexippidas, Misgolaidas, Isias, Aracus, Euar­ <lb/>
            chippus, Pantacles, Pityas, Archytas, Eudicus ; in whose year <lb/>
            Lysander returned home, after achieving the above-mentioned <lb/>
            exploits.</p>
          <p>11. Now the Thirty were elected as soon as the long walls and <lb/>
            those round the Piræeus had been demolished: but though elect­ <lb/>
            ed for the purpose of drawing up a code of laws by which they <lb/>
            should regulate their affairs, they continually deferred draw­ <lb/>
            ing up and promulgating those laws, but appointed a coun­ <lb/>
            cil, and the other offices, according to their own pleasure. 12. <lb/>
            Then they arrested, and brought to trial for their lives, in the <lb/>
            first instance, those whom all knew to have lived in the time <lb/>
            of the democracy by laying false informations, and to have <lb/>
            been a pest to the better kind of men; and both the council <lb/>
            gladly passed sentence upon them, and the rest, as many as <lb/>
            were conscious of not being similar characters, were not at all <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            sorry for it. 13. But when they began to form designs for having <lb/>
            power to govern the city as they pleased, in the first place <lb/>
            they sent Æschines and Aristoteles to Lacedæmon, and per­ <lb/>
            suaded Lysander to assist in arranging that a guard should be <lb/>
            sent them, they themselves promising to maintain it, until <lb/>
            they had put the ill-disposed out of the way, and established <lb/>
            the government. In compliance with their wishes, he assisted <lb/>
            in arranging that the guard should be sent them, and Cal­ <lb/>
            libius as harmost. 14. On receiving the guard, they courted Cal­ <lb/>
            libius with every kind of obsequiousness, that he might sane­ <lb/>
            tion what they did; and when he sent with them soldiers <lb/>
            of the guard, they arrested whom they pleased; no longer <lb/>
            those only who were ill-disposed and little worth, but now <lb/>
            such as they thought to bear least patiently being thrust aside, <lb/>
            and who, if they should attempt any measure against them, <lb/>
            would find the most numerous supporters. 15. In the first <lb/>
            period of their rule, then, Critias was of one mind, and on <lb/>
            friendly terms, with Theramenes; but afterwards he was head­ <lb/>
            long in putting many to death, (inasmuch as he had himself <lb/>
            been banished by the people,) while Theramenes was opposed <lb/>
            to it; alleging that it was not right to put to death any one <lb/>
            who, though honoured by the people, did the better kind of <lb/>
            men no harm ; "for," said he, "both I and you have both said <lb/>
            and done many things with a view to pleasing our country­ <lb/>
            men." 16. But Critias, being still intimate with Theramenes, <lb/>
            contended that it was not possible for those who wished to <lb/>
            take an advantage of others, to abstain from putting out of <lb/>
            the way such as were most able to prevent them ; " and if," <lb/>
            said he, "because there are thirty of us, instead of one, you <lb/>
            suppose we are less bound to provide for our government as <lb/>
            for a tyranny, you are a simple creature." 17. But when, in <lb/>
            consequence of the numerous unjust executions, many were evi­ <lb/>
            dently conspiring, and wondering what would become of the <lb/>
            constitution; Theramenes again said, that if they did not <lb/>
            adopt many associates in their measures, it would be impossi­ <lb/>
            ble for the oligarchy to stand. is. Upon that, indeed, Critias <lb/>
            and the rest of the Thirty, being now afraid, and not least of <lb/>
            Theramenes, lest the citizens should unite under him, make <lb/>
            a list of three thousand who should have a share in the ad­ <lb/>
            ministration. 19. But, again, with regard to this also, Thera- <pb n="328"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            menes said, that to him it appeared an absurdity, in the first <lb/>
            place, if they wished to take the best of the citizens as their <lb/>
            associates in the government, that they should take just three <lb/>
            thousand; as though that number involved any necessity of <lb/>
            their being the better class of men, and it were not possible, <lb/>
            either for any to be good beyond it, or bad within it. " And <lb/>
            secondly," said he, " I see that we are doing two things most <lb/>
            inconsistent one with the other, in establishing a government <lb/>
            which is carried on by force, and at the same time is weaker <lb/>
            than the governed.”</p>
          <p>20. To this effect spoke Theramenes. But the Thirty held a <lb/>
            review of the Three Thousand in the market-place, and of those <lb/>
            not included in the list in several different places, with subse­ <lb/>
            quent orders to appear in arms ; and while the latter were <lb/>
            gone away, they sent the guards, and those of the citizens <lb/>
            who held the same views as themselves, and took away the <lb/>
            arms of all but the Three Thousand, and having carried them <lb/>
            up to the Acropolis, deposited them together in the temple. 21. <lb/>
            When this was done, thinking that they might now act as they <lb/>
            pleased, they put to death many for the gratification of their <lb/>
            hatred, and many others for the sake of their property. And <lb/>
            in order that they might have money to give to the guards, <lb/>
            they determined to choose one each of the resident aliens, and <lb/>
            having put them to death, to confiscate their property. 22. They <lb/>
            also desired Theramenes to take whichever of them he would. <lb/>
            But he answered, “Nay, it does not appear to me to be right <lb/>
            that, while professing to be the best men, we should act more <lb/>
            unjustly than the very sycophants.1 For they allowed those <lb/>
            to live from whom they got money: and shall we put to death <lb/>
            men who do us no harm, in order that we may get money ? <lb/>
            How is not this conduct in every respect more iniquitous than <lb/>
            theirs ? " 23. Thinking him therefore an obstacle to their doing <lb/>
            as they pleased, they conspired against him, and privately ac­ <lb/>
            cused him to different members of the council, as marring the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν συκοφαντω̃ν</foreign>.] " Sycophantes in the time of Aristophanes <lb/>

            government. And, having sent word to some young men, <lb/>
            whom they considered to be most daring, to attend with dag­ <lb/>
            gers under their cloaks, they convened the council.</p>
          <p>24. When Theramenes was come, Critias rose and spoke as <lb/>
            follows.</p>
          <p>" Gentlemen of the council, if any of you think that more <lb/>
            are being put to death than the occasion requires, let him <lb/>
            reflect, that where forms of government are changed, these <lb/>
            things in all cases happen; and in this place there must needs <lb/>
            be the greatest number hostile to those who changed the govern­ <lb/>
            ment into an oligarchy, because our city is the most populous <lb/>
            one of all in Greece, and the people have for the longest time <lb/>
            been brought up in liberty. 25. We however, knowing that <lb/>
            democracy is a hateful form of government to such men as we <lb/>
            and you, and knowing also that to the Lacedæmonians, who <lb/>
            have been our preservers, the people would never be friendly, <lb/>
            whereas the aristocracy would always continue faithful to <lb/>
            them, are, in accordance with the wishes of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, establishing this form of government. 26. And if we find <lb/>
            any one opposed to the oligarchy, as far as we can, we put <lb/>
            him out of the way: but most of all by far does it appear <lb/>
            right to us, that if any of ourselves be a marrer of this con­ <lb/>
            stitution, he should pay the penalty of it. 27. Now then we find <lb/>
            this Theramenes here by all the means at his command to be <lb/>
            ruining both us and you. And to prove that this is true, if <lb/>
            you consider, you will perceive no one finding more fault than <lb/>
            this Theramenes with the present state of things, or offering <lb/>
            greater opposition, when we wish to put any of the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues out of the way. Now had he held these views from the <lb/>
            beginning, he would have been, it is true, our enemy, but still <lb/>
            would not justly have been considered a villain. 28. But as <lb/>
            it is, after being himself the originator of our confidence and <lb/>
            friendship with the Lacedæmonians, and of the putting down <lb/>
            of the democracy, and after urging us more than any one else <lb/>
            to inflict punishment on those who were first brought before <lb/>
            you; now, when both you and we have clearly incurred the <lb/>
            hatred of the people, he is no longer pleased with what is <lb/>
            going on; in order that he may again secure his own safety, <lb/>
            while we pay the penalty for what has been done. 29. So that <lb/>
            not only as an enemy, but as a traitor also both to you and to <lb/>
            us, it is right that he should be brought to justice. Treason, <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> L[ B. II. </note> <lb/>
            however, is a thing as much more fearful than open enmity, <lb/>
            as it is more difficult to guard against what is unseen, than <lb/>
            what is seen ; and so much more hateful a thing, inasmuch as <lb/>
            with enemies men make peace again, and return to conn­ <lb/>
            dence; but the man whom they find betraying, them, with <lb/>
            him no one ever yet made peace, or trusted him in future.</p>
          <p>30. "And that you may know that it is no new thing this man <lb/>
            is practising, but that he is a traitor by nature, I will remind <lb/>
            you of the things that have been done by him. Whereas, then, <lb/>
            he was originally honoured by the people from regard for his <lb/>
            father Hagnon, he became the most violent agent in changing <lb/>
            the democracy to the government of the Four Hundred, and <lb/>
            was the leading man amongst them. But when he perceived <lb/>
            that an opposition to the oligarchy was being formed, he be­ <lb/>
            came again the first leader of the people against them. 31. On <lb/>
            which account, as you are aware, he is called the Shoe; for <lb/>
            the shoe seems to fit both feet, and looks to being worn by <lb/>
            both. But, Theramenes, the man who deserves to live, ought <lb/>
            not to be clever at leading on his associates to the adoption <lb/>
            of measures, and then, if any difficulty arise, immediately <lb/>
            to change about; but to exert himself throughout, as in a <lb/>
            ship, until they have got a fair wind: else how could they <lb/>
            ever reach their destination, if, when any difficulty arose, they <lb/>
            should immediately be for sailing in opposite directions ? 32. It <lb/>
            is true that all changes of government are fatal to some; but <lb/>
            you, through being so fickle, are the cause of most supporters <lb/>
            of the oligarchy being put to death by the commons, and most <lb/>
            supporters of the democracy by the better class.</p>
          <p>"This too is the man who, when ordered by the generals to <lb/>
            rescue those of the Athenians who were wrecked in the sea- <lb/>
            fight off Lesbos, did not rescue them himself, and yet accused <lb/>
            the generals and put them to death, that he might save his <lb/>
            own life. 33. The man, however, who is seen to be always <lb/>
            studying his own advantage, but to have no regard for <lb/>
            honour, and for his friends, how can it ever be right to spare <lb/>
            him ? How can it fail to be right to guard against him— <lb/>
            knowing as we do his shiftings about-that he may not be <lb/>
            able to treat us also in the same way ? We arraign therefore <lb/>
            this man before you, as at once a conspirator and a traitor <lb/>
            both to us and to you.</p>
          <p>34. " And to prove that we are acting rightly, consider this <pb n="331"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            also. The constitution of the Lacedæmonians is thought, <lb/>
            I suppose, to be the best. Now if under that constitution <lb/>
            any of the ephors, instead of obeying the majority, should set <lb/>
            about finding fault with the government and opposing its mea­ <lb/>
            sures, do you not think he would be deemed worthy of the <lb/>
            severest punishment, both by the ephors themselves, and by <lb/>
            the rest of the state? And so you too, if you are wise, will <lb/>
            spare, not this man, but yourselves; for if lie should escape, <lb/>
            he would cause many of those who differ in sentiments from <lb/>
            you to be full of confidence ; but if he were put to death, he <lb/>
            would cut short the hopes of all of them, both in the city and <lb/>
            out of it."</p>
          <p>35. Having thus spoken, he sat down; and Theramenes <lb/>
            rose and said:</p>
          <p>"I will allude, gentlemen, in the first place, to the last state­ <lb/>
            ment he made against me. He says that I put the generals <lb/>
            to death by my accusation. But surely it was not I who <lb/>
            began speaking against them, but it was they who said, that <lb/>
            when orders had been given me by them, I did not rescue the <lb/>
            unfortunates in the sea-fight off Lesbos. But, when I urged <lb/>
            in my defence, that owing to the storm it was not possible even <lb/>
            to put to sea, much less rescue the men ; I was thought by <lb/>
            my country to speak reasonably, while they seemed to accuse <lb/>
            themselves. For though they declared that it was possible to <lb/>
            save the men, they left them to perish, and sailed away. 36. I <lb/>
            do not, however, wonder at Critias's illegal conduct; for when <lb/>
            these things happened, he was not present, but was in Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, establishing a democracy with Prometheus, and arming the <lb/>
            Penestæ1 against their lords. 37. Now may none of the things <lb/>
            he was doing there be done here! In this, however, I agree <lb/>
            with him; that if any one wishes to depose you from your <lb/>
            government, and is strengthening the hands of those who are <lb/>
            conspiring against you, it is right that he should incur your <lb/>
            severest vengeance. But who it is that is doing this, I think <lb/>
            you will best judge, if you will consider what has been done, <lb/>
            and what each of us is now doing. 38. Until, then, you were <lb/>
            established in the government, and the offices were arranged, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς πενέστας</foreign>.] The Thessalian Penestæ were a kind of serfs, <lb/>
            standing in nearly the same relation to their lords as the helots to <lb/>
            their Spartan conquerors, being a remnant of the old Æolian in­ <lb/>
            habitants, as the helots were of the Messenian. </note> <pb n="332"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            and the acknowledged sycophants were brought to trial, we <lb/>
            were all of one mind: but when these men began to arrest <lb/>
            good and honourable men, upon that I too began to be of a <lb/>
            different mind from them. 39. For I knew that by the death of <lb/>
            Leon of Salamis, who both was and was considered to be an <lb/>
            able man, and was guilty of no single offence, those of the <lb/>
            same character would be alarmed, and being alarmed would <lb/>
            become opposed to this form of government. And I knew that <lb/>
            through the arrest of Niceratus, son of Nicias, both a rich <lb/>
            man and one who had never yet done anything to please the <lb/>
            commons, neither himself nor his father, those of the same cha­ <lb/>
            racter would become ill-affected towards you. 40. And again, <lb/>
            through the destruction by your means of Antiphon, who in <lb/>
            the war furnished two fast-sailing triremes, I knew that all <lb/>
            likewise who had been zealous in behalf of the state would <lb/>
            be suspicious of you. I also opposed them, when they said <lb/>
            that each should take one of the resident aliens; for it was <lb/>
            clear that through their being put to death, all the resident <lb/>
            aliens likewise would be enemies to the constitution. 41. I also <lb/>
            opposed them, when they wished to take away their arms <lb/>
            from the populace; because I did not think we ought to ren­ <lb/>
            der the state powerless. For I did not see that the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians wished to preserve us for this purpose, that by <lb/>
            waxing few, we might have no power to help them: for if <lb/>
            that were what they wanted, they might have left not so <lb/>
            much as one of us, by only pressing us a little longer with <lb/>
            famine. 42. Nor indeed was the hiring of the guards agreeable <lb/>
            to me, as to them ; since we might have attached to us as <lb/>
            many of the citizens themselves, until we in the government <lb/>
            would easily have mastered those who were under it. Again, <lb/>
            when I saw many in the city disaffected towards this govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and many being cast into exile, it did not seem right to <lb/>
            me to banish either Thrasybulus, or Anytus, or Alcibiades. <lb/>
            For I knew that in this way the opposition would be strength­ <lb/>
            ened, if able leaders should join the populace, and many allies <lb/>
            should offer themselves to those who wished to take the lead. <lb/>
            43. The man then who openly gave this advice, should he with <lb/>
            justice be considered a well-wisher, or a traitor? Those, <lb/>
            Critias, who prevent many becoming your foes, and who teach <lb/>
            you how to gain most allies, those are not the men who <lb/>
            strengthen the enemy; but such as unjustly take away pro- <pb n="333"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            perty, and put to death men who are guilty of nothing, it is <lb/>
            these that both make many enemies, and betray not only their <lb/>
            friends, but themselves also, through their base love of gain. <lb/>
            44. If it is not certain on other grounds that I speak the truth, <lb/>
            look at it in this way. Do you think that Thrasybulus, <lb/>
            and Anytus, and the other exiles would rather that what I say <lb/>
            should be done here, or what these men are doing ? . For my <lb/>
            opinion is that now they consider every place to be full of <lb/>
            their allies ; but that, if the best part of the city were friendly <lb/>
            towards us, they would deem it a difficult thing even to set <lb/>
            foot any where in the country. 45. And now, again, as to what <lb/>
            he said of my being always disposed to change about, consider <lb/>
            this also. The government under the Four Hundred was <lb/>
            voted, we know, even by the people itself, on being informed <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians would trust any form of government <lb/>
            rather than a democracy. 46. But when the Four Hundred left <lb/>
            nothing unattempted, but Aristoteles, Melanthius, and Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus, acting as generals, were seen building a fort upon <lb/>
            the mole, into which they wished to admit the enemy, and so <lb/>
            to render the city subject to themselves and their associates; <lb/>
            if I, on perceiving this, prevented it, is that being a traitor to <lb/>
            my friends ? 47. And he calls me ' Shoe,' as endeavouring to <lb/>
            suit both parties. But the man who pleases neither party, <lb/>
            what, in the name of the gods, should we ever call him ? <lb/>
            For you indeed, under the democracy, were considered the <lb/>
            greatest hater of the people; and under, the aristocracy, you <lb/>
            have been the greatest hater of the good. 48. But I, Critias, <lb/>
            have all along been a foe to those, who think that there cannot <lb/>
            be a true democracy, before both the slaves and those who <lb/>
            would sell their country for a drachma2 are in receipt of the <lb/>
            drachma: and, again, I have always been opposed to those, <lb/>
            who think that there cannot be established amongst us a true <lb/>
            oligarchy, before they have brought the state under the tyranny <lb/>
            of a few. But in conjunction with men of influence,3 with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῳ̃ χώματι ἔρυμα</foreign>.] i. e. the fort Eetionea; for the nature and <lb/>

            commentators that the text of this passage is corrupt. If it is not <lb/>
            so, the interpretation which I have given seems the only one the <lb/>
            words will bear. </note> <pb n="334"/>

            both cavalry and infantry, to aid by their means the constitu­ <lb/>
            tion, this I thought best in former days, and I do not change <lb/>
            ray opinion now. 49. If, however, you can say, Critias, on what <lb/>
            occasion, in concert with the popular or the tyrannical party, I <lb/>
            attempted to deprive the good and honourable of a share In <lb/>
            the government, mention it; for should I be convicted of <lb/>
            either doing this now, or having ever yet done it, I acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge that I should justly be put to death after suffering the <lb/>
            most extreme of all tortures."</p>
          <p>50. When, after thus speaking, he ceased, and the council by a <lb/>
            murmur of applause plainly showed their favourable feeling, <lb/>
            Critias, perceiving that if he left it to the council to decide on <lb/>
            his case by vote, he would escape, and thinking that life would <lb/>
            then be not worth having, he went up to the Thirty, and held <lb/>
            some conversation with them. 51. After this he went out, and <lb/>
            ordered the men with the daggers to present themselves openly <lb/>
            before the council, at the bar of the house. Then he went in <lb/>
            again, and said, " Gentlemen of the council, I think it the <lb/>
            part of a leader who is what he ought to be, when he sees his <lb/>
            friends being imposed upon, not to allow it. I therefore will <lb/>
            act in this manner. For the men standing here declare that <lb/>
            they will not tolerate us, if we let off a man who is openly mar­ <lb/>
            ring the oligarchy. Now it is enacted in the recent laws, that <lb/>
            none of those included in the Three Thousand shall be put to <lb/>
            death without your vote; but with regard to those who are <lb/>
            not in the list, that the Thirty are authorized to put them to <lb/>
            death. I then," said he, " strike off this Theramenes here <lb/>
            from the list, with the consent of you all: and we," he added, <lb/>
            “ condemn him to death." 52. On hearing this, Theramenes <lb/>
            sprang up on the altar of Vesta, and said, "But I, gentle­ <lb/>
            men, entreat you for what is most strictly legal,-that it may <lb/>
            not be in the power of Critias to strike off me, or any of you <lb/>
            whom he pleases; but that according to the law which these <lb/>
            men passed respecting those in the list, according to that may <lb/>
            be the decision, both for you and for me. 53. And of this in­ <lb/>
            deed," said he, "by the gods, I am not ignorant, that this <lb/>
            altar will be no protection to me; but what I wish to show <lb/>
            is, that these men are not only most unjust with regard to <lb/>
            mankind, but also most impious with regard to the gods. <lb/>
            At you, however, who are good and honourable men, I am <lb/>
            astonished, if you do not come forward in your own defence; <pb n="335"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            knowing moreover, as you do, that my name is not at all more <lb/>
            easy to strike off than each of yours." 54. Upon this, the herald <lb/>
            of the Thirty ordered the Eleven to come for Theramenes ; <lb/>
            and when they had entered with the officers, led by Satyrus <lb/>
            the boldest and most shameless of their number, Critias said, <lb/>
            "We deliver up to you this Theramenes here, condemned ac­ <lb/>
            cording to law : do ye, Eleven, seize, and lead him off to the <lb/>
            proper place, and do your duty with him." 55. When he had <lb/>
            thus spoken, Satyrus dragged him from the altar, and so did <lb/>
            the officers. Theramenes, as was natural, called both on gods <lb/>
            and men to look on what was doing. But the council kept <lb/>
            quiet, seeing both the fellows of Satyrus at the bar, and the <lb/>
            space before the council-house filled with guards, and not <lb/>
            being ignorant that they had come with daggers. 56. So they <lb/>
            led off the man through the market-place, while he declared <lb/>
            with a very loud voice how he was being treated. And this <lb/>
            one expression also is told of him. When Satyrus said that <lb/>
            he would rue it if he were not silent; he asked, " And shall <lb/>
            I not then rue it, if I am ?" Moreover, when he was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to die, and drank the hemlock, they said that he jerked1 <lb/>
            out on the floor what was left of it, saying, "Let this be <lb/>
            for the lovely Critias." Now I am aware that these sayings <lb/>
            are not worth mentioning: but this I consider admirable in <lb/>
            the man, that when death was close at hand, neither his good <lb/>
            sense nor his pleasantry deserted his soul.</p>

          <p>Thrasybulus occupies Phyle, and defeats the forces of the Thirty, who are <lb/>
            afterwards deposed, and Ten appointed in their place. When Lysander and <lb/>
            his brother had nearly reduced the exiles in the Piræeus, the army of Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias saves them, and peace is restored between them and their country <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>l. THUS, then, died Theramenes. The Thirty, thinking they <lb/>
            might now play the tyrant without fear, published an order to <lb/>
            all who were not in the list, not to come into the city; while <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκοτταβίσαντα</foreign>.] The original word alludes to the favourite <lb/>
            Grecian game of the " Cottabus.” one form of which (for there were <lb/>
            several) consisted in jerking out of the cup the wine which remain­ </note> <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            they brought them to trial from their estates,1 that themselves <lb/>
            and their friends might take possession of their lands. And <lb/>
            when they took refuge in the Piræeus, they arrested many there <lb/>
            likewise, and filled Megara and Thebes with fugitives.</p>
          <p>2. After this, Thrasybulus set out from Thebes with about <lb/>
            seventy men, and occupied Phyle, a place of much strength. <lb/>
            The Thirty went to the rescue from the city, with the Three <lb/>
            Thousand, and the Knights, the weather being very fine at <lb/>
            the time. On their arrival, some of the young men, in a fool­ <lb/>
            hardy spirit, immediately assaulted the place, producing, <lb/>
            however, no effect upon it, but retiring with many wounds. 3. <lb/>
            When the Thirty were desirous of surrounding it with works, <lb/>
            that they might reduce them by cutting off all supplies of pro­ <lb/>
            visions ; there came on during the night a very heavy fall of <lb/>
            snow, covered with which they returned the next day into <lb/>
            the city, after losing very many of their camp followers by an <lb/>
            attack of the men from Phyle. 4. Knowing, however, that they <lb/>
            would also plunder the country, if there were no watch to <lb/>
            prevent it, they despatch to the frontiers, at the distance of fif­ <lb/>
            teen stades from Phyle, all but a few of the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            guards, and two squadrons of horse. These having encamped <lb/>
            on a rough piece of ground, proceeded to keep watch. 5. There <lb/>
            were by this time assembled at Phyle about seven hundred <lb/>
            men, whom Thrasybulus took, and marched down by night; <lb/>
            and having grounded arms about three or four stades from the <lb/>
            party on guard, remained quietly there. 6. When it was towards <lb/>
            day-break, and the enemy now began to get up and retire <lb/>
            from their post on necessary purposes, and the grooms were <lb/>
            making a noise in currying their horses; at this juncture <lb/>
            the party with Thrasybulus took up their arms again, and <lb/>
            fell upon them at a run. Some of them they despatched, <lb/>
            and routed and pursued them all for six or seven stades; <lb/>
            killing more than a hundred and twenty of the infantry, and <lb/>
            of the cavalry, Nicostratus (surnamed The Handsome) and two <note type="footnote"> ed in it after drinking; mentioning at the same time the especial <lb/>
            object of their affection, whose feelings towards them were supposed <lb/>
            to be favourable or not, in proportion to the clearness of the ring <lb/>
            with which the wine fell on the floor. Hence Cicero's translation <lb/>
            of this passage ; " Reliquum sic ejecit e poculo, ut id resonaret.” <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            others also, whom they surprised while yet in their beds. <lb/>
            7. After returning and erecting a trophy, they packed up all the <lb/>
            arms and baggage they had taken, and withdrew to Phyle. <lb/>
            And now the horsemen in the city came out to the rescue, <lb/>
            but found none of the enemy any longer on the spot; having <lb/>
            waited, therefore, till their relatives had taken up the dead, <lb/>
            they returned into the city.</p>
          <p>8. Upon this the Thirty, no longer thinking their cause safe, <lb/>
            wished to secure for themselves Eleusis, that they might have a <lb/>
            place of refuge, if required. Having sent their orders to the <lb/>
            cavalry, Critias and the rest of the Thirty came to Eleusis ; <lb/>
            and having held a review of the horse in the place, alleging <lb/>
            that they wished to know what was their number, and how <lb/>
            much additional garrison they would require, they ordered <lb/>
            them all to write down their names, and as each one wrote it <lb/>
            down in his turn, to pass out through the postern to the sea. <lb/>
            On the beach they had posted their cavalry on both sides, and <lb/>
            as each successively passed out, their attendants bound him. <lb/>
            When all were arrested, they ordered Lysimachus, the com­ <lb/>
            mander of the cavalry, to take them to the city and deliver <lb/>
            them up to the Eleven. 9. The next day they summoned to the <lb/>
            Odeum the heavy-armed in the list, and the rest of the <lb/>
            cavalry; when Critias stood up, and said: “It is no less for <lb/>
            your advantage, gentlemen, than for our own, that we are <lb/>
            establishing the present form of government. As then you <lb/>
            will share in its honours, so too you ought to share in its <lb/>
            dangers. You must give your votes therefore against the <lb/>
            Eleusinians here arrested, that you may have the same <lb/>
            grounds with us both of confidence and of fear." And point­ <lb/>
            ing out a certain spot, he ordered them openly to deposit <lb/>
            their votes in it. 10. At the same time the Lacedæmonian guard <lb/>
            under arms occupied half of the Odeum : and these measures <lb/>
            were approved by such of the citizens also as only cared for <lb/>
            their own advantage.</p>
          <p>After this, Thrasybulus takes those at Phyle, who had now <lb/>
            gathered together to the number of about a thousand, and <lb/>
            comes by night into Piræeus. The Thirty, on this intelligence, <lb/>
            immediately went out to the rescue with both the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, and the cavalry, and the heavy-armed; and then <lb/>
            advanced along the cart-way that leads to Piræeus. 11. The <lb/>
            force from Phyle for some time attempted to stop their ap- <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            proach; but when the great circuit of the wall appeared to <lb/>
            require a large body to guard it, and they were not a large <lb/>
            one, they marched in close order into Munychia. The <lb/>
            troops from the city, having come to the market-place of <lb/>
            Hippodamus, in the first place drew themselves up so as to <lb/>
            fill up the road which leads to the temple of the Munychian <lb/>
            Diana, and to the Bendideum, being not less than fifty <lb/>
            shields deep. In this order they marched up the hill. 12. The <lb/>
            force from Phyle also filled up the road, but were not more <lb/>
            than ten deep in their heavy-armed; behind whom, however, <lb/>
            there were posted both targeteers and light dart-men, and <lb/>
            behind them the slingers. These indeed formed a numerous <lb/>
            body; for the inhabitants of the place had joined them. <lb/>
            While the enemy were coming on, Thrasybulus ordered his <lb/>
            men to ground their shields, and having grounded his own, <lb/>
            but keeping the rest of his arms, he took his stand in the midst <lb/>
            of them, and spoke thus :</p>
          <p>13. "My fellow-citizens, I wish to inform some of you, and to <lb/>
            remind others, that of the men who are coming against us, <lb/>
            those on the right wing are they whom you routed and pur­ <lb/>
            sued five days ago; and those on the extreme left are the <lb/>
            Thirty, who both deprived us of our country when guilty of <lb/>
            nothing, and expelled us from our houses, and prosecuted the <lb/>
            dearest of our relatives. But now truly they have come into <lb/>
            a position, where they never thought of being, but we have <lb/>
            always been praying that they might be. 14. For we are posted <lb/>
            against them with arms in our hands; and seeing that in <lb/>
            former days we were arrested both when at our meals, and <lb/>
            asleep, and in the market-place, while others of us were banish­ <lb/>
            ed, when, so far from being guilty of any offence, we were not <lb/>
            even in the country; for these reasons the gods are now <lb/>
            clearly fighting on our side. For even in fair weather they <lb/>
            raise a storm, when it is for our advantage ; and when we <lb/>
            make an attack, though our enemies are many, they grant to <lb/>
            us, who are but few, to erect trophies, is. And now, too, they <lb/>
            have brought us into a position, in which our opponents can <lb/>
            neither hurl their spears nor their darts beyond those who <lb/>
            are posted before them, through its being up-hill; whereas we, <lb/>
            discharging down-hill both spears, and javelins, and stones, <lb/>
            shall both reach them, and mortally wound many of them. 16. <lb/>
            And one might perhaps have thought that the first ranks, at <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            any rate, must fight on equal terms; but as it is, if you only <lb/>
            discharge your weapons with spirit, as suits your character, <lb/>
            no one will miss, since the road is filled up with them, and <lb/>
            standing on their guard they will all the time be skulking <lb/>
            under their shields; so that we shall be able both to strike <lb/>
            them when we please, like blind men, and to leap on and over­ <lb/>
            turn them. IT. But, sirs, we must act in such a way that <lb/>
            each of us may have the consciousness of having been most <lb/>
            instrumental towards the victory. For that (if God will) <lb/>
            will now restore to us both country, and houses, and freedom, <lb/>
            and honours, and children, (such as have them,) and wives. 0 <lb/>
            blessed, then, those of us who, as victors, may see that sweet­ <lb/>
            est day of all! And happy, too, he who falls ! For no one, <lb/>
            however rich he may be, shall enjoy so glorious a monument. <lb/>
            I, then, when the time is come, will begin the pæan: and <lb/>
            when we have called on Mars to help us, then let us all with <lb/>
            one heart avenge ourselves on these men for the insults we <lb/>
            have suffered."</p>
          <p>is. Having thus spoken, he faced about towards the enemy, <lb/>
            and remained still. For their prophet gave them orders not <lb/>
            to make the onset before some one on their side had either <lb/>
            fallen, or been wounded: " When, however," said he, " that <lb/>
            has happened, I will lead the way, and there will be victory <lb/>
            for you who follow, but death to me, as I, at least, am of <lb/>
            opinion." 19. And he spoke no falsehood ; but when they had <lb/>
            taken up their arms, he himself, as though led by some des­ <lb/>
            tiny, was the first to bound forward, and falling on the enemy <lb/>
            was killed, and is buried by the passage of the Cephisus ; but <lb/>
            the rest were victorious, and pursued them as far as the level <lb/>
            ground. There were slain there, of the Thirty, Critias and <lb/>
            Hippomachus ; of the ten commanders in Piræeus, Charmides <lb/>
            son of Glaucon ; and of the rest about seventy. The con­ <lb/>
            querors took the arms, but plundered the clothes of none of <lb/>
            their fellow-citizens. And when this was done, and they were <lb/>
            returning the dead under a truce, many on both sides came <lb/>
            up and conversed together. 20. And Cleocritus, the herald of <lb/>
            the initiated, being gifted with a very fine voice, hushed them <lb/>
            into silence and thus addressed them.</p>
          <p>" Fellow-citizens, why are you driving us from our country ? <lb/>
            Why do you wish to kill us ? For we have never yet done you <lb/>
            any harm; but have shared with you both the most solemn <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            rites, and the noblest sacrifices and festivals; and have been <lb/>
            your companions in the dance, and in the schools, and in war; <lb/>
            and have faced many dangers with you by land and by sea, <lb/>
            for the common safety and liberty of both parties. 21. In the <lb/>
            name of our fathers' and our mothers' gods, in the name of <lb/>
            kindred, and affinity, and fellowship, (for all these things <lb/>
            have we in common with one another,) cease sinning against <lb/>
            your country, and be not persuaded by those most impious <lb/>
            Thirty, who for the sake of their own gain have killed almost <lb/>
            more of the Athenians in eight months, than all the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians in ten years' warfare. 22. And when we might live <lb/>
            together in peace, these men inflict on us that war which of all <lb/>
            is the most disgraceful, and grievous, and impious, and most <lb/>
            hateful both to gods and men—war with one another. But, <lb/>
            however, be well assured, that for some of those now slain <lb/>
            by us, not only you, but we also, have shed many tears." <lb/>
            Such was his speech. The rest of the enemy's commanders, <lb/>
            from the very fact of their hearing such fresh appeals to them, <lb/>
            led back their men into the city.</p>
          <p>23. The next day the Thirty, quite dejected and solitary, <lb/>
            sat together in council: while the Three Thousand, wherever <lb/>
            they were severally posted, were at variance with one another. <lb/>
            For as many as had acted in a more violent manner, and were <lb/>
            therefore afraid, vehemently maintained that they ought not <lb/>
            to submit to those in Piræeus: while such as were confident <lb/>
            that they had done no wrong, both reflected themselves, and <lb/>
            were persuading the rest, that there was no necessity for these <lb/>
            troubles: and they said that they ought not to obey the Thirty, <lb/>
            nor suffer them to ruin the state. At last they voted for de­ <lb/>
            posing them, and choosing others : and accordingly they chose <lb/>
            ten, one from each tribe.</p>
          <p>24. So the Thirty departed to Eleusis ; while the Ten, toge­ <lb/>
            ther with the commanders of the cavalry, directed their atten­ <lb/>
            tion to those in the city, who were in a state of great confusion <lb/>
            and distrust of each other. The cavalry also bivouacked in <lb/>
            the Odeum, with both their horses and their shields; and <lb/>
            owing to their want of confidence they kept going their <lb/>
            rounds along the walls, after evening had set in, with their <lb/>
            shields, and towards morning, with their horses, being con­ <lb/>
            stantly afraid that some of those in Piræeus might attack them. <lb/>
            25. They, being now many in number, and men of all sorts, <pb n="341"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            were making themselves arms, some of wood, others of wicker <lb/>
            work, and were whitening them over. Before ten days had <lb/>
            elapsed, after giving pledges that whoever joined in the war, <lb/>
            even though they were strangers, should have equal privileges, <lb/>
            they marched out, with many heavy-armed and many light- <lb/>
            armed. They had also about seventy horse; and making <lb/>
            forays by day, and carrying off wood and corn, they slept <lb/>
            again in Piræeus. 26. Of those in the city none else came out <lb/>
            under arms, but the cavalry sometimes secured plunderers <lb/>
            from the force in Piræeus, and annoyed their phalanx. They <lb/>
            also fell in with a party of Æxonians going to their own <lb/>
            estates for provisions; whom Lysimachus, the commander of <lb/>
            the horse, butchered, though they begged hard for their lives, <lb/>
            and though many of the cavalry were indignant at his conduct. <lb/>
            27. Those in Piræeus also, by way of retaliation, put to death one <lb/>
            of the knights, whom they had taken in the country—Callis­ <lb/>
            tratus, of the Leontine tribe. For indeed they were now in <lb/>
            high spirits, so that they even made attacks on the city wall. <lb/>
            And here I may mention (if it is worth while) a device of the <lb/>
            engineer in the city; who, when he knew that they were <lb/>
            about to bring up their engines along the race-course leading <lb/>
            out of the Lyceum, ordered all the carts to take stones that <lb/>
            were a load each, and throw them down in whatever part of <lb/>
            the course each man pleased. When this was done, every <lb/>
            one of the stones caused them great trouble.</p>
          <p>28. And now the Thirty from Eleusis, and those in the list <lb/>
            from the city, sent ambassadors to Lacedæmon, and urged them <lb/>
            to come to their support, as the people had revolted from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. Lysander, calculating that it was possible <lb/>
            quickly to reduce those in Piræeus, when besieged both by <lb/>
            land and by sea, if once they were cut off from all supplies, <lb/>
            joined in getting a hundred talents lent them, and himself sent <lb/>
            out as harmost, with his brother Libys as admiral. 29. And <lb/>
            having himself proceeded to Eleusis, he raised a large force of <lb/>
            Peloponnesian heavy-armed; while the admiral kept guard <lb/>
            that no provisions should go in for them by sea; so that those <lb/>
            in Piræeus were soon in a strait again, while those in the city, on <lb/>
            the other hand, were elated again with confidence in Lysander.</p>
          <p>When things were progressing in this way, Pausanias the <lb/>
            king, filled with envy at the thought of Lysander's succeeding <lb/>
            in these measures, and so at once winning reputation and <pb n="342"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            making Athens his own, gained the consent of three of the <lb/>
            ephors, and led out an expedition. so. All the allies also joined <lb/>
            him, except the Bœotians and Corinthians. These alleged <lb/>
            that they did not consider they should show due regard for <lb/>
            their oaths, if they marched against the Athenians while doing <lb/>
            nothing contrary to the treaty: and they took this course, be­ <lb/>
            cause they knew that the Lacedæmonians wished to make the <lb/>
            country of Attica a faithful dependency of their own.</p>
          <p>Pausanias encamped on a spot called Halipedum, near Pi­ <lb/>
            ræeus, himself occupying the right wing, and Lysander, with <lb/>
            his mercenaries, the left. 31. And he sent ambassadors to those <lb/>
            in Piræeus, telling them to go away to their own homes; but <lb/>
            when they did not obey his message, he made an assault, (so <lb/>
            far, at least, as noise went,) that he might not openly appear <lb/>
            to wish them well. When he had retired with no result from <lb/>
            the assault, the day following he took two brigades of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and three squadrons of the Athenian cavalry, <lb/>
            and went along to the Mute Harbour,1 reconnoitring in what <lb/>
            direction Piræeus was most easy to circumvallate. 32. On his <lb/>
            retiring, a party of the besieged ran up to him, and caused him <lb/>
            trouble; annoyed at which, he ordered the horse to charge <lb/>
            them at full speed, and such as had passed the period of youth <lb/>
            ten years to accompany them, while he himself followed with <lb/>
            the rest. And they slew about thirty of the light-armed, and <lb/>
            pursued the rest to the theatre in Piræeus. 33. There all the <lb/>
            targeteers and heavy infantry of the party in Piræeus happened <lb/>
            to be arming themselves. And now the light-armed immedi­ <lb/>
            ately running forward began darting, throwing, shooting, <lb/>
            slinging. The Lacedæmonians, when many were being wound­ <lb/>
            ed, being very hard pressed, began slowly to retreat; and <lb/>
            upon this their opponents threw themselves on them much <lb/>
            more vigorously. It was there that Chæron and Thibrachus, <lb/>
            both of them polemarchs, were killed, with Lacrates the <lb/>
            Olympic conqueror, and others who lie buried before the <lb/>
            gates in the Ceramicus. 34. Seeing this, Thrasybulus and the <lb/>
            rest of the heavy-armed went to the support of their men, and <lb/>
            quickly drew themselves up in front of the others, eight deep. <lb/>
            Pausanias, being very hard pressed, and having retired about <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κωφὸν λιμένα</foreign>.] " I have no knowledge of this. Wyttenbach <lb/>

            four or five stades to a hill, sent orders for the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and the rest of the allies to advance and join him. There <lb/>
            having formed his phalanx very deep, he led it against the <lb/>
            Athenians. They received his charge, but then some of them <lb/>
            were driven into the mud at Halae, and the rest gave way; <lb/>
            about a hundred and fifty of them being slain. 35. Pausanias <lb/>
            erected a trophy, and withdrew.</p>
          <p>Not even under these circumstances was he exasperated <lb/>
            with them, but sent secretly, and instructed those in Piræeus, <lb/>
            with what proposals they should send ambassadors to him and <lb/>
            the ephors who were there. They complied with his advice. <lb/>
            He also set those in the city at variance, and advised that as <lb/>
            many as possible should collect together and come to the <lb/>
            Spartan officers, alleging that they did not at all want to be <lb/>
            at war with the men in Piræeus, but to be reconciled together, <lb/>
            and both parties to be friends of the Lacedæmonians. 36. It was <lb/>
            with pleasure that Nauclides also, the ephor, heard this pro­ <lb/>
            posal : for as it is customary for two of the ephors to take the <lb/>
            field with a king, so on that occasion he and another were <lb/>
            present, both of them being men of Pausanias's views, rather <lb/>
            than of Lysander's. For these reasons, then, they also with <lb/>
            alacrity sent to Sparta the envoys from Piræeus, with the <lb/>
            treaty they proposed to make with the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            the private individuals from the party in the city, namely, Ce­ <lb/>
            phisophon and Meletus. 37. When, however, these were gone <lb/>
            to Lacedæmon, the public authorities in the city also sent am­ <lb/>
            bassadors, declaring that they surrendered to the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians both the fortresses in their possession and themselves, <lb/>
            to be treated as they pleased; and they said they thought it <lb/>
            but fair that those in Piræeus also, if they professed to be <lb/>
            friends to the Lacedæmonians, should surrender Piræeus and <lb/>
            Munychia. 38. The ephors and the committee appointed to <lb/>
            consider the question having heard all their statements, de­ <lb/>
            spatched fifteen men to Athens, and ordered them, in concert <lb/>
            with Pausanias, to effect the best reconciliation of the parties <lb/>
            they could. So they reconciled them on condition of their <lb/>
            making peace with one another, and returning to their several <lb/>
            homes, with the exception of the Thirty, the Eleven, and the <lb/>
            Ten who had commanded in Piræeus. If any of those in the <lb/>
            city should feel afraid of remaining there, it was determined <lb/>
            that they should establish themselves at Eleusis.</p><pb n="344"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> 39. These arrangements being effected, Pausanias disbanded <lb/>
            his army, and the party from Piræeus went up under arms to <lb/>
            the Acropolis, and sacrificed to Athena. When the generals <lb/>
            had come down again, Thrasybulus then delivered the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing speech.</p>
          <p>40. " To you, gentlemen of the city, I give this advice-to <lb/>
            know yourselves. And you would best gain that knowledge <lb/>
            by considering upon what grounds you ought to be so lifted <lb/>
            up as to attempt to rule over us. Are you more honest men ? <lb/>
            Nay, but the people, though poorer than you, never yet wrong­ <lb/>
            ed you for the sake of money: whereas you, though richer <lb/>
            than all of us, have done many base deeds for gain. But since <lb/>
            you have no claim to honesty, see whether, then, it is on your <lb/>
            courage that you should pride yourselves. 41. And what better <lb/>
            test of this could there be, than the manner in which we have <lb/>
            carried on war against each other ? But is it in council that <lb/>
            you would profess to surpass us ?—you who, with a fortified <lb/>
            town, and arms, and money, and allies from the Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            have met with such reverses at the hands of men who had <lb/>
            none of these advantages ? But is it by your connexion with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, forsooth, that you think you ought to be <lb/>
            elated ? How so ? For just as men fasten a collar to biting <lb/>
            curs, and give them up to those they have bitten; so they, <lb/>
            too, have given you up to this injured people, and are gone <lb/>
            away. 42. I do not, however, wish you, my friends, to break <lb/>
            any of the conditions to which you have sworn ; but in addi­ <lb/>
            hall to all your other noble qualities to show this also, that you <lb/>
            are both true to your oaths, and have a sense of religion."</p>
          <p>Having spoken these words, with others to the same pur­ <lb/>
            port, and told them that they should create no confusion, but <lb/>
            live according to their ancient laws, he broke up the assembly.</p>
          <p>43. At that time, then, they appointed their magistrates, and <lb/>
            carried on the government. But some time afterwards, hear­ <lb/>
            ing that the party at Eleusis were hiring mercenaries, they took <lb/>
            the field en masse against them ; and when their commanders <lb/>
            had come to a conference, they put them to death; but sent <lb/>
            in to the others their friends and relations, and persuaded <lb/>
            them to a reconciliation. And having sworn not to remember <lb/>
            past grievances, they still live together under the same govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and the popular party abide by their oaths.</p><pb n="345"/>

          <p>Cyrus the Younger solicits aid from the Lacedæmonians on going to war <lb/>
            with his brother, and, by their directions, Samius their admiral secures <lb/>
            him a safe passage through Cilicia. The Lacedæmonians send Thibron, <lb/>
            with a moderate force, in which are some Athenian cavalry, to the sup­ <lb/>
            port of the Greeks in Asia Minor, and, as he is joined by the Greeks that <lb/>
            had served under Cyrus, he is able to oppose Tissaphernes in the field. <lb/>
            He takes some towns, but lingering too long at the siege of Larissa, is <lb/>
            ordered by the ephori to march into Caria. He is succeeded by Dercy­ <lb/>
            lidas, who makes a treaty with Tissaphernes, and unites his forces with <lb/>
            him against Pharnabazus. Mania, who governed Æolia after the death <lb/>
            of her husband Zenis, is assassinated by her son-in-law, Meidias. Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus prepares to avenge her death, but is opposed by Dercylidas, who <lb/>
            afterwards marches himself against Meidias, and strips him of his troops <lb/>
            and treasures, leaving him nothing but what he had inherited from his <lb/>
            father.</p>
          <p>i. THE discord at Athens was thus at an end. Soon after, <lb/>
            Cyrus sent deputies to Lacedæmon, and requested that, " as <lb/>
            he had conducted himself towards the Spartans in the war <lb/>
            with the Athenians,l so the Spartans would conduct them­ <lb/>
            selves towards him." The ephori, thinking that he proposed <lb/>
            what was just, sent orders to Samius, who was then admiral <lb/>
            of the fleet, " to assist Cyrus if he should in any way require <lb/>
            his services." Samius accordingly executed with alacrity what­ <lb/>
            ever Cyrus required; for, joining his own fleet with that of <lb/>
            Cyrus, he sailed round to Cilicia, and prevented Syennesis, <lb/>
            the governor of Cilicia, from being able to oppose Cyrus by <lb/>
            land in his march against the king. 2. How, therefore, Cyrus <lb/>
            collected an army and went up with it against his brother; <lb/>
            how the battle took place, how he was killed, and how the <lb/>
            Greeks afterwards returned in safety to the sea, has been <lb/>
            written by Themistogenes the Syracusan.2</p>
          <p>3. When Tissaphernes, however, who was thought to have <lb/>
            been of great service to the king in the war with his brother, <note type="footnote"> I See book i. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See " Remarks on the Authorship of the Anabasis," prefixed <lb/>
            to the Translation of it. </note> <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            was sent down as satrap, not only of the provinces which he <lb/>
            had governed before, but also of those which Cyrus had held, <lb/>
            he immediately required that all the cities of Ionia should <lb/>
            put themselves under his dominion. But these cities, desiring <lb/>
            to be free, and at the same time dreading Tissaphernes, be­ <lb/>
            cause they had shown more regard for Cyrus, while he was <lb/>
            alive, than for him, would not admit him within their walls, <lb/>
            but sent ambassadors to the Lacedæmonians, and entreated <lb/>
            them, " as they were masters of all Greece, to take them also, <lb/>
            the Greeks in Asia, under their protection, that their lands <lb/>
            might not be ravaged, and that they themselves might con­ <lb/>
            tinue free." 4. The Lacedæmonians accordingly sent Thibron <lb/>
            to them as harmost, assigning him a thousand soldiers of the <lb/>
            newly-enfranchised citizens, and four thousand of the other <lb/>
            Peloponnesians. Thibron also solicited three hundred cavalry <lb/>
            from the Athenians, engaging that he himself would secure <lb/>
            them pay. The Athenians sent him that number, selected <lb/>
            from those who had served with the Thirty, thinking it would <lb/>
            be a gain to the state if, leaving the country, they should meet <lb/>
            their deaths.</p>
          <p>5. When they arrived in Asia, Thibron collected also the <lb/>
            troops from the Greek cities on the continent; for all those <lb/>
            cities were then ready to obey whatever orders a Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nian might give. But with all this army, Thibron, observing <lb/>
            the cavalry opposed to him, would not go down into the plain, <lb/>
            but was satisfied with preserving that part of the country in <lb/>
            which he was from being ravaged. 6. After the troops, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that had gone up with Cyrus, and had returned safe, <lb/>
            joined him,1 he immediately arrayed himself against Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes on the level ground, and got possession of some cities, <lb/>
            Pergamus by voluntary surrender, and also Teuthrania and <lb/>
            Halisarna, which Eurysthenes and Procles governed, descend­ <lb/>
            ants of Demaratus the Lacedæmonian, to whom that part of <lb/>
            the country had been given by the king,2 as a reward for <lb/>
            having accompanied his army against Greece. Gorgion and <lb/>
            Gongylus, two brothers, also came over to him, the one of <lb/>
            whom possessed Gambreion and Palægambreion, the other <note type="footnote"> 1 See Anab. vii. 8. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xerxes. On the flight of Demaratus, the Spartan king, to the <lb/>

            Myrine and Gryneion : these cities, also, had been a gift from <lb/>
            the king1 to Gongylus, because he was the only one of the <lb/>
            Eretrians that was banished for his attachment to the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. 7. Some cities that were weak, too, Thibron took by <lb/>
            assault; before Larissa, however, called the Egyptian, he en­ <lb/>
            camped, as it refused to submit, and proceeded to besiege it. <lb/>
            Being unable to take it by other means, he marked out and <lb/>
            dug a passage under-ground,2 with the intention of cutting off <lb/>
            their water, but as the besieged, sallying out frequently from <lb/>
            the walls, threw timber and stones into-the part that was dug, <lb/>
            he constructed a wooden pent-house and placed it over the <lb/>
            opening. But the Larissæans rushed out in the night and <lb/>
            set fire to it. And as he seemed to be doing nothing to any <lb/>
            purpose, the ephori sent him word to quit Larissa and march <lb/>
            into Caria.</p>
          <p>8. But while he was at Ephesus, in the course of his march <lb/>
            towards Caria, Dercylidas came to the army to take the com­ <lb/>
            mand of it; a man who was considered extremely fertile in <lb/>
            expedients, and had in consequence the name of Sisyphus. <lb/>
            Thibron accordingly returned home, and was fined and ban­ <lb/>
            ished ; for the allies accused him of allowing his troops to <lb/>
            plunder their friends.</p>
          <p>9. Dercylidas, when he took the command of the forces, <lb/>
            knowing that Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus were jealous of <lb/>
            each other, made some communication to Tissaphernes, and <lb/>
            led off his army into the territory of Pharnabazus, choosing <lb/>
            rather to go to war with one of them, than with both of them <lb/>
            at once. Dercylidas had also previously been an enemy to <lb/>
            Pharnabazus ; for, having been harmost at Abydos when <note type="footnote">1 Darius, as it appears. Dindorf. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φρεατίαν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόνομον</foreign>.] It appears to me that these two words <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            Lysander was commander of the fleet, and having been ac­ <lb/>
            cused of some offence by Tissaphernes, he had been obliged <lb/>
            to stand holding his shield; a circumstance which is thought <lb/>
            by the respectable Lacedæmonians a mark of disgrace, for it <lb/>
            is the punishment for neglect of discipline. 10. He therefore <lb/>
            marched with much more readiness against Pharnabazus, and <lb/>
            soon showed such superiority in generalship to Thibron, that <lb/>
            he led the army through a friendly part of the country as far <lb/>
            as that portion of Æolia belonging to Pharnabazus, without <lb/>
            doing the least damage to the allies.</p>
          <p>This district of Æolia belonged indeed to Pharnabazus, but <lb/>
            Zenis, a Dardanian, had governed here for him as long as he <lb/>
            lived. When Zenis was carried off by disease, and Pharna­ <lb/>
            bazus was preparing to give the government to some one else, <lb/>
            Mania his wife, who was also a native of Dardania, prepared <lb/>
            her retinue,1 and taking with her presents to give Pharnaba­ <lb/>
            zus himself, and to gratify his mistresses, and such as had <lb/>
            most influence with him, set out to visit Pharnabazus. 11. <lb/>
            Being admitted to a conference, she said, " My husband, Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus, was friendly to you in other respects, and paid you <lb/>
            tribute in such a way that you praised and honoured him. <lb/>
            If I, therefore, can serve you not worse than he did, why <lb/>
            need you appoint another governor? And if I should not <lb/>
            satisfy you in any particular, it will still be in your power to <lb/>
            take the government from me and to give it to some one <lb/>
            else." 12. Pharnabazus, on hearing this application, deter­ <lb/>
            mined that the woman should be governor. Mania, when <lb/>
            she became mistress of the country, paid the tribute not less <lb/>
            punctually than her husband had paid it, and, in addition, <lb/>
            whenever she went to see Pharnabazus, always took him <lb/>
            presents, and whenever he came down into her province, <lb/>
            entertained him by far the most honourably and agreeably of <lb/>
            all his deputy-governors. is. Whatever towns she had re­ <lb/>
            ceived, she kept secure for him; and of such as were not in <lb/>
            subjection to him, she captured Larissa, Hamaxitus, and <lb/>
            Colons, places on the sea-coast, assailing their walls with a <lb/>
            Greek mercenary force, and viewing the efforts of the troops <lb/>
            in her chariot; and whomsoever she thought worthy of praise, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναζεύξασα στόλον</foreign>.] It is doubtful whether by <foreign xml:lang="grc">στόλος</foreign> Xeno­ <lb/>

            she rewarded with the utmost liberality; so that she brought <lb/>
            her mercenaries to a most excellent condition. She also joined <lb/>
            Pharnabazus in the field, whenever he invaded the Mysians <lb/>
            or Pisidians for committing depredations on the king's terri­ <lb/>
            tory. Pharnabazus, in consequence, honoured her most mag­ <lb/>
            nificently in return, and sometimes called her in as a counsel­ <lb/>
            lor. 14. But when she was something more than forty years <lb/>
            old, Meidias, her daughter's husband, (being lightly persuaded <lb/>
            by some of his people that it was disgraceful to him for a <lb/>
            woman to govern, while he himself was only in a private sta­ <lb/>
            tion, and she being carefully on her guard against others, as <lb/>
            is fitting in a despotic government, but trusting and caressing <lb/>
            him as any woman would caress her son-in law,) is said to <lb/>
            have gone into her apartment and strangled her. He also <lb/>
            put to death her son, a youth of very handsome person, and <lb/>
            about seventeen years of age. is. After committing these <lb/>
            crimes, he seized upon Scepsis and Gergis, two strong cities, <lb/>
            in which the chief part of Mania's treasures were deposited. <lb/>
            The other cities, however, would not admit him, but the gar­ <lb/>
            risons that were in them kept them for Pharnabazus. Meidias <lb/>
            soon after sent presents to Pharnabazus, and asked to have <lb/>
            the government of the province as Mania had had it. Pbar­ <lb/>
            nabazus replied, that he might keep his presents, until he <lb/>
            himself should come and take both him and them; for he <lb/>
            said that he would not live if he did not avenge Mania.</p>
          <p>16. At this time Dercylidas arrived, and took in one day, <lb/>
            by voluntary surrender, the cities on the coast, Larissa, Ha­ <lb/>
            maxitus, and Colons. He sent also to the cities of Æolia, <lb/>
            and urged them to assert their freedom, to admit him within <lb/>
            their walls, and to become his allies. The Neandrians, Ilians, <lb/>
            and Coeylitans accordingly complied with his request; for <lb/>
            the Greeks that garrisoned them had not treated the people <lb/>
            well since Mania died; 17. but he that commanded the garri­ <lb/>
            son in Cebren, a very strong place, thought that if he pre­ <lb/>
            served the town for Pharnabazus, he should be honourably <lb/>
            recompensed by him, and refused to admit Dercylidas, who, <lb/>
            being exasperated, prepared to assail the walls. As the omens <lb/>
            were unfavourable, however, when he sacrificed the first day, <lb/>
            lie offered sacrifice again on the following day, and, as they <lb/>
            were not even then favourable, again on the third day, and <lb/>
            continued to sacrifice for four days together, being extremely <pb n="350"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III </note> <lb/>
            discontented, for he was eager to become master of all Æolia <lb/>
            before Pharnabazus could come to its relief, 18. Meanwhile <lb/>
            an officer named Athenadas, a native of Sicyon, thinking that <lb/>
            Dercylidas was trifling and wasting time, and that he himself <lb/>
            could cut off the water of the Cebrenians, ran forward with <lb/>
            his troop and tried to fill up their fountain; but the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants, sallying out, wounded the officer himself, and killed two <lb/>
            of his men, and repulsed the rest with swords and missiles. <lb/>
            While Dercylidas was under concern at this occurrence, and <lb/>
            judged that the assault would in consequence be less spirited, <lb/>
            heralds from the Greeks came out of the town, and said that <lb/>
            " what their commander was doing did not please them, as <lb/>
            they themselves wished to join Greeks rather than Bar­ <lb/>
            barians." 19. As they were still talking on the matter, a <lb/>
            messenger came from their commander to announce that what <lb/>
            the previous messengers had said, they had said with his ap­ <lb/>
            probation. Dercylidas therefore, as he happened to have <lb/>
            sacrificed satisfactorily that day, took up his arms and led his <lb/>
            men towards the gates, which the inhabitants opened and gave <lb/>
            him admittance. He then established a garrison in the place, <lb/>
            and marched without delay towards Seepsis and Gergis.</p>
          <p>20. Meidias, who expected Pharnabazus, and was then in <lb/>
            fear of the inhabitants, sent to Dercylidas, and said that he <lb/>
            would come to a conference with him, if he might be allowed <lb/>
            to receive hostages. Dercylidas sent him one from each city <lb/>
            of the allies, and desired him to take whatever number and <lb/>
            whichsoever of them he pleased. He took ten, and came out, <lb/>
            and going to Dercylidas, asked him " on what conditions he <lb/>
            might become his ally." Dercylidas replied, " on condition <lb/>
            that he would leave the inhabitants of the cities free and in­ <lb/>
            dependent." As he gave this answer, he advanced towards <lb/>
            Scepsis. 21. Meidias, knowing that he could not stop him <lb/>
            without the consent of the people, allowed him to enter. <lb/>
            Dercylidas, after sacrificing to Minerva in the city of the <lb/>
            Scepsians, drew out the garrison of Meidias, and put the city <lb/>
            into the hands of the inhabitants, and exhorting them to <lb/>
            manage their affairs as became Greeks and freemen, went out <lb/>
            and led his troops towards Gergis. Many of the Scepsians <lb/>
            also attended him on his march, paying him honour and ex­ <lb/>
            pressing their pleasure at what he had done. 22. Meidias, <lb/>
            following close upon him, begged him to give him the city of <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.]</note> <lb/>
            Gergis. Dercylidas, however, merely replied that " he would <lb/>
            not fail to obtain whatever was right," and, while he was utter­ <lb/>
            ing the words, went up to the gates with Meidias, the troops <lb/>
            quietly following two by two. The people on the towers, <lb/>
            which were very high, seeing Meidias with Dercylidas, threw <lb/>
            no missiles ; but when Dercylidas said, " Give orders, Meidias, <lb/>
            to open the gates, that you may lead the way in, and that I <lb/>
            may go with you to the temple and sacrifice in it to Minerva," <lb/>
            Meidias hesitated to have the gates opened ; yet fearing that <lb/>
            he should instantly be put under arrest, he at last gave orders <lb/>
            to open them. 23. When he had entered, he took Meidias <lb/>
            with him and proceeded to the citadel; and ordering the other <lb/>
            soldiers to pile their arms round the walls, he himself, with <lb/>
            his staff, offered sacrifice to Minerva. When the sacrifice was <lb/>
            ended, he ordered also the guards of Meidias to pile their <lb/>
            arms in front of his own troops, as if they were going to be <lb/>
            taken into his pay, since Meidias had no longer anything to <lb/>
            fear. 24. Meidias, however, being perplexed how to act, said, <lb/>
            " I am now going away, to see the entertainment prepared for <lb/>
            you." " No, indeed," rejoined Dercylidas, " for it would be <lb/>
            unbecoming in me, after having sacrificed, to be entertained by <lb/>
            yon, and not to afford you entertainment. Stay here, there­ <lb/>
            fore, with us, and while the table is being prepared, you and I <lb/>
            will consider and settle what is right towards each other."</p>
          <p>25. When they were seated, Dercylidas asked this question : <lb/>
            " Tell me, Meidias," said he, " did your father leave you <lb/>
            master of all his property?" "Certainly," said Meidias. <lb/>
            And how many houses were there for you ? how many <lb/>
            fields? how many pastures?" As he was writing down his <lb/>
            answers, those of the Scepsians who were present said, " He <lb/>
            is deceiving you, Dercylidas." 26. " Well," rejoined Dercy­ <lb/>
            lidas, " do not require too minute an account." When the <lb/>
            property of his father had been taken down, " Tell me," <lb/>
            added Dercylidas, cto whom did Mania belong, ? They all <lb/>
            said, "To Pharnabazus." " Then her property," rejoined he, <lb/>
            " belonged also to Pharnabazus." " Assuredly," they replied. <lb/>
            " It must now be ours, then," said he, " since we are con­ <lb/>
            querors ; for Pharnabazus is our enemy. But let somebody <lb/>
            show us where the effects of Mania and Pharnabazus are de­ <lb/>
            posited." 27. As the others conducted him into the house of <lb/>
            Mania, of which Meidias had taken possession, Meidias also <pb n="352"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            followed. When Dercvlidas had entered, he called the stew­ <lb/>
            ards, and desiring his attendants to take charge of them, gave <lb/>
            them notice that if they were found secreting anything be­ <lb/>
            longing to Mania, they should be instantly put to death. <lb/>
            They made, however, a full discovery. When he had in­ <lb/>
            spected everything, he shut up the whole, set his seal upon <lb/>
            it, and appointed a guard. 28. As he came out, he said to <lb/>
            such of his centurions and captains as he found at the gates, <lb/>
            " Pay, my friends, has been secured by us for the army, <lb/>
            enough for eight thousand men for nearly a year; and if we <lb/>
            gain anything besides, it will be an addition to it." This he <lb/>
            said, in the belief that on hearing it they would be more or­ <lb/>
            derly and ready to serve him. When Meidias asked, " And <lb/>
            where must I live, Dercylidas?" he replied, " Where it is <lb/>
            most proper that you should live, in your native place, Scepsis, <lb/>
            and in your father's house." 1</p>

          <p>Pharnabazus makes a truce with Dercylidas, who winters in Bithynia and <lb/>
            ravages the country. Messengers from the ephori come to him at Lamp­ <lb/>
            sacus to commend him and prolong his command. Learning from these <lb/>
            messengers that the people of the Chersonesus had applied to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians to build a wall across the isthmus to defend them from the <lb/>
            Thracians, he sets out with his army to the Chersonesus and builds the <lb/>
            wall. He then returns into Asia and takes Atarneus from certain Chian <lb/>
            exiles who had seized it, and prepares it as a residence for himself. He <lb/>
            proceeds to Ephesus, where he receives orders from the ephori to march <lb/>
            into Caria to bring Tissaphernes to submission. Pharnabazus having <lb/>
            joined Tissaphernes in Caria, and both of them having crossed the Mean­ <lb/>
            der, Dercylidas crosses it to oppose them. Both parties prepare for an <lb/>
            engagement, but Tissaphernes, fearing the valour of the Greeks, prefers <lb/>
            to invite Dercylidas to a conference, at which it is understood that a <lb/>
            peace should be made on condition that the king should give liberty to the <lb/>
            Greek cities in Asia, and that the Lacedæmonians should withdraw their <lb/>
            narmosts and troops from the king's territories. In Greece the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians make war on the Eleians, to avenge old insults ; but their king, <lb/>
            Agis, on entering the enemy's territory, thinks himself supernaturally <lb/>
            admonished to return. Next year he ravages the country of the Eleians <lb/>
            who at length obtain peace on very unfavourable terms.</p>
          <p>i. DERCYLIDAS, having accomplished these objects, and <lb/>
            taken nine cities in eight days, deliberated by what means he <note type="footnote"> 1 We hear nothing further of Meidias. It would have been satis­ <lb/>
            factory to learn that he had received some additional punishment <lb/>
            from Pharnabazus, as he threatened, sect. to </note> <pb n="353"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            might avoid being burdensome to the allies, as Thibron was, <lb/>
            by wintering in a friendly part of the country, and by what <lb/>
            means Pharnabazus, on the other hand, might be prevented <lb/>
            from harassing the Greek cities with his cavalry in contempt <lb/>
            of him. He therefore sent to Pharnabazus, and asked him <lb/>
            " whether he wished to have peace or war." Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            considering that Æolia was now fortified to bear upon Phry­ <lb/>
            gia, his place of residence, preferred peace.</p>
          <p>2. When this point was settled, Dercylidas marched into <lb/>
            Bithynian Thrace, and fixed his quarters there for the winter, <lb/>
            Pharnabazus being very little concerned at the procedure, for <lb/>
            the Bithynians were often at war with him. Dercylidas con­ <lb/>
            tinued to ravage and plunder Bithynia in other ways, and to <lb/>
            get from it abundance of provisions for his troops. But as <lb/>
            some of his allies joined him from the opposite side of the <lb/>
            country, (a party of the Odrysæ that came from Seuthes, about <lb/>
            two hundred horse and three hundred peltasts,) they, forming <lb/>
            an encampment, enclosed it with a palisade, about twenty <lb/>
            stadia from that of the Greeks, and, having requested of Der­ <lb/>
            cylidas some heavy-armed men to guard their camp, went out <lb/>
            for booty, and captured a great number of slaves and other <lb/>
            valuable effects. 3. But while their camp was crowded with <lb/>
            so many prisoners, the Bithynians, having learned how many <lb/>
            had gone out, and how many Greeks they had left to keep <lb/>
            guard, assembled in great numbers, both cavalry and peltasts, <lb/>
            and proceeded to attack our heavy-armed men, who were about <lb/>
            two hundred, at break of day. As they approached, some <lb/>
            threw stones, and others hurled javelins, at them; and as the <lb/>
            defenders of the camp began to be wounded, and some of them <lb/>
            killed, and were unable to make any effectual efforts, being <lb/>
            confined within a palisading of the height of a man, they made <lb/>
            an opening in the rampart, and sallied out upon the enemy; <lb/>
            4. who, whenever the Greeks advanced, retreated, and, being <lb/>
            peltasts, easily escaped from men in heavy armour, hurling <lb/>
            their javelins at them from all sides, and striking down <lb/>
            several of them at every sally that they made, till at last, <lb/>
            pent up as it were in a sheep-fold, they were overwhelmed <lb/>
            with darts. About fifteen of them, however, made their <lb/>
            escape to the camp of the Greeks, but these, as soon as they <lb/>
            saw what was going to happen, had gone off in the midst of <lb/>
            the struggle, slipping through among the Bithvnians while <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 4 </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            they neglected to watch them. 5. The Bithynians, having thus <lb/>
            succeeded in their enterprise, and put to death the tent-keepers <lb/>
            of the Odrysæ, went off, taking all their booty with them; so <lb/>
            that when the Greeks heard of the attack, and went to give <lb/>
            succour, they found nothing in the camp but stripped corpses. <lb/>
            But after the Odrysæ returned, and had buried their dead, <lb/>
            drinking a great quantity of wine, and celebrating a horse­ <lb/>
            race at their funeral, they encamped thenceforward close to the <lb/>
            Greeks, and ravaged and wasted Bithynia with fire.</p>
          <p>6. When spring came, Dercylidas marched from the country <lb/>
            of the Bithynians, and proceeded to Lampsacus. While he <lb/>
            was there, Aracus, Naubates, and Antisthenes arrived from <lb/>
            the authorities at Sparta; persons who had come to see how <lb/>
            affairs were, in other respects, in Asia, and to tell Dercylidas <lb/>
            that he was to remain there and hold the command for the <lb/>
            following year; they stated also that the ephori had directed <lb/>
            them to call together the soldiers, and to tell them that they <lb/>
            censured them for what they had previously done, but com­ <lb/>
            mended them now, as they were doing nothing wrong ; and to <lb/>
            assure them also, with regard to the future, that if they com­ <lb/>
            mitted any injustice, they would not let it pass; but that, if <lb/>
            they acted justly towards the allies, they would give them <lb/>
            commendation. 7. After they had assembled the troops, and <lb/>
            delivered this message, the commander1 of those who had <lb/>
            gone up with Cyrus replied, " We, for our parts, men of <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, are the same soldiers now that we were a year <lb/>
            ago; but the general that commands now is different from <lb/>
            him who commanded in past time; the reason, therefore, that <lb/>
            we commit no irregularities now, though we were guilty of <lb/>
            them then, you yourselves are very well able to discover."</p>
          <p>8. When the ambassadors from home, and Dercylidas, were <lb/>
            at an entertainment together in his tent, one of the friends of <lb/>
            Aracus mentioned that they had left behind them at Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon an embassy from the people of the Chersonesus ; who, <lb/>
            they said, stated that they could not at present cultivate the <lb/>
            Chersonesus, as it was ravaged and plundered by the Thraci­ <lb/>
            ans; but that if it were fenced in by a wall from sea to sea, <note type="footnote"> I Morus, Weiske, and Schneider, agree in thinking that Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon himself is probably meant, as he may have remained with <lb/>
            the army after he had put it under the command of Thibron, Anab. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            there would be abundance of good land for themselves to till, <lb/>
            and for as many of the Lacedæmonians as might wish to settle <lb/>
            there; so that they should not wonder, they said, if some <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian should be sent out by the state with a body of <lb/>
            men to effect that object. 9. Dercylidas, as he listened to this <lb/>
            account, gave no intimation what he thought on the subject, <lb/>
            but sent away the commissioners from Ephesus through the <lb/>
            Greek cities, being rejoiced that they would see those cities <lb/>
            in a state of peace and prosperity. The commissioners set <lb/>
            out accordingly. But Dercylidas, as soon as he knew that he <lb/>
            was to remain, sent again to Pharnabazus, and asked him <lb/>
            " whether he was inclined to continue the truce, as during the <lb/>
            winter, or to go to war." As Pharnabazus preferred to pro­ <lb/>
            long the truce, Dercylidas, leaving all the allied cities near <lb/>
            Pharnabazus at peace with him, crossed over the Hellespont <lb/>
            with his army into Europe, and marching through the friendly <lb/>
            part of Thrace, and being hospitably entertained by Seuthes, <lb/>
            made his way to the Chersonesus. 10. Finding that the pe­ <lb/>
            ninsula contained eleven or twelve towns, and that the ground <lb/>
            was extremely fertile and valuable, but was ravaged, as had <lb/>
            been stated, by the Thrac;ans, and having measured the isth­ <lb/>
            mus and found that it was seven and thirty stadia across, he <lb/>
            lost no time, but, after sacrificing, began to erect a wall, <lb/>
            portioning out the ground among his troops ; and by pro­ <lb/>
            mising rewards to such as should finish their part of the wall <lb/>
            first, and to others as they should respectively deserve, he <lb/>
            succeeded in completing the wall, beginning in the spring, <lb/>
            before autumn; and he included within it eleven cities, se­ <lb/>
            veral harbours, a great quantity of excellent land for sowing <lb/>
            and planting, and a vast number of the finest pastures for all <lb/>
            sorts of cattle. Having thus effected his purpose, he crossed <lb/>
            over again into Asia.</p>
          <p>11. Making an inspection of the cities there, he found <lb/>
            them in good condition in other respects, but learned that <lb/>
            certain exiles from Chios were in possession of Atarneus, a <lb/>
            strong place, and, making excursions from thence, were ravaging <lb/>
            and plundering Ionia, and by that means gaining subsistence. <note type="footnote"> 1 'A7r' '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εφέσου</foreign>.] Dr. Smith's translation has, " to Ephesus," from <lb/>

            Discovering that they had a large quantity of corn in the <lb/>
            place, he encamped around it and laid siege to it; and, having <lb/>
            reduced it in eight months, he appointed Draco, a native of <lb/>
            Pallene, to take charge of it, laying up in it abundance of all <lb/>
            kinds of stores, that he might be able to sojourn there when­ <lb/>
            ever he came into those parts. He then went off to Ephesus, <lb/>
            which is distant from Sardes three days' journey.</p>
          <p>12. Till this period, Tissaphernes and Dercylidas, and the <lb/>
            Greeks and Barbarians in those parts, had continued at peace <lb/>
            with each other. But as deputies from the cities of Ionia <lb/>
            went to Lacedæmon, and represented that " it was in the <lb/>
            power of Tissaphernes, if he were inclined, to leave the <lb/>
            Greek cities independent," and that " if, therefore, Caria, in <lb/>
            which Tissaphernes' residence was, should be attacked, they <lb/>
            thought that he would soon consent," they said, " to leave <lb/>
            them at liberty," the ephori, on hearing this statement, sent <lb/>
            to Dercylidas, and ordered him to cross over1 with his army <lb/>
            into Caria, and directed Pharax, their commander at sea, to <lb/>
            support him with the fleet. These orders they accordingly <lb/>
            executed. is. Just at that time, however, Pharnabazus hap­ <lb/>
            pened to pay a visit to Tissaphernes, both to congratulate him <lb/>
            on being appointed commander-in-chief, and to testify, for <lb/>
            himself, that be was ready to concur in a general war, to <lb/>
            unite his force with that of Tissaphernes, and to join in <lb/>
            driving the Greeks out of the king's dominions. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less he envied Tissaphernes his supremacy, and was extremely <lb/>
            dissatisfied at being deprived of Æolia. Tissaphernes, on <lb/>
            hearing what he said, replied, " In the first place, then, cross <lb/>
            over with me into Caria, and we will then consult about these <lb/>
            matters." 14. When they were come into Caria, however, it <lb/>
            seemed advisable to them, after placing sufficient garrisons in <lb/>
            the fortresses, to cross over again into Ionia.</p>

            neighbourhood of Ephesus, suddenly observed, over against <lb/>
            them, some scouts mounted upon the tombs, and having caused <lb/>
            their own scouts to climb upon some tombs and turrets that were <lb/>
            near them, discovered the enemy's force drawn up in the part <lb/>
            through which their road lay, consisting of Carians with their <lb/>
            white shields, as many Persian troops as chanced to be in <lb/>
            those quarters, whatever Greeks each of the satraps had in <lb/>

            dered the centurions and captains to draw up their men eight <lb/>
            deep, directing that the peltasts and the cavalry, such and so <lb/>
            many as he had, should be posted on either flank ; and he then <lb/>
            offered sacrifice. 17. Whatever troops were from the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese, stood quiet, and prepared for battle ; but of those from <lb/>
            Priene, Achilleium, and the islands and cities of Ionia, some <lb/>
            left their arms in the corn (for in the plain of the Meander <lb/>
            the corn was very high) and ran away; and such as stood <lb/>
            showed that they would not stand long. 18. Pharnabazus, it <lb/>
            was said, gave orders to engage; but Tissaphernes, reflecting <lb/>
            how the Greeks under Cyrus had fought against the Persians, <lb/>
            and supposing that all Greeks resembled them, would not <lb/>
            consent to fight, but sent to Dercylidas, and said, " that he <lb/>
            wished to come to a conference with him." Dercylidas, taking <lb/>
            the best-looking of the horse and foot that were about him, <lb/>
            advanced towards the messengers, and said, " I was preparing <lb/>
            to fight, as you see; since Tissaphernes, however, desires to <lb/>
            come to a conference, I offer no objection. But if it is to <lb/>
            take place, we must give and receive hostages as securities." <lb/>
            19. This arrangement being approved and settled, the ar­ <lb/>
            mies drew off, that of the Barbarians to Tralles in Caria, <lb/>
            and that of the Greeks to Leucophrys, where there was a <lb/>
            temple of Diana, held in great veneration, and a lake of more <lb/>
            than a stadium in length, with a sandy bottom, supplied by <lb/>
            perpetual springs, its water being good for drinking and <lb/>
            warm.</p>
          <p>Such were the events of that day. On the morrow they <lb/>
            met at the place appointed; and each proceeded to ask the <lb/>
            other on what terms they might conclude a peace. 20. Der­ <lb/>
            cylidas said, " On condition that the king would leave the <pb n="358"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            Greek cities independent." Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus <lb/>
            said, " On condition that the Grecian army would quit the <lb/>
            king's territory, and the Lacedæmonian harmosts the cities.'1 <lb/>
            Having made these proposals, they settled a truce between <lb/>
            them, until the requisitions of Dercylidas could be reported at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, and those of Tissaphernes to the king.</p>
          <p>21. Whilst these affairs were conducted in Asia by Dercy­ <lb/>
            .idas, the Lacedæmonians, during the same period, who had <lb/>
            long been exasperated against the Eleians, both because they <lb/>
            had made an alliance1 with the Athenians, Argives, and Man­ <lb/>
            tineans, and because, on the allegation that a fine2 had been <lb/>
            imposed upon them, they excluded them from the equestrian <lb/>
            and gymnic games ; nor had they been content with this, but <lb/>
            when Lichas, having joined his chariot with those of the <lb/>
            Thebans, went forward, on the Thebans being proclaimed <lb/>
            victors, to crown his charioteer, they scourged him, though an <lb/>
            old man, and expelled him from the lists ;3 22. and some time <lb/>
            afterwards, when Agis was sent in obedience to an oracle to <lb/>
            sacrifice to Jupiter, the Eleians would not allow him to pray <lb/>
            for success in war, saying that " it was a rule from old time <lb/>
            that Greeks should not consult the oracle with regard to a <lb/>
            war against Greeks," so that he went away without sacrificing ; <lb/>
            23. being exasperated on all these accounts, therefore, the <lb/>
            ephori and assembly of the people resolved to bring them to <lb/>
            their senses. Sending ambassadors accordingly to Elis, they <lb/>
            acquainted them that it seemed equitable to the magistracy <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians " that the Eleians should leave the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities free." As the Eleians answered that " they <lb/>
            would not do so, since they were masters of those cities by <lb/>
            right of war," the ephori called out their forces to attack <note type="footnote"> I See Thucydides, v. 43—47, where the form of the treaty is <lb/>

            fortress of Phyrcus, and sent a body of their heavy-armed into <lb/>

            them. Agis led the army through Achaia, and entered Elis <lb/>
            at Larisus.1 24. But as soon as the troops were in the enemy's <lb/>
            country, and the lands began to be ravaged, an earthquake <lb/>
            took place ; and Agis, thinking it a sign from the gods, went <lb/>
            back out of the country, and disbanded his army. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence, the Eleians became bolder, and sent deputies round to <lb/>
            whatever cities they knew to be disaffected towards the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians.</p>
          <p>25. After the expiration of a year, the ephori again as. <lb/>
            sembled a force to invade Elis ; and, except the Bœotians and <lb/>
            Corinthians, all the other allies, as well as the Athenians, <lb/>
            accompanied Agis in the expedition. As Agis entered the <lb/>
            country through Aulon, the people of Lepreum revolted from <lb/>
            the Eleians and joined him, when the Macistians immediately <lb/>
            did the same, and soon after the Epitalians. While he was <lb/>
            crossing the river,2 the Letrians, Amphidolians, and Marga­ <lb/>
            nians came over to him. 26. Soon after he went to Olympia. <lb/>
            and sacrificed to Olympian Jupiter; and no one any longer <lb/>
            tried to hinder him. When he had finished the sacrifice, he <lb/>
            advanced towards the city,3 laying waste and burning up the <lb/>
            country; and a vast quantity of cattle, as well as a great <lb/>
            number of slaves, were taken from the fields ; so that many <lb/>
            others of the Arcadians and Achæans, when they heard of <lb/>
            these proceedings, came of their own accord to join the army, <lb/>
            and had a share of the plunder ; and this enterprise was, as it <lb/>
            were, a foraging expedition for the Peloponnesus. When he <lb/>
            arrived at the city, he destroyed the suburbs and gymnasia, <lb/>
            which were splendid ; but as to the city itself, for it was un­ <lb/>
            walled, they thought that he was rather unwilling to take it <lb/>
            than unable.</p>
          <p>While the country was thus devastated, and the army was <lb/>

            supplied. But some of the Eleians conspiring together, and <lb/>
            meeting in a certain house, and issuing from it, commenced a <lb/>
            massacre ; they put to death several others, and having also <lb/>
            killed a man very like Thrasydæus, the head of the popular <lb/>
            party, they thought that they had killed Thrasydæus himself, <lb/>
            so that the people were totally dispirited, and remained pas­ <lb/>
            sive ; 28. and the assassins thought that their purpose was fully <lb/>
            effected, and their whole party began to bring out their arms <lb/>
            to join them in the market-place. But Thrasydæus was still <lb/>
            lying asleep where he had been overcome with wine ; and <lb/>
            when the people heard that he was not dead, his house was <lb/>
            surrounded with crowds on every side, as the queen of a hive <lb/>
            is encircled by a swarm of bees. 29. Thrasydæus putting <lb/>
            himself at the head of the people and leading them on, and an <lb/>
            engagement taking place, the people had the advantage, and <lb/>
            those who had commenced the massacre were driven to join <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>When Agis had retreated, and repassed the Alpheius, he <lb/>
            left a garrison, with the exiles from Elis, and Lysippus as <lb/>
            harmost, in Epitalium on that river, and then disbanded his <lb/>
            army, and went off home. so. During the rest of the summer, <lb/>
            and the ensuing winter, the country of the Eleians was plun­ <lb/>
            dered and ravaged by Lysippus and his soldiers.</p>
          <p>The following summer, Thrasydæus sent deputies to Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon, and signified his consent to pull down the walls of <lb/>
            Phea and Cyllene, and to leave the Triphylian towns, Phryxa, <lb/>
            Epitalium, the Letrians, Amphidolians, and Marganians, free; <lb/>
            and, in addition to these, the Acrorians, and Lasion which was <lb/>
            claimed by the Arcadians. But Epeium, a city between <lb/>
            Heræa and Macistus, the Eleians insisted on keeping; for <lb/>
            they said that they had bought that whole district for thirty <lb/>
            talents from the people who then held the city, and had paid <lb/>
            the money. The Lacedæmonians, however, knowing that it <lb/>
            is not more just in those who take from the weaker to buy <lb/>
            by force, than to seize by force, compelled them to leave that <lb/>
            city also free; yet of the presidency of the temple of Olympian <lb/>
            Jupiter, though it did not originally belong to the Eleians, <lb/>
            they did not deprive them; regarding the people 1 who <lb/>
            claimed it as rustics, and unfit for such a charge. These <note type="footnote"> 1 The Arcadians and Pisans, of whom Pausanias speaks, v. 4. <lb/>

            matters being amicably settled, peace and an alliance were <lb/>
            contracted between the Eleians and Lacedæmonians. Thus <lb/>
            the war between the Lacedæmonians and Eleians was brought <lb/>

          <p>1. SOME time afterwards, Agis, having gone to Delphi, and <lb/>
            offered the tenth of the spoil, fell ill on his return, as he was <lb/>
            now an old man, at Heræa, whence he was conveyed to Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon alive; but expired there soon after, and was honoured <lb/>
            with a funeral more magnificent than that of a mere man.1 <lb/>
            But when the days for the funeral solemnities were past,2 and <lb/>
            it was necessary for another king to be appointed, Leotychides, <lb/>
            who said that he was the son of Agis, and Agesilaus his <lb/>
            brother, stood forward as competitors for the throne. 2. <lb/>
            Leotychides saying, " The law, Agesilaus, directs, not that the <lb/>
            brother, but that the son of the king is to reign ; though if <lb/>
            there happen to be no son, the brother may in that case be­ <lb/>
            come king," Agesilaus rejoined, " Then I must be king." <lb/>
            " How,” said Leotychides, “ when I am alive ? ” “ Because,” <lb/>
            returned Agesilaus, " he whom you call your father, said that <lb/>
            you were not his son." " But my mother, who knows much <lb/>
            better than he, still declares that I am." " Neptune, how <lb/>
            ever," said Agesilaus, “ showed that what you assert is false, <lb/>
            as he drove your father abroad by an earthquake from her <note type="footnote"> 1 The laws of Lycurgus, by the honours which they appointed to <lb/>

            chamber ; and time,which is said to be the truest of witnesses, <lb/>
            gives testimony with him to the same effect; for you were <lb/>
            born in the tenth month after he fled from her, and was never <lb/>
            after seen in her chamber." 3. In this manner they disputed. <lb/>
            But Diopeithes, a man who paid great attention to oracles, <lb/>
            supported Leotychides, and said that there was an oracle of <lb/>
            Apollo enjoining them " to beware of a halting reign." Ly <lb/>
            sander however said in reply to him, on behalf of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            that " he did not think the god desired them to beware lest <lb/>
            their king should stumble and halt, but rather lest one who <lb/>
            was not of the royal family should reign; for that the royal <lb/>
            power would assuredly be lame whenever men not descended <lb/>
            from Hercules should rule the state." 4. The people, after <lb/>
            hearing such arguments from both sides, chose Agesilaus for <lb/>
            their king.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus had not yet been a year on the throne, when, as <lb/>
            he was offering one of the sacrifices appointed for the city, <lb/>
            the augur told him that the gods indicated some conspiracy <lb/>
            of the most dangerous kind. When he sacrificed a second <lb/>
            time, the augur declared that the victims appeared still more <lb/>
            threatening than before. When he sacrificed a third time, he <lb/>
            said, “ Signs are given to me, Agesilaus, just as if we were in <lb/>
            the midst of enemies." They then sacrificed to the gods who <lb/>
            avert evil, and to those who preserve the state, and having <lb/>
            scarcely obtained favourable omens, they ceased. Within five <lb/>
            days after the conclusion of this sacrifice, somebody gave in­ <lb/>
            formation to the ephori of a conspiracy, and said that "Cina­ <lb/>
            don was leader in the affair." 5. Cinadon was a man of <lb/>
            vigorous frame, and of powerful mind, but not one of the <lb/>
            Equals.1 When the ephori asked the informer what account <lb/>
            he could give of the way in which the plot would be carried <lb/>
            into effect, he said that " Cinadon, having conducted him to <lb/>
            the outside of the forum, desired him to count how many <lb/>
            Spartans there were In the forum; and I," continued he, <lb/>
            " having counted the king, the ephori, the senators, and about <lb/>
            forty others, asked him, ‛ And why, Cinadon, have you told <lb/>
            me to count them ?' ‛ Consider these,' he replied, ‛ as ene­ <lb/>
            mies, and all the rest now in the forum, who are more than <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν ὁμοίων</foreign>.] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</foreign> at Sparta were those who were alike <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 3 ] </note> <lb/>
            lour thousand, as allies.'" He said also that Cinadon pointed <lb/>
            out to him in the streets sometimes one, and sometimes two, <lb/>
            that were enemies, and said that all the other people were <lb/>
            auxiliaries, and that whatever Spartans were on their estates <lb/>
            in the country, one, namely the master, was an enemy, while <lb/>
            on every estate there were numbers of allies. 6. The ephori <lb/>
            then inquiring how many Cinadon said were privy to the plot, <lb/>
            he replied that he told him, as to that point, that" there <lb/>
            were not very many in concert with the principal agents, but <lb/>
            that they were trust-worthy, and declared that they were in <lb/>
            communication with all the Helots, the newly-enfranchised, <lb/>
            the inferior citizens, and the people in the parts about the <lb/>
            city; for whenever any mention of the Spartans was made <lb/>
            among them, no one could forbear from showing that he <lb/>
            would willingly eat them up alive.” 1 7. When the ephori <lb/>
            further asked " whence they said they would get arms," he <lb/>
            answered, that Cinadon had stated to him, " Those of us who <lb/>
            are already united, say we have arms enough ;” and for the <lb/>
            multitude, he said that Cinadon, conducting him into the iron­ <lb/>
            market, had pointed out numbers of daggers, swords, spits, <lb/>
            axes, hatchets, and scythes, and added that “all the instru­ <lb/>
            ments with which men cultivate the ground, or hew wood or <lb/>
            stone, would serve as weapons, while the greater part of the <lb/>
            artificers had sufficient tools to fight with, especially against <lb/>
            unarmed enemies." The informer being finally interrogated <lb/>
            " at what time the scheme was to be carried into execution," <lb/>
            replied that " directions had been given him to be in readi­ <lb/>
            ness at home."</p>
          <p>8. The ephori, after listening to his statement, were of <lb/>
            opinion that he had given information of a well-concerted <lb/>
            plot, and were greatly alarmed ; nor did they summon even <lb/>
            what was called the lesser assembly, but some of the senators, <lb/>
            conferring together here and there, resolved to send Cinadon <lb/>
            to Aulon, accompanied by some others of the younger men, <lb/>
            with directions to bring back with him certain inhabitants of <lb/>
            that place, and some Helots, whose names were written on his <lb/>
            scytale. They desired him also to bring with him a certain <lb/>
            woman, who was said to be the handsomest in the place, and <lb/>
            was thought to corrupt all the Lacedæmonians, old as well as <lb/>
            young, that went thither. 9. Cinadon had executed similar <note type="footnote"> I See note on Anab. iv. 8. 14. </note> <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. III. </note> <lb/>
            commissions for the ephori before; and they now delivered to <lb/>
            him the scytale on which were written the names of the per­ <lb/>
            sons that were to be apprehended. As he asked " which of <lb/>
            the young men he should take with him," they said to him, <lb/>
            Go, and desire the eldest of the hippagretæ 1 to send with <lb/>
            you six or seven of such of his men as may be at hand." They <lb/>
            had previously taken care that the hippagretes should know <lb/>
            whom he was to send, and that those who were sent should be <lb/>
            apprized that they were to secure Cinadon. They moreover <lb/>
            acquainted Cinadon that they would send three carriages, that <lb/>
            they might not bring away their prisoners on foot, concealing <lb/>
            from him as carefully as possible that they sent them with a <lb/>
            view to his security alone. 10. They did not apprehend him <lb/>
            in the city, because they were uncertain how far the plot <lb/>
            might have spread, and wished first to hear from Cinadon <lb/>
            himself who were his accomplices in it, before they them­ <lb/>
            selves should be aware that information was given against <lb/>
            them, lest they should make their escape. The party who <lb/>
            took him were to keep him prisoner, and when they had <lb/>
            learned from him the names of his accomplices, were to send <lb/>
            them in writing to the ephori as speedily as possible. So <lb/>
            intent indeed were the ephori on effecting their object, that <lb/>
            they even despatched a troop of horse to support the party <lb/>
            that was gone to Aulon.</p>
          <p>11. As soon as Cinadon was secured, and a horseman ar­ <lb/>
            rived with the names of those whom he had put on his list, <lb/>
            they instantly apprehended Tisamenus the soothsayer, and the <lb/>
            other principal conspirators ; and when Cinadon was brough4 <lb/>
            back and examined, and had made a full confession and spe <lb/>
            cified his accomplices, they at last asked him " with wlia <lb/>
            object he had engaged in such a scheme." He replied, “ in <lb/>
            order that he might be inferior to no man in Lacedæmon.’ <lb/>
            Soon after he was fastened, arms and neck, in a wooden col <lb/>
            lar, and scourged and pricked with lances; and in this condi­ <lb/>
            tion he and his accomplices were led round the city. Thus <lb/>
            they suffered the penalty of the law. <note type="footnote"> I There were three hippagretœ at Sparta, who were officers set <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>News being brought to Lacedæmon that a great fleet was being prepared in <lb/>
            Phœnicia by the Persians, Agesilaus collects forces for an expedition into <lb/>
            Asia, and takes Lysander with him. When he is going to sacrifice at <lb/>
            Aulis, he is prevented, with insults, by the Bœotians. He sails to Ephe­ <lb/>
            sus, and having acquainted Tissaphernes that he was come to set free the <lb/>
            Greek cities in Asia, Tissaphernes makes a truce with him until he should <lb/>
            communicate with the king. Agesilaus religiously observes the truce ; <lb/>
            Tissaphernes pays too little regard to it. Lysander, conducting himself <lb/>
            too ostentatiously, is sent away to the Hellespont, where he is of some <lb/>
            service to Agesilaus. Tissaphernes, elated by a reinforcement from the <lb/>
            king, prepares for way with Agesilaus, unless he should quit Asia. Age­ <lb/>
            silaus invades Phrygia, and carries off a great quantity of spoil. The <lb/>
            cavalry of Pharnabazus encounter those of Agesilaus, who puts them to <lb/>
            flight with the aid of his infantry. He prepares to raise an additional <lb/>
            number of cavalry. In the spring he resumes hostilities, and eludes and <lb/>
            defeats the forces of Tissaphernes, who, not being present in the engage­ <lb/>
            ment, is accused of treachery to the king, and beheaded by Tithraustes.</p>
          <p>1. SHORTLY after these occurrences, a person named He­ <lb/>
            rodes, a native of Syracuse, being with a master of a vessel <lb/>
            in Phœnicia, and seeing there several Phœnician galleys, some <lb/>
            arriving from other parts, some being manned where they <lb/>
            were, and some still in a state of preparation, and hearing <lb/>
            besides that there were to be three hundred in all, went on <lb/>
            board the first vessel that was sailing for Greece, and gave <lb/>
            notice to the Lacedæmonians that " the king and Tissaphernes <lb/>
            were preparing this fleet, but whither it was to be sent," he <lb/>
            said, “ he did not know." 2. The Lacedæmonians being roused <lb/>
            at this intelligence, and assembling their allies and consulting <lb/>
            how they ought to act, Lysander, who believed that the Greeks <lb/>
            would be far superior in naval force, and reflected how the <lb/>
            troops that went up with Cyrus had saved themselves, per­ <lb/>
            suaded Agesilaus to make an offer, that if they would give <lb/>
            him thirty Spartans,1 two thousand of the newly-enfranchised, <lb/>
            and a body of six thousand of the allies, he would make an <lb/>
            expedition into Asia. In addition to this suggestion, he wished <note type="footnote"> 1 The Lacedæmonians were accustomed to appoint a council of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            to accompany Agesilaus himself, in order that he might re- <lb/>
            establish, in concert with him, the governments of Ten which <lb/>
            had been appointed by him in the several cities, and which <lb/>
            had been abolished by the ephori, who ordered the people to <lb/>
            return to their own forms of government. 3. Agesilaus ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly engaging to undertake the expedition, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians granted him all that he asked, and a supply of corn <lb/>
            for six months. When he had offered such other sacrifices as <lb/>
            were necessary, and especially those preparatory to crossing <lb/>
            the borders, he set forward, and, sending messengers to the <lb/>
            several cities, gave them notice how many men were to be <lb/>
            sent from each, and where they were to join him ; while he <lb/>
            himself proposed to go and sacrifice at Aulis, where Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon had sacrificed when he sailed to Troy. 4. When he <lb/>
            arrived there, the Bœotarchs,1 who heard that he was sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing, sent thither a party of horse, and forbade him to sacri­ <lb/>
            fice there for the future; and the victims which they found <lb/>
            sacrificed they threw off the altar. Agesilaus, making ap­ <lb/>
            peals to the gods, and feeling greatly enraged, went on board <lb/>
            his galley, and sailed off. Arriving at Geræstus, and assem­ <lb/>
            bling there as many of his forces as he could, he set sail for <lb/>
            Ephesus.</p>
          <p>5. When he had arrived there, Tissaphernes, in the first <lb/>
            place, sent messengers to him, and asked him " for what pur­ <lb/>
            pose he was corner He replied, " In order that the Greek <lb/>
            cities in Asia may be free, like those in Greece with us." <lb/>
            To this Tissaphernes rejoined, " If then you are willing to <lb/>
            conclude a truce, until I can send messengers to the king, I <lb/>
            think that you may attain your object and sail back again, if <lb/>
            you think proper." " I should be willing to do so," replied <lb/>
            Agesilaus, " if I were not apprehensive of being deceived by <lb/>
            you. But it is in your power," he added, “ on giving me a <lb/>
            pledge of what you promise, to receive also a pledge from me <lb/>
            that if yon act in the matter without fraud, we will do no <lb/>
            injury to your province during the truce." 6. On this pro­ <lb/>
            posal being made, Tissaphernes swore to Herippidas, Dercy­ <lb/>
            lidas, and Megillus, who were sent to him for the purpose, <lb/>
            that " he would endeavour without fraud to procure a peace <note type="footnote"> 1 The Bœotarchs were the undecemviri of the Thebans, presidents <lb/>
            of Boeotia both in war and peace. The number eleven is given by <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            and they swore to him in return, on the part of Agesilaus, <lb/>
            that " he would, if Tissaphernes acted as he said, strictly ob­ <lb/>
            serve the truce." Tissaphernes, however, soon ceased to ob­ <lb/>
            serve what he had sworn; for, instead of fixing his thoughts <lb/>
            on peace, he sent for a large body of troops from the king, <lb/>
            in addition to those which he already had; but Agesilaus, al­ <lb/>
            though he was aware of his proceedings, nevertheless adhered <lb/>
            to the truce.</p>
          <p>While Agesilaus was passing his time in quiet and inacti­ <lb/>
            vity at Ephesus, the people in general, as the governments in <lb/>
            the cities were unsettled, there being no longer democracies, <lb/>
            as under the Athenians, nor councils of Ten, as under Ly <lb/>
            sander, made application, as they were acquainted with Ly­ <lb/>
            sander, to him, and solicited him to obtain from Agesilaus <lb/>
            whatever they desired. Hence a vast number of persons were <lb/>
            always following and paying court to him, so that Agesilaus <lb/>
            seemed only a private man, and Lysander a king. That this <lb/>
            state of things irritated Agesilaus, he afterwards showed; <lb/>
            and the rest of the Thirty could not hold their peace for <lb/>
            envy, but observed to Agesilaus that Lysander was acting <lb/>
            illegally, in assuming too much ostentation even for the royal <lb/>
            dignity; and when Lysander proceeded to introduce some of <lb/>
            his suitors to Agesilaus, Agesilaus dismissed all those whom <lb/>
            he knew that Lysander was anxious to support, without grant­ <lb/>
            ing their requests. As the result, therefore, was always con­ <lb/>
            trary to Lysander's wishes, he began to understand the state <lb/>
            of things, and no longer permitted a crowd to follow him, but <lb/>
            frankly told those who asked his assistance, that they would <lb/>
            be less likely to succeed if he appeared in their favour. 9. <lb/>
            Being concerned, too, at the dishonour thrown upon him, he <lb/>
            went to Agesilaus, and said to him, “ Were you always clever, <lb/>
            Agesilaus, at humbling your friends?" "Yes, by Jupiter," <lb/>
            replied he, “ at least such as wish to seem greater than my­ <lb/>
            self; but such as promote my honour I should be ashamed if <lb/>
            I did not know how to honour in return." " Perhaps, then," <lb/>
            said Lysander, "you act in a more reasonable way than I <lb/>
            have acted; but for the future, that I may neither feel the <lb/>
            dishonour of wanting influence with you, nor give you any <lb/>
            personal offence, do me the favour to send me to some other <lb/>
            post; for wherever I may be, I will strive to be of service to <lb/>
            you." 10. As he made this proposal, it seemed advisable to <pb n="368"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            Agesilaus to comply with it; and he accordingly despatched <lb/>
            him to the Hellespont. Here Lysander, having learned that <lb/>
            Spithridates the Persian had been in some way insulted1 by <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, sought a conference with him, and persuaded <lb/>
            him to revolt, and to bring with him his children, the money <lb/>
            which he had in his possession, and two hundred cavalry. <lb/>
            The rest Lysander left at Cyzicus, but put Spithridates him­ <lb/>
            self, with his son, on board a vessel, and conveyed him to <lb/>
            Agesilaus ; who, on seeing him, was highly pleased at the <lb/>
            adventure, and immediately proceeded to make inquiries about <lb/>
            the province and government of Pharnabazus.</p>
          <p>11. As Tissaphernes, when he was encouraged by the ar­ <lb/>
            rival of the troops that had come down from the king, declared <lb/>
            war against Agesilaus, unless he should quit Asia, the rest of <lb/>
            the allied force, and whatever Lacedæmonians were with the <lb/>
            king, were evidently much troubled, deeming that the force <lb/>
            with Agesilaus was inferior to that of the king of Persia; <lb/>
            but Agesilaus, with an extremely cheerful countenance, de­ <lb/>
            sired the deputies to acquaint Tissaphernes that " he was <lb/>
            under great obligations to him, as he had, by perjuring him­ <lb/>
            self, rendered the gods his enemies, and made them, at the <lb/>
            same time, favourable to the Greeks." Immediately after­ <lb/>
            wards he issued orders to the troops to prepare to take the <lb/>
            field, and sent notice to the towns at which he had to stop in <lb/>
            his route to Caria, to have provisions ready for sale. He <lb/>
            sent also to the Ionians, Æolians, and the people on the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont, to send their troops that were to join him to Ephesus. <lb/>
            12. Tissaphernes, as Agesilaus had no cavalry, as Caria was <lb/>
            a country unsuitable for them, and as he thought Agesilaus was <lb/>
            exasperated with him for his perfidy, concluded that he would <lb/>
            assuredly march into Caria to attack his residence, and de­ <lb/>
            spatched all his infantry thither, whilst he led his cavalry <lb/>
            round to the plain of the Mæander; imagining that he would <lb/>
            be able to trample down the Greeks with his cavalry before <lb/>
            they reached the parts in which cavalry could not act. Age­ <lb/>
            silaus, however, instead of going towards Caria, turned him­ <lb/>
            self in a quite contrary direction, and proceeded towards <lb/>
            Phrygia; and, receiving such reinforcements as met him on <lb/>
            his route, he led them on with him, reduced the towns, and, <note type="footnote">1 Pharnabazus had sought to make the daughter of Spithridates <lb/>

            by an invasion so unexpected, secured a vast quantity of <lb/>
            spoil.</p>
          <p>is. For some time he pursued his march without molesta­ <lb/>
            tion. But when Dascyleium was at no great distance, his <lb/>
            cavalry, that were in advance, rode up to a rising ground, <lb/>
            that they might see what was before them. By chance, too, <lb/>
            the cavalry of Pharnabazus, commanded by Rathines and <lb/>
            Bagæus, his illegitimate brother, being about equal to the <lb/>
            Greek cavalry in number, were just then sent forward by <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, and rode up to the same eminence at the same <lb/>
            time. Getting sight of one another, scarcely four hundred <lb/>
            feet distant, both parties at first made a halt, the Grecian <lb/>
            cavalry being formed four deep, like a body of foot, the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians with not more than twelve men in front, but several <lb/>
            deep. 14. Soon after the Barbarians advanced first to the <lb/>
            charge; and when they closed hand to hand, whatever Greeks <lb/>
            assailed the enemy, all broke their lances, while the Persians, <lb/>
            who had spears made of cornel-wood, soon killed twelve men <lb/>
            and two horses; and the Greeks were in consequence put to <lb/>
            flight. But as Agesilaus advanced to their relief with the <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops, the Barbarians retreated in their turn, <lb/>
            and one of them was slain.</p>
          <p>15. After this encounter between the cavalry had taken <lb/>
            place, Agesilaus, on offering sacrifice the next day, with a <lb/>
            view to advancing, found the victims inauspicious, and, in <lb/>
            consequence of this indication, turned off and proceeded to­ <lb/>
            wards the coast. But being convinced that, unless he pro­ <lb/>
            cured an efficient body of cavalry, he should be unable to <lb/>
            march over the plains, he decided that he must procure them, <lb/>
            that he might not be obliged to fight like one running away. <lb/>
            He therefore obtained a list of the richest men in all the <lb/>
            towns there, that they might maintain cavalry; and, giving <lb/>
            notice that whoever supplied a horse, arms, and an approved <lb/>
            rider, might be exempted from personal service, he caused his <lb/>
            wishes to be executed as promptly as if each was eagerly seek­ <lb/>
            ing for a man to die in his stead.</p>
          <p>16. In the next place, as soon as the spring appeared, be <lb/>
            assembled his whole force at Ephesus; and, wishing to exer­ <lb/>
            cise his men, he offered prizes for such of the companies of <lb/>
            heavy-armed as should show themselves in the finest condition, <lb/>
            and for such of the troops of cavalry as should exhibit the <note type="footnote"> VOL. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <pb n="370"/>

            best horsemanship; and he promised rewards, also, to such of <lb/>
            the peltasts and archers as should appear ablest in their se­ <lb/>
            veral capacities. In consequence, a person might have seen <lb/>
            all the gymnasia full of men at their exercises, the horse­ <lb/>
            courses full of riders, and the javelin-men and archers im­ <lb/>
            proving themselves in their duties. IT. He indeed made the <lb/>
            whole city in which he was quartered worthy of being seen ; <lb/>
            for the market-place was crowded with horses and arms of all <lb/>
            kinds for sale; and the braziers, carpenters, smiths, curriers, <lb/>
            and decorators were all engaged in preparing equipments for <lb/>
            the field; so that a person might really have thought the city <lb/>
            to be a workshop of war. is. Every spectator, too, would <lb/>
            have felt encouraged at seeing Agesilaus walking in front, and <lb/>
            his men following him with chaplets on their heads, as they <lb/>
            went away from the places of exercise, and proceeded to offer <lb/>
            their chaplets to Diana; for where men reverence the gods, <lb/>
            cultivate martial exercises, and are careful to obey their su­ <lb/>
            periors, how can everything be otherwise than full of the <lb/>
            best hopes ?</p>
          <p>19. Reflecting also that a contempt of the enemy produces <lb/>
            :n men confidence on taking the field, he ordered the criers to <lb/>
            sell such of the Barbarians as were taken prisoners by the <lb/>
            plundering parties, without their upper garments. The sol­ <lb/>
            diers, in consequence, seeing that their skins were extremely <lb/>
            white, as they never stripped themselves for exercise, and that <lb/>
            they were delicate and unfit for labour, as they constantly rode <lb/>
            in carriages, thought that the war would be of no other nature <lb/>
            than if they were going to fight with women.</p>
          <p>20. A year had now expired from the time when Agesilaus <lb/>
            had sailed from Greece; so that the Thirty, of whom Lysander <lb/>
            was chief, returned home by sea, and their successors, the <lb/>
            principal of whom was Herippidas, arrived. Of these, Age­ <lb/>
            silaus appointed Xenocles and another over the cavalry; <lb/>
            Scythes over the heavy-armed that were of the newly-en­ <lb/>
            franchised ; Herippidas over those who had served with <lb/>
            Cyrus; and Migdon over the troops from the allied cities; <lb/>
            and gave them notice that he would immediately lead them <lb/>
            by the shortest route into the best parts of the country, that <lb/>
            they might thence recruit their bodies and their spirits so as <lb/>
            be in a condition for action. 21. Tissaphernes, however, <lb/>
            thought that he made this announcement only with a view to <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="margin"> CII. 4.] <lb/>
            </note>deceive him again, and that he would now undoubtedly invade <lb/>
            Caria. He accordingly despatched his cavalry, as before, into <lb/>
            Caria, and stationed his cavalry at the plain of the Mæander. <lb/>
            But Agesilaus had given no false intimation ; for he marched <lb/>
            at once, as he had signified, to the parts about Sardes; and <lb/>
            proceeding for three days through a country void of enemies, <lb/>
            lie secured abundance of provisions for his army. 22. On the <lb/>
            fourth day the enemy's cavalry appeared, and their commander <lb/>
            ordered the officer in charge of the baggage to cross the river <lb/>
            Pactolus and encamp; the cavalry themselves, seeing the fol­ <lb/>
            lowers of the Greeks dispersed to look for plunder, slew se­ <lb/>
            veral of them. Agesilaus, observing what was taking place, <lb/>
            ordered his cavalry to advance to their succour; and the Per­ <lb/>
            sians, on their side, when they saw the reinforcement coming <lb/>
            up, collected themselves into a body, and drew up, with thia <lb/>
            whole of their numerous troops of cavalry, in order of <lb/>
            battle. 23. Upon this, Agesilaus, knowing that the infantry <lb/>
            of the enemy was not yet at hand, while on his own side none <lb/>
            of the forces that he had procured were absent, thought it a <lb/>
            favourable opportunity to come to an engagement, if he found <lb/>
            it possible. Having offered sacrifice, therefore, he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately led his main body against the cavalry arrayed in front <lb/>
            of him, and ordered the youngest1 of the heavy-armed men <lb/>
            to hurry forward at the same pace with them, and told the <lb/>
            peltasts also to advance running. He then ordered the ca­ <lb/>
            valry to charge, as he and the whole army would follow close <lb/>
            upon them. 24. The Persians stood, indeed, the charge of the <lb/>
            cavalry, but when every species of danger threatened them <lb/>
            at once, they gave way; and some of them immediately met <lb/>
            their fate in the river,2 while the rest fled. The Greeks pur­ <lb/>
            sued, and took their camp. The peltasts, as was to be ex­ <lb/>
            pected, betook themselves to plundering; but Agesilaus sur­ <lb/>
            rounded all with his force, both friend and foe; and a vast <lb/>
            quantity of spoil was captured, which was sold for more than <lb/>
            seventy talents; the camels also were taken on that occasion, <lb/>
            which Agesilaus brought into Greece.</p>
          <p>25. When this engagement took place, Tissaphernes was at <note type="footnote"> 1 Td <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέκα ἀφ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥβης</foreign>.] Properly those of eight-and-twenty years of <lb/>

            Sard8s; so that the Persians laid to his charge, that they had <lb/>
            been betrayed by him. The king of Persia himself, too, know­ <lb/>
            ing that Tissaphernes was the cause of his affairs being in ill <lb/>
            condition, sent down Tithraustes, and had his head cut off.</p>
          <p>Tithraustes, having executed the order, sent deputies to <lb/>
            Agesilaus with this message: “ He, Agesilaus, who was the <lb/>
            cause of trouble to you and us, has received his punishment; <lb/>
            but the king requires that you shall sail home, and that the <lb/>
            cities in Asia, being left to govern themselves by their own <lb/>
            laws, shall pay him the same tribute as formerly." 26. Age­ <lb/>
            silaus replying that “ he could not comply with these requi­ <lb/>
            sitions without the consent of the authorities at home," Tith­ <lb/>
            raustes rejoined, " But till you can learn the wishes of your <lb/>
            countrymen, then, remove your camp into the province of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, since I have taken vengeance on your enemy <lb/>
            here." “ Until I can march thither, therefore," said Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus, " supply me with provisions for my troops." Tithraustes <lb/>
            then gave him thirty talents, and he proceeded, on receipt of <lb/>
            them, into that part of Phrygia belonging to Pharnabazus.</p>
          <p>27. As he was in the plain above Cyme, a message arrived <lb/>
            from the government at home that " he was to direct the fleet <lb/>
            as he judged best, and to appoint as admiral of it whomsoever <lb/>
            he pleased." The Lacedæmonians adopted this measure from <lb/>
            the following consideration, that if the same man should have <lb/>
            the command of both, the land forces would feel far more <lb/>
            confidence, as the efforts of both would be made in concert, <lb/>
            and the fleet would feel more assured, as the land army would <lb/>
            appear to support it wherever it might be necessary. 28. <lb/>
            Agesilaus, accordingly, having received this commission, sent <lb/>
            orders, in the first place, to the towns on the islands and on <lb/>
            the coast, to build as many galleys as each of them might <lb/>
            think proper. New galleys, in consequence, to the number <lb/>
            of a hundred and twenty, were constructed, partly from what <lb/>
            the towns engaged to furnish, and partly from what private <lb/>
            individuals, who wished to oblige Agesilaus, contributed. <lb/>
            29. Peisander, his wife's brother, he appointed admiral, a man <lb/>
            of ambition, and of strong natural abilities, but too little <lb/>
            skilled in the proper management of a fleet.</p>
          <p>Peisander accordingly set out to attend to his naval duties; <lb/>
            and Agesilaus pursued his march, as he had commenced it, <lb/>
            towards Phrygia. <pb n="373"/>

          <p>Agesilaus is desired by Tithraustes to quit Asia, but is so far from obeying <lb/>
            that he contemplates an expedition against the king himself. Tithraustes <lb/>
            sends an envoy into Greece with a large sum of money, to bribe several of <lb/>
            the states to raise war against the Lacedæmonians. The envoy executes <lb/>
            his commission with such subtlety and success, that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            themselves are obliged to commence a war with the Thebans. The Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians are unsuccessful; Lysander is killed at Haliartus, and Pausa­ <lb/>
            nias returns home with the army. Pausanias is found guilty of having <lb/>
            neglected his duty to his country, and afterwards dies in exile at Tegea.</p>
          <p>i. TITHRAUSTES, however, feeling convinced that Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus despised the king's power, and had not the least intention <lb/>
            of quitting Asia, but rather cherished strong hopes of over­ <lb/>
            coming the king, was concerned how to act under the circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and sent into Greece a Rhodian named Timocrates, <lb/>
            giving him money to the amount of fifty talents of silvery and <lb/>
            directing him to distribute it among the principal men in the <lb/>
            several states, on the understanding that they should pro­ <lb/>
            mote war with the Lacedæmonians, requiring from them the <lb/>
            strongest engagements to that effect. Having arrived in <lb/>
            Greece, he gave money, at Thebes, to Androcleides, Ismenias, <lb/>
            and Galaxidorus; at Corinth, to Timolaus and Polyanthes; <lb/>
            and at Argos, to Cylon and those of his party. 2. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, even without receiving any share of the money, were <lb/>
            ready enough to go to war, thinking it dishonourable to be <lb/>
            ruled by the Spartans.2 Those who had received portions ot <lb/>
            the money, spread calumnies regarding the Lacedæmonians in <lb/>
            their respective cities; and when they had brought them to <lb/>
            conceive a detestation of Sparta, they put the principal states <lb/>
            in communication with each other.</p>
          <p>3. But as the leading men at Thebes saw that unless some­ <lb/>
            body should commence hostilities, the Lacedæmonians would <lb/>
            be unwilling to break the treaty with their allies, they prevailed <note type="footnote"> 1 £12,189 10s.; the talent being valued at £243 15s. See Mr. <lb/>

            on the Locrians of Opus to levy contributions on a certain <lb/>
            district, the right to which was disputed between the Phocians <lb/>
            and themselves, expecting that the Phocians, when this took <lb/>
            place, would invade LOCI'is. Nor were they deceived; for <lb/>
            the Phocians burst into LOCI'is at once, and carried off spoil <lb/>
            to many times the amount of the contributions levied. 4. <lb/>
            Androcleides and his party then prevailed on the Thebans to <lb/>
            assist the Locrians, as the Phocians had made an incursion, <lb/>
            not into a disputed territory, but into LOCI'is itself, which was <lb/>
            confessedly in friendship and alliance with Thebes. The <lb/>
            Thebans, therefore, in retaliation, having invaded Phocis and <lb/>
            ravaged the country, the Phocians immediately sent ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors to Lacedæmon, and entreated assistance, representing <lb/>
            that they had not commenced the war, but had gone against <lb/>
            the Locrians in self-defence, s. The Lacedæmonians gladly <lb/>
            caught at a pretext for an attack upon the Thebans, having <lb/>
            long harboured resentment against them for their claim of the <lb/>
            tenth1 belonging to Apollo at Deceleia, and for their refusal <lb/>
            to march with them against the Pirceeus;2 and they accused <lb/>
            them also of persuading the Corinthians not to march with <lb/>
            them; they remembered, too, that they had prevented Agesi­ <lb/>
            bus from sacrificing at Aulis,3 and had even hurled the slain <lb/>
            victims from the altars; and that they had furnished no aid <lb/>
            to Agesilaus for his expedition to Asia. They considered also <lb/>
            that it was a favourable time for leading an army against them, <lb/>
            and for putting a stop to their insolence towards themselves; <lb/>
            for their own affairs in Asia were prosperous, as Agesilaus <lb/>
            was victorious, and no other war stood in their way in Greece. <lb/>
            6. The people of Lacedæmon being of this opinion, the ephori <lb/>
            gave notice for a foreign expedition, and despatched Lysander <lb/>
            to the Phocians, directing him to come with the Phocians <lb/>
            themselves, with the CEteans, the Heracleans, the Melians, <lb/>
            and iEnianes, to Haliartus ; where also Pausanias, who was to <lb/>
            take the command, engaged to arrive with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and the other confederates from the Peloponnesus, by a speci­ <lb/>
            fied day. Lysander executed all the directions that were given <note type="footnote"> 1 " The Thebans alone claimed the tenth from the spoil of the <lb/>

            him, and, in addition, prevailed on the Orchomenians to de­ <lb/>
            tach themselves from the Thebans. 7. But Pausanias, after <lb/>
            the sacrifices were favourable for crossing the borders, en­ <lb/>
            camped at Tegea, and, sending through the country the <lb/>
            officers that were to command the allies, waited for the troops <lb/>
            to arrive from the neighbouring cities. However, as it was <lb/>
            plain to the Thebans that the Lacedæmonians would invade <lb/>
            their territory, they sent ambassadors to Athens, who delivered <lb/>
            the following speech:</p>
          <p>s. " The complaints which you make against us, 0 men of <lb/>
            Athens, as having formed severe resolutions against you at <lb/>
            the close of the war,1 you make without justice; for it was <lb/>
            not the people that formed those resolutions ; it was only one <lb/>
            man,2 who happened then to be at the consultation of the <lb/>
            allies, that spoke to that effect. But when the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            called on us to march with them against the Piræeus, the <lb/>
            whole people at once passed a vote ‛ not to join them.' As <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, therefore, are exasperated against us <lb/>
            chiefly on your account, we think it but right that you should <lb/>
            send succours to our city. 9. Such of you, also, as were among <lb/>
            the number of those in the city, we entreat still more earnestly <lb/>
            to march with vigour against the Lacedæmonians; for after <lb/>
            having established you as an oligarchy, and involved you in <lb/>
            hostilities with the people, they came hither with a large force <lb/>
            in the character of your supporters, and then delivered you <lb/>
            over to the multitude; so that, as far as was in their power, <lb/>
            you were utterly undone, and it was the multitude here that <lb/>
            saved you.</p>
          <p>10. " That you would wish, 0 men of Athens, to recover <lb/>
            that power which you formerly possessed, we all know; and <lb/>
            by what means is it more likely that this object should be <lb/>
            effected, than by succouring, of yourselves, those who are <lb/>
            oppressed by the Lacedcemonians? Be not afraid of them <lb/>
            because they rule over many states, but rather be greatly <lb/>
            encouraged, by that consideration, to resist them; reflecting <lb/>
            that you yourselves, when you had the greatest number of <note type="footnote"> 1 See ii. 2. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He is called Erianthus by Plutarch, Lysand. c. 15. He pro­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            subjects, had also the greatest number of enemies. As long, <lb/>
            indeed, as they had nobody to whom they could revolt, they <lb/>
            concealed their enmity against you; but when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians stood forward as leaders, they at once showed what <lb/>
            their feelings towards you were; 11. and be assured that if <lb/>
            you and we, on the present occasion, appear openly uniting <lb/>
            our strength against the Lacedæmonians, many who cherish <lb/>
            hatred to them will openly declare it.</p>
          <p>" That we speak what is true, you will, if you reflect, pre­ <lb/>
            sently acknowledge. For what people of Greece continues <lb/>
            now well-affected towards them ? Have not the Argives been <lb/>
            constantly their enemies? 12. The Eleians, deprived of a <lb/>
            great portion of land, and of several towns, have become also <lb/>
            their enemies. The Corinthians, Arcadians, and Achæans, <lb/>
            we need hardly mention; people who, during the war with <lb/>
            yourselves, were earnestly solicited to join them, and shared <lb/>
            in all its toils, dangers, and expenses; but, when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians had effected their objects, of what dominion, or lion­ <lb/>
            ours, or gains, did they allow them to partake ? They even <lb/>
            think their helots worthy to be made harmosts, and have de­ <lb/>
            clared themselves, since their successes, despots over their free <lb/>
            allies. 13. Those whom they seduced from you they have <lb/>
            manifestly deceived; for, instead of giving them freedom, <lb/>
            they have laid upon them a double weight of bondage, for <lb/>
            they are oppressed both by the harmosts, and by the councils <lb/>
            of ten that Lysander has established in every city. As to the <lb/>
            monarch of Asia himself, who contributed the most to their <lb/>
            victory over you, what better treatment does he meet with <lb/>

            who are thus aggrieved, how can it be improbable that you <lb/>
            may become greater than any people ever were ? When you <lb/>
            were in power before, you had dominion only by sea; but now <lb/>
            you may be masters of all, of us, of the Peloponnesians, of <lb/>

            has the largest share of power. We were allies of some con­ <lb/>

            apparent that we shall support you with far more vigour in <lb/>

          <p>15. " You ought also to understand that the usurpation of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians is far more easy to be overthrown than <lb/>
            your government was; for you, having a fleet, ruled over <lb/>
            people who had none ; but they, being but few, encroach upon <lb/>
            others many times as numerous as themselves, and not at all <lb/>

            as inviting you to a course of conduct that will be even more <lb/>
            beneficial for your city than for ours."</p>
          <p>16. The speaker, having made these representations, con­ <lb/>
            eluded. Many of the Athenians then spoke to the same <lb/>
            effect, and all unanimously passed a decree for supporting the <lb/>
            Thebans. Thrasybulus, showing the ambassadors the decree <lb/>
            by way of answer, 1 remarked to them also, that though the <lb/>
            Piræus was yet unwalled, they would nevertheless venture <lb/>
            to return them greater favours than they had themselves re­ <lb/>
            ceived : " for you, Thebans," he said, " merely forbore from <lb/>
            joining our enemies against us, but we will actually fight for <lb/>
            you against your enemies the Lacedæmonians, if they attack <lb/>
            you." 17. The Thebans accordingly departed, and made pre­ <lb/>
            parations for their defence; the Athenians made arrangements <lb/>
            for sending them succour.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians, indeed, lost no more time; for Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias their king marched into Boeotia with the forces from <lb/>
            Sparta and those from the rest of the Peloponnesus, except <lb/>
            that the Corinthians did not join them. Lysander, however, <lb/>
            who was bringing up the troops from the Phocians, from <lb/>
            Orchomenus, and from the adjacent parts, arrived at Haliartus <lb/>
            before Pausanias. is. When he was come thither, he did not <lb/>
            wait quietly for the army from Lacedæmon, but advanced with <lb/>
            the force which he had up to the walls of Haliartus. At first <lb/>
            he solicited the people to revolt, and declare themselves in­ <lb/>
            dependent; but as some of the Thebans, who were in the <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αποκρινάμενος τὸ ψήφισμα</foreign>.] Thrasybulus seems to have read <lb/>

            city, prevented them from doing so, he made an attack upon <lb/>
            the walls. 19. The Thebans, hearing of the assault, hurried <lb/>
            off, both heavy-armed and cavalry, to succour the place; but <lb/>
            whether, unobserved by Lysander, they fell suddenly upon <lb/>
            him, or whether he, perceiving their approach, awaited them <lb/>
            in full assurance of victory, is uncertain; this, however, is <lb/>
            undisputed, that a battle was fought under the walls, and a <lb/>
            trophy erected at the gates, of Haliartus. As the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian party, Lysander being killed,1 fled to the mountain, <lb/>
            the Thebans pursued them with great vigour. 20. But when, <lb/>
            in their pursuit, they had gained the ascent, and difficulties <lb/>
            and defiles prevented their progress, the heavy-armed men <lb/>
            faced about and hurled down javelins and stones upon them; <lb/>
            and as two or three of the foremost fell, and they rolled down <lb/>
            large pieces of rock upon the rest, and pressed upon them with <lb/>
            great spirit, the Thebans were forced to take flight down the <lb/>
            hill, and more than two hundred of them were killed.</p>
          <p>21. During that day, therefore, the Thebans remained dis­ <lb/>
            pirited. thinking that they had suffered no less loss than they <lb/>
            had inflicted; but on the next day, when they found that the <lb/>
            Phocians had gone off in the night, and that the rest of the <lb/>
            confederates were taking their departure to their several <lb/>
            homes, they then felt more elated at what had taken place. <lb/>
            But when again Pausanias came in sight, with the army from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, they thought themselves once more in extreme <lb/>
            peril, and it was said that deep silence and dejection prevailed <lb/>
            throughout their force. 22. Yet as, on the next day, the <lb/>
            Athenians arrived and formed a junction with them, and Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias neither advanced nor prepared for battle, the spirits of <lb/>
            the Thebans began to be greatly exalted. Pausanias, on his <lb/>
            side, having called together his generals and captains, held a <lb/>
            council whether he should give battle, or fetch off Lysander, <lb/>
            and those who had fallen with him, under favour of a truce. <lb/>
            But as not only Pausanias himself, but the rest of the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonians that were in authority, reflected that Lysander <lb/>
            was no more, and that his army was defeated and dispersed; <lb/>
            that the Corinthians had utterly refused to follow them; and <note type="footnote"> 1 Lysander was killed by Nearchus of Haliartus, on the hill <lb/>
            Archelis, which was also called Alopecus, near the river Hoplites, <lb/>

            that the troops who were with them were serving unwillingly; <lb/>
            and as they considered, too, that the cavalry of the enemy <lb/>
            was numerous, and their own but few, and, what was most <lb/>
            important of all, that the dead were lying under the walls, so <lb/>
            that it would not be easy for them to fetch them off, even if <lb/>
            they gained a victory, because of the enemy on the towers; <lb/>
            they deemed it advisable, on all these accounts, to bring on <lb/>
            the dead under a truce. 24. But the Thebans declared that <lb/>
            they would not give up the dead, except on condition that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians should quit the country. The Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans, however, listened to these terms with pleasure, and, taking <lb/>
            off the dead, prepared to march out of Bccotia. When these <lb/>
            matters were settled, the Lacedæmonians commenced their <lb/>
            retreat with great dejection, while the Thebans went off with <lb/>
            extreme insolence ; and if any of the Lacedæmonians, on their <lb/>
            march, trespassed in the slightest degree on the grounds o <lb/>
            any person, they drove them back with blows into the road. <lb/>
            Thus was this army of the Lacedemonians disbanded.</p>
          <p>25. However, Pausanias, when he returned home, was <lb/>
            brought to trial for his life. Being accused of having arrived <lb/>
            later than Lysander at Haliartus, though he had engaged to <lb/>
            be there on the same day; of having resolved to recover the <lb/>
            dead by a truce instead of a battle; and of having let the <lb/>
            popular party at Athens escape,1 when he had surprised them <lb/>
            at the Piræeus; and being, besides, absent on the day ap­ <lb/>
            pointed for his trial, sentence of death was pronounced against <lb/>
            him; and he fled to Tegea, where he died a natural death. <lb/>
            Such were the events that occurred in Greece. <note type="footnote"> 1 For this supposed offence Pausanias had already been tried and <lb/>

          <p>Agesilaus, by the advice of Spithridates, proceeds to Paphlagonia, and <lb/>
            makes an alliance with Otys the king, to whom he marries the daughter <lb/>
            of Spithridates. He winters at Dascyleium, where Spithridates, on being <lb/>
            deprived of his share of some spoil that he had taken, left him, and went <lb/>
            off to Ariæus. A conference is held between Pharnabazus and Agesilaus, <lb/>
            at which Pharnabazus states that if he should be put under the power of <lb/>
            another by the king of Persia, he would join Agesilaus, but that, if the <lb/>
            king should give him supreme authority, he would oppose Agesilaus to <lb/>
            the utmost of his power. Agesilaus, charmed with his frankness, desists <lb/>
            from ravaging his province. But as he is meditating an expedition against <lb/>
            the king of Persia, he is recalled to defend his country</p>
          <p>1. WHEN Agesilaus arrived, at the beginning of autumn, at <lb/>
            that part of Phrygia under the government of Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            he proceeded to burn and lay waste the country, and took <lb/>
            several cities, some by force, and others by voluntary surren­ <lb/>
            der. 2. But as Spithridates1 told him that if he would ac­ <lb/>
            company him into Paphlagonia, he would bring the king2 of the <lb/>
            Paphlagonians to a conference with him, and make him his <lb/>
            ally, he readily marched thither, having long desired to detach <lb/>
            some nation3 from the king.</p>
          <p>3. As soon as he entered Paphlagonia, Otys came to him, <lb/>
            and agreed to make an alliance; for, though he had received <lb/>
            a summons from the king, he had not gone up in obedience to <lb/>
            it. At the solicitation of Spithridates, Otys left with Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus a thousand horse and two hundred peltasts.</p>
          <p>4. Agesilaus, feeling grateful to Spithridates for these <lb/>
            services, said to him, “ Tell me, Spithridates, would you <lb/>
            not be willing to marry your daughter to Otys ? ” " Much <lb/>
            more willing indeed," replied Spithridates, "than he would <lb/>
            be to take for a wife the daughter of an exile, when he is <lb/>
            king over an extensive territory and great forces." This was <lb/>
            all that was said of the marriage on that occasion. 5. But <note type="footnote">1 iii. 4. 10. 2 Called Otys in the next sect. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αφιστάναι τι ἔθνος</foreign>.] Schneider, Weiske, and Moms read TO <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CH. I.] <lb/>
            </note>when Otys was going away, he went to Agesilaus to take his <lb/>
            leave; and Agesilaus, sending Spithridates out of the way, <lb/>
            entered upon the subject in the presence of the Thirty, 6. <lb/>
            saying, “ Tell me, Otys, of what sort of family is Spithri­ <lb/>
            dates ? " Otys replied that he was inferior in birth to no one <lb/>
            of the Persians. " And have you observed," said Agesilaus, <lb/>
            “ how handsome a youth his son is ?" "How can I have <lb/>
            failed to do so ? for I supped last night in his company." <lb/>
            " But they say that he has a daughter much more handsome." <lb/>
            " By Jupiter, then," said Otys, "she must be handsome indeed." <lb/>
            7. " And for my part," said Agesilaus, " since you are become <lb/>
            our friend, I would recommend that this daughter of his <lb/>
            should become your wife. She is extremely beautiful, and <lb/>
            what is more pleasing to a husband than beauty ? and she is <lb/>
            the daughter of a man of the highest birth, and of so great <lb/>
            power, that having been wronged by Pharnabazus, he has in­ <lb/>
            flicted such vengeance upon him as to render him a fugitive <lb/>
            from his whole province, as you yourself see." 8. " Be assured, <lb/>
            too," added he, " that as he is able to avenge himself upon <lb/>
            Pharnabazus his enemy, so he would be able to do service to <lb/>
            a friend. Consider also that, if this connexion is formed, it is <lb/>
            not Spithridates only that will be joined in affinity with you, <lb/>
            but myself and all the Lacedæmonians, and, as we rule Greece, <lb/>
            the rest of Greece besides. 9. And if you comply with my <lb/>
            proposal, who would ever celebrate his marriage with greater <lb/>
            pomp than yourself ? For what bride have so many horse­ <lb/>
            men, and peltasts, and heavy-armed troops, ever escorted <lb/>
            home, as will escort yours home to you?" 10. Otys then <lb/>
            asked, ,: Do you make this proposal, Agesilaus, with the sanc­ <lb/>
            tion of Spithridates ? " " By the gods," replied Agesilaus, <lb/>
            “ he gave me no commission to make any such suggestion. <lb/>
            For myself, however, though I rejoice exceedingly when I <lb/>
            take vengeance on an enemy, I am sensible of feeling much <lb/>
            greater joy when I discover anything good for my friends." <lb/>
            11. “ Why, then," said Otys, "do you not ask him whether <lb/>
            the proposal is agreeable to him ?" “ Go you, therefore, <lb/>
            Herippidas," said he, Hand prevail on him to be of the same <lb/>
            mind with us." 12. Herippidas and his colleagues accordingly <lb/>
            rose up and went to use their influence with him. As they <lb/>
            made some delay, " Are you willing, Otys," said Agesilaus, <lb/>
            “that we should send for him hither ? ”" Indeed I think," <pb n="382"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            replied Otys, "that he would be persuaded by you sooner <lb/>
            than by all the rest." Agesilaus accordingly called in Spithri­ <lb/>
            dates and the others. is. As they came forward, Herippidas <lb/>
            immediately said, " Why should we give a long account, Age­ <lb/>
            silaus, of everything else that has been said ? for, in conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, Spithridates says that he will gladly do whatever may <lb/>
            please you." 14. " It pleases me, then," rejoined Agesilaus, <lb/>
            " that you, Spithridates, with the favour of fortune, should <lb/>
            give your daughter to Otys, and that you, Otys, should take <lb/>
            her. We should not however be able to escort the damsel by <lb/>
            land before the spring." But, by Jupiter," returned Otys, <lb/>
            " she may at once be sent by sea, if you desire it." 15. Having <lb/>
            accordingly given their hands to one another to adhere to this <lb/>
            contract, they sent Otys away.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus, as he knew that Otys was impatient, manned a <lb/>
            galley without delay, and, having ordered Callias the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian to take off the damsel in it, marched himself <lb/>
            towards Dascyleium, where Pharnabazus had a palace, round <lb/>
            which were a number of populous villages, stored with <lb/>
            abundance of provisions. 16. There was also excellent hunt­ <lb/>
            ing there, both in the parks and in the open grounds; while <lb/>
            a river, full of all sorts of fish, surrounded the whole; and <lb/>
            there were plenty of birds, too, for those who were skilful in <lb/>
            fowling. Here he passed the winter, obtaining supplies from <lb/>
            the place itself, or fetching them by means of foraging <lb/>
            parties. i. But as the soldiers, on one occasion, were getting <lb/>
            provisions without any apprehension from the enemy, or tak­ <lb/>
            ing any precaution against them, because they had hitherto <lb/>
            suffered no injury, Pharnabazus, with two scythed-chariots, <lb/>
            and about four hundred horse, surprised them while they <lb/>
            were scattered over the plain, is. The Greeks, when they <lb/>
            saw him advancing, ran together in a body to the number of <lb/>
            about seven hundred. Pharnabazus made no delay, but post­ <lb/>
            ing his chariots in front, and taking his own station with the <lb/>
            cavalry behind, gave orders to charge the enemy. 19. As the <lb/>
            chariots, dashing in among the Greeks, scattered their force, <lb/>
            the cavalry soon despatched about a hundred of them ; the <lb/>
            rest fled to Agesilaus, who happened to be at hand with the <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops.</p>
          <p>so. The third or fourth day after this occurrence, Spithri­ <lb/>
            dates discovered that Pharnabazus was encamped at Caue, a <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            large village about a hundred and sixty stadia distant, and <lb/>
            immediately sent intelligence of the circumstance to Herippi­ <lb/>
            das. 21. Herippidas, who was eager to achieve some splendid <lb/>
            exploit, asked Agesilaus for two thousand heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            as many peltasts, the cavalry belonging to Spithridates and <lb/>
            the Paphlagonians, and as many of the Greeks besides as he <lb/>
            could persuade to accompany him. 22. As Agesilaus pro­ <lb/>
            mised to let him have them, he proceeded to offer sacrifice, <lb/>
            and, having found favourable omens, finished the sacrifice <lb/>
            in the evening. Immediately after, he ordered the men to <lb/>
            take their supper and join him in front of the camp. 23. <lb/>
            When darkness came on, however, not half of each troop had <lb/>
            come out; yet, for fear that the rest of the Thirty, if he should <lb/>
            draw back from the enterprise, would turn him to ridicule, <lb/>
            he marched off with what force he had; 24. and as he fell <lb/>
            suddenly, at break of day, on the camp of Pharnabazus, many <lb/>
            of his advanced guard, consisting of Mysians, were killed ; <lb/>
            the Persians fled, and the camp was taken, with a great quan­ <lb/>
            tity of plate and other valuables, that formed the equipment <lb/>
            of Pharnabazus, as well as abundance of baggage, and a vast <lb/>
            number of beasts of burden ; 25. for as Pharnabazus was <lb/>
            afraid that, if he made any stay in a place, he should be sur­ <lb/>
            rounded and besieged, he removed, like the Nomadic tribes, <lb/>
            sometimes to one part of the country, sometimes to another, <lb/>
            concealing his place of encampment with the utmost caution. <lb/>
            26. But when the Paphlagonians and Spithridates were bring­ <lb/>
            ing off the booty that had been taken, Herippidas, posting his <lb/>
            centurions and captains for the purpose, took away from <lb/>
            Spithridates and the Paphlagonians all that they had, in order <lb/>
            that he himself might bring in as much booty as possible to <lb/>
            the officers appointed to sell it. 27. To this treatment, how­ <lb/>
            ever, they would not submit, but thinking themselves wrong­ <lb/>
            ed and insulted, packed up their baggage and went off in the <lb/>
            night to Sardes to join Ariæus,1 being confident of a favour­ <lb/>
            able reception with him, because he had revolted from the <lb/>
            king, and was at war with him. 28. To Agesilaus nothing <lb/>
            was a matter of greater concern, during the campaign, than <note type="footnote"> 1 The same that had joined Cyrus the younger when he went to <lb/>

            gonians.</p>
          <p>29. There was a man named Apollophanes, a native of <lb/>
            Cyzicus, who had been for a long time a guest-friend of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, and had at this period also become a guest- <lb/>
            friend to Agesilaus. This man remarked to Agesilaus that <lb/>
            he thought he could bring Pharnabazus to a conference with <lb/>
            him about a peace. As Agesilaus listened to him, he brought <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, after obtaining from him a truce, and a pledge <lb/>
            of faith, to a place which had been agreed upon, where Age­ <lb/>
            silaus and the Thirty were seated on the grass and waiting for <lb/>
            him. so. Pharnabazus came in a dress of great value ; but <lb/>
            as his attendants were spreading carpets for him, on which <lb/>
            the Persians sit at ease, he was ashamed, when he saw the <lb/>
            simplicity of Agesilaus, to indulge himself in such a manner, <lb/>
            and threw himself down, as he was, on the bare ground. 31. <lb/>
            In the first place they saluted one another, and then, a? <lb/>
            Pharnabazus extended his hand, Agesilaus extended his in re­ <lb/>
            turn, when Pharnabazus, for he was the elder, began to <lb/>
            speak :</p>
          <p>32. " I was a friend and ally to you, Agesilaus, and all you <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians who are present, when you were at war with <lb/>
            the Athenians; I both strengthened your fleet by supplying <lb/>
            you with money, and, by land, I fought on horseback in com­ <lb/>
            pany with you, and pursued your enemies into the sea;2 nor <lb/>
            can you accuse me of acting with duplicity, like Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            either in deed or word towards you. 33. But, after conduct­ <lb/>
            ing myself thus in regard to you, I receive such treatment <lb/>
            from you, that I cannot get even a meal in my own province, <lb/>
            unless I gather up, like the beasts, a portion of what you may <lb/>
            have left; while I see the beautiful houses, and the parks <lb/>
            stocked with timber and cattle, which my father left me, and <lb/>
            in which I delighted, cut down or burnt. If, therefore, I do <lb/>
            not know what is right and just, teach me yourselves how <lb/>
            these can be the actions of men who know how to return <lb/>
            good offices."</p>
          <p>34. Thus spoke Pharnabazus, and the Thirty all felt ashamed <note type="footnote">1 The love of Agesilaus for this youth is noticed at some length <lb/>
            by Xenophon in his Agesilaus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. 1. 6. </note> <pb n="385"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            before him, and kept silence. Agesilaus, however, after some <lb/>
            little time, addressed him thus:</p>
          <p>"I think that you are aware, Pharnabazus, that in the <lb/>
            cities of Greece men form connexions of hospitality with one <lb/>
            another, yet, when the states of which they are members go <lb/>
            to war with each other, they exercise hostilities, in behalf of <lb/>
            their respective countries, even on those with whom they are <lb/>
            in hospitable union, and they may, if it so happen, kill one <lb/>
            another. We, in like manner, being now at war with your <lb/>
            king, are obliged to regard all that is his as hostile to us; yet <lb/>
            to yourself, individually, we should desire, above all things, to <lb/>
            be friends. 35. If, indeed, you were merely to make an ex­ <lb/>
            change, and take us for your masters instead of having the <lb/>
            king for your master, I would not advise you to make such <lb/>
            exchange; but it is now in your power, if you join us, to live <lb/>
            in the full enjoyment of what belongs to you, without paying <lb/>
            obeisance to any one, or having any master at all; and I con­ <lb/>
            sider, indeed, that to be free is worth all the riches in the <lb/>
            world. 36. Yet we do not call upon you, while you become <lb/>
            free, to become at the same time poor, but, by using our ser­ <lb/>
            vices as allies, to enlarge, not the dominions of the king, but <lb/>
            your own, and to oblige those who are now your fellow-slaves <lb/>
            to become your subjects. And if you be free, and at the <lb/>
            same time become rich, what will you want to be completely <lb/>
            happy?"</p>
          <p>37. " Shall I then," asked Pharnabazus, " tell you in one <lb/>
            word what I mean to do ?" " It will be well for you to do <lb/>
            so," said Agesilaus. " Then," continued Pharnabazus, " if the <lb/>
            king sends down another satrap, and orders me to be subject <lb/>
            to him, I shall willingly become your friend and ally. But if <lb/>
            he assigns the supreme command to me, you may be assured <lb/>
            that (such, it seems, is the influence of ambition) I shall pro­ <lb/>
            secute the war against you to the utmost of my power." 38. <lb/>
            Agesilaus, on hearing this, took hold of his hand and said, <lb/>
            " Noble-minded man, would that, being such as you are, you <lb/>
            may become our friend! But be assured of one thing, that <lb/>
            I will now march out of your province as soon as I can; and, <lb/>
            for the future, if the war continue, we will, as long as we have <lb/>
            another to attack, forbear from molesting you and yours."</p>
          <p>39. Having spoken thus, Agesilaus put an end to the con­ <lb/>
            ference, and Pharnabazus, mounting his horse, rode away; <note type="footnote"> VOL II, </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <pb n="386"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            but his son by Parapitas,l a person still in the beauty of youth, <lb/>
            lingered behind, and, running up to Agesilaus, said, " I take <lb/>
            you, Agesilaus, for my guest-friend." " And I receive you <lb/>
            for mine," replied Agesilaus. " Remember me, then," said <lb/>
            he, and immediately presented his lance (and a beautiful one <lb/>
            he had) to Agesilaus, who accepted it, and as his secretary,2 <lb/>
            Idæus, had beautiful trappings on his horse, he took them off, <lb/>
            and gave them to the young man in return. The son then <lb/>
            leaped upon his horse and followed the father. 40. Some time <lb/>
            after, when, in the absence of Pharnabazus, another brother <lb/>
            deprived the son of Parapitas of his command, and drove him <lb/>
            into exile, Agesilaus paid him great attention in other respects, <lb/>
            and also, when he conceived a great affection for an Athenian <lb/>
            youth, the son of Eualces, used every exertion that he might <lb/>
            be admitted, for his sake, to the stadium at Olympia, though <lb/>
            he was taller than any of the other youths.3</p>
          <p>41. Agesilaus, as he had promised Pharnabazus, immedi­ <lb/>
            ately marched out of his province; and soon after the spring <lb/>
            came on. Having advanced into the plain of Thebe, he en­ <lb/>
            camped about the temple of Diana Astyrene,4 where he col­ <lb/>
            lected, from all quarters, a numerous force in addition to that <lb/>
            which he had; for he was preparing to march as far up the <lb/>
            country as he could, considering that whatever people he left <lb/>
            behind him, he would completely detach from the king. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκ τη̃ς Παραπίτας</foreign>.]Perhaps we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παραπίταδος</foreign>, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Agesilaus returns to Greece. The Corinthians consult the Boeotians and <lb/>
            their other allies about the proper method of going to war with Sparta, <lb/>
            the Spartans invade the territory of Sicyon. In a battle which ensues, <lb/>
            the allies of the Lacedæmonians are all defeated except the Pellenians, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians themselves are victorious, and make great havoc <lb/>
            among the enemy.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH were the occupations in which Agesilaus was en­ <lb/>
            gaged. But the Lacedæmonians, when they knew for certain <lb/>
            that money was come into Greece, and that the chief cities <lb/>
            were combining to go to war with them, thought their city in <lb/>
            great danger, and judged it necessary to take the field. 2. <lb/>
            They accordingly made preparations for the purpose, and <lb/>
            despatched, at the same time, Epicydides to Agesilaus. Epi­ <lb/>
            cydides, when he came into the king's presence, told him how <lb/>
            things were in other respects, and that " the state sent him <lb/>
            orders to come to the succour of his country as soon as pos­ <lb/>
            sible." 3. Agesilaus, on hearing this message, was greatly <lb/>
            concerned, contemplating the honours and expectations of <lb/>
            which he would be disappointed; nevertheless, calling an <lb/>
            assembly of the allies, he communicated to them the orders <lb/>
            which had been sent him by the government, and stated that <lb/>
            it was incumbent on him to go to support his country; " but," <lb/>
            said he, " if matters succeed well there, be assured, my friends <lb/>
            and confederates, that I shall not be unmindful of you, but <lb/>
            shall return to accomplish what you desire." 4. On hearing <lb/>
            these words, many shed tears, and all declared their resolution <lb/>
            to go with Agesilaus to the aid of Sparta, and, if affairs in <lb/>
            Greece proved fortunate, to return with him again into Asia. <lb/>
            They in consequence prepared themselves to follow him.</p>
          <p>5. Agesilaus left Euxenus as harmost in Asia, and with <lb/>
            him not less than four thousand troops for garrisons, that he <lb/>
            might be able to secure the cities. But observing that many <lb/>
            of the soldiers were more inclined to stay where they were <lb/>
            than to bear arms against Greeks,1 and yet being desirous to <note type="footnote">1 Having experienced the timidity of the Persians, and having <lb/>
            begun to enjoy their effeminacy and splendour, they were more <lb/>
            willing to continue the present war in Asia than to engage in an­ <lb/>
            other against their own countrymen. Schneider </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 C 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>

            take with him the greatest possible number, in the best possi­ <lb/>
            ble condition, he offered prizes for such of the cities as should <lb/>
            send in the choicest bodies of men, as well as to such of the <lb/>
            captains of the mercenaries, the heavy-armed, the archers, <lb/>
            and the peltasts, as should present their companies in the best <lb/>
            state of equipment. He gave notice also to the commanders <lb/>
            of cavalry, that he would give prizes to such of them as ex­ <lb/>
            hibited their troops best mounted and best accoutred. 6. The <lb/>
            decision he said that he would make in the Chersonesus, as <lb/>
            soon as they had crossed over from Asia into Europe, that <lb/>
            they might fully understand that all who engaged in the cam­ <lb/>
            paign must equip themselves carefully.1 7. The prizes were <lb/>
            chiefly arms for infantry and cavalry, elegantly made; there <lb/>
            were also golden crowns; and the whole of the prizes were <lb/>
            worth not less than four talents. Such a sum being expended, <lb/>
            arms cf great value were provided for the army. s. When <lb/>
            he had passed over the Hellespont, judges were appointed; of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, Menascus, Herippidas, and Orsippus; of <lb/>
            the allies, one from each city. Agesilaus, as soon as he had <lb/>
            made the adjudication, set forward with his army by the same <lb/>
            road which Xerxes had taken when he invaded Greece.</p>
          <p>9. In the mean time the ephori had given notice of an ex­ <lb/>
            pedition ; and the government, as Agesipolis was yet a minor, <lb/>
            commissioned Aristodemus, who was of the royal family, and <lb/>
            guardian to the young king, to take the command of the army. <lb/>
            10. When the Lacedæmonians had marched forth, and their <lb/>
            adversaries were assembled, the latter held a council how they <lb/>
            might come to a battle with the greatest advantage to them­ <lb/>
            selves ; and Timolaus the Corinthian spoke as follows: 11. <lb/>
            " The power of the Lacedæmonians, my friends and allies, <lb/>
            seems to me to resemble the course of rivers; for rivers, at <lb/>
            their sources, are small and easy to be crossed, but the farther <lb/>
            they go from their sources, the stronger do other rivers, that <lb/>
            flow into them, render their streams. 12. In like manner the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, at the point from which they commence their <lb/>
            course, are alone, but, as they proceed, and attach other peo- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐκρινει̃ν</foreign>.] The critics are uncertain whether to take this verb <lb/>
            in an active or neuter sense; whether to refer it to the officers, in <lb/>
            the sense of accuratum militum delectum habere, or to the soldiers, in <lb/>
            the sense of accurate se parare. I have, with Schneider, preferred <lb/>
            the latter. Weiske adopts the other. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            ple to them, they become more numerous and more difficult <lb/>
            to be resisted. I see also," he added, " that such as wish to <lb/>
            destroy wasps, are, if they attempt to hunt them as they issue <lb/>
            from their nests, stung by vast numbers of them; but that if, <lb/>
            while they are still in the nest, they apply fire to it, they suffer <lb/>
            nothing, but overcome the wasps. Taking instruction from <lb/>
            these examples, I think it best for us to fight our battle in <lb/>
            Sparta itself, or, if not, as near to it as possible." 13. As he <lb/>
            appeared to offer reasonable advice, they decided upon the <lb/>
            course which he recommended. But whilst they were settling <lb/>
            about the command, and discussing how deep the army should <lb/>
            be formed, (lest, if the states ranged their troops too deep, <lb/>
            they should give the enemy an opportunity of surrounding <lb/>
            them,) the Lacedæmonians, during the interval, having joined <lb/>
            to themselves the Tegeans and Mantineans, had passed beyond <lb/>
            the parts near the sea.1 14. As both parties advanced, the <lb/>
            forces of the Corinthians were now almost at Nemea, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and their allies at Sicyon. As the latter were <lb/>
            effecting a passage by Epieicia,2 the light troops of the enemy, <lb/>
            by discharging stones and arrows at them from the heights, <lb/>
            had at first grievously annoyed them ; 15. but when they came <lb/>
            down to the sea, they proceeded through the plain there, ra­ <lb/>
            vaging and burning the country; their adversaries, however, <lb/>
            who were still advancing, came to an encampment with the <lb/>
            ravine3 in front of them. The Lacedæmonians, too, when <lb/>
            they came up, and were scarcely ten stadia from the enemy, <lb/>
            encamped there also and remained quiet.</p>
          <p>16. I will now state the force on each side. The heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops of the Lacedæmonians were assembled to the <lb/>
            number of six thousand; of the Eleians, Triphylians, Acro­ <lb/>
            reans, and Lasionians, there were nearly three thousand; of <lb/>
            the Sicyonians fifteen hundred; of the Epidaurians, Trœze­ <lb/>

            lowed, and slingers, from the Marganians, Letrians, and Amphi. <lb/>
            dolians, not fewer than four hundred. The Phliasians did <lb/>
            not join the army, for they alleged that they had made a <lb/>
            truce. Such was the force on the side of the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            17. On that of the enemy were assembled, of the Athenians, six <lb/>
            hundred heavy-armed troops ; of the Argives, there were said <lb/>
            to be about seven thousand; of the Boeotians, as the Orcho­ <lb/>
            menians had not arrived, about five thousand; of the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians three thousand; and from the whole of Eubœa not <lb/>
            fewer than three thousand. This was the number of their <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops; the cavalry numbered, from the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, as that of Orchomenos had not arrived, about eight <lb/>
            hundred; from the Athenians, six hundred; from the Chal­ <lb/>
            cideans in Eubœa a hundred ; and from the Opuntian Lo­ <lb/>
            crians fifty. Their light troops, including those of the <lb/>
            Corinthians, were more numerous than those of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ; for the Ozolian Locrians, Melians, and Acarnanians, <lb/>
            had joined them.</p>
          <p>is. Such was the strength of the two parties. The Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, as long as they held the left wing,l were not in the least <lb/>
            hurry to join battle; but as soon as the Athenians moved <lb/>
            over against the Lacedæmonians, and they themselves occupied <lb/>
            the right wing, and were posted in front of the Achæans, <lb/>
            they immediately said that the sacrifices were favourable, and <lb/>
            ordered their men to prepare for battle; and neglecting, in <lb/>
            the first place, the custom of forming sixteen deep,2 they drew <lb/>
            up their main body of a very great depth, and still bore away <lb/>
            towards the right, that they might stretch beyond the enemy <lb/>
            with their wing; while the Athenians, that they might not <note type="footnote"> 1 As long as they stood in the left wing opposed to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>

            there was a risk that they would be surrounded.</p>
          <p>19. For a time, however, the Lacedæmonians had no suspi­ <lb/>
            cion of the enemy's approach ; for the ground was covered <lb/>
            with shrubs; but when they raised the paean, they understood <lb/>
            how things were, and immediately gave orders, on their side, <lb/>
            for all to prepare to engage. When.they were drawn up in the <lb/>
            order which the captains of the auxiliaries had settled for <lb/>
            their several bodies, they exhorted the men to follow their <lb/>
            leaders, and the Lacedæmonians bore off towards the right,1 <lb/>
            and so far outstretched the enemy's wing, that of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian tribes,2 six were opposite the Lacedæmonians, and four <lb/>
            opposite the Tegeans. 20. They were now not a furlong asun­ <lb/>
            der, when the Lacedæmonians, having sacrificed, as is their <lb/>
            custom, a she-goat to the goddess of the chaser led forward <lb/>
            against the enemy, bending round that part of their line <lb/>
            which stretched beyond the enemy's wing, to enclose them. <lb/>
            When they joined battle, all the other allies of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were defeated by their antagonists, and the Pelle­ <lb/>
            nians only, who were opposed to the Thespians, maintained <lb/>
            the contest, several on both sides falling on the spot. 21. As <lb/>
            for the Lacedæmonians themselves, they defeated all the <lb/>
            Athenians that they attacked, and surrounding them with that <lb/>
            portion of their line that extended beyond them, slew them in <lb/>
            great numbers, and, as they suffered no damage from the <lb/>
            enemy, continued to push forward in firm array. Thus they <lb/>
            passed the four tribes of the Athenians before they returned <lb/>
            from the pursuit, so that none of these Athenians were killed, <lb/>
            except the few that may have been slain by the Tegeans in <lb/>
            the encounter with them. 22. The Lacedæmonians also met <lb/>
            the Argives as they were retreating, but, when the chief com­ <lb/>
            mander was preparing to charge them in front, some one is <lb/>
            said to have called out " to let the first pass," and as this was <lb/>
            done, they assailed them, as they hurried past, on their unde­ <lb/>

            the walls, but, as the Corinthians shut them out, they took <lb/>
            up their quarters again in their former camp. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, on the other side, returned to the place where they <lb/>
            had first engaged the enemy, and erected a trophy. Such was <lb/>

          <p>News of this battle is brought to Agesilaus on his march. He is harassed <lb/>
            in Thessaly by the allies of the Bœotians, but at length repels the Thes­ <lb/>
            salian cavalry with his own. He receives intelligence of an unfortunate <lb/>
            battle by sea, but conceals his knowledge of it from his troops, who are <lb/>
            soon afterwards victorious in a skirmish. The battle of Coroneia, and the <lb/>
            merits of Agesilaus in it. He dedicates a tenth of the spoil to Apollo.</p>
          <p>i. AGESILAUS was still hastening from Asia to the aid of <lb/>
            his country; but when he was at Amphipolis, Dercylidas 1 <lb/>
            met him with the news that " the Lacedæmonians had gained <lb/>
            a victory, and that only eight2 of their number had been <lb/>
            killed, but a great many of the enemy ;" he informed him <lb/>
            also that "no small number of the confederates had fallen." 2. <lb/>
            As Agesilaus then asked him, " Would it not be well, Dercy­ <lb/>
            lidas, if the cities who have sent their troops along with me, <lb/>
            should be informed of this victory as soon as possible ?" <lb/>
            Dercylidas replied, " It is probable at least that, on hearing <lb/>
            of it, they would feel greater confidence." " Would not you <lb/>
            yourself, then," said Agesilaus, " give them the best account <lb/>
            of it, as you were present on the occasion ? " Dercylidas was <lb/>
            pleased to hear him ask that question, for he had always been <lb/>
            fond of going abroad, and replied, " If you command me." <lb/>
            " I do command you, then," said Agesilaus, "and desire you <lb/>
            besides to tell them that if affairs succeed well here, we shall <lb/>
            return to them again as we promised." 3. Dercylidas, accord- <note type="footnote">1 He had been sent by Agesilaus to Tissaphernes, b. iii. c. 4, and <lb/>

            ingly, proceeded at once1 towards the Hellespont; and Age­ <lb/>
            silaus, passing through Macedonia, arrived in Thessaly. Here <lb/>
            the Larissæans, Crannonians, Scotussæans, and Pharsalians, <lb/>
            who were in alliance with the Bœotians, and all the Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians indeed, except such as were then in exile, pursued and <lb/>
            harassed his rear. 4. For a time he led his army in an ob­ <lb/>
            long body, with half his cavalry in the van, and the other <lb/>
            half in the rear; but when the Thessalians, by continually <lb/>
            assailing the hindmost, retarded his march, he sent off all the <lb/>
            cavalry from the front, except those about his own person, to <lb/>
            strengthen the rear. 5. But when they stood face to face with <lb/>
            each other, the Thessalians, thinking it unadvisable to fight <lb/>
            with cavalry only against heavy-armed infantry, wheeled <lb/>
            about, and retreated at a slow pace, and those of Agesilaus <lb/>
            leisurely followed them. 6. Agesilaus, observing that both <lb/>
            were acting injudiciously, despatched the horsemen that he <lb/>
            had about him, a very efficient body of men, with orders to <lb/>
            the others to pursue with their utmost speed, and to join in <lb/>
            the pursuit themselves, and not to allow the enemy again an <lb/>
            opportunity of facing about. 7. When the Thessalians saw <lb/>
            them thus unexpectedly advancing, some of them did not <lb/>
            even turn round, and others, endeavouring to do so, but hav­ <lb/>
            ing the enemy on their flanks, were made prisoners. 8. Poly­ <lb/>
            charmus, however, the commander of the Pharsalian horse, <lb/>
            faced round upon his pursuers, and was killed with those about <lb/>
            him. As soon as this had happened, a disastrous flight en­ <lb/>
            sued among the. Thessalians, so that some of them were killed, <lb/>
            and others taken prisoners; and they did not stop till they <lb/>
            reached the mountain Narthacium. 9. Agesilaus then erected <lb/>
            a trophy between Pras and Narthacium, and halted there, <lb/>
            greatly delighted with his exploit, in having defeated, with <lb/>
            cavalry which he himself had formed, a people who prided <lb/>
            themselves on their equestrian skill. Next day, having crossed <lb/>
            the Achaean mountains2 at Phthia, he proceeded, during the <lb/>
            rest of his march, through the country of friends, until he <lb/>
            reached the frontiers of Boeotia. <note type="footnote"> I "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηδη</foreign>.] Some manuscripts have <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον</foreign>. "I hesitate," says <lb/>

            admiral, Peisander, killed. 11. It was also stated in what <lb/>
            manner the battle had been fought; that the meeting of the <lb/>
            fleets took place near Cnidus; that Pharnabazus, as admiral, <lb/>
            was there with the Phoenician fleet;2 and that Conon, with <lb/>
            the Grecian fleet, drew up in front of him; 12. that when <lb/>
            Peisander formed his line to attack the enemy, and his ships <lb/>
            appeared far inferior in number3 to the Greek vessels with <lb/>
            Conon, the allies on his left wing immediately fled, but that <lb/>
            he himself, rushing in among the enemy with his galley, <lb/>
            which was armed with sharp points at the prow, was driven <lb/>
            on shore; and that others, who were also driven on shore, <lb/>
            abandoned their vessels, and escaped, as well as they could, <lb/>
            to Cnidus, while Peisander himself, continuing the contest in <lb/>
            his own ship, met his death. 13. On bearing this news, Age­ <lb/>
            silaus was at first extremely concerned; but as he reflected <lb/>
            that the greater part of his troops were such as would will­ <lb/>
            ingly feel interested in favourable occurrences, and that, if he <lb/>
            became aware of anything adverse, it was not necessary to <lb/>
            communicate it to them, he in consequence made some change <lb/>
            in the account, and gave out that " Peisander was said to have <lb/>
            lost his life, but had gained a victory by sea." 14. As he <lb/>

          <p>is. Those who were now in the field against Agesilaus were <lb/>
            the Bœotians, Athenians, Argives, Corinthians, Ænianes, Eu­ <lb/>
            bœans, and both the Locrians. On the side of Agesilaus was <lb/>
            one battalion of Spartans, which had crossed over to him from <lb/>
            Corinth, and the half of a battalion from Orchomenus ; there <lb/>
            were also the newly-enfranchised citizens from Sparta, that <lb/>
            had already served with him ; and, besides these, the mercen­ <lb/>
            ary force which Herippidas commanded ; there were the troops <lb/>
            from the Greek cities in Asia, and those which he had taken <lb/>
            from such of the cities in Europe as he had passed through ; <lb/>
            and there had joined him, from the immediate neighbourhood, <lb/>
            some heavy-armed soldiers of the Orchomenians and Phocians. <lb/>
            Of peltasts, the greater number was on the side of Agesilaus; <lb/>
            the cavalry was nearly equal on both sides. 16. Such was the <lb/>
            strength of the two parties; and I will now give a full ac­ <lb/>
            count of the battle; for it was of such a character that no <lb/>
            other of those in our time was similar to it.</p>
          <p>The forces of Agesilaus, advancing from the Cephisus, and <lb/>
            those of the Thebans from Mount Helicon, met in the plain <lb/>
            near Coroneia. Agesilaus led the right wing of his own <lb/>
            army, and the Orchomenians were posted at the extremity of <lb/>
            his left; on the other side the Thebans themselves were on <lb/>
            their right wing, and the Argives on their left. 17. As they <lb/>
            approached one another, there was for some time deep silence <lb/>
            on both sides; but when they were about a stadium apart, <lb/>
            the Thebans raised a shout, and advanced to the charge at a <lb/>
            running pace; and, when there was but half a stadium be­ <lb/>
            tween them, the mercenary force that Herippidas led, and <lb/>
            with them the Ionians, Æolians, and Hellespontines, ran for­ <lb/>
            ward from the main body of Agesilaus to engage them ; all <lb/>
            these rushed in a mass to the charge, and, attacking them at <lb/>
            the point of the spear, put to flight all that were opposed to <lb/>

            however, on their side, when they saw that their allies bad <lb/>
            fled towards Helicon, were desirous to make a way through <lb/>
            the enemy to join them, and, collecting themselves into a body, <lb/>
            marched forward with great spirit. 19. On this occasion we <lb/>
            may say, without dispute, that Agesilaus proved himself a <lb/>
            brave man; but he did not choose the safest mode of pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding : for, when he might have let the Thebans, who were <lb/>
            seeking to escape, pass by him, and then have pursued and <lb/>
            harassed their rear, he did not adopt that course, but closed <lb/>
            with them full in front, and both parties, clashing their shields <lb/>
            together, alternately gave way and resisted, slew and were <lb/>
            slain. At length part of the Thebans made their escape to <lb/>
            Mount Helicon, but a great number of them were cut off in <lb/>
            attempting to retreat. 20. When the victory was fairly won <lb/>
            by Agesilaus, but he himself was brought in wounded to the <lb/>
            main body, some of his cavalry rode up, and told him that a <lb/>
            party of the enemy, about eighty in number, were in arms <lb/>
            under shelter of the templet and asked him how they should <lb/>
            act towards them. Agesilaus, though suffering from several <lb/>
            wounds, was not unmindful of the obligations of religion, but <lb/>
            gave orders to let them depart whither they pleased, and to do <lb/>
            them no injury. The troops then took their supper, for it <lb/>
            was now late, and went to rest.</p>
          <p>21. In the morning he directed Gylis, one of the chief <lb/>
            officers, to draw up the army, and erect a trophy; giving or­ <lb/>
            ders, at the same time, that all the men should crown them­ <lb/>
            selves in honour of the god,2 and that all the flute-players <lb/>
            should play on their instruments. The Thebans then sent <lb/>
            heralds, requesting leave, under favour of a truce, to bury <lb/>
            their dead; a truce was accordingly made, and Agesilaus, <lb/>
            going to Delphi, offered the tenth of the spoil to the god, to <lb/>
            the amount of not less than a hundred talents.</p>
          <p>22. Gylis, meanwhile, taking the command of the army, <lb/>
            marched into Phocis, and thence made an incursion into Lo­ <lb/>
            cris, where, during the early part of the next day, the soldiers <lb/>
            employed themselves in carrying off moveables and provisions <lb/>
            from the villages, but, when it was near evening, as they were <note type="footnote">1 The temple of Minerva It( nia. Plutarch, Agesil. c. 19 ; Poly­ <lb/>

            drawing off with the Lacedæmonians in the rear, the Locrians <lb/>
            pursued them, hurling stones and javelins at them, but as the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, facing about, attacked and killed some of <lb/>
            them, they ceased at once from following them behind, and <lb/>
            hurled down stones upon them from the higher grounds. 23. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians tried to charge them up the steep, but as <lb/>
            darkness came on, and they had to retreat, some of them lost <lb/>
            their lives through the ruggedness of the ground, others from <lb/>
            inability to see what was before them, and others by the <lb/>
            weapons of the enemy. Here Gylis the general was killed, <lb/>
            and several1 of his body-guard, with about eighteen in all of <lb/>
            the other soldiers, some struck down with stones, and others <lb/>
            pierced with darts; and had not the rest of the army, who <lb/>
            were at supper, come to their relief, the whole party would <lb/>
            have been in danger of perishing.</p>

          <p>At Corinth the party favourable to peace are massacred by their adversaries, <lb/>
            who conspire against them. The whole state appearing likely to fall un­ <lb/>
            der the power of Argos, Pasimelus and Alcimenes, two Corinthians, form <lb/>
            a communication with the Lacedæmonians at Sicyon, whom they admit <lb/>
            within the walls, and who are victorious In a battle that ensues, after <lb/>
            which they pull down a portion of the walls, and capture Sidus, Crom­ <lb/>
            myon, and Epieicia. The war is then carried on with hired soldiers on <lb/>
            both sides. Iphicrates attacks Phlius, the people of which send for the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and deliver up their city to them. The Athenians rebuild <lb/>
            that part of the walls of Corinth which the Lacedæmonians had pulled <lb/>
            down, but it is again demolished by Agesilaus.</p>
          <p>i. THE rest of the army was now dismissed to their several <lb/>
            cities; and Agesilaus went home by sea. Afterwards the <lb/>
            Athenians, Bœotians, Argives, and their allies, prosecuted <lb/>
            the war by making excursions from Corinth, and the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians and their allies by expeditions from Sicyon. But <lb/>
            as the Corinthians saw that their lands were laid waste, and <lb/>
            their people cut off, because they were in the immediate neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of the enemy, while their confederates were at peace, <lb/>
            and their lands in a state of cultivation, the greater number of <note type="footnote"> 1 I read <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλοὶ</foreign> with Schneider, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πελλη̃ς</foreign>, which Weiske <lb/>

            them, and the better class, grew desirous of peace, and com­ <lb/>
            bined to bring others to the same opinion. 2. The Argives, <lb/>
            Athenians, and Bœotians, however, and such of the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians as had shared the king's money, and had been the chief <lb/>
            promoters of the war, seeing that unless they could rid them­ <lb/>
            selves of those who were inclined to peace, the city of Corinth <lb/>
            would be likely to return to the side of the Spartans, resolved, <lb/>
            in consequence, to proceed to a massacre of the people; and, <lb/>
            in the first place, they contrived the most impious of all pos­ <lb/>
            sible schemes; for other people, even if a man be doomed to <lb/>
            die by law, do not put him to death at the time of a festival; <lb/>
            but these men fixed upon the last day of the Eucleia,l because <lb/>
            they thought that they should then find the largest number in <lb/>
            the forum to massacre. 3. When it was signified to those to <lb/>
            whom the commission was given, what persons they were to <lb/>
            kill, they drew their swords, and stabbed one man standing <lb/>
            in a circle of his friends,2 another seated, another in the the­ <lb/>
            atre, and one or two sitting as judges of the games.3 As <lb/>
            soon as the matter was understood, the principal citizens im­ <lb/>
            mediately fled for refuge, some to the statues of the gods in <lb/>
            the forum, some to the altars, where those most impious men, <lb/>
            utterly regardless of everything sacred, (as well those who <lb/>
            directed as those who executed,) slaughtered them even at the <lb/>
            very shrines of the deities; so that some of those who were <lb/>
            unharmed, and retained a due respect for religion, were ap­ <lb/>
            palled at the sight of such impiety. 4. Thus perished many <lb/>
            of the elder citizens, for they happened to be in greater num­ <lb/>
            bers in the forum; the younger men, as Pasimelus4 suspected <note type="footnote"> 1 Hesychius has <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐκλος, Διὸς ἳερὸν έν Μεγάροις καὶ κορίνθω̜</foreign>, where <lb/>

            what was going to happen, kept themselves quiet in the Cra­ <lb/>
            neium.1 But when they heard the noise, and some came fly­ <lb/>
            ing from the scene to take refuge with them, they then ran <lb/>
            up by the citadel of Corinth, and repulsed the Argives and <lb/>
            others who were making an assault upon it; 5. but while <lb/>
            they were deliberating what they should do next, the capital <lb/>
            fell from one of the pillars, without the intervention of any <lb/>
            earthquake or blast of wind. When they sacrificed with re­ <lb/>
            ference to that occurrence, the omens from the victims were <lb/>
            of such a nature that the augurs said it would be better for <lb/>
            them to go down from their position. At first, therefore, they <lb/>
            withdrew from it with the intention of fleeing out of the ter­ <lb/>
            ritory of Corinth; but as their friends, mothers, and brothers <lb/>
            came and entreated them, and some of those who were in <lb/>
            authority promised, with an oath, that they should suffer no <lb/>
            harm, several of them in consequence returned to their homes. <lb/>
            6. When they saw, however, the tyrants that were over them, <lb/>
            and perceived that their city would be put out of knowledge, <lb/>
            as their land-marks would be taken away, and their country <lb/>
            called Argos instead of Corinth; and as they would be ne­ <lb/>
            cessitated, too, to share citizenship with the people of Argos, <lb/>
            for which they had no liking, and would have less influence <lb/>
            in their own city than mere sojourners, some of them thought <lb/>
            such a life intolerable, but that, should they try to establish <lb/>
            their country Corinth as it was at first, and to exhibit it free <lb/>
            and purified from shedders of blood, and in the enjoyment of <lb/>
            its excellent laws, it would be worthy of them, if they could <lb/>
            accomplish these objects, to become saviours of their country, <lb/>
            and, if they could not, to die a glorious death in aiming at <lb/>
            the most honourable and noble ends. 7. Accordingly, two of <lb/>
            their number, Pasimelus and Alcimenes, undertook, by making <lb/>
            their way along the bed of a torrent, to communicate with <lb/>
            Praxitas, the Lacedæmonian general, who was in garrison <lb/>
            with his battalion at Sicyon, and told him that they could <lb/>
            secure him an entrance within the walls that reach down to­ <lb/>
            wards Lechæum. Praxitas, who was previously assured that <lb/>
            the men were trustworthy, put confidence in them, and having <lb/>
            settled that his battalion, which was going to leave Sicyon, <note type="footnote">1 This was a grove of cypress trees before the city, with a gymna­ <lb/>

            should remain there, arranged with them the mode of en­ <lb/>
            trance. 8. When the two men, therefore, whether by chance <lb/>
            or by contrivance, came on guard at the gates where the <lb/>
            trophy was erected, Praxitas then advanced with his batta­ <lb/>
            lion, the Sicyonians, and as many of the Corinthians as were <lb/>
            then exiles. After he had come up to the gates, but was ap­ <lb/>
            prehensive of entering, he expressed a desire to send in a <lb/>
            person, one of those in whom he had confidence, to ascertain <lb/>
            the state of things within. The two men accordingly con­ <lb/>
            ducted him in, and showed him everything so ingenuously, <lb/>
            that lie reported that " all was safe as they had stated." 9. <lb/>
            Praxitas in consequence went in himself; and as his men, <lb/>
            from the walls being a considerable distance apart, appeared <lb/>
            to themselves, when drawn up, to be but few, they formed a <lb/>
            palisading and a trench, such as they could, in front of them, <lb/>
            to defend themselves until their confederates could come to <lb/>
            their support. Behind them, at the harbour, was a garrison <lb/>
            of Bœotians.</p>
          <p>The day following the night in which they entered, they <lb/>
            passed without fighting; but the next day the Argives, ad­ <lb/>
            vancing upon them with all their force, and finding the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians drawn up on their right, the Sicyonians next to them, <lb/>
            and the Corinthian fugitives, to the number of about a hundred <lb/>
            and fifty, close to the eastern wall, their mercenaries, under <lb/>
            Iphicrates, drew themselves up also close to the same wall, <lb/>
            and the Argives nearest to them, while the Corinthians from <lb/>
            the city took post in their left wing. 10. As they despised the <lb/>
            enemy, from being superior in number, they instantly charged <lb/>
            them, defeated the Sicyonians, and breaking through the <lb/>
            palisading, pursued them to the sea, where they killed a <lb/>
            great number of them. Pasimachus the equestrian prefect, <lb/>
            however, who had but a small body of cavalry, gave orders, <lb/>
            when he saw the Sicyonians repulsed, for the horses to be <lb/>
            tied to the trees, and, snatching their shields from the fugi­ <lb/>
            tives, advanced, with such as were willing to follow him, to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̜̃ δεξιῳ̃ ἑαυτω̃ν</foreign>.] Weiske thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑαυτω̃ν</foreign>may mean the <lb/>

            only to the Argives. " The faint notion which we have of the <lb/>
            situation of the places," he adds, "prevents us from clearly under­ <lb/>
            standing the position of the several forces ; and a figure, with which <lb/>
            Weiske endeavours to assist us, leaves the difficulties still un­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            encounter the Argives; who, when they saw the S upon their <lb/>
            shields, were under no apprehensions from them, believing <lb/>
            them to be Sicyonians. Pasimachus is said to have exclaim­ <lb/>
            ed, " By the twin gods, ye Argives, this S will deceive you," <lb/>
            and to have closed with them; and thus, fighting with a <lb/>
            handful of men against numbers, he was killed, and some of <lb/>
            those about him. 11. The fugitive Corinthians, meanwhile, <lb/>
            having defeated the party opposed to them, made their way <lb/>
            upwards, and were now near the wall1that encircled the city ; <lb/>
            and the Lacedæmonians, on the other wing, when they saw the <lb/>
            Sicyonians defeated, came out2 to their succour, keeping the <lb/>
            palisading on their left. The Argives, when they heard that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians were behind them, turned back in great <lb/>
            haste, and threw themselves over the palisading;3 and those <lb/>
            of them who were farthest to the right, being assailed on <lb/>
            their defenceless parts by the Lacedæmonians, were cut off; <lb/>
            but those nearest to the wall, collecting in a body, retreated <lb/>
            with great difficulty towards the city, but as they encounter­ <lb/>
            ed the Corinthian fugitives, and discovered that they were <lb/>
            enemies, they again fell back. Here some of them, going up <lb/>
            the scaling ladders,4 leaped from the wall and perished; others, <lb/>
            being assailed and wounded on the ladders, lost their lives in <lb/>
            that way; and some were trampled down and suffocated by <lb/>
            one another. 12. The Lacedæmonians were at no loss for <lb/>
            men to kill; for the gods gave them such occupation as they <lb/>
            would not have even sought by prayer; for how can it be <lb/>
            thought otherwise than an appointment of the gods, that a <lb/>
            multitude of enemies thus terror-stricken, astounded, exposing <lb/>
            their unarmed sides, no one turning to resist, but all contri­ <lb/>
            buting in every way to their own destruction, should have <lb/>
            been delivered into their hands ? Assuredly such numbers <lb/>
            fell in a short time, that people who had only been used to see <lb/>
            heaps of corn, or wood, or stones, saw on that occasion heaps <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Του̃ περὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄστυ κύκλου</foreign>.] Fossam vallumque ab obsidentibus ducta <lb/>

            dead under favour of a truce; and the allies of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians came to their succour. When they were assembled, <lb/>
            Praxitas first resolved to make a breach in the wall as wide <lb/>
            as would afford a sufficient passage for an army; then, draw­ <lb/>
            ing off his troops, he led them towards Megara, and took by <lb/>
            assault first Sidus, and afterwards Crommyon.1 After placing <lb/>
            garrisons in these fortresses, he returned, and, • fortifying <lb/>

            wards Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>14. After this occurrence, large armies on both sides were <lb/>
            discontinued for a time; but the different cities sending gar­ <lb/>
            risons, some to Corinth, and others to Sicyon, kept those for­ <lb/>
            tresses secure. Both parties however had mercenaries, and <lb/>
            kept up hostilities vigorously by their means.</p>
          <p>is. It was at this time that Iphicrates invaded the terri­ <lb/>
            tory of Phlius, and located his light troops there; when, as <lb/>
            he carried off booty with small parties, and people from the <lb/>
            city came out to repulse him too incautiously, he killed such <lb/>
            numbers, that the Phliasians, who had previously refused to <lb/>
            admit the Lacedæmonians within their walls, lest they should <lb/>
            restore those who alleged that they had been exiled for Lacon­ <lb/>
            ism, were now so much in dread of the people from Corinth, <lb/>
            that they sent for the Lacedæmonians, and put their city and <lb/>
            citadel under their protection. The Lacedæmonians, however, <lb/>
            though kindly disposed towards the exiles, made, as long as <lb/>
            they held the city, no mention of their return, but, as soon as <lb/>
            the city appeared to have recovered its spirit, quitted it, re­ <lb/>
            storing to the citizens their town and their institutions just as <lb/>
            they had received them. <note type="footnote"> 1 Sidus was a village, and Crommyon a town, in the territory of <lb/>

            parts of Arcadia, carried off booty, and attacked the fortified <lb/>
            places ; for the Arcadian heavy-armed troops never ventured <lb/>
            out against them ; so much afraid were they of his peltasts ; <lb/>
            though those very peltasts were so much in dread of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians that they would not come within a javelin's <lb/>
            throw of their heavy-armed men ; since some of the younger <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had sometimes ventured to pursue them even <lb/>
            from that distance, and had overtaken and killed some of them. <lb/>
            17. But, however the Lacedæmonians despised these peltasts, <lb/>
            they despised their own allies still more; for when the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans came to their aid on one occasion, and sallied out <lb/>
            upon the peltasts from the wall extending towards Lechæeum, <lb/>
            they gave way as soon as they were assailed with darts, and <lb/>
            some of them were killed as they fled; so that the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ventured to jest upon them, saying that their allies <lb/>
            dreaded the peltasts as much as children dreaded bugbears."</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians themselves, with a battalion of their <lb/>
            own, and the Corinthian fugitives, encamped1 round the <lb/>
            city of Corinth; is. while the Athenians, on their part, <lb/>
            dreading the force of the Lacedæmonians, lest, as the long <lb/>
            walls of the Corinthians were broken through, they should <lb/>
            make an assault upon them, thought it best to rebuild that por­ <lb/>
            tion of the wall which had been demolished by Praxitas; and, <lb/>
            coming to the spot in full force,2 with masons and carpenters, <lb/>
            they in a few days rebuilt, in excellent style, the part towards <lb/>
            Sicyon and the west; the part towards the east they repaired <lb/>
            more at their leisure.</p>
          <p>19. But the Lacedæmonians now reflecting that the Argives <lb/>
            were enjoying themselves at home, and exulting at the war, <lb/>
            proceeded to invade their territories. Agesilaus commanded <lb/>
            in the expedition, and, after devastating all their country, im­ <lb/>

          <p>The Corinthians make a stand at their harbour of the Peiraeum; they are <lb/>
            assailed by Agesilaus, who gets possession of the place by a stratagem. <lb/>
            He obliges another party at Heraeum to surrender. His joy at these suc­ <lb/>
            cesses is damped by the news that a battalion of the Amyclæans had been <lb/>
            cut off by Iphicrates. Agesilaus returns home, leaving a battalion to <lb/>
            garrison Lechæum.</p>
          <p>i. SOON after, the Lacedæmonians, having learned from the <lb/>
            fugitives that the Corinthians in the city were keeping and <lb/>
            securing all their cattle in the Peiræum,1 and that numbers of <lb/>
            people were maintained there, made another expedition against <lb/>
            Corinth, Agesilaus being leader also on this occasion. In the <lb/>
            first place he proceeded to the Isthmus; for it was the month 2 <lb/>
            in which the Isthmian games are celebrated, and the Argives <note type="footnote">lying between Corinth and Mycenæ." There is an allusion to it <lb/>
            in an epigram mentioned by Strabo, vol. i. p. 552, ed. Falconer. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Thucydides, viii. 10, says that the Corinthian harbour called <lb/>

            places it, with Heræum and CEnoe, as well as Lechaeum, on the <lb/>
            Crissæan Gulf. Palmerius, therefore, Exercit. p. 72, in speaking of <lb/>
            this passage of Xenophon, thinks that there were two harbours of <lb/>
            the name, one on each gulf. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The month is not specified by any of the ancient writers; but <lb/>
            Corsini, in his Dissertatio 4ta Agonistica, has shown that the Isth­ <lb/>
            mian games fell sometimes on the month Panemus, sometimes on <lb/>
            that of Thargelion or Munychion. The games were celebrated <lb/>
            every third year, and would fall on the first and third year of each <lb/>

            were there at the time offering the sacrifice to Neptune, as if <lb/>
            Argos and Corinth were one; but when they saw Agesilaus <lb/>
            approaching, they abandoned their sacrifices and festive pre­ <lb/>
            parations, and, in very great alarm, retreated by the road to <lb/>
            Cenchreiæ into the city. 2. Agesilaus, however, though he <lb/>
            saw the way they took, did not pursue them, but, fixing his <lb/>
            quarters in the temple, made offerings himself to the god, <lb/>
            and remained there until the fugitives from Corinth had <lb/>
            sacrificed to Neptune and brought the games to a conclusion. <lb/>
            But the Argives, notwithstanding, when Agesilaus was gone, <lb/>
            celebrated the Isthmian games over again; and thus in this <lb/>
            year, in some of the contests, the same person was twice un­ <lb/>
            successful, while in others the same persons were twice pro­ <lb/>
            claimed victors.</p>
          <p>3. It was on the fourth day that Agesilaus led his army to <lb/>
            the Peiræum, but seeing that it was guarded by a number of <lb/>
            people, he marched off, after dinner, towards the city, as if he <lb/>
            thought that it would be betrayed into his hands, so that <lb/>
            the Corinthians, fearing that it had been actually betrayed <lb/>
            by some of their people, sent for Iphicrates with the principal <lb/>
            part of his peltasts ; and Agesilaus, getting notice that they <lb/>
            had arrived in the night, wheeled round as soon as it was day, <lb/>
            and led his army back towards the Peiræum. He advanced <lb/>
            himself by the hot springs, but sent up a battalion to the top of <lb/>
            the heights; and he remained, during the night, encamped by <lb/>
            the hot springs, while the battalion spent the night in occu­ <lb/>
            pation of the heights. 4. Here Agesilaus gained reputation <lb/>
            by a little, but seasonable, contrivance ; for though many peo­ <lb/>
            ple carried provisions to the battalion, no one brought them <lb/>
            fire; and, as it was very cold, because they were upon ex­ <lb/>
            tremely high ground, and rain and hail had fallen in the even­ <lb/>
            ing, (while they had gone up with only such light garments <lb/>
            as they wear in summer,) they were now shivering in darkness, <lb/>
            and without the least appetite for their supper, when Agesilaus <lb/>
            sent up to them not less then ten men with fire in pots; and <lb/>
            when they had reached the summits, some by one path and <lb/>
            some by another, several large fires were kindled, as there <lb/>
            was plenty of fuel at hand, and they all anointed themselves, <lb/>
            and many took supper a second time. The same night the <lb/>
            temple of Neptune was seen in flames; but by whom it was <lb/>
            set on fire nobody knew.</p><pb n="406"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> 5. When the people in the Peiræum saw that the heights <lb/>
            were occupied by the enemy, they no longer thought of de­ <lb/>
            fending themselves, but fled, male and female, slaves and free­ <lb/>
            men, with the greatest part of the cattle, to Heræum,1 whither <lb/>
            Agesilaus proceeded with his army along the coast. The <lb/>
            battalion, at the same time, coming down from the heights, <lb/>
            took CEnoe, a walled fortress, and made prize of what was in <lb/>
            it; and all the troops, indeed, on that day, secured abundance <lb/>
            of provisions from the neighbouring parts. Those who had <lb/>
            taken refuge in CEnoe came forth, leaving to Agesilaus to de­ <lb/>
            termine whatever he pleased concerning them. His decision <lb/>
            was, that " they should give up all who had been concerned <lb/>
            in the massacre to the fugitives, and that all the plunder should <lb/>
            be sold." Much booty of all kinds was then brought out of <lb/>
            Heræum. 6. Just at this time several deputations from vari­ <lb/>
            ous quarters waited upon him, and some ambassadors from the <lb/>
            Bœotians came to ask him what they should do to obtain <lb/>
            peace." But Agesilaus, assuming a very lofty air, appeared <lb/>
            not even to see them, (though Pharax, the proxenus2 of the <lb/>
            Bœotians, stood by their side to introduce them;) and, taking <lb/>
            his seat at the round-house near the harbour, he surveyed the <lb/>
            great quantity of spoil as it was brought out. Some of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian troops, belonging to the heavy-armed, attend­ <lb/>
            ed the prisoners, as guards, with their spears, and were much <lb/>
            gazed at by all who were present; for the fortunate and vic­ <lb/>
            torious seem always to be thought worthy of admiration.</p>
          <p>7. While Agesilaus, however, was still sitting there, ap­ <lb/>
            pearing to be delighted with what was going on, a horseman <lb/>
            rode up with his horse in a violent sweat, and, being asked by <lb/>
            many of the people " what news he brought," he made no one <lb/>
            any answer; but, when he drew near Agesilaus, he sprung <lb/>
            from his horse, and, running up to him with a very sad coun­ <lb/>
            tenance, gave him an account of the calamity of the battalion <note type="footnote"> I I have called it Heræum, not the Heræum. It was a promontory, <lb/>

            at Lechæum.1Agesilaus, on hearing it, immediately jumped <lb/>
            from his seat, snatched up his spear, and ordered the herald <lb/>
            to summon the generals, captains, and commanders of the <lb/>
            auxiliaries. 8. When they had all hastily gathered round <lb/>
            him, he told them to take what refreshment they could, (for <lb/>
            they had not yet dined,) and to follow him as soon as possible, <lb/>
            while he himself, with the attendants at the royal tent, started <lb/>
            off before them without taking anything. His guards, with <lb/>
            their heavy arms, followed him with all speed, he leading the <lb/>
            way, and they keeping in his track. But when he had <lb/>
            passed the hot springs, and had reached the open plain of <lb/>
            Lechæum, three horsemen rode up and told him that " the <lb/>
            dead bodies were recovered." As soon as he heard this, he <lb/>
            ordered his followers to pile their arms, and, after resting a <lb/>
            while, led them back again to Heræum. Next day the booty <lb/>
            was sold.</p>
          <p>9. The ambassadors from the Bceotians being now sum <lb/>
            moned, and asked for what purpose they had come, made no <lb/>
            further mention of peace, but said that, " if there was nothing <lb/>
            to prevent them, they wished to go into the city to their <lb/>
            countrymen who were soldiers there." Agesilaus smiled, and <lb/>
            said, " It is not the soldiers, I know, that you wish to see, <lb/>
            but the success of your friends, and to ascertain what has <lb/>
            been the extent of it; stay, therefore," he added, " and I will <lb/>
            conduct you thither myself, and, being with me, you will <lb/>
            learn better what it is that has taken place." 10. Nor did he <lb/>
            deceive them; for the next day, after a sacrifice, he led his <lb/>
            army towards the city. The trophy2 he did not demolish; <lb/>
            but whatever trees were left he cut down and burned, and <lb/>
            showed the ambassadors that no one would venture out to <lb/>
            attack him. Having done this, he encamped about Lechæum, <lb/>
            and sent off the Theban ambassadors, not to the city, but by <lb/>
            the sea to Creusis.3 As such a calamity, however, was an un­ <lb/>
            usual occurrence to the Lacedæmonians, there was great <lb/>
            mourning throughout the army, except among those whose <lb/>
            sons, or fathers, or brothers, had died at their posts; for these <note type="footnote"> 1 This is related afterwards, sect. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The enemy had, then, erected a trophy near Corinth. Weiske, <lb/>

          <p>11. The disaster that befell the battalion occurred in the <lb/>
            following manner. The Lacedæmonians of Amyclæ, whether <lb/>
            they happen to be in the field, or abroad on any other busi­ <lb/>
            ness whatever, always go home to the Hyacinthia1 to join in <lb/>
            the paean. On this occasion Agesilaus had left the Amy­ <lb/>
            clæans, of all his army, at Lechoeum; and the officer com­ <lb/>
            manding the garrison there ordered the troops of the auxili­ <lb/>
            aries to guard the fortress, while he himself, with the battalion <lb/>
            of heavy-armed foot, and the cavalry, escorted the Amyclæans <lb/>
            past the city of Corinth. 12. When they were about twenty <lb/>
            stadia distant from Sicyon, the officer, with his heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, in number about six hundred, went back to Lechæum, <lb/>
            and ordered the commander of the cavalry, when he had at­ <lb/>
            tended the Amyclæans as far as they thought necessary, to <lb/>
            follow him. That there were many peltasts and heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops in Corinth they were not unaware, but they held them <lb/>
            in contempt, imagining that none would venture to attack <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians on account of their late successes. 13. The sol­ <lb/>
            diers of the Corinthians, however, and Callias, the son of <lb/>
            Hipponicus, the commander of the Athenian heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, and Iphicrates, the captain of the peltasts, observing <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians were but few, and without either <lb/>
            peltasts or cavalry, thought that they might safely attack them <lb/>
            with their own body of peltasts; for, if they continued their <lb/>
            march, they might suffer by being galled with missiles on <lb/>
            their unarmed flanks; or, if they attempted to turn back and <lb/>
            pursue, they themselves, with their nimble peltasts, would <lb/>
            easily escape from heavy-armed men. 14. Having formed <lb/>
            this opinion, they led out their force ; and Callias posted his <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops not far from the city, while Iphicrates, <lb/>
            with his peltasts, attacked the battalion of Lacedæmonians; <lb/>
            who, when they were assailed with missiles, and some were <note type="footnote"> 1 On this custom of the Amycleeans, see Valck. ad Herod. ix. 6. <lb/>

            wounded, and two or three fell, ordered the shield-bearers1 to <lb/>
            take them up and carry them off to Lechaeum ; and these were <lb/>
            in truth the only men of the battalion that escaped. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian officer then ordered the younger men2 to pur­ <lb/>
            sue the enemy; 15. but when they pursued, being heavy- <lb/>
            armed men in chase of peltasts, they came within javelin's <lb/>
            throw of none of them; and their officer had desired them to <lb/>
            retreat before the heavy-armed men of the enemy could join <lb/>
            their peltasts. As they retired straggling, having pursued <lb/>
            each according to his speed, the peltasts of Iphicrates faced <lb/>
            about, and those who were in front again hurled javelins at <lb/>
            them, while others, running up to them on the flank, galled <lb/>
            them on the unarmed parts of their bodies; and thus, at the <lb/>
            very commencement of the pursuit, struck down with their <lb/>
            javelins nine or ten men. Success thus attending them, they <lb/>
            pressed upon the enemy with much greater confidence. 16. <lb/>
            As the Lacedæmonians now suffered severely, their com­ <lb/>
            mander ordered the men between thirty and forty years of <lb/>
            age to pursue; but of these, as they retreated, more were <lb/>
            killed than of those who made the previous attempt. When <lb/>
            their best men were in this manner cut off, the cavalry3 came <lb/>
            up to them, and, in conjunction with these, they made another <lb/>
            effort at pursuit. But when the peltasts retired, the cavalry <lb/>
            did not follow them judiciously; for they did not continue to <lb/>
            ride after them till they had killed some of them, but kept <lb/>
            abreast of their own pursuing infantry,4 and pursued or re­ <lb/>
            treated with them. Acting thus again and again, and always <lb/>
            incurring a similar result, they themselves grew continually <lb/>
            fewer and more dispirited, while their assailants became bolder <lb/>
            and more numerous. 17. Being grievously distressed, they <lb/>
            collected in a body on a small hill, distant about two stadia <lb/>
            from the sea and sixteen or seventeen from Lechæum. Those <lb/>
            at Lechæum,5 learning what had happened, embarked in boats <lb/>
            and sailed along the coast till they came opposite the hill. <lb/>
            But the Lacedæmonians, being in utter despair, as they were <note type="footnote"> I The attendants who carried the shields.

            harassed and cut off, and could do nothing in their own de <lb/>
            fence, and seeing, besides, the heavy-armed troops of the <lb/>
            enemy advancing upon them, took to flight, when some of <lb/>
            them were driven into the sea, and only a small number, with <lb/>
            the cavalry, escaped to Lechæum. In the whole of the skir­ <lb/>
            mishes, and in the flight, about two hundred and fifty of them <lb/>
            lost their lives. Such was the termination of that affair.</p>
          <p>is. Soon after, Agesilaus marched away, taking with him <lb/>
            the battalion that had suffered so much, and leaving another <lb/>
            at Lechæum. As he pursued his journey homeward, he took <lb/>
            up his quarters in the several towns as late as possible in the <lb/>
            evening, and resumed his march as early as possible in the <lb/>
            morning. From Orchomenus, indeed, he set out so early <lb/>
            that he passed by Mantineia before it was daylight; so angrily <lb/>
            were the soldiers likely to look upon the Mantineans, who <lb/>
            would rejoice1 at their disaster.</p>
          <p>is. After this Iphicrates had great success in other enter­ <lb/>
            prises ; for garrisons having been placed in Sidus and Crom­ <lb/>
            myon by Praxitas, when he took those places, and another in <lb/>
            CEnoe by Agesilaus when the Peiræum was taken, Iphicrates <lb/>
            reduced them all. Lechæum, however, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and their allies still continued to hold. As for the fugitives <lb/>
            from Corinth, they no longer went by land from Sicyon, in <lb/>
            consequence of the calamity of the battalion, but sailing along <lb/>
            the coast, and making incursions from it, they brought annoy­ <lb/>
            ance on themselves, and gave trouble to those in the city.</p>
          <p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
          <p>The people of Calydon, allies of the Achæans, are harassed by the Acar­ <lb/>
            nanians, against whom the Achaeans solicit aid from the Lacedæmonians. <lb/>
            Agesilaus conducts a force to the support of the Achaeans, in conjunction <lb/>
            with whom he lays waste the lands of the Acarnanians and defeats their <lb/>
            troops. But as he took none of their towns, the Achæans express dissa­ <lb/>
            tisfaction, and he promises to return to their aid in the following year.</p>
          <p>1. SOON after these occurrences, the Achæans, who were <lb/>
            in possession of Calydon, which formerly belonged to Ætolia, <note type="footnote"> 1 The cause of such rejoicing may be easily gathered from what <lb/>
            is related in c. 4, sect. 17 Morus. </note> <pb n="411"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] <lb/>
            </note>and who had made the people of Calydon their fellow-citizens, <lb/>
            were obliged to put a garrison in the place; for the Acarna­ <lb/>
            nians made attacks upon it, and some of the Athenians and <lb/>
            Bœotians, from being in alliance with them, joined them. The <lb/>
            Achæans, in consequence, being distressed by these enemies, <lb/>
            sent ambassadors to Lacedæmon, who, on their arrival, stated <lb/>
            that they were not treated with justice by the Lacedæmonians ; <lb/>
            2. “ For we," said they, "have joined you in the field whenever <lb/>
            you have directed us, and followed you whithersoever you <lb/>
            have led; but when a city of ours is assailed by the Acarna­ <lb/>
            nians, and by the Athenians and Boeotians their allies, you <lb/>
            pay no regard to us. Under such a state of things, therefore, <lb/>
            we should be unable to hold out; and we shall, accordingly, <lb/>
            either give up the war in the Peloponnesus, and cross over1 <lb/>
            with our whole force to oppose the Acarnanians and their <lb/>
            allies, or shall conclude such a peace as we may be able." <lb/>
            3. In saying this they conveyed a threat to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            that they would relinquish their alliance with them, unless <lb/>
            they sent them succour in return for their services. Such a <lb/>
            statement being made, it was thought necessary by the ephori <lb/>
            and assembly of the people to take the field with the Achæans <lb/>
            against the Acarnanians ; and they in consequence sent out <lb/>
            Agesilaus with two battalions and the proper complements <lb/>
            from the allies ; and the Achæans prepared to join him with <lb/>
            their whole force.</p>
          <p>4. When Agesilaus had crossed the water, all the Acarna­ <lb/>
            nians in the country fled for refuge to the towns; and all the <lb/>
            cattle were removed to a distance, that they might not be <lb/>
            taken by his army. Agesilaus, on his part, when he came to <lb/>
            the frontiers of the enemy's territory, sent to Stratus,2 to the <lb/>
            common council of the Acarnanians, and said that " if they did <lb/>
            not relinquish their connexion with the Bœotians and Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans, and join the Lacedæmonians and their allies, he would <lb/>
            devastate their whole country piece by piece, and leave no cor­ <lb/>
            ner of it untouched." 5. As they paid no regard to his words, <lb/>
            he did as he had said, and ravaged the lands without inter <note type="footnote">1 Over the Corinthian Gulf. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That Stratus was the chief town of Acarnania is understood <lb/>

            mission, advancing not more than ten or twelve stadia a day. <lb/>
            The Acarnanians, in consequence, brought down their cattle <lb/>
            from the hills, and resumed their work in most of the fields, <lb/>
            supposing it safe to do so on account of the slow march of the <lb/>
            army. 6. But when they appeared to Agesilaus to have thrown <lb/>
            off all fear, he sacrificed early in the morning, on the fifteenth <lb/>
            or sixteenth day after he had entered the country, and com­ <lb/>
            pleted, before evening, a march of a hundred and sixty stadia <lb/>
            to the lake1 round which almost all the cattle of the Acarna­ <lb/>
            nians were collected, when he captured a great many herds <lb/>
            of oxen, horses, and beasts of every other kind, and a number <lb/>
            of slaves.</p>
          <p>After making this capture, he remained there the following <lb/>
            day and sold what he had taken. 7. Many peltasts of the <lb/>
            Acarnanians, however, came up, and, as Agesilaus was en­ <lb/>
            camped on the side of the mountain,2 they threw down stones, <lb/>
            and used their slings, from the summit of it, without suffering <lb/>
            anything in return, and forced him to move his camp down <lb/>
            to the plain, though it was about the time for preparing sup­ <lb/>
            per. At night the Acarnanians drew off, and the soldiers, <lb/>
            having posted sentinels, reposed in quiet. The next day <lb/>
            Agesilaus led off his army. The outlet from the meadow-land <lb/>
            and plain about the lake was narrow, by reason of the moun­ <lb/>
            tains that surrounded it; and of these the Acarnanians took <lb/>
            possession, and not only hurled down stones and javelins from <lb/>
            the heights, but, coming down to the skirts of the mountains, <lb/>
            hung upon the rear of the troops, and annoyed them so much, <lb/>
            that they could no longer continue their march. 9. The heavy- <lb/>
            armed men and the cavalry, therefore, issued from the main <lb/>
            body in pursuit of the assailants, but did them no injury; <lb/>
            for the Acarnanians, when they retreated, soon gained their <lb/>
            strongholds. Agesilaus, in consequence, thinking it impracti­ <lb/>
            cable to march through a narrow pass under such annoyances, <lb/>
            resolved on attacking those who were hanging on his left, and <note type="footnote"> 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν λίμνην</foreign>.] We wander here through unknown places, says <lb/>

            who were very numerous; for the hills were on that side <lb/>
            easier of ascent for the heavy-armed troops and cavalry. 1o. <lb/>
            While he was offering sacrifice, the Acarnanians continued to <lb/>
            harass him with stones and javelins, and, as they drew nearer, <lb/>
            wounded several of his men. But when he gave the signal, <lb/>
            the men between thirty and thirty-five years of age hastened <lb/>
            to pursue, the cavalry rode along with them, and Agesilaus <lb/>
            followed with the rest; 11. when such of the Acarnanians as <lb/>
            had descended the hills, and were using their missiles, at once <lb/>
            fled, and were killed as they tried to escape up the steep. On <lb/>
            the summit were posted the heavy-armed troops of the Acar­ <lb/>
            nanians, and the greater part of their peltasts, where they <lb/>
            stood their ground, and, besides throwing other weapons, <lb/>
            hurled also spears, with which they wounded the horsemen <lb/>
            and killed some of the horses. But when they were nearly <lb/>
            at close quarters with the Lacedæmonian heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            they gave way, and there were killed of them on that day <lb/>
            about three hundred.</p>
          <p>12. The affair being ended, Agesilaus erected a trophy; <lb/>
            and then, marching about the country, devastated and burned <lb/>
            it. He also made attacks on some of the towns, in compliance <lb/>
            with the urgent requests of the Achæans, but did not take one. <lb/>
            When autumn was just coming on, he quitted the country.</p>
          <p>13. The Achæans thought that he had done nothing, as he <lb/>
            had taken no town either by voluntary surrender or by force, <lb/>
            and entreated him, if he would do nothing more, to stay at <lb/>
            least so long in the country as to hinder the Acarnanians from <lb/>
            sowing their corn. But he replied that they were asking what <lb/>
            was contrary to their interest, " for I shall march hither again," <lb/>
            said he, " next summer, and the more they sow, the more de­ <lb/>
            sirous of peace will they be." 14. After giving them this <lb/>
            answer, he marched off through Ætolia, by roads which nei­ <lb/>
            ther a large nor small army could have passed without the <lb/>
            consent of the Ætolians, who, however, allowed him to pass <lb/>
            in the hope that he would afterwards assist them in recovering <lb/>
            Naupactus. When he reached Rhium, he crossed there, and <lb/>
            proceeded homewards. The passage from Calydon to the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus the Athenians had stopped with their galleys, <lb/>
            in which they made excursions from Œneadæ.1 <note type="footnote">1 A town of Acarnania at the mouth of the Achelous </note></p><pb n="414"/>

          <p>The Acarnanians, rather than continue at war with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            become their allies, and make peace with the Achæans. The Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians determine upon attacking the Argives; Agesipolis invades their <lb/>
            territories, approaches close to the walls of Argos, and strikes great terror <lb/>
            into the people.</p>
          <p>.. WHEN the winter was past, Agesilaus, in conformity <lb/>
            with his promise to the Achæans, gave notice, in the very be­ <lb/>
            ginning of spring, of an expedition against the Acarnanians, <lb/>
            who, gaining intelligence of it, and thinking that, as their <lb/>
            towns lay in the heart of their country, they would be as <lb/>
            much besieged by those who destroyed their corn as if they <lb/>
            were invested by an army in form, sent ambassadors to Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon, and made peace with the Achæans, and an alliance <lb/>
            with the Lacedæmonians. The transactions with the Acar­ <lb/>
            nanians were thus brought to a termination.</p>
          <p>2. After this the Lacedæmonians thought it unsafe to un­ <lb/>
            dertake an expedition against the Athenians or Bœotians, and <lb/>
            leave the hostile and powerful state of the Argives, lying <lb/>
            close on Laconia, behind their back, and accordingly gave <lb/>
            notice of an expedition against Argos. Agesipolis, when he <lb/>
            found that he was to command the force, and the sacrifices <lb/>
            proved favourable to him for crossing the borders, went to <lb/>
            Olympia, and applying to the oracle, inquired of the god <lb/>
            "whether it would be just for him not to admit the truce <lb/>
            alleged by the Argives," because they pleaded the sacred <lb/>
            months,1 not when the time fell, but when the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians were about to invade their country. The god intimated <lb/>
            that "it would be just for him not to admit a truce unjustly <lb/>
            alleged." From thence he immediately proceeded to Delphi, <lb/>
            and inquired of Apollo “ whether he thought the same with <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπέφερον τοὺς</foreign> The Argives alleged some sacred months, <lb/>
            in which they and the Lacedæmonians had mutually agreed that <lb/>
            there should be a cessation from hostilities. So far all is clear; <lb/>
            but what months they were is a question. Schneider. Dodwell <lb/>
            thinks that the time during which the Isthmian games were cele­ <lb/>
            brated is meant; and Schneider, who has a long note on the pass­ <lb/>
            age, is inclined to agree with him. Weiske supposes that the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives pretended sometimes that one month, sometimes that another, <lb/>
            was sacred. </note> <pb n="415"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            regard to the truce as his father." Apollo gave an answer <lb/>
            exactly to the same purpose. 3. Agesipolis, accordingly, led <lb/>
            off the army from Phlius, where it had assembled while he <lb/>
            was gone to the oracles, and entered Argolis by Nemea.1 The <lb/>
            Argives, as soon as they found that they would be unable to <lb/>
            stop him, despatched, as they were accustomed, two heralds <lb/>
            with garlands on their heads, alleging that the truce was still <lb/>
            in force. But Agesipolis replied that " they were not con­ <lb/>
            sidered by the gods to make such an allegation with justice," <lb/>
            and refused to admit the existence of the truce, but continued <lb/>
            his march, and spread great perplexity and alarm over the <lb/>
            country, and in the city. 4. As he was at supper the first <lb/>
            evening, however, in the territory of Argos, and while the <lb/>
            libation was being made after supper, the god2 shook the <lb/>
            earth ; when all the Lacedæmonians, those at the royal tent <lb/>
            commencing, sang the paean to Neptune; but the rest of the <lb/>
            army thought that they ought to return, because Agis once,3 <lb/>
            on an earthquake taking place, had withdrawn his forces out <lb/>
            of Elis. Agesipolis replied, that "if the earthquake had <lb/>
            taken place when he was about to invade the country, he <lb/>
            should have thought that the god meant to prohibit him, but <lb/>
            as it had happened after he had invaded it, he considered that <lb/>
            the god wished to encourage him." 5. Having accordingly <lb/>
            sacrificed next day to Neptune, he advanced, though not far, <lb/>
            into the country. But as Agesilaus had lately conducted an <lb/>
            expedition against Argos, Agesipolis asked the soldiers how <lb/>
            near to the walls Agesilaus had led them, and to what extent <lb/>
            he had ravaged the country and then, like a champion <lb/>
            contending for every prize, endeavoured to go beyond him in <lb/>
            all respects. 6. On one occasion, being struck with missiles <lb/>
            from the towers, he recrossed the trenches that surrounded <lb/>
            the walls; and at another time, when most of the Argives were <lb/>
            gone into Laconia,4 he approached so near to the gates that <note type="footnote"> 1 This was the way the Lacedæmonians usually went, as appears <lb/>

          <p>Pharnabazus and Conon, meanwhile, expel the Lacedæmonian harmosts <lb/>
            from the Greek eities in Asia, and attach many to their interest. Derey­ <lb/>
            lidas secures Abydos and Sestus. Pharnabazus and Canon lay waste parts <lb/>
            of the coast of the Peloponnesus. Pharnabazus takes possession of Cythera, <lb/>
            and goes to the Isthmus of Corinth to encourage his allies, and supply <lb/>
            them with money. Conon then has the sole charge of the fleet, with which <lb/>
            he proceeds to Athens, and rebuilds a great portion of the Long Walls, and <lb/>
            those of the Piræeus. The Lacedæmonians send Antalcidas to the satrap <lb/>
            Tiribazus, to inform him what Conon was doing, and to offer to make <lb/>
            peace with the king; Antalcidas proposes to leave all the islands and the <lb/>
            Greek cities of Asia free. The Athenians and other states send ambassa­ <lb/>
            dors thither at the same time, who disapprove of that proposal. The <lb/>
            negotiation being suspended, Tiribazus secretly supplies the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians with money, makes Conon a prisoner, and then goes to the king to <lb/>
            tell him what he has done. The king sends Struthes to take the charge <lb/>
            of affairs on the coast in Asia Minor, who favours the Athenians. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians send Thibron to oppose Struthes, but with little success. <lb/>
            They then send out an expedition to Rhodes under Ecdicus to restore the <lb/>
            exiles and re-establish the democracy, and despatch, at the same time, <lb/>
            Diphridas to act against Struthes. Afterwards they direct Teleutias to <lb/>
            join Struthes; and the Athenians send out Thrasybulus to oppose both of <lb/>
            them. Thrasybulus, instead of going to Rhodes, sails to Thrace, where <lb/>
            he reconciles two princes that were at variance. He then recovers Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium and Chalcedon, sails to Lesbos, confirms the Mitylenæans in their <lb/>
            fidelity to the Athenians, and defeats the Lacedæmonians at Methymne. <lb/>
            Thrasybulus is killed at Aspendus, and the Athenians send out Agyrrhius <lb/>
            in his place, despatching also Iphicrates to the Hellespont, where the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians make great efforts under Anaxibius. Iphicrates, lying in <lb/>
            ambush for Anaxibius, kills him and a great number of his troops.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH was the mode in which the war was pursued by <lb/>
            .and. But I shall now relate what happened, during the time <lb/>
            that all these events occurred, on the sea and at the cities on <lb/>
            the coast. The most memorable of the transactions I shall <lb/>
            write at length, but such as are undeserving of notice I shall <lb/>
            omit.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, Pharnabazus and Conon, when they <lb/>
            had defeated the Lacedæmonians in the sea-fight, 1 sailed round <lb/>
            to the islands and maritime cities, expelled the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            harmosts, and comforted the people by assuring them that <lb/>
            they would build no citadels in their towns, but would leave <lb/>
            them free and independent. 2. On hearing these assurances, <lb/>
            they were delighted, extolled Pharnabazus, and eagerly sent <note type="footnote"> I See c. 3, sect. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. 11 </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 s </note> <pb n="418"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            him presents. Canon, indeed, had impressed upon Pharna­ <lb/>
            bazus, that " if he acted thus, all the cities would be well dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards him," but told him, that " if he showed open <lb/>
            intentions of enslaving them, each individual city could <lb/>
            give him much trouble," and that " there would be danger <lb/>
            lest the Greeks, if they heard of such conduct on his part, <lb/>
            should combine against him." 3. On these suggestions Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus accordingly acted. Going on shore at Ephesus, he <lb/>
            committed forty galleys to the charge of Conon, with direc­ <lb/>
            tions to meet him at Sestus; and he himself, in the mean <lb/>
            time, proceeded by land to his own province.</p>
          <p>Dercylidas, who was his enemy of old, happened, when the <lb/>
            sea-fight took place, to be at Abydos, and did not, like the <lb/>
            other harmosts, abandon the place, but continued to hold it, <lb/>
            and kept it attached to the Lacedaemonians ; for, having <lb/>
            called the people of Abydos together, he addressed them thus: <lb/>
            4. “ It is in your power, men of Abydos, as you have previously <lb/>
            been friends to our state, to prove yourselves at the present <lb/>
            time its actual benefactors; for that men should show them­ <lb/>
            selves faithful to others in prosperity is nothing wonderful ; <lb/>
            but when they prove true to their friends in adversity, their <lb/>
            conduct is always held in remembrance. Our condition in­ <lb/>
            deed is not such, that, since we are beaten at sea, we are re­ <lb/>
            duced to nothing ; for even in past times, when the Athenians <lb/>
            were sovereigns of the sea, our state was well able to do good <lb/>
            to her friends and harm to her enemies. But the more other <lb/>
            cities desert us with fortune, the more remarkable will your <lb/>
            fidelity appear to us. And if any one of you fears that we <lb/>
            may be besieged here by land and sea, let him consider that <lb/>
            there is no Grecian fleet yet at sea, and that, if the Barba­ <lb/>
            rians attempt to make themselves masters of the sea, the <lb/>
            Greeks will never suffer them to effect their object; and con­ <lb/>
            sequently, while she supports herself, she will be a supporter <lb/>
            to you."</p>
          <p>5. The people of Abydos, on hearing this exhortation, com­ <lb/>
            plied with it, not reluctantly, but with the greatest cheerful­ <lb/>
            ness. Such of the harmosts as came1 to them they received <lb/>
            as friends, and such of them as did not come they invited. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιόντας</foreign>.] Venientes, as in c. 4, sect. 5, and v. 4, 29. They came <lb/>
            after being sent out of the cities which had shaken off the yoke of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. Dindorf. </note> <pb n="419"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            After a large number of efficient men were thus collected <lb/>
            within the city, Dercylidas crossed over to Sestus, which lies <lb/>
            opposite Abydos, and is not more than eight stadia distant <lb/>
            from it. Here he assembled such persons as held land in the <lb/>
            Chersonesus under favour of the Lacedæmonians, and such of <lb/>
            the harmosts as had been. ejected from the cities in Europe, <lb/>
            receiving them kindly, and telling them that " they ought not <lb/>
            to be dispirited any more than the people of Abydos, but to <lb/>
            reflect that even in Asia, which from the first belonged to the <lb/>
            king, there were Temnus, not indeed a large city, and Ægæ,1 <lb/>
            and several other places, in which they might settle without <lb/>
            becoming the king's subjects. Although," added he, “ what <lb/>
            place can you find stronger than Sestus, or more difficult to <lb/>
            be reduced by siege, for, if it were to be blockaded, it would <lb/>
            require both a navy and land forces for the purpose." By <lb/>
            Addressing them thus, he prevented them from being overcome <lb/>
            with fear.</p>
          <p>6. When Pharnabazus found that Abydos and Sestus were <lb/>
            in this condition, he sent word to them, that " if they did not <lb/>
            eject the Lacedæmonians, he would make war upon them." <lb/>
            As they paid no regard to his words, he directed Conon to <lb/>
            prevent them from taking to the sea ; and then proceeded, <lb/>
            himself, to lay waste the lands of Abydos. But as his efforts <lb/>
            were ineffectual to bring the people to a surrender, he went <lb/>
            home, desiring Conon to manage the towns on the Hellespont <lb/>
            in such a manner that as large a fleet as possible might be <lb/>
            collected from them by the spring; for, being enraged with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians for what he had suffered from them, he <lb/>
            was eager, above all things, to sail to their country, and to <lb/>
            take vengeance on them as far as he could.</p>
          <p>7. The winter, accordingly, they spent in making prepar­ <lb/>
            ations ; and, as soon as spring came, Pharnabazus, having <lb/>
            manned a number of vessels, and hired a body of mercenaries, <lb/>
            sailed away, and Conon with him, through the islands3 to <lb/>
            Melos, from whence they proceeded towards Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            But first making a descent on Pheræ,3 he ravaged the country <note type="footnote">1 Both towns of Æolia. </note> <note type="footnote">2 He says “ through the islands," because the voyage was made, <lb/>
            not through the open part of the Ægean, but through the midst of <lb/>
            the Cyclades. Dindorf. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 In Messenia, as Bos ad Corn. Nep. Conon, c. 1, has remarked. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            there; and afterwards, disembarking at other points on the <lb/>
            coast, he spread as much devastation as he could. Fearing, <lb/>
            however, the want of harbours in those parts, the readiness of <lb/>
            the people to assist one another, and the scarcity of provisions, <lb/>
            he soon drew back, and, sailing off, came to an anchor at <lb/>
            Phoenicus1 in Cythera. 8. But as the Cytherians who held <lb/>
            the town abandoned their defences, from fear of being made <lb/>
            prisoners by assault, he sent them, according to a treaty which <lb/>
            lie made with them, into Laconia, while he himself, after <lb/>
            strengthening the fortifications of the Cytherians, left a garri­ <lb/>
            son there with Nicophemus an Athenian in the character of <lb/>
            governor. Having completed these affairs, he stood away to <lb/>
            the Isthmus of Corinth ; and, exhorting the allies to prosecute <lb/>
            the war with alacrity, and to prove themselves faithful adhe­ <lb/>
            rents to the king, he left them whatever money he had with <lb/>
            him, and sailed off home.</p>
          <p>9. But as Conon represented to him that “ if he would al­ <lb/>
            low him to have the fleet, he would supply it with provisions <lb/>
            from the islands, and would make an expedition to his coun­ <lb/>
            try, and rebuild the Long Walls of the Athenians and the wail <lb/>
            round the Piræus, than which exploit," he said, " he knew <lb/>
            nothing would be more grievous to the Lacedoemonians;" <lb/>
            " and by that means," he continued, " you yourself will both <lb/>
            gratify the Athenians and take revenge on the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, since you will render that ineffectual on which they <lb/>
            have exhausted their greatest efforts." Pharnabazus, on rc <lb/>
            ceiving this proposal, gladly despatched him to Athens, and <lb/>
            supplied him with money for the rebuilding of the walls. 10. <lb/>
            Conon, in consequence, proceeding to Athens, erected a large <lb/>
            portion of the wall, employing his own crews in the work, <lb/>
            supplying wages for carpenters and masons, and defraying <lb/>
            whatever other expense was required. There was some part <lb/>
            of the wall, however, which the Athenians themselves, the <lb/>
            Bœotians, and other people, joined in building of their own <lb/>
            accord.</p>
          <p>The Corinthians, in the mean time, having manned a num­ <lb/>
            ber of vessels with the money that Pharnabazus had left <lb/>
            them, and having appointed Agathinus to the command of <lb/>
            them, made themselves masters by sea in the gulf round <note type="footnote"> 1 A harbour not mentioned by any other writer. Weiske. </note> <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            Achaia and Lechæum. 11. The Lacedæmonians, also, fitted <lb/>
            out a fleet to oppose them, of which Podanemus had the COIn­ <lb/>
            mand ; but as he was killed in an encounter, and Poll is, the <lb/>
            second in command, was wounded and went home, Herip­ <lb/>
            pidas took the charge of that fleet. Proænus, a Corinthian, <lb/>
            who succeeded Agathinus in command of the Corinthian fleet, <lb/>
            abandoned Rhium, and the Lacedæmonians took possession of <lb/>
            it. After this Teleutias came out to take the command of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian fleet from Herippidas, and he, in his turn, be <lb/>
            came master of the gulf.</p>
          <p>12. The Lacedæmonians, when they heard that Conon was <lb/>
            rebuilding the walls of Athens with the king's money, main­ <lb/>
            taining his fleet by the same means, and inducing the islands <lb/>
            and cities on the coast to join the Athenians, began to think <lb/>
            that if they could apprize Tiribazus, the king's general,1 of <lb/>
            those particulars, they would either attach him to their own <lb/>
            interest, or at least prevent him2 from maintaining Conon'? <lb/>
            fleet. With these views, they sent Antalcidas to Tiribazus, <lb/>
            instructing him to convey this information, and to endeavoui <lb/>
            to make peace between their government and the king. 13 <lb/>
            The Athenians, at the same time, getting notice of their inten <lb/>
            tion, sent, on their part, an embassy under the escort of Conon, <lb/>
            consisting of Hermogenes, Dion, Callisthenes, and Callimedon ; <lb/>
            they invited also ambassadors to join them from their allies, and <lb/>
            some came from the Bœotians, and from Corinth and Argos <lb/>
            14. When they had all reached their place of destination, <lb/>
            Antalcidas told Tiribazus that " he was come to solicit for his <lb/>
            country a peace with the king ; a peace such as the king al­ <lb/>
            ready desired; for the Lacedæmonians would not claim from <lb/>
            the king the possession of the Greek cities in Asia, but would <lb/>
            be content if the islands and other cities were left free." <lb/>
            " And when we," he proceeded, " feel thus disposed, for what <lb/>
            reason should3 the king either continue at war with us, or be <lb/>
            at such expense? for it will neither be possible for the Athe <note type="footnote">1 He was not subject to Pharnabazus, and does not seem to have <lb/>

            Antalcidas pleased Tiribazus, as he listened to them, ex­ <lb/>
            tremely ; but to the opposite party they were mere words; <lb/>
            for the Athenians were afraid to consent that the cities and <lb/>
            islands should be free, lest they should lose Lemnos, Imbros, <lb/>
            and Scyros; the Thebans were afraid, lest they should be <lb/>
            obliged to set free the cities of Bœotia; and the Argives did <lb/>
            not think that, if such a treaty and conditions were made, they <lb/>
            should be able, as they desired, to retain Corinth as one with <lb/>
            Argos.1 Thus this attempt at peace was ineffectual, and the <lb/>
            ambassadors departed to their several homes.</p>
          <p>16. Tiribazus thought it inconsistent with his personal <lb/>
            safety openly to take the side of the Lacedæmonians without <lb/>
            the consent of the king. Secretly, however, he gave a sum of <lb/>
            money to Antalcidas, in order that a fleet might be maintain­ <lb/>
            ed by the Lacedæmonians, and the Athenians and their allies <lb/>
            be thus made more desirous of peace. Conon, as one who <lb/>
            had injured the king, and against whom the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            brought just accusations, he kept in confinement. After these <lb/>
            proceedings he went up to the king, to state what the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians had proposed, to tell him that he had confined <lb/>
            Conon as a mischievous character, and to ask how he should <lb/>
            act with regard to all these matters. 17. But the king, as <lb/>
            soon as Tiribazus arrived, sent down Struthes to take the <lb/>
            command of the provinces on the coast.</p>
          <p>Struthes, for his part, showed strong attachment to the <lb/>
            cause of the Athenians and their allies, remembering what <lb/>
            damage the king's dominions had suffered from Agesilaus ; <lb/>
            and the Lacedæmonians, as soon as they discovered that <lb/>
            Struthes was hostile to them, and friendly to the Athenians, <lb/>
            sent out Thibron to make war upon him, who, crossing the <lb/>
            sea, and fixing his head quarters at Ephesus, and the towns <lb/>
            in the plain of the Mæander, Priene, Leucophrys, and Achil­ <lb/>
            leium, ravaged and plundered the king's territories, is. But <lb/>
            after some time, Struthes having observed that Thibron sup­ <lb/>
            ported his plundering parties, on every occasion, without ob­ <lb/>
            serving any order, or showing any fear of an enemy, de­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            spatched troop of cavalry into the plains, ordering them tr <note type="footnote"> I See c. 4, sect. 5 and 6 </note> <pb n="423"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            gallop down, and to surround and drive off whatever they <lb/>
            could. Thibron happened then to be passing the time after <lb/>
            dinner in the tent of Thersander the musician. (Thersander <lb/>
            was not only a good musician, but, as having been trained like a <lb/>
            Spartan, had claims to distinction in bodily exercises.) 19. <lb/>
            Struthes, seeing that the enemy came to the rescue in disor­ <lb/>
            der, and that the foremost party were but few, showed him­ <lb/>
            self at the head of a numerous and compact body of horse. <lb/>
            Thibron and Thersander were the first that they slew, and, <lb/>
            when these had fallen, they put the rest of the army to <lb/>
            flight, and pursued and killed a great number of them. <lb/>
            Some escaped in safety to the towns that were friendly to <lb/>
            them. A greater number, because they heard the call to the <lb/>
            rescue too late,1 * * * *; for Thibron, on many other occa­ <lb/>
            sions, as well as on the present, started forth to support some <lb/>
            of his men without giving due notice to the rest. Such was <lb/>
            the way in which this affair terminated.</p>
          <p>20. Certain of the Rhodians, who had been ejected2 by the <lb/>
            popular party, having gone to Lacedæmon, represented that it <lb/>
            would be wrong in the Lacedæmonians to allow the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to subdue Rhodes, and gain so much additional power. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, therefore, well knowing that if the peo­ <lb/>
            ple were masters, all Rhodes would be in the power of the <lb/>
            Athenians, but that, if the rich prevailed, it would be their <lb/>
            own, manned eight vessels to support the aristocracy, and ap­ <lb/>
            pointed Ecdicus to take the command of them. 21. With <lb/>
            him, too, in this fleet, they sent Diphridas, whom they direct­ <lb/>
            ed to cross over into Asia, to secure the cities that had re­ <lb/>
            ceived Thibron, to take the command of the troops that had <lb/>
            saved themselves, and, collecting others from whatever quarter <lb/>
            he could, to make war upon Struthes. Diphridas executed <lb/>
            his orders, succeeded in some other matters, and captured <lb/>
            Tigranes, who had married Struthes' daughter, as he was <lb/>
            going to Sardes with his wife, and did not set them at liberty <note type="footnote"> 1 Leunclavius thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελείποντο</foreign> ought to be inserted in the <lb/>

            without receiving a vast sum of money, by means of which he <lb/>
            was at once enabled to pay his troops. 22. Diphridas be­ <lb/>
            came not less popular than Thibron had been, and, as a gene­ <lb/>
            ral, was far more observant of discipline, and more enterpris­ <lb/>
            ing ; for bodily pleasures held no control over him, but, in <lb/>
            whatever work he engaged, he prosecuted it with the utmost <lb/>
            diligence.</p>
          <p>Ecdicus, having sailed to Cnidus, and found that the popu­ <lb/>
            lar party, having gained entire ascendancy at Rhodes, were <lb/>
            masters both by land and water, and could put to sea with <lb/>
            twice as many galleys as he himself had, remained quiet at <lb/>
            Cnidus; 23. while the Lacedæmonians, on their part, finding <lb/>
            that he had too small a force to give any effectual support to <lb/>
            their friends, directed Teleutias, with the twelve ships which <lb/>
            he commanded in the bay about Achaia and Lechæum, to sail <lb/>
            round to Ecdicus and send him home, and to take upon him­ <lb/>
            self, at the same time, the protection of such as desired to be <lb/>
            their friends, and do whatever damage he could to the enemy. <lb/>
            Teleutias, accordingly, having gone to Samos, and taken some <lb/>
            vessels from thence, sailed to Cnidus, and Ecdicus returned <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>24. Having now seven and twenty ships under his com­ <lb/>
            mand, Teleutias set sail for Rhodes, and, on his voyage, fell <lb/>
            in with Philocrates the son of Ephialtus, who was proceeding <lb/>
            with ten galleys from Athens to Cyprus, to assist Evagoras. <lb/>
            The whole of these vessels he captured. But both parties, in <lb/>
            this affair, acted in direct opposition to their own interests; <lb/>
            for the Athenians, who had the king of Persia for their friend, <lb/>
            were sending aid to Evagoras, who was at war with him; and <lb/>
            Teleutias, while the Lacedæmonians were at war with the <lb/>
            king of Persia, intercepted those who were going to further <lb/>
            the war with him. Teleutias returned to Cnidus, and, after <lb/>
            disposing of what he had taken, set off again to Rhodes to <lb/>
            support the friends of the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>25. The Athenians, apprehending that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            might now re-establish their power at sea, sent out Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus of Styria, with forty ships, to oppose them. Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus, after he had set sail, resolved not to go to the aid of his <lb/>
            countrymen at Rhodes, imagining, on the one hand, that he <lb/>
            would not easily retaliate on the friends of the Lacedæmoni- <pb n="425"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            ans, as they occupied a fortified place,1 and Teleutias was <lb/>
            ready with a fleet to support them, and, on the other, thai <lb/>
            his own friends were not likely to fall into the hands of their <lb/>
            enemies, as they were in possession of cities, were far more <lb/>
            numerous, and had had the advantage in a battle.2 26. Sailing <lb/>
            off, therefore, to the Hellespont, and no enemy appearing to <lb/>
            oppose him, he thought that he might accomplish something <lb/>
            that would be of service to his country. Having learned, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, that Medocus, the king of the Odrysæ, and Seuthes, <lb/>
            the governor of the sea-coast, were at variance, he reconciled <lb/>
            them, and made them friends and allies to the Athenians, ex­ <lb/>
            pecting that, when these were united, the Greek cities lying <lb/>
            on the borders of Thrace would more readily pay regard to <lb/>
            the Athenians. 27. These affairs, then, being satisfactorily <lb/>
            arranged, and the cities in Asia being favourable to the <lb/>
            Athenians, because the king was their friend, he steered to <lb/>
            Byzantium, where he sold to the tax-gatherers the tenth ex­ <lb/>
            acted from people sailing out of the Pontus, and changed the <lb/>
            government of Byzantium from an oligarchy into a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy ; so that the people of Byzantium saw without concern <lb/>
            the great number of Athenians present in the city. 28. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing effected these objects, and made the people of Chalcedon <lb/>
            his friends, he set sail for the Hellespont.</p>
          <p>In the island of Lesbos he found that all the towns had <lb/>
            declared for the Lacedæmonians except Mitylene ; but he took <lb/>
            no measures against any of them until he had united in a <lb/>
            body, at Mitylene, the four hundred heavy-armed men from <lb/>
            his own vessels, and such of the exiles from the other cities <lb/>
            as had fled to Mitylene, joining with them the most efficient <lb/>
            of the Mitylenæans themselves, and holding out hopes to the <lb/>
            Mitylenæans that if he should take the other cities, they <lb/>
            themselves would be sovereigns of all Lesbos; to the exiles, <lb/>
            that if they supported him in attacking all the cities severally, <lb/>
            they would be able, each of them, to secure a return to hi? <lb/>
            country; and to those who embarked with him as volunteers, <lb/>
            that if they rendered Lesbos friendly to Mitylene, they would <lb/>
            acquire a great abundance of wealth. After giving them such <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τει̃χος</foreign>.] Does he mean the city of Rhodes ? or some other <lb/>

            encouragements, he drew them up in a body and led them <lb/>
            against Methymne. 29. Therimachus, who was the Laceda3- <lb/>
            monian harmost there, when he heard of the approach of <lb/>
            Thrasybulus, took the soldiers from on board his vessels, the <lb/>
            Methymnæans themselves, and whatever exiles from Mitylene <lb/>
            chanced to be there, and proceeded to meet him upon the bor­ <lb/>
            ders. A battle ensuing, Therimachus was killed on the field, <lb/>
            and many of his party were slaughtered as they fled. 30. Af­ <lb/>
            ter this event, Thrasybulus brought over some of the towns, <lb/>
            plundered the lands of such as refused to submit, and, having <lb/>
            thus furnished pay to his soldiers, hastened to set out for <lb/>
            Rhodes. But that he might be able to embody an efficient <lb/>
            force there also, he proceeded to collect money, not only from <lb/>
            other cities, but went also to Aspendus, and anchored near <lb/>
            the river Eurymedon ; and he had already received a contri­ <lb/>
            bution from the Aspendians, when, as some of his men com­ <lb/>
            mitted depredations on their lands, the people were enraged, <lb/>
            and, falling upon him in the night, killed him in his tent.</p>
          <p>31. Thus died Thrasybulus, a man who was regarded as <lb/>
            possessed of great ability. The Athenians chose Agyrrhius <lb/>
            in his place, and sent him out to take the command of the <lb/>
            fleet.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians, having heard that the tenth exacted <lb/>
            from the ships sailing out of the Pontus had been sold at <lb/>
            Byzantium by the Athenians, and that the other cities on the <lb/>
            Hellespont, from Pharnabazus being friendly to them, were iv <lb/>
            a favourable condition for the Athenians, who occupied Chal­ <lb/>
            cedon, saw that they must pay attention to matters in that <lb/>
            quarter. 32. Of Dercylidas they had no reason to complain ; <lb/>
            yet Anaxibius, as the ephori were inclined to favour him, <lb/>
            contrived that he himself should be sent out as harmost to <lb/>
            Abydos; and engaged, if he should be intrusted with a sum <lb/>
            of money and some vessels, to prosecute the war with the <lb/>
            Athenians in such a manner that their prosperity on the <lb/>
            Hellespont should be brought to an end. 33. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians accordingly gave him three triremes, and pay sum­ <lb/>
            dent for a thousand mercenaries, and despatched him. When <lb/>
            he arrived at the parts to which he was sent, he collected a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καλχηδόνα ἔχουσι</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐ ἔχοιεν</foreign>.] " Were in a prosperous condition <lb/>
            for them, (the Athenians,) holding Chalcedon." </note> <pb n="427"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            mercenary force by land, and detached some of the Æolian <lb/>
            cities from Pharnabazus ; while, whatever cities sent troops to <lb/>
            attack Abydos, he took the field against them, and invaded <lb/>
            and laid waste their territories. Having manned, too, three <lb/>
            vessels at Abydos, in addition to those which he had, he <lb/>
            Drought into the harbour whatever vessels of the Athenians <lb/>
            or their allies he was able to capture.</p>
          <p>34. The Athenians, receiving intelligence of these proceed­ <lb/>
            ings, and fearing that what Thrasybulus had done on the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont would be lost to them, sent out Iphicrates with eight <lb/>
            ships and about twelve hundred peltasts, of whom the greater <lb/>
            part were those that he had commanded at Corinth, for after <lb/>
            the Argives had made Argos and Corinth one, they said that <lb/>
            they had no further need of them. Iphicrates, indeed, had <lb/>
            cut off some of those that favoured the Argives, and in con­ <lb/>
            sequence had retired to Athens and remained at home. 35. <lb/>
            After Iphicrates arrived at the Chersonesus, Anaxibius and <lb/>
            he at first sent out bands of pirates, and carried on the war <lb/>
            with one another in that way ; but, after some time had passed, <lb/>
            Iphicrates, having learned that Anaxibius was gone to An­ <lb/>
            tandros with his mercenaries, such Lacedæmonian troops as <lb/>
            he had, and two hundred heavy-armed soldiers from Abydos, <lb/>
            and having subsequently heard that he had attached Antan­ <lb/>
            dros to him, he suspected that, after settling a garrison there, <lb/>
            he would return, and bring the Abydenians home again, and <lb/>
            accordingly crossed over by night at the least frequented part <lb/>
            of the territory of Abydos, where he retired up into the moun­ <lb/>
            tains and placed an ambuscade. The vessels which brought <lb/>
            him over he ordered to cruise, as soon as it was day, along the <lb/>
            upper part of the Chersonesus, that he might be thought to <lb/>
            have gone, as he had been accustomed, to collect money. 36. <lb/>
            Having made these dispositions, he was not disappointed in <lb/>
            his expectations ; for Anaxibius was now on his return, though <lb/>
            the victims that day, it was said, had not been favourable to <lb/>
            him ; a warning, however, of which he thought little, because <lb/>
            he was to go through a friendly country and to a friendly <lb/>
            city; and, as he heard from persons who met him that Iphi­ <lb/>
            crates had sailed towards Prceconnesus, he proceeded with still <lb/>
            less concern. 37. Iphicrates, as long as the troops of Anaxibius <lb/>
            were all on the same level, did not rise from his hiding-place; <lb/>
            but when the men of Abydos. who led the way, had reached <pb n="428"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV </note> <lb/>
            the plain near Cremastes, where they have their gold mines, <lb/>
            and the rest of the force was following on the slope of the <lb/>
            hill, and Anaxibius was just going to descend with his Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, Iphicrates started from his ambush, and rushed at <lb/>
            full speed upon him. 38. Anaxibius, conscious that there was <lb/>
            no hope of escape, as be saw his troops extended forwards in <lb/>
            a long narrow road, and knew that those who had gone before <lb/>
            could certainly not come to his aid up the steep, and perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing, too, that they were all struck with a panic as soon as they <lb/>
            saw the ambuscade, said to those who were near him, " Friends, <lb/>
            it becomes me to die here; but do you, before you meet the <lb/>

            he said this, he snatched his shield from the man that carried <lb/>
            it, and fell fighting on the spot. A favourite boy stood by <lb/>
            him to the last; and about twelve of the Lacedæmonian liar­ <lb/>
            masts, who had joined him from the neighbouring cities, fought <lb/>
            and died with him. The rest fled and were slaughtered, for <lb/>
            the enemy pursued them to the city. Of the other troops <lb/>
            about two hundred were killed; of the heavy-armed men ot <lb/>
            Abydos about fifty. Having achieved this exploit, Iphicrate? <lb/>

          <p>The Athenians attack the Æginetans, to put a stop to their depredations on <lb/>
            the coast of Attica. Teleutias, the Lacedæmonian, puts to flight the <lb/>
            Athenian fleet. Honours paid to Teleutias by his soldiers. He is suc­ <lb/>
            ceded by Hierax, and Hierax by Antalcidas, who sends Nicolochus to <lb/>
            Abydos. Gorgopas, a Lacedaemonian, pursues some vessels of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians under Eunomus near Ægina, and captures four of them. Chabrias <lb/>
            lies in ambush for Gorgopas in Ægina, and kills him and many of his <lb/>
            supporters. Teleutias is again sent out, to the great joy of the troops, <lb/>
            and makes a successful attack on the vessels in the Piræeus. The Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans unsuccessfully pursue Antalcidas, who captures Thrasybulus of Col­ <lb/>
            lytus, and, with an accession of force, becomes master of the whole sea. <lb/>
            The Athenians, Lacedæmonians, and Argives become all desirous of <lb/>
            peace. Tiribazus brings conditions of peace from the king, the principal <lb/>
            of them being, that the Greek cities and islands should be left free. This <lb/>
            proposal is well received by all except the Thebans, who are unwilling to <lb/>
            leave any of the Boeotian towns in freedom, but are obliged by Agesilaus <lb/>
            to submit, as well as the Corinthians and Argives.</p>
          <p>i. SUCH was the state of affairs, with regard to the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans and Lacedæmonians, on the Hellespont.</p>
          <p>In Ægina, meanwhile, the people of which had formerly <lb/>
            maintained an intercourse with the Athenians, Eteonicus be­ <lb/>
            ing there again,1 permitted them, as the war was openly car­ <lb/>
            ried on by sea, and as the ephori gave their consent, to carry <lb/>
            off plunder from Attica at pleasure. 2. The Athenians, in <lb/>
            consequence, being annoyed by the Æginetans, despatched to <lb/>
            Ægina a body of heavy-armed troops, under the conduct of <lb/>
            Pamphilus, and erected forts there to command the country, <lb/>
            blockading the place not only by land, but with ten galleys by <note type="footnote"> 1 Xenophon has nowhere else said that Eteonicus was in Ægina <lb/>
            before, but being here, as in many other parts of this history, some­ <lb/>
            what too studious of brevity, merely intimates by the word " again " <lb/>
            that he had been there before. In the rest of the section, also, <lb/>
            there is much obscurity. Schneider. The Athenians had at one <lb/>
            time had the Æginetans under their power, to which period we <lb/>
            must, as Schneider observes, refer the expression formerly," <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόι <lb/>
            πϱόσθεν χρ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">νον</foreign>, in the text. Lysander afterwards set them free ; <lb/>
            and hence, says Weiske, a hatred of the Athenians had been pro­ <lb/>
            duced in the Æginetans, so that Eteonicus had no need to order, <lb/>
            but had only to " permit " them, to plunder Attica. </note> <pb n="430"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            sea. Teleutias, however, who happened to be going to some <lb/>
            of the islands to collect money, heard of the erection of the <lb/>
            forts, and went to the support of the Æginetans; when he <lb/>
            forced the fleet to retire, but of the fortresses Pamphilus kept <lb/>
            possession.</p>
          <p>3. Soon afterwards, Hierax was sent out by the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians as admiral, and took the command of the fleet. Te­ <lb/>
            leutias then set sail for Sparta, and with feelings of the highest <lb/>
            gratification; for when he went down, as he was starting, to <lb/>
            the water-side, there was not a man among the soldiers there <lb/>
            that did not take his hand; while one crowned him with gar­ <lb/>
            lands, and another adorned him with fillets ;I and those even <lb/>
            who were too late, nevertheless threw their garlands into the <lb/>
            sea, and prayed for innumerable blessings on his head. 4. I <lb/>
            know that in relating such particulars, I give no remarkable <lb/>
            instance of munificence, defiance of danger, or able contriv­ <lb/>
            ance ; yet it appears to me, unquestionably, worthy of any <lb/>
            man's consideration, by what sort of conduct Teleutias thus. <lb/>
            wrought on the affections of those under his command; for <lb/>
            a man's success in that way deserves far higher commendation <lb/>
            than any lavishing of wealth or conquest of danger.</p>
          <p>5. Hierax left twelve ships at Ægina, with Gorgopas, his <lb/>
            second in command, as harmost, and took the rest of the fleet <lb/>
            again2 to Rhodes. The Athenians in the line of forts at <lb/>
            Ægina were now more closely besieged by Gorgopas than <lb/>
            their enemies in the city by themselves; so that the Athenians <lb/>
            at home, by an express decree, manned several vessels, and <lb/>
            brought off their men from the fortresses in the island in the <lb/>
            fifth month afterwards. When this, however, was done, the <lb/>
            Athenians were again infested both by the plunderers from <lb/>
            Ægina and by Gorgopas. They therefore fitted out thirteen <lb/>
            vessels to oppose them, and chose Eunomus to take the com­ <lb/>
            mand. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εταινίωσεν</foreign>.] A great mark of honour ; for it was in general <lb/>
            only the statues of the gods, the dead, conquerors in the games, <lb/>
            ind eminent benefactors to their country and mankind, that wen <lb/>
            so distinguished. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πάλιν</foreign>.] This word seems not to refer to the man, but to the <lb/>
            matter; not to indicate that Hierax had been at Rhodes before, <lb/>
            but that there had been an affair with the Rhodians, and that in <lb/>
            consequence of it the fleet was obliged to go thither again. Weiske. <lb/>
            Schneider refers to iv. 8. 25. </note></p><pb n="431"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> </p>
          <p>6. While Hierax was at Rhodes, the Lacedæmonians sent <lb/>
            out Antalcidas as their admiral, thinking that by doing so <lb/>
            they would highly gratify Tiribazus. Antalcidas, when he <lb/>
            arrived at Ægina, took with him the ships under Gorgopas, <lb/>
            and sailed to Ephesus, whence he sent Gorgopas back again <lb/>
            with his twelve ships to Ægina, and appointed Nicolochus, <lb/>
            his second in command, over the rest. Nicolochus sailed off <lb/>
            to give the people of Abydos support, but, turning aside to <lb/>
            Tenedos, laid waste the country there, and, after securing <lb/>
            some money, stood off again towards Abydos. 7. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nian commanders, however, assembling from Samothrace, <lb/>
            Thasos, and the places in that quarter, came to the assistance <lb/>
            of the people of Tenedos; and when they found that Nicolo­ <lb/>
            clius had already steered off for Abydos, they put to sea from <lb/>
            the Chersonesus, and blocked him up there with two-and-thirty <lb/>
            vessels of their own, he having only twenty-five. In the mean <lb/>
            time Gorgopas, as he was sailing from Ephesus, fell in with <lb/>
            Eunomus, and for the present betook himself to Ægina, a little <lb/>
            before sunset, where he landed his men, and ordered them <lb/>
            immediately to take their suppers. 8. Eunomus also, having <lb/>
            stayed here a short time, pursued his voyage, and when night <lb/>
            came on, led the way with a light, as is usual, that the ships <lb/>
            behind may not miss their way; when Gorgopas, having re­ <lb/>
            embarked his men, immediately followed him by the aid of <lb/>
            the light, keeping at some distance behind, that he might not <lb/>
            be perceived or afford any indication of his approach, the <lb/>
            celeustæ1 using the sound of stones, instead of their voice, to <lb/>
            give their time-signals, and oblique strokes of their oars.2 9. <lb/>
            But as soon as the vessels of Eunomus had got to land near <lb/>
            Zoster in Attica, he ordered an attack with sound of trum­ <lb/>
            pet. The men from some of the ships of Eunomus had then <note type="footnote"> 1 The men whose office it was by voice or signals to give time to <lb/>
            the rowers. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παραγωγη̃ τω̃ν κωπω̃ν</foreign>.] Liddell and Scott interpret this term <lb/>
            in nearly the same manner as Sturz and Brodæus, " a sliding mo­ <lb/>
            tion of the oars, so that they made no dash in going in and out ot <lb/>
            the water." Schneider and Weiske suppose that flat strokes of the <lb/>
            oars on the water are meant, to make more noise than usual, as <lb/>
            signals in combination with the dropping of the stones. But in this <lb/>
            supposition they must surely be deceived. Dindorf says that we <lb/>
            must understand the expression de reductis remis, by which the reader <lb/>
            is not much assisted. </note> <pb n="432"/>

            gone on shore; others were anchoring, and others drawing to <lb/>
            land. A battle taking place by moonlight, Gorgopas captured <lb/>
            four of the enemy's ships, and went off with them in tow to <lb/>
            Ægina; but the rest of the Athenian vessels took shelter in <lb/>
            the Piræeus.</p>
          <p>10. After these occurrences, Chabrias was sailing out1 to <lb/>
            Cyprus to the aid of Euagoras, with eight hundred peltasts <lb/>
            and ten galleys ; but taking with him from Athens some other <lb/>
            vessels, and a party of heavy-armed men, he landed by night <lb/>
            on the island of Ægina, and placed himself in ambush, with <lb/>
            his peltasts in a hollow some distance beyond the temple of <lb/>
            Hercules. As soon as it was day, the heavy-armed Atheni­ <lb/>
            fins, as had been agreed, came to join him under the command <lb/>
            of Demænetus, and went up about sixteen stadia beyond the <lb/>
            temple of Hercules, where the place called the Three Towers2 <lb/>
            is. 11. Gorgopas, receiving intelligence of these proceedings, <lb/>
            came out with a body of Æginetans, the soldiers from the <lb/>
            fleet, and eight Spartans who happened to be there, to oppose <lb/>
            the enemy. He issued orders, too, that all the free-men in <lb/>
            the crews of the vessels should come to his support; so that <lb/>
            many of these also gave film aid, each bringing whatever <lb/>
            weapon he could find. 12. But as soon as those in front had <lb/>
            passed the ambuscade, Chabrias and his party started up, and <lb/>
            hurled javelins and stones at them; when the heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, who had landed from the ships, advanced to the charge; <lb/>
            and the first party, for they were not in a compact body, were <lb/>
            soon cut off; among them were Gorgopas and the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ; and when these were killed, the rest took to flight. <lb/>
            Of the Æginetans there perished about a hundred and fifty; <lb/>
            and of the foreigners, sojourners, and mariners, who had run <lb/>
            down to give assistance, not less than two hundred. 13. Af­ <lb/>
            ter this the Athenians ranged the sea as quietly as in the <lb/>
            midst of peace; for the sailors refused to move an oar3 for <note type="footnote"> 1 Was he going from Athens? If so, why does Xenophon after­ <lb/>
            wards say, " taking with him from Athens," &amp;c.? We must there­ <lb/>
            fore suppose that he brought ships and peltasts from some other <lb/>
            place ; and were these the peltasts and ships which he had previ­ <lb/>
            ously used in the war with Corinth, when he succeeded Iphicratcs? <lb/>

            Eteonicus, how much soever lie tried to compel them, since he <lb/>
            had no money for their pay,</p>
          <p>Soon after, the Lacedæmonians sent out Teleutias to take <lb/>
            the command of the ships in those parts ; and the sailors, <lb/>
            when they saw him arrive, were in the highest degree de­ <lb/>
            lighted. He called them together, and addressed them thus: <lb/>
            14. " I am come, my fellow-combatants, without any money; <lb/>
            but if the gods please, and you heartily support me, I will en­ <lb/>
            deavour to supply you with the greatest possible abundance of <lb/>
            provisions; and be assured that, as long as I command you, <lb/>
            I pray that you may have subsistence not less plentifully than <lb/>
            myself. You would perhaps wonder if I should say that I <lb/>
            wish you to have plenty rather than myself; but, by the gods, <lb/>
            I would sooner submit to fast for two days than that you <lb/>
            should fast for one. My door used to be open in past times, <lb/>
            for any one that wanted anything of me to enter, and it shall <lb/>
            be open also now; so that, whenever you have abundance <lb/>
            of provisions, you will then see my table, likewise, more plen­ <lb/>
            tifully supplied. 15. And when you behold me enduring cold, <lb/>
            and heat, and want of sleep, consider that you yourselves, too, <lb/>
            ought to <unclear>bear1</unclear> the same inconveniences; for I do not require <lb/>
            you to submit to hardships merely that you may suffer pain, <lb/>
            but that you may gain some advantage from them. 16. Our <lb/>
            own state, my fellow-soldiers, which is seen to be prosperous, <lb/>
            acquired its blessings and honours, be assured, not by being <lb/>
            slothful, but by being willing to submit to toils and dangers <lb/>
            whenever it might be necessary. You were formerly, as I <lb/>
            myself know, brave men ; and it now behoves you to be still <lb/>
            more brave, that we may labour together with content, and <lb/>
            enjoy success together with pleasure. 17. What greater plea­ <lb/>
            sure can there be, indeed, than to have to flatter no man, <lb/>
            either Greek or Barbarian, for pay, but to be able to procure <lb/>
            subsistence for ourselves, and to procure it by the most lion­ <lb/>
            ourable means ? For abundance of spoil, taken from the <lb/>
            enemy in war, brings with it, you may be certain, not merely <lb/>
            subsistence, but fame among all mankind."</p>
          <p>is. Thus he spoke; and they all cried out that he might <lb/>
            order them to do whatever he thought necessary, as they <lb/>
            were ready to obey. He had already performed the custom- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οἴεσθε κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺμει̃ς ταυ̃τα πάντα καρτεοει̃ν</foreign>.] Dindorf refers to <lb/>

            ary sacrifices, and now said to them, " Go, then, soldiers, and <lb/>
            take your suppers as you were about to do; and then furnish <lb/>
            yourselves, in accordance with my wishes,1 with one day's <lb/>
            provisions. When you have done so, repair at once to your <lb/>
            vessels, that we may sail whither heaven directs us, and <lb/>
            arrive at a fortunate time." 19. As soon as they were come, he <lb/>
            made them go on board, and sailed off by night towards the <lb/>
            harbour of Athens, sometimes slackening his course, and bid­ <lb/>
            ding the men take some rest, and sometimes speeding onward <lb/>
            with the aid of oars.</p>
          <p>If any one thinks that he acted rashly, in going with only <lb/>
            twelve galleys against a people possessed of so numerous a <lb/>
            navy, let him consider what course of reasoning he adopted. <lb/>
            20. He thought that the Athenians, since Gorgopas was killed, <lb/>
            took less precaution to guard their ships in the harbour; he <lb/>
            believed that even if vessels of war were anchored there, it <lb/>
            would be safer for him to attack twenty of them at Athens <lb/>
            than ten of them elsewhere, for, in ships that were abroad, he <lb/>
            knew that the seamen lay constantly on board, but at Athens <lb/>
            he felt sure that the captains would sleep at home, and that <lb/>
            the sailors would go to lodge in various places. It was with <lb/>
            these considerations that he engaged in the enterprise.</p>
          <p>21. When he was about five or six stadia from the harbour, <lb/>
            he remained quiet, and made his men rest themselves. But as <lb/>
            soon as day appeared, he led onward with his ship, and the <lb/>
            rest followed. He did not allow his crews to sink or damage <lb/>
            any trading vessels, but, wherever they saw a war-galley, he <lb/>
            bade them try to disable her for sailing. He told them also to <lb/>
            fasten all the trading vessels, and such as had cargoes on <lb/>
            board, to their own, and tow them out to sea ; and to board <lb/>
            the larger ships, wherever they could, and carry off the peo­ <lb/>
            ple that they found in them. Some of his men even leaped <lb/>
            into the market-place on the quay,2 and, seizing some traders <lb/>
            and masters of vessels, carried them prisoners on board their <lb/>
            own ships. 22. Such was the success of Teleutias. Of the <lb/>

            heard the noise, ran out to see what it was; while, of such <lb/>
            as were out of doors, some ran into their houses for their arms, <lb/>
            and others hastened to the city to tell the news. All the <lb/>
            troops from Athens, both infantry and cavalry, then marched <lb/>
            down with succour, just as if the Piræeus had been taken. <lb/>
            23. But Teleutias sent off the vessels which he had captured <lb/>
            to Ægina, and ordered his men to take three or four galleys <lb/>
            with them ; while he himself, with the rest of his vessels, di­ <lb/>
            recting his course along the coast of Attica, surprised, as he <lb/>
            was apparently sailing quietly out of the harbour, several <lb/>
            fishing and ferry boats, full of people, coming in from the is­ <lb/>
            lands. Proceeding also to Sunium, he took a number of <lb/>
            transport vessels, some laden with corn and some with mer­ <lb/>
            chandise. 24. After these successes he sailed back to Ægina, <lb/>
            and, selling his spoils, gave his soldiers a month's pay in ad­ <lb/>
            vance. Continuing his cruise afterwards, also, he captured <lb/>
            whatever he could, and, by this means, kept his ships well <lb/>
            manned, and disposed his men to serve him with cheerfulness <lb/>
            and activity.</p>
          <p>25. Antalcidas now returned with Tiribazus, having ob­ <lb/>
            tained the king's consent to support the Lacedæmonians, if <lb/>
            the Athenians and their allies refused to acquiesce in the <lb/>
            peace which he had proposed. Hearing, however, that Nico­ <lb/>
            lochus, with his vessels, was blocked up at Abydos by Iphi­ <lb/>
            crates and Diotimus, he proceeded to that city by land; <lb/>
            where he resumed the command of the fleet, and put out to <lb/>
            sea1 by night, spreading a report that the Chalcedonians had <lb/>
            sent for him. At the harbour of Percote he anchored, and <lb/>
            then remained quiet. 26. Demœnetus, Dionysius, Leontichus, <lb/>
            and Phanias, perceiving his departure, went in pursuit of him <lb/>
            towards Prœconnesus; and he, when they had sailed past <lb/>
            him, turned and went back to Abydos; for he had heard that <lb/>
            Polyxenus was coming with the twenty ships2 from Syracuse <lb/>
            and Italy, and he purposed to unite them to his own.</p>
          <p>Soon after, Thrasybulus the Colyttian3 set sail with eight <lb/>
            ships from Thrace, wishing to form a junction with the rest <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανήγετο</foreign>.] It is not explained how, when Nicolochus was <lb/>

            of the Athenian fleet. 27. Antalcidas, when his scouts gave <lb/>
            him notice that the eight ships were coming up, sent men on <lb/>
            board twelve of his best sailing vessels, ordering them to make <lb/>
            up the crews, if any vessel was deficient, from the other ships, <lb/>
            and lay on the watch as much out of sight as possible. As <lb/>
            soon as they had passed him, he started in pursuit of them; <lb/>
            and they, seeing him, fled. With his best sailing vessels, he <lb/>
            soon overtook those of the Athenians that sailed most slowly, <lb/>
            but, as he had ordered such of his ships as should outstrip the <lb/>
            rest. not to attack the hindmost of the enemy, he continued in <lb/>
            pursuit 01 the foremost; and when he had taken these, the <lb/>
            last, seeing their vessels in front captured, became a prey, <lb/>
            through being dispirited, to the slower vessels1 of Antalcidas ; <lb/>
            and thus the whole were captured.</p>
          <p>28. When there joined him, besides, the twenty ships2 from <lb/>
            Syracuse, with those from that part of Ionia of which Tiri­ <lb/>
            bazus was master, (the complement being made up from the <lb/>
            part under Ariobarzanes, for Tiribazus had long been his <lb/>
            guest-friend, and Pharnabazus had gone up3 by summons to <lb/>
            the royal court, at the time when he married the king's <lb/>
            daughter,) Antalcidas, with all these vessels, amounting to <lb/>
            more than eighty, rode master of the sea, so that he prevented <lb/>
            ships from Pontus4 from sailing to Athens, and carried them <lb/>
            off as prizes to his own allies. 29. The Athenians, therefore, <lb/>
            seeing that the enemy's fleet had become thus numerous, and <lb/>
            fearing that, as the king had become an ally to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, they should be subdued as they had been before, and <lb/>
            beirg harassed, at the same time, by pirates5 from Ægina <lb/>
            grew, on all those accounts, extremely desirous of peace.</p>
          <p>The Lacedæmonians too, on their part, who had a batta­ <lb/>
            lion in garrison at Lechæum, and another at Orchomenus, who <lb/>
            had to watch the cities, which they trusted, lest they should <lb/>
            be taken from them, and those which they distrusted, lest they <lb/>
            should revolt, and who were still suffering and struggling <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν βραδυτέρων ἡλίσκοντο</foreign>.] Before these words Stephens and <lb/>

            about Corinth, were becoming discontented at the protraction <lb/>
            of the war.</p>
          <p>The Argives also, who knew that another expedition was <lb/>
            decreed against them, and were sensible that their allegation <lb/>
            of the months I would no longer avail them, were most eager <lb/>
            for peace.</p>
          <p>so. In consequence, when Tiribazus gave notice that such <lb/>
            as desired to hear2 the terms of the peace which the king had <lb/>
            sent down, should attend him, they all very soon presented <lb/>
            themselves. When they were assembled, Tiribazus, having <lb/>
            showed them the king's seal, read what was written to them. <lb/>
            It was as follows:</p>
          <p>31. " Artaxerxes the king thinks it right that the cities in <lb/>
            Asia, with the islands of Clazomenæ 3 and Cyprus, should belong <lb/>
            to himself, and that he should leave the other Grecian cities, <lb/>
            small and great, free, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; <lb/>
            and that these, as formerly, should belong to the Athenians. <lb/>
            Whichsoever of the two parties4 does not assent to those terms <lb/>
            of peace, I myself, in conjunction with those who receive <lb/>
            them, will make war upon that party both by land and sea, <lb/>
            both with ships and money."</p>
          <p>32. The deputies from the several states, having listened <lb/>
            to these terms, reported them severally to their own people. <lb/>
            All the rest swore for themselves that they would observe <lb/>
            them, but the Thebans demanded to swear in the name of all <lb/>
            the Bœotians. Agesilaus, however, refused to admit their <lb/>
            oath, unless they swore, as the king's letter expressed it, that <lb/>
            " every city, small and great, should be free." The deputies <lb/>
            of the Thebans said that power to do so had not been granted <lb/>
            them. " Go then," said Agesilaus, " and consult your people ; <lb/>
            and tell them also that if they do not comply, they shall be <lb/>
            excluded from the peace." 33. The deputies accordingly went <lb/>
            away. But Agesilaus, from his hostility to the Thebans, did <note type="footnote">1 iv. 7. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπακου̃σαι</foreign>.] We should rather read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπακου̃σαι</foreign> Dindorf. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Palmerius, in allusion to this passage, shows, from Pausanias, <lb/>

            not hesitate how to act, for, having brought the ephori over <lb/>
            to his opinion, he at once offered sacrifice, and as the omens <lb/>
            were favourable for crossing the frontiers, he proceeded to <lb/>
            Tegea, and sent some of his horsemen to the neighbouring <lb/>
            people' to summon their troops; he despatched also the cap­ <lb/>
            tains of the auxiliaries to their own towns.2 But before he <lb/>
            set out from Tegea, the Thebans came to him, saying that <lb/>
            they would leave'the cities free. The Lacedæmonians conse­ <lb/>
            quently returned home, and the Thebans were obliged to in­ <lb/>
            elude themselves in the peace, leaving the Bœotian cities in <lb/>
            freedom.</p>
          <p>34. Yet the Corinthians, on their part, would not send away <lb/>
            the garrison of Argives. But Agesilaus gave notice to them <lb/>
            both, to the Corinthians, if they did not send away the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, and to the Argives, if they did not quit Corinth, that he <lb/>
            would make war upon them. As both were alarmed at this <lb/>
            denunciation, the Argives marched out, and the city of Corinth <lb/>
            became again its own mistress; when the authors of the <lb/>
            massacre,3 and those who were privy to it, withdrew of their <lb/>
            own accord4 from the city; and the other citizens readily re­ <lb/>
            admitted such as had formerly been banished.</p>
          <p>35. When these matters were arranged, and the states had <lb/>
            sworn to adhere to the terms of peace which the king had <lb/>
            sent, the land forces and naval forces were at the same time <lb/>
            disbanded. Thus this first peace was made between the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians and Athenians, and the allies of each, after the <lb/>
            war between them subsequent to the demolition of the walls <lb/>
            of Athens. 36. The Lacedæmonians, who had turned the <lb/>
            scale in their favour during the war, became still more distill­ <lb/>
            guished in consequence of the peace, as it was called, of An­ <lb/>
            talcidas. For making themselves executors of the peace sent <lb/>
            down by the king, and insisting on the freedom of the cities, <lb/>
            they gained Corinth as an ally ; they set the cities of Bœotia, <lb/>
            as they had long desired, free from the Thebans; and they <lb/>
            caused the Argives to desist from appropriating Corinth, by <lb/>
            declaring war against them unless they should quit the place. <note type="footnote"> 1 The people in the neighbourhood of Tegea, subject to that city. <lb/>

          <p>The Lacedæmonians manifest their displeasure towards their refractory and <lb/>
            cuspected allies, and overthrow the city of Mantineia. Exiles from Phlius <lb/>
            apply for aid to the Lacedæmonians, by whose means they are reinstated <lb/>
            in their country. Ambassadors from Acanthus and Apollonia are sent to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon to complain of the increasing power of the Olynthians, and <lb/>
            represent the dangers likely to arise from it. The Lacedæmonians, in <lb/>
            consequence, send out Eudamidas to Olynthus with such forces as they <lb/>
            could readily assemble, and appoint his brother Phœbidas to follow with <lb/>
            a reinforcement. Phœbidas, having reached Thebes, which was then <lb/>
            divided into two factions, is put in possession of the citadel by Leontiades, <lb/>
            leader of one of the factions, who causes Ismenias, leader of the other, <lb/>
            to be brought to trial as an enemy to his country. Ismenias is tried and <lb/>
            condemned by commissioners from Sparta, and put to death. The Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, who are pleased with the conduct of Phœbidas, in having <lb/>
            taken possession of the citadel, are assisted, by the influence of Leontiades, <lb/>
            with a large number of troops from Thebes for the Olynthian war. Te­ <lb/>
            leutias is appointed harmost. His successes.</p>
          <p>1. THESE matters having succeeded as they wished, they de­ <lb/>
            termined to punish such of their allies as had been trouble­ <lb/>
            some to them during the war, and had shown more favour to <lb/>
            the enemy than to themselves ; and to deal with them in such <lb/>
            a manner that they might not be disobedient to them in fu­ <lb/>
            ture. In the first place, accordingly, they sent to the Manti­ <lb/>
            neans, commanding them to pull down their walls, as they <lb/>
            could not otherwise trust that they would not join their ene­ <lb/>
            mies; 2. " for they had heard," they said, "that they had <lb/>
            sent corn to the Argives when they were at war with Argos; <lb/>
            that at times they had refused to take the field with them, on <lb/>
            pretext of the existence of a truce; and that, when they did <lb/>
            go with them, they acted with no spirit." They stated also, <lb/>
            that " they knew they were envious of them if any success <lb/>
            attended them, and pleased if any calamity befell them." The <lb/>
            truce, too, which bad been made with the Mantineans for <lb/>
            thirty years1 after the battle at Mantineia, was said to have <note type="footnote"> 1 On this passage Dodwell remarks to this effect ; <unclear/> Since the bat. <lb/>

            treaty of peace had been made for fifty years; there must therefore <lb/>
            have been another treaty, which the Mantineans had made against <lb/>
            their will." These observations of Dodwell are not very satisfac­ <lb/>

            expired this year. 3. But as the Mantineans refused to pull <lb/>
            down their walls, the Lacedæmonians gave notice of an expe­ <lb/>
            dition against them.</p>
          <p>Agesilaus begged his countrymen to excuse him from lead­ <lb/>
            ing the army on the occasion, representing to them that the <lb/>
            people of Mantineia had frequently been of service to his <lb/>
            father1 in the wars with Messene. Agesipolis, therefore, <lb/>
            took the command of the expedition, although his father, <lb/>
            Pausanias,2 had been very friendly with the leaders of the <lb/>
            people at Mantineia. 4. When he had crossed the borders, <lb/>
            lie proceeded first to lay waste the country; but as they would <lb/>
            not even then pull down their walls, he dug a trench quite <lb/>
            round the city, half of his men sitting by with the arms of <lb/>
            those who were digging, while the other half carried on the <lb/>
            work. After the trench was finished, he next constructed, <lb/>
            without molestation, a wall around the city. Hearing, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that there was abundance of corn in the place, as there <lb/>
            had been a plentiful harvest the preceding year, and thinking <lb/>
            that it would be a great hardship if he should be obliged to <lb/>
            wear out both his own people and the allies with military <lb/>
            operations, he dammed up the river,3 though it was very large, <lb/>
            that runs through the city. 5. The course of the stream being <lb/>
            thus stopped, the water rose above the foundations of the <lb/>
            houses and above those of the city walls. The lower bricks4 <lb/>
            being In consequence soaked through, and failing to support <lb/>
            those above, the walls first began to crack, and then to give <lb/>
            way. For a time the people propped them with pieces of <lb/>
            timber, and contrived to prevent the tower5 from falling; but <lb/>
            when they found themselves overpowered by the water, and <lb/>
            were afraid that if any part of the wall fell, they should be <lb/>
            taken by assault, they consented to demolish their walls. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, however, refused now to assent to their pro­ <lb/>
            posal, unless they would also distribute themselves into sepa­ <lb/>
            rate villages. The Mantineans, thinking that necessity <note type="footnote"> 1 Archidamus, in the war carried en for ten years from the first <lb/>

            obliged them, agreed to this condition likewise. 6. As those <lb/>
            who had favoured the Argives,1 and those who had been <lb/>
            leaders in the democracy, were afraid that they should be put <lb/>
            to death, Pausanias, the father of Agesipolis, obtained his <lb/>
            consent that their lives should be granted them if they would <lb/>
            depart from the city; the number of them being about sixty. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians accordingly ranged themselves, with their <lb/>
            spears in their hands, on both sides of the road, beginning <lb/>
            from the very gates, to take a view of such as left the place ; <lb/>
            and, though they hated them, they yet refrained from offering <lb/>
            violence more easily than did the oligarchic party of the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans. Let this be recorded as a signal proof of their obe­ <lb/>
            dience to command. 7. The wall was then demolished, and <lb/>
            the city was divided into four villages, just as the people had <lb/>
            dwelt originally. At first they were very much discontented <lb/>
            at having to pull down their present houses, and build others ; <lb/>
            but when those who had property found themselves located <lb/>
            nearer their estates, which lay round the villages, and when <lb/>
            they had experience of an aristocracy, and were rid of their <lb/>
            turbulent demagogues, they were delighted at the result.2 <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians sent them, not one captain only,3 but <lb/>
            one for each village ; and they joined them in the field from <lb/>
            the villages much more cheerfully than they had done when <lb/>
            they were under a democracy. Affairs respecting the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans were thus brought to a conclusion, mankind being <lb/>
            taught by their fate not to let a river run through their walls.</p>
          <p>8. At this time, those who had been banished from Phlius, <lb/>
            observing that the Lacedæmonians were now examining how <lb/>
            each of their allies had behaved to them during the war, <lb/>
            thought it a fit season to state their own case, and, going to <note type="footnote"> 1 That the Mantineans had always taken the side of the Ar­ <lb/>

            Lacedæmon, represented that as long as they themselves had <lb/>
            remained at home, the people had received the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans within their walls, and had followed them in the field <lb/>
            wherever they led; but that, after the city ejected them, they <lb/>
            had not only not followed them anywhere, but refused the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians alone, of all men living, admittance within <lb/>
            their gates. 9. The ephori, having listened to this represent­ <lb/>
            ation, thought it well deserving of attention, and, sending to <lb/>
            the city of Phlius, intimated that " the exiles were friends to <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian people, and had been banished without <lb/>
            having done anything wrong ;" and added that " they wished <lb/>
            to obtain their restoration, not by compulsion, but with the <lb/>
            voluntary consent of the people." The Phliasians, on receiv­ <lb/>
            ing this message, began to suspect that if the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            should march against them, some of their own people would <lb/>
            let them into the city, as there were many relations of the <lb/>
            exiles within the walls, who were well inclined to their cause <lb/>
            on other accounts, and who, or at least some of them, from <lb/>
            desire of a change in affairs, (as often happens under most <lb/>
            governments,) were willing to effect their restoration. 10. <lb/>
            Entertaining such apprehensions, they passed a decree that <lb/>
            they would re-admit the exiles; that they would restore them <lb/>
            the property that evidently belonged to them; that whoever <lb/>
            had bought anything of theirs should receive an equivalent <lb/>
            for it from the public treasury ; and that, if any dispute arose <lb/>
            among the parties, it should be settled by an equitable deci­ <lb/>
            sion. Such were the arrangements made with regard to the <lb/>
            Phliasian exiles on this occasion.</p>
          <p>11. Ambassadors from Acanthus and Apollonia, also, the <lb/>
            largest cities in the neighbourhood of Olynthus, arrived at <lb/>
            this time at Lacedæmon. The ephori, having learned with <lb/>
            what object they came, brought them before the assembly of <lb/>
            the people and the allies; when Cleigenes of Acanthus spoke <lb/>
            to the following effect:</p>
          <p>12. "We are of opinion, citizens and allies of Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            that a power which is now rising up in Greece has escaped <lb/>
            your observation. That Olynthus, however, is the largest of <lb/>
            the cities on the borders of Thrace, you are almost all aware. <lb/>
            The people of that city have attached some other cities to <lb/>
            them, on the understanding that they are to use the same laws <lb/>
            and be under the same government; and these have since: <pb n="443"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            brought some of the larger cities into union with them. They <lb/>
            have in consequence attempted to set free the cities of Mace­ <lb/>
            donia from their subjection to Amyntas, king of the Macedo­ <lb/>
            nians ; is. and, as those nearest them yielded to their solicita­ <lb/>
            tions, they soon proceeded to make attempts on the more distant <lb/>
            and more important; so that, when we left those parts, they <lb/>
            were in possession, not only of several others, but also of <lb/>
            Pella, the greatest of all the cities in Macedonia; and we <lb/>
            heard that Amyntas was withdrawing from his cities, and had <lb/>
            been driven from almost the whole of Macedonia.</p>
          <p>" The Olynthians have also sent to us, and to the people of <lb/>
            Apollonia, and signified that unless we prepare to act in the <lb/>
            field with them, they will make war upon us. 14. But we, 0 <lb/>
            men of Lacedæmon, desire to adhere to the laws of our country, <lb/>
            and to remain an independent government. Yet, unless some <lb/>
            other power supports us, we must of necessity unite ourselves <lb/>
            with them. They have already not less than eight hundred <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops, and of peltasts a much larger number; <lb/>
            and their cavalry, if we should have to join them, will be more <lb/>
            than a thousand. 15. We left also ambassadors from the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans and Bœotians there; and we heard that it had been re­ <lb/>
            solved by the Olynthians themselves to send back ambassadors <lb/>
            with them to those states to concert an alliance. If, then, <lb/>
            so great a power shall be added to the present strength of the <lb/>
            Athenians and Thebans, take care lest they be in future diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to be controlled by you.</p>
          <p>" Since they are in possession, too, of Potidæa, lying on <lb/>
            the isthmus of Pallene, be sure that the towns within that <lb/>
            isthmus must submit to them; and let this be a proof to you <lb/>
            of the extreme alarm which those towns feel, that, though <lb/>
            they sincerely hate the Olynthians, they did not dare to send <lb/>
            ambassadors with us to join in these representations to you.</p>
          <p>16. "Reflect, also, how it can be reasonable for you to take <lb/>
            measures that Bœotia may not -be united, and to disregard the <lb/>
            combination of a far greater power ; a power which is grow­ <lb/>
            ing strong, not only by land, but also by sea; for what can <lb/>
            hinder its progress, when there is timber in the country for <lb/>
            ship-building, tribute from many ports and trading towns, and <lb/>
            a numerous population maintained by the fertility of the soil ? <lb/>
            17. The Thracians, moreover, who have no king, are neigh­ <lb/>
            bours to the Olynthians, and are already paying court to them, <pb n="444"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            and, if they should submit to their authority, this would also <lb/>
            be a vast accession of power to them. Besides, should the <lb/>
            Thracians join them, the gold mines at Pangæum will at once <lb/>
            stretch out a hand to them.</p>
          <p>is. " In speaking thus, we say only what has been said ten <lb/>
            thousand times among the people of Olynthus; and the am­ <lb/>
            bition which they feel, who shall express ? for the deity has <lb/>
            perhaps ordained that the ambition of men must increase with <lb/>
            their power.</p>
          <p>" We, then, 0 citizens and allies of Lacedæmon, make <lb/>
            known to you the state of things in that quarter; and it is <lb/>
            for you to consider whether they seem deserving of attention. <lb/>
            You ought, however, to feel assured, that the power which <lb/>
            we have represented as great, is not yet irresistible; for such <lb/>
            towns as have joined the community of the Olynthians against <lb/>
            their inclination, will, if they see any opposition, quickly revolt <lb/>
            from them. 19. But if they shall become more closely connected <lb/>
            with them by marriages and profitable intercourse, on which <lb/>
            they have decided, and shall find that it is advantageous to join <lb/>
            with the powerful, (as the Arcadians, when they take the field <lb/>
            with you, preserve what is their own, and seize what belongs <lb/>
            to others,) perhaps they will not be so easy to be detached."</p>
          <p>20. When this speech was concluded, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            conferred with their allies, and requested them to recommend <lb/>
            whatever they might respectively think best for the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesus and those in league with it. In consequence, a large <lb/>
            number of them, and especially such as wished to please the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, advised that they should assemble an army; <lb/>
            and it was accordingly resolved that each city should furnish <lb/>
            its complement to make up a force of ten thousand men. 21. <lb/>
            Suggestions were also offered that any of the cities that wished <lb/>
            might be allowed to furnish money instead of men, three oboli <lb/>
            of Ægina a day for each man ; that if any furnished cavalry, <lb/>
            the pay for each horse-soldier should be equivalent to that of <lb/>
            four heavy-armed foot; 22. and that if any one of the cities <lb/>
            failed in its part towards the army, the Lacedæmonians should <lb/>
            be empowered to fine it a stater a day for each man that was <lb/>
            wanting. 23. When these proposals were approved, the <lb/>
            Acanthians again rose up and said that " these were very ex­ <lb/>
            cellent resolutions, but could not be soon executed;" and" "it <lb/>
            would be better therefore," they added. " that, while this force <pb n="445"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            was being collected, some person should at once go out as <lb/>
            commander, and as large a force as coul 1 readily be sent with <lb/>
            him from Lacedæmon and the other cities ; for, if this should <lb/>
            be done, the towns which had not yet joined the Olynthians <lb/>
            would stand as they were, and those which had been forced <lb/>
            into union with them would yield them less support." 24. As <lb/>
            these suggestions were also well received, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            sent out Eudamidas, and with him a body of the newly-en­ <lb/>
            franchised citizens, and some of the perioeci1 and Sciritæ, to <lb/>
            the number of about two thousand in all. Eudamidas, how­ <lb/>
            ever, at his departure, requested of the ephori that his brother <lb/>
            Phœbidas might collect the rest of the troops appointed to <lb/>
            join him, and follow him with them. He himself, as soon as <lb/>
            he arrived on the coasts of Thrace, sent garrisons to such of <lb/>
            the cities as desired them, and brought over Potidæa, which <lb/>
            had already joined the Olynthians, with its own free consent. <lb/>
            From thence he afterwards made excursions, and conducted <lb/>
            the war as became a general with a small force.</p>
          <p>25. Phoebidas, as soon as the troops left by Eudamidas were <lb/>
            ready for him, put himself at their head and set forward. <lb/>
            When they reached Thebes, they encamped without the city <lb/>
            near the gymnasium. The Thebans were at this time divided <lb/>
            into parties, and Ismenias and Leontiades were generals-in- <lb/>
            chief, who were at variance with one another, and each at the <lb/>
            head of separate factions. Ismenias, from dislike to the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians, did not even visit Phœbidas, but Leontiades <lb/>
            paid him attention in various ways, and, when he had grown <lb/>
            familiar with him, spoke to him to this effect: 26. " It is in <lb/>
            your power, Phœbidas, to do, on this very day, the greatest <lb/>
            service to your country; for if you will but follow me with <lb/>
            your heavy-armed men, I will conduct you into the citadel; <lb/>
            and, when your establishment there is secured, you may be <lb/>
            convinced that Thebes will be entirely in the power of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and of our party who are your friends. 27. <lb/>
            A proclamation, as you know, has just been made,2 that none <lb/>
            of the Thebans shall go into the field with you against the <note type="footnote"> 1 The name periœci signifies those who dwelt around Sparta ; a <lb/>

            Olynthians; but if you only do what I propose, in concert <lb/>
            with us, we will immediately send with you a numerous body <lb/>
            of heavy-armed foot and another of horse; so that you will <lb/>
            support your brother with a powerful force, and, while he is <lb/>
            meditating the reduction of Olynthus, you will already have <lb/>
            become master of Thebes, a city far greater than Olynthus."</p>
          <p>28. Phcebidas, on hearing these suggestions, was highly <lb/>
            elated; for he was far more desirous of achieving something <lb/>
            great than even of life itself, but does not appear to have <lb/>
            been a man of great reasoning or depth of thought.1 As he <lb/>
            agreed to the proposal, Leontiades told him to put his troops <lb/>
            in motion, as if he had packed up his baggage to take his <lb/>
            departure; " and when the proper time is come," added he, <lb/>
            " I will join you, and will conduct you myself." 29. Whilst, <lb/>
            therefore, the senate was sitting in the portico in the forum, <lb/>
            because the women were celebrating the festival of Ceres in <lb/>
            the citadel;2 and whilst, as it was summer and noon-day, <lb/>
            there were very few persons in the streets, Leontiades rode <lb/>
            up to Phœbidas, made him turn back, and conducted him <lb/>
            without delay to the citadel.</p>
          <p>After having thus put Phcebidas and his party in possession <lb/>
            of the place, given him the key of the gates, and charged him <lb/>
            to let no one into the citadel but such as he himself sanc­ <lb/>
            tioned, he hastened away to the senate, and, having entered, <note type="footnote"> I By this remark on the character of Phcebidas, Xenophon en­ <lb/>
            deavours to remove all participation in this most treacherous deed <lb/>
            from the public councils of the Lacedæmonians. Diodorus Siculus, <lb/>
            on the other hand, (xv. 20,) says that the Spartans, dreading the <lb/>
            increasing power of the Thebans, and presaging as it were their <lb/>
            rising eminence, gave secret instructions to their generals that they <lb/>
            should embrace any opportunity that offered of seizing on the cita­ <lb/>
            del of Thebes. Plutarch unhesitatingly attributes the seizure of it <lb/>
            to the inveterate hatred of Agesilaus towards the Thebans ; * * * <lb/>
            and Agesilaus manifestly showed his feeling in the saying which <lb/>
            Xenophon attributes to him in sect. 32. See Plutarch, Agesil. c. 23. <lb/>
            Morus has also remarked that Diodorus imputes to the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians as a body that which he ought to have attributed to Agesilaus <lb/>
            alone. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Xenophon intimates that the senate would otherwise have been <lb/>
            sitting in the citadel. This festival was celebrated in the beginning <lb/>
            of November, with which time the expression in the text, " it was <lb/>
            summer," is at variance, unless, as Schneider suggests, there were <lb/>
            two festivals of the kind, one in spring, and the other in autumn. <lb/>

            said, so. " Be not concerned, senators, because the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians are in possession of the citadel; for they declare that <lb/>
            they come as enemies to no man who is not desirous of war. <lb/>
            For my part, I, by the law that permits a general-in-chief to <lb/>
            apprehend any one that appears to have been guilty of a <lb/>
            capital crime, apprehend Ismenias here, as a contriver of war. <lb/>
            You, officers of the army, and you who are commissioned to <lb/>
            act with them, arise, take him, and conduct him to the place <lb/>
            which has been appointed." 31. Those who were privy to <lb/>
            the matter, accordingly, stood forward, obeyed the directions <lb/>
            of Leontiades, and secured Ismenias; while, of those who <lb/>
            were strangers to the plot, and opposed to the faction of Leon­ <lb/>
            tiades, some fled at once out of the city, for fear of being put <lb/>
            to death; others retired at first to their homes, but when they <lb/>
            heard that Ismenias was a prisoner in the citadel, all who <lb/>
            were of the same party with Androcleides 1 and Ismenias, to <lb/>
            the number of about four hundred, went off to Athens.</p>
          <p>32. When this affair was concluded, they chose another2 <lb/>
            general-in-chief in the room of Ismenias, and Leontiades im­ <lb/>
            mediately afterwards set out to Lacedæmon, where he found <lb/>
            the ephori, and the body of the people, highly incensed with <lb/>
            Phœbidas, for having engaged in such an affair without orders <lb/>
            from the government. Agesilaus however observed, that "if <lb/>
            what he had done was to the hurt of Lacedæmon, he deserved <lb/>
            to be punished; but that if it was for its benefit, it was an <lb/>
            old rule that a man might do such a thing of his own accord. <lb/>
            This is the point, therefore," he added, " which we have to <lb/>
            consider, whether good or evil has been done." 33. Just at <lb/>
            this time Leontiades came before the council,3 and addressed <lb/>
            them thus: " How hostile the Thebans were to you, men of <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, before the present affair took place, you your­ <lb/>
            selves used to confess; for you saw that they were always <lb/>
            well disposed towards your enemies, and ill disposed towards <lb/>
            your friends. Did they not refuse to march with you against <lb/>
            the popular party at the Piræeus,4 who were most inimical to <lb/>
            you ? and did they not make war on the Phocians5 because <lb/>
            they knew that they were friendly towards you ? 34. When <lb/>
            they saw, too, that you were going to war with the Olyn- <note type="footnote">1 See iii. 5. 1. 2 Archias.

            thians, they immediately made an alliance with them; and <lb/>
            you were then always expecting the hour when you should <lb/>
            hear that they had brought all Bœotia under their sway. But <lb/>
            now, since our enterprise has succeeded, you have no longer <lb/>
            any reason to fear the Thebans; for a small scytale1 will be <lb/>
            sufficient to cause everything that you desire there to be done, <lb/>
            if you but pay as much regard to us as we show to you." <lb/>
            35. The Lacedæmonians, on hearing these representations, re­ <lb/>
            solved " to keep the citadel, as it had been seized ; and to <lb/>
            hold a court on the conduct of Ismenias." They accordingly <lb/>
            sent commissioners for the purpose, three from Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            and one from every city, small and great, in alliance with <lb/>
            Lacedæmon. When the court was assembled, it was laid to <lb/>
            the charge of Ismenias, that " he was a friend to the Barba­ <lb/>
            rians ; that he had become a guest-friend to the Persian for <lb/>
            no good to Greece; that he had received a share of the money <lb/>
            sent from the king; and that he and Androcleides were the <lb/>
            chief authors of all the disturbances in Greece." 36. He de­ <lb/>
            fended himself against every one of these charges, but could <lb/>
            not convince his judges that he had not been an ambitious2 <lb/>
            and mischievous character. He was accordingly condemned <lb/>
            and put to death; and the party of Leontiades continued to hold <lb/>
            Thebes, and endeavoured to serve the Lacedemonians even <lb/>
            further than was required of them.</p>
          <p>37. When these affairs were settled, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            hastened off the army against Olynthus with still more alacrity <lb/>
            than before. They sent out Teleutias as harmost; the peo­ <lb/>
            ple all contributed their complements to make up the ten <lb/>
            thousand troops; and the government sent scytalæ3 to the <lb/>
            cities in alliance, ordering them to support Teleutias accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the decree of the confederacy. Others, therefore, served <lb/>
            Teleutias with cheerfulness, (for lie seemed not likely to be <lb/>
            ungrateful to those who served him,) and the city4 of Thebes, <lb/>
            as he was the brother of Agesilaus, readily supplied him both <note type="footnote">1See note on Corn. Nep. Pause c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεγαλοπράγμων</foreign> TE <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κακοπράγμων</foreign>.] The former word signi' <lb/>

            with heavy-armed foot and cavalry, as. Teleutias, though <lb/>
            eager to proceed, did not make a hasty march, but studied to <lb/>
            advance in such a way as not to hurt the lands of the friendly <lb/>
            states, and to attach to himself as large reinforcements as <lb/>
            possible. He sent forward, also, messengers to Amyntas, 1 and <lb/>
            requested him to send him a body of mercenaries, and, if he wish­ <lb/>
            ed to recover his power, to distribute money among the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring princes to induce them to become his allies. He sent <lb/>
            also to Derdas, the prince of Elimia,2 to admonish him that as <lb/>
            the Olynthians had reduced the greater power of Macedonia, <lb/>
            they would not refrain from humbling a lesser power, unless <lb/>
            some force should put a stop to their presumption. 39. Acting <lb/>
            in this manner, he arrived with a large army at the territories <lb/>
            of his friends. When he reached Potidæa, he marshalled his <lb/>
            forces, and proceeded into the enemy's country. As he ap­ <lb/>
            proached towards Olynthus, he neither devastated the lands <lb/>
            by fire, nor cut down the trees, judging that, if he committed <lb/>
            such ravages, everything would be adverse to him both in <lb/>
            his advance and retreat ; but thinking that when he retired <lb/>
            from the city, it would then be well for him to cut down the <lb/>
            trees and throw them in the way of the enemy, if any of them <lb/>
            should pursue him.</p>
          <p>40. When he was somewhat less than ten stadia from the <lb/>
            city, he ordered his troops to halt under arms, occupying the <lb/>
            left wing himself, (and thus it happened that he advanced up <lb/>
            to the gate at which the enemy had gone out,) while the <lb/>
            other part of the allied forces extended away towards the <lb/>
            right. Of the cavalry, he posted the Lacedæmonians, The­ <lb/>
            bans, and as many of the Macedonians as he had, on the right; <lb/>
            Derdas and his cavalry, amounting to about four hundred, he <lb/>
            retained near himself, both because he admired that body of <lb/>
            horse, and because he wished to pay attention to Derdas, that <lb/>
            he might support him with alacrity. 41. When the enemy <lb/>
            had come forth, and ranged themselves under the wall, their <lb/>
            cavalry, forming in a close body, charged down upon the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians and Bœotians. Polycharmus, the commander of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian cavalry, they threw from his horse, and <note type="footnote"> 1 King of Macedonia. See sect. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In Macedonia, called both Elymæa and Elimia, as appears <lb/>

            gave him several wounds as he was lying on the ground; <lb/>
            others they killed; and at length put to flight the whole of <lb/>
            the cavalry on the left wing. As soon as the cavalry fled, <lb/>
            that part of the infantry which was nearest to them gave <lb/>
            way, and the whole army would have been in danger of being <lb/>
            routed, had not Derdas with his body of horse ridden up <lb/>
            straight to the gates of Olynthus. Teleutias and his own men <lb/>
            followed him in order. 42. But when the Olynthian cavalry <lb/>
            perceived these movements, they were afraid lest they should <lb/>
            be shut out of the city, and, wheeling round, retreated with <lb/>
            great speed. Here Derdas killed a vast number of their men <lb/>
            as they were riding past him ; and the infantry of the Olyn­ <lb/>
            thians then retired into the city, very few of them being killed, as <lb/>
            they were close to the wall. 43. After a trophy was erected, <lb/>
            and the victory was fairly secured by Teleutias, he proceeded <lb/>
            to cut down the trees as he retreated. And as he had spent <lb/>
            the summer in this campaign, he dismissed the Macedonian <lb/>
            troops and those of Derdas. But the Olynthians continued <lb/>
            to make frequent excursions against the towns in alliance with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, carrying off plunder, and killing many of <lb/>
            the inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Reverses of Teleutias; he is killed at Olynthus. Agesipolis is sent out in <lb/>
            his place by the Lacedæmonians, with a still greater force. The restored <lb/>
            exiles at Phlius being ill-treated by the government, make complaints to <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians ; Agesilaus besieges Phlius; his mode of incorporat­ <lb/>

            thus ; his death. Obstinate resistance of Delphion at Phlius; the place <lb/>
            is compelled to surrender by famine. Humanity of Agesilaus, to whom <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians leave the decision as to the treatment of Phlius. <lb/>
            Olynthus is received into alliance with Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>I. AT the very beginning of the next spring, the Olynthian <lb/>
            cavalry, which were about six hundred in number, had made <lb/>
            an excursion, one day about noon, against Apollonia, and <lb/>
            dispersing themselves through the country, began to plunder <lb/>
            it. But it chanced that Derdas, on the same day, had gone to <lb/>
            Apollonia with his cavalry, and was stopping there for refresh­ <pb n="451"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            ment. When he saw the advance of the enemy, he kept him­ <lb/>
            self quiet, with his horses in readiness for action, and the <lb/>
            riders under arms; and as the Olynthians rode up fearlessly <lb/>
            into the suburbs and to the very gates, he sallied forth with <lb/>
            his men in order of battle. The enemy no sooner saw him <lb/>
            than they took to flight. 2. Derdas, when he had once made <lb/>
            them turn their backs, did not cease from pursuing and <lb/>
            slaughtering them the distance of ninety stadia, until he drove <lb/>
            them to the very walls of Olynthus. Derdas was said to have <lb/>
            killed on this occasion not less than eighty horsemen. From <lb/>
            this time the enemy kept themselves more within their walls, <lb/>
            and cultivated but a very small portion of their lands.</p>
          <p>3. Some time after, when Teleutias was leading his force <lb/>
            towards the city of Olynthus, in order to cut down whatever <lb/>
            trees were left standing, and to lay waste whatever land had <lb/>
            been cultivated by the enemy, the Olynthian cavalry, having <lb/>
            come out of the place, marched quietly forward and crossed the <lb/>
            river that runs by the city, and then advanced silently towards <lb/>
            the adverse army. Teleutias observing them, and being pro­ <lb/>
            voked at their audacity, immediately ordered Tlemonides, the <lb/>
            captain of his peltasts, to rush down upon them at full speed; <lb/>
            4. and the Olynthians, when they saw the peltasts advancing <lb/>
            upon them, wheeled round, retreated at a quiet pace, and re­ <lb/>
            crossed the river. The peltasts followed them with great <lb/>
            intrepidity, and, supposing that they were in flight, crossed <lb/>
            the river to pursue 1 them. But the Olynthian cavalry, when <lb/>
            those who had crossed seemed to be in their power, faced <lb/>
            about and attacked them, and killed Tlemonides himself, and <lb/>
            more than a hundred of his men. a. Teleutias, seeing what <lb/>
            had happened, was fired with rage, and, seizing his arms, led <lb/>
            forward the heavy-armed men at a quick pace, ordering the <lb/>
            peltasts and the cavalry to follow, and to put forth their ut­ <lb/>
            most speed. A great portion of the other troops, having con­ <lb/>
            tinued the pursuit too close to the walls, 2 had found great <lb/>
            difficulty in retreating; and this latter party, being harassed <lb/>
            with missiles from the towers, were compelled to retire in <note type="footnote"> I The text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώξαντες</foreign>, but Schneider recommends that we <lb/>

            confusion, and to keep on their guard against the weapons <lb/>
            hurled against them. 6. In this state of things the Olyn­ <lb/>
            thians sent out their cavalry, whom their peltasts supported ; <lb/>
            the heavy-armed men sallied out at length, and all fell upon <lb/>
            the disordered troops of the enemy. Here Teleutias was killed <lb/>
            fighting, and, as soon as he fell, all about him gave way; no <lb/>
            one any longer made a stand, but the whole army fled, some <lb/>
            towards Spartolus, some to Acanthus, some to Apollonia, but <lb/>
            the greater number to Potidæa; and, as they thus fled in <lb/>
            different directions, the enemy pursued them in as many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ways, and cut off a vast number of men, and indeed <lb/>
            all the efficient portion of the army.</p>
          <p>7. By such calamities I consider that men are taught that <lb/>
            they ought not to inflict vengeance, even on their own domes­ <lb/>
            tics, in anger ; for masters, when angry, have often suffered <lb/>
            more harm than they have done; but to attack an enemy in <lb/>
            anger, and not with cool judgment, is an inexcusable fault; <lb/>
            since anger is thoughtless of consequences, but judgment has <lb/>
            no less care to avoid injury than to inflict it on an enemy.</p>
          <p>8. The Lacedæmonians, when they heard of this disaster, <lb/>
            judged, on deliberation, that they must send out a considerable <lb/>
            force to Olynthus, so that the spirits of the victors might be <lb/>
            repressed, and that what they had done might not prove use­ <lb/>
            less. Having come to this resolution, they despatched Agesi­ <lb/>
            polis the king, as general-in-chief, with a council of thirty <lb/>
            Spartans, the same number that had gone with Agesilaus into <lb/>
            Asia; 9. and many of the periœci, men of honour and re­ <lb/>
            spectability, followed him as volunteers, as well as many <lb/>
            strangers, of those called trophimi, 1 and illegitimate children <lb/>
            of the Spartans, persons of excellent appearance, and not un­ <lb/>
            acquainted with the honourable discipline of the state. Volun­ <lb/>
            teers also from the allied cities joined the army, as well as cavalry <lb/>
            from Thessaly, who wished to recommend themselves to the <lb/>
            notice of Agesipolis; and Amyntas and Derdas came with <lb/>
            more alacrity than before. Agesipolis, attending to all that <note type="footnote">1 They are the same, says Schneider, as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόθακες</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόθωνες</foreign>; <lb/>

            concerned the expedition,1 pursued his march towards Olyn­ <lb/>
            thus.</p>
          <p>to. The citizens of Phlius,2 who had been commended by <lb/>
            Agesipolis for having furnished large and prompt contribu­ <lb/>
            tions to his army, but who thought that, as Agesipolis was <lb/>
            abroad, Agesilaus would not be likely to attack them, (since <lb/>
            it was hardly probable that both kings would absent them­ <lb/>
            selves from Sparta at the same time,) haughtily refused jus­ <lb/>
            tice to the exiles that had lately returned. The exiles <lb/>
            entreated that disputed points might be settled by an impar­ <lb/>
            tial tribunal; but their opponents compelled them to submit <lb/>
            to such decisions as should be given in the city.3 When those <lb/>
            who had returned asked what justice could be expected <lb/>
            when the persons that had injured them were judges," the <lb/>
            others paid no attention to them. 11. The restored exiles, in <lb/>
            consequence, went to Lacedæmon to lay an accusation against <lb/>
            their city; and other people from Phlius went with them, and <lb/>
            stated that "the exiles were thought by many of the citizens <lb/>
            to be treated unjustly." The people of Phlius, being incensed <lb/>
            at these proceedings, imposed a fine on all those who had gone <lb/>
            to Lacedæmon without being commissioned by the govern­ <lb/>
            ment. 12. Those who were fined were therefore afraid to return <lb/>
            home, and, remaining at Sparta, represented that " the same <lb/>
            persons who were the authors of this violence, were also those <lb/>
            who had driven themselves into exile, and shut the gates4 <lb/>
            against the Lacedaemonians ; that the same persons had bought <lb/>
            their property, and sought by violent means to exempt them­ <lb/>
            selves from restoring it; and that the same persons had pro­ <lb/>
            cured a fine to be laid upon them for going to Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            in order that no one, in future, might venture to go thither to <lb/>
            report what was done at Phlius." 13. As the Phliasians, there­ <lb/>
            fore, appeared certainly to have been guilty of insolent oppres­ <lb/>
            sion, the ephori gave notice of an expedition against them. <lb/>
            This proceeding was not at all displeasing to Agesilaus; for <lb/>
            Podanemus and his adherents, who were among the exiles <lb/>
            that had then returned, had been guest-friends of his father; <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταυ̃τα πράττων</foreign>. ] Apparans ita expeditionem.

            sacrifices for crossing the borders being propitious,) but com­ <lb/>
            menced his march at once, several embassies met him and <lb/>
            offered him money not to enter their country. He replied <lb/>

            they would submit to whatever he imposed on them, and <lb/>
            entreated him not to invade their territories. His answer <lb/>
            was, that "he could not trust to their words, as they had al­ <lb/>
            ready acted deceitfully, but that he must have some positive <lb/>
            pledge of faith." Being asked what would be a sufficient <lb/>
            pledge, he replied, "that which you gave before, and were not <lb/>
            at all injured by us." This was, to deliver up their citadel. <lb/>
            16. But as they refused to do so, he marched into their conn­ <lb/>
            try, and soon formed a line of circumvallation, and laid siege <lb/>
            to their city. Many of the Lacedæmonians remarking, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that, " for the sake of a few, they were engaging in hos­ <lb/>
            tilities with a city of more than five thousand men," (for, that <lb/>
            this might be certainly believed, the Phliasians openly pro­ <lb/>
            claimed it to those without the walls,) Agesilaus devised a plan <lb/>
            to obviate the charge. it. Whenever any persons came out <lb/>
            of the city to him, as being friends or relatives of the exiles, <lb/>
            he instructed them to prepare their own tables, and to furnish <lb/>
            whatever was sufficient for the maintenance of as many as <lb/>
            wished to practise military exercises; he enjoined them also <lb/>
            to provide arms for them all, and not to hesitate at borrowing <lb/>
            money for these objects.1 They, complying with his wishes in <lb/>
            these respects, supplied him with more than a thousand men <lb/>
            in excellent condition of body, and well disciplined and armed ; <lb/>
            so that the Lacedæmonians at last acknowledged that it was <lb/>
            well for them to have such fellow-soldiers. Such was the <lb/>
            mode in which Agesilaus employed himself.</p>
          <p>18. Agesipolis, in the mean time, advancing straight through <lb/>
            Macedonia, brought up his forces before the walls of Olynthus. <lb/>
            But as none of the people came out against him, he laid waste <lb/>
            whatever in the Olynthian territory remained uninjured, and <lb/>
            proceeding against the towns in alliance with Olynthus, de- <note type="footnote">1 These instructions I suppose to have been given by Agesilaus, <lb/>

            stroyed their crops. Torone he attacked and took by storm. <lb/>
            19. But, while he was engaged in these occupations, in the <lb/>
            middle of summer, a burning fever seized him ; and, as he had <lb/>
            recently seen the temple of Bacchus at Aphytis, a longing <lb/>
            came over him for its shady bowers and limpid and cool <lb/>
            streams. He was therefore carried thither still alive, but, on <lb/>
            the seventh day after he fell sick, he expired without the verge <lb/>
            of the temple. Being put in honey, and conveyed home, he <lb/>
            was honoured with a royal interment.</p>
          <p>20. Agesilaus, on hearing of his death, was not rejoiced, as <lb/>
            might have been expected, because a rival was removed, but <lb/>
            shed tears, and mourned for the loss of his society. For the <lb/>
            two kings, when they are at Sparta, reside in the same house ; <lb/>
            and Agesipolis was well qualified to converse with Agesilaus <lb/>
            on topics such as young men talk of, or on hunting, or horse­ <lb/>
            manship, or subjects of amusement. He also paid him, in. <lb/>
            their intercourse, such respect as it became him to pay to his <lb/>
            senior. The Lacedæmonians sent out Polybiades in his room <lb/>
            as harmost to Olynthus.</p>
          <p>21. Agesilaus had now spent more time before Phlius, <lb/>
            than that for which it was said that there were provisions in <lb/>
            the place. But such a difference does control of the appetite <lb/>
            make, that the Phliasians, having determined to consume only <lb/>
            half as much corn as before, and having adhered to their de­ <lb/>
            termination, had sustained the siege twice as long as had been <lb/>
            expected. 22. So much does resolution, too, sometimes pre­ <lb/>
            vail over despondency, that a man named Delphion, who ap­ <lb/>
            pears to have been a person of note, was able, by attaching <lb/>
            to himself three hundred Phliasians, to repress such of the <lb/>
            people as wanted to make peace, and was able also to keep in <lb/>
            confinement such as he distrusted. He had influence enough, <lb/>
            besides, to force the common people to mount guard, and, by <lb/>
            going the rounds, to keep them steady at their posts. He <lb/>
            frequently sallied out, too, with his party, and drove off the <lb/>
            guards at different points along the lines of circumvallation. <lb/>
            23. But when this chosen body of men, after every possible <lb/>
            search, were able to find no more corn in the city, they then <lb/>
            sent to Agesilaus, and begged him to make a truce with them <lb/>
            for a deputation to go to Lacedasmon ; for they said that " they <lb/>
            had resolved to allow the government at Lacedæmon to do <lb/>
            with their city whatever they pleased." 24. Agesilaus, being <pb n="456"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            offended that they thus treated him personally as of no con­ <lb/>
            sideration, sent to his friends at home, and effected, by their <lb/>
            means, that the decision of affairs concerning Phlius should <lb/>
            be committed to himself. For the deputation he granted a <lb/>
            truce; and then kept a stricter guard round the place than <lb/>
            before, that none of the people in it might escape. Delphion, <lb/>
            however, and a branded slave with him, who stole many arms <lb/>
            from the besiegers, effected their escape by night. 25. But <lb/>
            when the messengers came from Lacedæmon, announcing that <lb/>
            the state permitted Agesilaus to settle matters at Phlius as he <lb/>
            pleased, he appointed that " fifty of the late exiles and fifty <lb/>
            of those who had stayed in the city, should in the first place <lb/>
            determine which of the people in the place deserved to live, <lb/>
            and which to die; and should then draw up a body of laws, <lb/>
            according to which they should conduct the government." <lb/>
            Until they should settle these points, he left a garrison in the <lb/>
            place and six months' pay for it. After making these arrange­ <lb/>
            ments, he dismissed the allies, and led his own troops home. <lb/>
            The transactions at Phlius were thus brought to an end in a <lb/>
            year and eight months.</p>
          <p>26. Polybiades had now obliged the Olynthians, who were <lb/>
            suffering grievously from famine, as they could neither get <lb/>
            provisions from the country, nor import them by sea, to send <lb/>
            deputies to Lacedæmon concerning peace. Deputies accord­ <lb/>
            ingly went with full powers, and entered into an engagement <lb/>
            that " they would have the same enemies and friends as the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians ; that they would follow wherever they led ; <lb/>
            and would be their allies." Having sworn to adhere to this <lb/>
            engagement, they returned home.</p>
          <p>27. Success having thus attended the Lacedæmonians, so <lb/>
            that the Thebans and other Bœotians were entirely under <lb/>
            their power; the Corinthians were become faithful adherents <lb/>
            to them; the Argives were humbled, as their allegation of <lb/>
            the months1 no longer availed them; the Athenians were left <lb/>
            unsupported; and their allies, who had been disaffected, were <lb/>
            chastised; their dominion seemed to be fully established in <lb/>

          <p>The Thebans rescue their citadel from the hands of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            who put to death their harmost for resigning it. Cleombrotus leads an <lb/>
            expedition against Thebes, but returns without attempting anything, <lb/>
            leaving Sphodrias as harmost at Thespiæ. The Thebans, to involve the <lb/>
            Athenians in the war, prevail on Sphodrias to make an incursion into <lb/>
            Attica. Sphodrias is brought to trial for having acted in the matter <lb/>
            without the consent of the Lacedæmonians, but is acquitted from regard <lb/>
            to his past services, or rather on the intercession of Archidamus the son <lb/>
            of Agesilaus. The Athenians are incited by the aggression of Sphodrias <lb/>
            to give more efficient support to the Bœotians, whom the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            again attack under the leadership of Agesilaus. Agesilaus, after little <lb/>
            success, leaves Phœbidas as harmost at Thespiae, who lays waste the The­ <lb/>
            bail territories, but is attacked by them and killed. Agesilaus commands <lb/>
            another expedition against Thebes with great success, marching up to the <lb/>
            very walls of the city. He quells discord at Thespiae. Two Theban tri­ <lb/>
            remes, sent out to bring corn, are captured by Aletas, a Lacedæmonian, <lb/>
            and carried to Oreus, but the crews contrive to escape with the vessels <lb/>
            and freight. Death of Agesilaus. Ill success of Cleombrotus against the <lb/>
            Thebans. The Lacedæmonians fit out a large fleet to cut off supplies <lb/>
            of corn from Athens, but are foiled by the Athenians under Chabrias. <lb/>
            The Athenians send out another fleet under Timotheus, who reduces <lb/>
            Corcyra; he is opposed, but unsuccessfully, by Nicolochus, the admiral <lb/>
            of the Lacedaemonians.</p>
          <p>1. MANY other proofs a writer might produce, from the <lb/>
            histories both of Greeks and Barbarians, that the gods do not <lb/>
            disregard those who conduct themselves impiously, or are <lb/>
            guilty of unjust actions; but I shall now speak only of the <lb/>
            subjects before me. The Lacedæmonians, who had sworn to <lb/>
            leave the cities independent, and who nevertheless took pos­ <lb/>
            session of the citadel of Thebes, were punished by that very <lb/>
            people, and that alone, who had been wronged by them, <lb/>
            though they had not previously been conquered1 by any na­ <lb/>
            tion whatever; and as to those citizens of Thebes who con­ <lb/>
            ducted the Lacedæmonians into the citadel, and wished their <lb/>
            city to be a slave to Sparta, in order that they themselves <lb/>
            might become tyrants, seven of the exiles, and no more, were <lb/>
            sufficient to overthrow their power. How this enterprise was <lb/>
            achieved, I will relate.</p>
          <p>2. There was a man named Phyllidas, who was secretary <note type="footnote">1 That is, as Morus observes, not so far conquered as to be brought <lb/>
            under the power of any other nation ; for in single battles, he adds, <lb/>
            they had often been conquered </note> <pb n="458"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            to Archias and the other polemarchs,1 and who had served <lb/>
            them in other matters, as it appears, very satisfactorily. He <lb/>
            having gone to Athens on some business Melon, one of the <lb/>
            Theban exiles that had fled to Athens, a person with whom <lb/>
            he was previously acquainted, chanced to meet him, and, <lb/>
            having questioned him about the power in the hands or <lb/>
            Archias the polemarch and Philippus,2 and perceived that he <lb/>
            disliked the state of things at home still more than himself, <lb/>
            he gave him pledges of faith, and received others from him, <lb/>
            and arranged with him how matters ought to be conducted. <lb/>
            3. Melon, in consequence, taking with hill six of the most <lb/>
            efficient of the exiles, armed with daggers and no other <lb/>
            weapon, proceeded, in the first place, to the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Thebes by night. Having passed the next day in some <lb/>
            unfrequented place, they went up to the gates, like men re­ <lb/>
            turning from the fields, at the time when the latest of the <lb/>
            labourers come in from their work. When they had thus <lb/>
            effected an entrance into the city, they passed that night at <lb/>
            the house of one Charon, with whom they also continued the <lb/>
            following day. 4. Phyllidas was then preparing other mat­ <lb/>
            ters for the polemarchs, as they were going to celebrate the <lb/>
            festival of Venus 3 at the expiration of their office, and, having <lb/>
            long promised to bring them some of the finest and fairest <lb/>
            women in Thebes, gave them notice that he would bring them <lb/>
            at that very time. The polemarchs, for such was their cha­ <lb/>
            racter, expected to pass the night with the greatest pleasure.</p>
          <p>5. When they had supped, and, by the zealous attentions of <lb/>
            - Phyllidas, had soon become intoxicated, and called on him <note type="footnote"> 1The same that are previously called Bœotarchs, iii. 4. 4, as the <lb/>

            Cornelius Nepos make no mention of this festival in their narrations <lb/>
            of the transaction. Schneider, with whom Weiske concurs, thinks <lb/>
            that Xenophon speaks of a festival of Venus only metaphorically, <lb/>
            signifying such a feast of rejoicing as men might make at the end <lb/>
            of any troublesome office or business, or at the termination of a <lb/>
            long voyage, and refers, in support of his notion, to Plutarch, Op. <lb/>
            Moral, ii. p. 795, 1095. But surely the mode in which Phyllidas <lb/>
            prepares for the celebration of the festival shows that a real feast <lb/>
            of Venus was intended. </note> <pb n="459"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            again and again to bring in the women, he went out and in.. <lb/>
            traduced Melon and his party, three of whom he had dressed <lb/>
            as mistresses, and the others as servants. 6. He conducted <lb/>
            them first into the steward's room attached to the polemarchs' <lb/>
            hall, and then went in and told Archias and the others that <lb/>
            " the women said they would not come in, if any of the <lb/>
            attendants remained in the apartment." In consequence, they <lb/>
            at once told all the attendants to go out, and Phyllidas, sup­ <lb/>
            plying them with wine, sent them away to drink it at one of <lb/>
            their own houses. He then introduced the pretended women, <lb/>
            and seated them each by a man, for the arrangement was, <lb/>
            that as soon as they were seated, they should immediately <lb/>
            unveil themselves and kill. Such is the mode in which some <lb/>
            say the polemarchs were put to death ; ethers relate that Me- <lb/>
            Ion and his party came in disguised as revellers, and so killed <lb/>
            the polemarchs.</p>
          <p>7. Phyllidas, taking three of the conspirators with him, went <lb/>
            off to the house of Leontiades, and, knocking at the door, <lb/>
            said that he wished to deliver a message from the polemarchs. <lb/>
            Leontiades happened to be still resting in retirement after <lb/>
            supper, and his wife was sitting by him spinning. Thinking <lb/>
            Phyllidas a trustworthy person, he gave orders that he might <lb/>
            be admitted ; and the conspirators, when they had thus se­ <lb/>
            cured an entrance, put Leontiades to death, frightened his <lb/>
            wife, and enjoined her to be silent. As they went out, they <lb/>
            ordered that the door should be kept shut, threatening that, <lb/>
            if they found it had been opened, they would kill every one <lb/>
            in the house. 8. This part of the business being executed, <lb/>
            Phyllidas took two of the men with him, and went to the <lb/>
            public prison, where he told the gaoler that " he had brought <lb/>
            him a man from the polemarchs whom he must keep in con­ <lb/>
            finement." When he opened the door, they immediately de­ <lb/>
            spatched him, and set free the prisoners, whom they soon <lb/>
            armed by taking weapons down from the portico, and, con­ <lb/>
            ducting them to the Ampheium,l told them to range them- <note type="footnote">1 The derivation of this word, says Dindorf, is unknown, but <lb/>

            that " all the Theban cavalry and infantry should come out, <lb/>
            as the tyrants were dead." The people of the city, however, <lb/>
            as long as night lasted, were distrustful, and made no stir ; <lb/>
            but when it was day, and what was done became known, both <lb/>
            infantry and cavalry came forth in arms to give them aid. <lb/>
            The exiles, too, who had returned, sent horsemen to their <lb/>
            friends who were waiting on the frontiers of Attica, and to <lb/>
            the two1 Athenian leaders who were with them. They, <lb/>
            knowing for what purpose they sent them,2 * * * *</p>
          <p>10. The Lacedæmonian harmost in the citadel, as soon as <lb/>

            once to Platææ and Thespiæ for aid. But the Theban ca­ <lb/>

            frontiers joined them, they made an assault upon the citadel. <lb/>
            11. As the garrison in the citadel were conscious of their weak­ <lb/>
            ness, and perceived the ardour of all their assailants, with the <lb/>
            great offers of reward to such as should first scale the wall, <lb/>
            they were greatly intimidated, and offered to quit the place, <lb/>
            if they would grant them their lives, and allow them to march <lb/>
            out under arms. This request they willingly granted, and <lb/>
            having made a truce, and taken oaths to observe the condi­ <lb/>
            tions, they allowed them to come out. 12. When they were <lb/>
            gone, they seized and put to death whomsoever they knew to <lb/>
            be of the number of their enemies.3 Some few, however, <lb/>
            were concealed and saved by the Athenians who had come to <lb/>
            the aid of the exiles from the frontiers. The Thebans took <lb/>
            even the children of the dead, as many as had children, and <lb/>
            put them to death.</p>
          <p>13. When the Lacedæmonians heard of these occurrences, <lb/>
            they put to death the harmost for quitting the citadel, when <lb/>
            he should have waited in it for aid, and gave notice of ar <note type="footnote"> I The two Athenian leaders of the exiles, who are said, sect. 19, <lb/>

            expedition against Thebes. Agesilaus, however, represented <lb/>
            that he was fifty-eight years old, and that "as it was not re­ <lb/>
            quired of others of that age to serve out of their own country, <lb/>
            so there was the same law for the kings;" and, by making <lb/>
            this representation, exempted himself from the expedition. <lb/>
            Yet it was not on account of his age that he stayed at home, <lb/>
            but from knowing that if he took the command, his country­ <lb/>
            men would say that " he gave trouble to the state with the <lb/>
            object of supporting tyrants." He allowed the government, <lb/>
            therefore, to make arrangements about the expedition just as <lb/>
            they pleased. 14. The ephori, accordingly, having received <lb/>
            information from those who had escaped after the massacre at <lb/>
            Thebes, sent out Cleombrotus, who then commanded for the <lb/>
            first time, in the very depth of winter. The road that led <lb/>
            by Eleutheræ Chabrias was guarding, with a body of Athenian <lb/>
            peltasts; and Cleombrotus in consequence went up by that <lb/>
            which leads to Platææ. His peltasts, who were in advance, <lb/>
            fell in, upon the hill, with the men who had been freed from <lb/>
            prison, and who were keeping guard there, in number about <lb/>
            a hundred and fifty, all of whom, except one or two that <lb/>
            may have escaped, they put to death. is. Cleombrotus then <lb/>
            marched down towards Platææ, which was still friendly to <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians; but when he came to Thespiæ, he went <lb/>
            off from thence to Cynoscephlæ,1 which was in the interest <lb/>
            of the Thebans, and encamped there. After continuing at <lb/>
            that place about sixteen days, he went back again to Thespiæ, <lb/>
            where he left Sphodrias as harmost, with a third part of each <lb/>
            body of troops from the allies, giving him also whatever <lb/>
            money he had brought from Sparta, and desiring him to hire <lb/>
            a body of mercenaries. These directions Sphodrias executed.</p>
          <p>16. Cleombrotus then led home the troops that remained <lb/>
            with him by the road through Creusis, the men being very <lb/>
            much in doubt whether there was war with the Thebans or <lb/>
            peace ; for he had led the army into the territory of Thebes. <lb/>
            but was going back after doing them as little damage as pos­ <lb/>
            sible. it. As he was on his way, a prodigious storm of wind <lb/>
            assailed him, which some thought an omen indicative of what <note type="footnote"> 1 Not, observes Schneider, the place of that name in Thessaly, <lb/>

            was going to happen; for among many remarkable effects <lb/>
            which it wrought, it hurled, as Cleombrotus with his troops <lb/>
            was crossing the hills reaching from Creusis to the sea, se­ <lb/>

            and blew a great many arms, snatched from the soldiers' <lb/>
            grasp, into the deep ; till at length numbers of the men, being <lb/>
            unable to proceed with all their equipments, left their shields <lb/>
            here and there upon the heights, turning them up and filling <lb/>
            them with stones. is. That night they supped, as well as <lb/>
            they could, at Ægosthena, in the territory of Megara, and the <lb/>
            next day they returned and fetched off their arms. Soon <lb/>
            after they went away to their several homes, for Cleom­ <lb/>
            brotus disbanded them.</p>
          <p>19. The Athenians, who saw how great the power of Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon was, and observed that there was no longer any war <lb/>
            at Corinth, but that the Lacedæmonians, having passed by <lb/>
            Attica, had made war upon Thebes, were so much alarmed <lb/>
            that they brought to trial the two generals who had been <lb/>
            privy to the insurrection of Melon against the party of Leon­ <lb/>
            tiades, one of whom they put to death; the other, as he did <lb/>
            not wait to stand his trial, they declared an exile.</p>
          <p>20. The Thebans, being also under apprehension, in case <lb/>
            none but themselves should continue at war with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, contrived the following scheme: they prevailed on <lb/>
            Sphodrias, the harmost at Thespiæ, by giving him, as was <lb/>
            suspected, a sum of money, to make an incursion into Attica, <lb/>
            in order to provoke the Athenians to take up arms against <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. Sphodrias, complying with their solicit­ <lb/>
            ations, and pretending that he would seize the Piræeus, as it <lb/>
            was not yet secured by gates, led out his force from Thespiæ, <lb/>
            after an early supper, and declared that he would make his <lb/>
            way to the Piræeus before day. 21. Day, however, came <lb/>
            upon him at Thrium, and he then took no care even to con­ <lb/>
            ceal what he had meditated, but, when he had to retreat, car­ <lb/>
            ried off the cattle and plundered the houses. Some persons <lb/>
            too, who had met him in the night, fled back to the city, and <lb/>
            told the Athenians that a large army was approaching. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly their cavalry and heavy-armed troops speedily <lb/>
            equipped themselves, and formed into a body to guard the <lb/>
            city. 22. Ambassadors from the Lacedæmonians also, Ety­ <lb/>
            mocles, Aristolochus. and Ocellus, happened then to be residing <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            at Athens, in the house of Callias the proxenus ; 1 whom the <lb/>
            Athenians, as soon as the attempt of Sphodrias was made <lb/>
            known, apprehended, and kept under guard, on suspicion that <lb/>
            they were promoters of the plot. The ambassadors were ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly alarmed at the occurrence, and represented, in their <lb/>
            defence, that " if they had been aware of a design to seize <lb/>
            the Piræeus, they would not have been so foolish as to put <lb/>
            themselves in the power of the Athenians in the city, and <lb/>
            especially in the house of the proxenus, where they might <lb/>
            be found in a moment." 23. They gave assurance, besides, <lb/>
            that " it should be made clear to the Athenians that the go­ <lb/>
            vernment of the Lacedæmonians had no knowledge of the <lb/>
            matter;" for they were certain," they added, "that the <lb/>
            Athenians would hear of Sphodrias being put to death by his <lb/>
            countrymen." They were accordingly considered to have had <lb/>
            no concern in the affair, and were set at liberty.</p>
          <p>24. The ephori recalled Sphodrias, and preferred a capital <lb/>
            charge against him. Sphodrias, however, was afraid of the <lb/>
            result, and would not appear. But, though he thus refused <lb/>
            to stand a trial, he was nevertheless acquitted. This matter <lb/>
            seemed to many to have been most iniquitously decided at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon. But the cause of the decision was as follows.</p>
          <p>25. Sphodrias had a son, named Cleonymus, of an age just <lb/>
            beyond boyhood, the most handsome and estimable of all of <lb/>
            the same years; and Archidamus, the son of Agesilaus, had <lb/>
            a fondness for him. The friends of Cleombrotus, who were <lb/>
            also intimates of Sphodrias, were inclined to have him ac­ <lb/>
            quitted, but were afraid of Agesilaus and his friends, and in­ <lb/>
            deed of all impartial persons ; for he had doubtless committed <lb/>
            an enormous offence. 26. But Sphodrias soon after said to <lb/>
            Cleonymus, " It is in your power, my son, to save your fa­ <lb/>
            ther's life, by entreating Archidamus to render Agesilaus <lb/>
            favourable to me on my trial." Cleonymus, on hearing this, <lb/>
            ventured to go to Archidamus, and begged him to be the <lb/>
            preserver of his father. 27. But Archidamus, though, when he <lb/>
            saw Cleonymus in tears, he stood by his side and wept with <lb/>
            him, yet, when he heard his request, replied, " Be assured, <lb/>
            Cleonymus, that I am not even able to look my father in the <lb/>
            face, but that, if I wish to effect any object in the city, I <lb/>
            solicit anybody else much sooner than my father; neverthe­ <lb/>
            less. as you make this request, be certain that I will use ray <note type="footnote"> See note on iv, 5. 6. </note> <pb n="464"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            warmest efforts that your desire may be accomplished." 28. <lb/>
            Returning home, then, from the common hall where they <lb/>
            were, he went to rest; and, rising early the next morning, <lb/>
            he was on the watch that his father might not go out unob­ <lb/>
            served by him. Yet when he saw him going out, he, in the <lb/>
            first place, if any of the citizens were by, allowed them to <lb/>
            talk with him, and then, if any strangers were there, he al­ <lb/>
            lowed them similar precedence ; and afterwards, if any of the <lb/>
            attendants wished to speak with him, he gave way to them. <lb/>
            In fine, even when Agesilaus came back from the Eurotas,1 <lb/>
            and entered the house, he went away without approaching <lb/>
            him. The next day he acted precisely in the same manner. <lb/>
            29. Agesilaus suspected why he came near him so often, yet <lb/>
            asked him no questions, but let him alone. Archidamus <lb/>
            was longing, as was natural, to see Cleonymus, but did <lb/>
            not know how he could appear before him, when he had not <lb/>
            spoken to his father about what he had requested of him. <lb/>
            Sphodrias and his friends, meanwhile, not seeing Archidamus <lb/>
            going to Cleonymus, though he used before to go to him fre­ <lb/>
            quently, felt fully persuaded that he had been chidden by Age­ <lb/>
            silaus. so. At last, however, Archidamus summoned courage <lb/>
            to go to Agesilaus, and to say, "Father, Cleonymus requests <lb/>
            me to beg yon to save his father, and I accordingly entreat <lb/>
            you to do so, if it be in your power." Agesilaus replied, " I <lb/>
            forgive you for making the request, but I do not see how I <lb/>
            shall obtain forgiveness from my country if I do not condemn <lb/>
            the man, as guilty, for what he has done to the detriment of <lb/>
            my country."2 31. Archidamus, on that occasion, made no <lb/>
            reply, but went away silenced by the justice of the remark ; <lb/>
            yet some time, afterwards, either from his own thought or <lb/>
            from being prompted by some one else, he came again to <lb/>
            Agesilaus, and said, " That you would have acquitted Spho­ <lb/>
            drias, father, if he had done nothing wrong, I am certain ; <lb/>
            and now, though he has done something wrong, let him obtain <note type="footnote"> 1 The narrative is here too brief, and in consequence obscure. <lb/>

            from you acquittal for my sake." Agesilaus answered, " It <lb/>
            shall be so, if it can be done with honour." His son, on <lb/>
            hearing this reply, went away in great despondency.</p>
          <p>32. One of the friends of Sphodrias, however, conversing <lb/>
            afterwards with Etymocles, observed, " All you, I suppose, <lb/>
            who are friends of Agesilaus, will be inclined to put Sphodrias <lb/>
            to death." "Then, by Jupiter," rejoined Etymocles, "we <lb/>
            shall not act in the same way as Agesilaus; 1 for he says, in­ <lb/>
            variably, to all with whom he converses on the matter, that <lb/>
            it is impossible not to admit that Sphodrias has done wrong ; <lb/>
            but that to put to death a man who, both as a boy, and a <lb/>
            youth, and a grown-up person, uniformly discharged his duties <lb/>
            with honour, would be a grievous hardship, for Sparta has <lb/>
            need of such soldiers." 33. Sphodrias' friend, on hearing this, <lb/>
            went and told it to Cleonymus, who, in great joy, hastened to <lb/>
            Archidamus, and said, " That you have a regard for us, we <lb/>
            are already aware; and be well assured, Archidamus, that we <lb/>
            will study to make it our care that you may never be ashamed <lb/>
            of your regard for us." Nor did he fail to keep his word; but <lb/>
            observed, as long as he lived, whatever is honourable at Sparta ; <lb/>
            and, as he was fighting at Leuctra before the king, in com­ <lb/>
            pany with Deinon one of the polemarchs, he, after falling <lb/>
            three times, met his death, first of all the Spartans, in the <lb/>
            midst of the enemy. His death grieved Archidamus to the <lb/>
            utmost, though, as he promised, he did not disgrace him, but <lb/>
            was rather an honour to him. By such means was it that <lb/>
            Sphodrias escaped condemnation.</p>
          <p>34. Of the Athenians, however, such as favoured the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, represented to the people that the Lacedæmonians had <lb/>
            not only not punished Sphodrias, but had even praised him, <lb/>
            for having formed a design upon Athens. In consequence, <lb/>
            the Athenians put gates to the Piræeus, built ships, and pre­ <lb/>
            pared to aid the Bœotians with all possible ardour. 35. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, on the other hand, called out their forces for <lb/>
            . another expedition against the Thebans, and, thinking that <lb/>
            Agesilaus would conduct it for them with more prudence than <lb/>
            Cleombrotus, begged him to take the command of the army. <lb/>
            He replied that " he would object to nothing that was ap- <note type="footnote">1 All editors, except Dindorf, give this interrogatively, " Must we <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [ B. V. </note> <lb/>
            proved by the state," and prepared to take the field. 36. But <lb/>
            as he knew that unless a force should secure Cithæron, it <lb/>
            would not be easy to penetrate to Thebes, and as he had <lb/>
            heard that the Cleitorians were at war with the Orchome­ <lb/>
            nians, and were maintaining a body of foreign troops, he made <lb/>
            an arrangement with them that their foreign troops should <lb/>
            join him, if he should need their services. 37. When the <lb/>
            sacrifices for crossing the borders were favourable, therefore, <lb/>
            he despatched a messenger, before he reached Tegea, to the <lb/>
            captain of the foreign troops in the service of the Cleitorians, <lb/>
            and, sending them a month's pay in advance, desired that they <lb/>
            should occupy Cithæron. To the Orchomenians he gave no­ <lb/>
            tice, also, that " they should abstain from hostilities as long as <lb/>
            his expedition lasted; and that if any state, while his force <lb/>
            was abroad, should make war on any other state, he would <lb/>
            march," he declared, "against the offending state first, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the resolution passed by the allies." 38. As soon as he <lb/>
            had passed over Cithæron, he advanced to Thespiæ, and, hast­ <lb/>
            ening from thence, entered the territory of the Thebans. But <lb/>
            finding the plains, and the most valuable parts of the country, <lb/>
            secured by a trench and palisading round them, lie shifted his <lb/>
            encampment from place to place, and, making excursions every <lb/>
            day after breakfast, laid waste the ground on his side of <lb/>
            the palisading and the trench ; for the enemy, on whatever <lb/>
            quarter Agesilaus showed himself, marched in that direction, <lb/>
            keeping still within the palisading, and resolved to defend it. <lb/>
            39. But on one occasion, as he was retreating to his camp, the <lb/>
            Theban cavalry, after keeping out of sight for a while, sallied <lb/>
            suddenly forth through the outlets made in the palisading, and <lb/>
            while the peltasts were going off to their suppers or getting <lb/>
            them ready, and the cavalry were either dismounting or <lb/>
            mounting again, galloped in among them, when they killed <lb/>
            several of the peltasts, and, of the cavalry, Clean and Epicy­ <lb/>
            elides, both Spartans, besides Eudicus, one of the periœci, and <lb/>
            some of the Theban exiles who had not yet mounted their <lb/>
            horses. 40. But when Agesilaus faced about with his heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops, and came to the rescue, and his cavalry rallied <lb/>
            and rode up to meet the cavalry of the enemy, while the <lb/>
            younger of the heavy-armed hurried forward with them, the <lb/>
            cavalry of the Thebans became like men who had drunk a <lb/>
            little too much in the heat of noon, for they made a stand, in- <pb n="467"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            deed, against their assailants, so far as to throw their spears, <lb/>
            but produced no effect with them, and at last, wheeling about <lb/>
            at that distance to retreat, twelve of them were slain. 41. <lb/>
            But as Agesilaus observed that it was always after breakfast <lb/>
            that the enemy showed themselves, he offered sacrifice one <lb/>
            morning at day-break, and, leading out his troops as speedily <lb/>
            as possible, entered the palisading by a part entirely unguarded ; <lb/>
            and then ravaged and burned the parts within up to the very <lb/>
            walls of the city. After having done this, he went back again <lb/>
            to Thespiæ, and fortified that city; and then, leaving Phœ­ <lb/>
            bidas harmost there, he passed over again to Megara,1 dismiss­ <lb/>
            ed the allies, and conducted the Spartan troops home.</p>
          <p>42. Soon afterwards, Phœbidas, sending out plundering <lb/>
            parties, ravaged and stripped the lands of the Thebans, and <lb/>
            annoyed their whole neighbourhood with incursions. The <lb/>
            Thebans, eager to have their revenge, marched with their <lb/>
            whole force into the territory of the Thespians ; but, while <lb/>
            they were in it, Phoebidas, hovering about them with his pel­ <lb/>
            tasts, allowed none of them anywhere to straggle from the <lb/>
            main body; so that the Thebans, greatly dissatisfied at the <lb/>
            success of their incursions, prepared for a precipitate retreat, <lb/>
            and the muleteers, throwing away the corn which they had <lb/>
            collected, rode off homewards ; so great a panic had seized on <lb/>
            the army. 43. Phœbidas, at that time, pressed boldly upon <lb/>
            them, keeping the peltasts about him, and ordering his heavy- <lb/>
            armed men to follow in order. He was in hopes of putting <lb/>
            the Thebans entirely to rout; for lie led forward resolutely, <lb/>
            and encouraged the rest of his men to grapple with the enemy, <lb/>
            calling on the Thespian heavy-armed, at the same time, to <lb/>
            follow closely behind. 44. But as the Theban cavalry in their <lb/>
            retreat came to an impassable wood, they first collected in a <lb/>
            close body, and then faced about from being at a loss where <lb/>
            they should attempt a passage. The peltasts in advance, who <lb/>
            were but few, felt alarmed, and took to flight; and the cavalry, <lb/>
            when they saw them doing so, were encouraged by their re­ <lb/>
            treat to attack them. 45. Here Phœbidas, and two or three <lb/>
            with him, were killed fighting; and the mercenaries, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence, took flight to a man, and when, in their retreat, <lb/>
            they encountered the heavy-armed Thespians, they also, though <note type="footnote"> 1 Briefly expressed for crossing over Cithæron and coming to <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            they had previously felt confident that they would never yield <lb/>
            to the Thebans, gave way, but were not pursued far, for it <lb/>
            was now late. Nor were many killed; but the Thespians did <lb/>
            not stop till they were within their own walls.</p>
          <p>46. After this occurrence the affairs of the Thebans assumed <lb/>
            new spirit, and they made attacks on Thespiæ and the other <lb/>
            neighbouring towns. The democratic parties, indeed, from <lb/>
            those places, had betaken themselves to Thebes; for oligar­ <lb/>
            chies, like that at Thebes, had been established in them all ; <lb/>
            so that the friends of the Lacedæmonians in them were greatly <lb/>
            in need of succour. After the death of Phœbidas, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians sent out one of the polemarchs, with a battalion, <lb/>
            by sea, and garrisoned Thespiæ with that force.</p>
          <p>47. When the next spring came on, the ephori again gave <lb/>
            notice of an expedition against Thebes, and solicited Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus, as before, to take the command of it. He, continuing of <lb/>
            the same opinion with regard to the mode of invasion, sent off <lb/>
            a messenger, before he offered sacrifices, to the commander at <lb/>
            Thespiæ, and told him to secure the heights above the road by <lb/>
            Mount Cithæron, and to keep guard there until he himself <lb/>
            should come up. 48. When he had passed that mountain, and <lb/>
            had arrived at Platææ, he pretended at first to be going back <lb/>
            again to Thespiæ, and, sending messengers thither, directed <lb/>
            that the people should prepare provisions for sale, and that all <lb/>
            deputations should wait for him there; so that the Thebans <lb/>
            strongly guarded the access to their city on the side of Thes­ <lb/>
            piæ; 49. but Agesilaus, sacrificing at day-break, directed his <lb/>
            march along the road to Erythræ, and accomplishing, at the <lb/>
            head of his forces, the march of two days in one, passed the <lb/>
            line of palisading near Scolus, before the Thebans could come <lb/>
            from their station at the place where he entered the previous <lb/>
            year. Having met with this success, he laid waste the coun­ <lb/>
            try to the eastward of Thebes as far as Tanagra, (for Hypa­ <lb/>
            todorus 1 and his party, who were friends to the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, still held Tanagra,) and then marched back, keeping <lb/>
            the walls of Thebes on his left. so. The Thebans however <lb/>
            came out against him, and drew up in order of battle at <lb/>
            Graosstethos, having the trench and palisading in their rear, <lb/>
            and thinking it advisable to hazard an engagement there, for <lb/>
            it was a rather narrow piece of ground, and difficult to be <note type="footnote"> He is nowhere else mentioned. </note> <pb n="469"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            crossed. But Agesilaus, seeing that such was the case, did <lb/>
            not advance against them, but, turning aside, directed his <lb/>
            course towards the city of Thebes. 51. The Thebans, fearing <lb/>
            for the city, as it was defenceless, left <unclear>the</unclear> place where they <lb/>
            were posted, and hurried off towards Thebes along the road <lb/>
            by Potniae, as being the safest. But it was thought to have <lb/>
            been an excellent stratagem in Agesilaus, that, by drawing <lb/>
            off to a distance from the enemy, he obliged them to quit their <lb/>
            ground with precipitation. 52. Some of the officers of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, at the head of their companies, made an attack <lb/>
            upon the Thebans as they were hurrying past them; but the <lb/>
            Thebans hurled missiles upon them from some eminences, and <lb/>
            Alypetus, one of the officers, was killed, being pierced through <lb/>
            with a spear. The Thebans however were forced to flee <lb/>
            from these eminences, and the Sciritæ 1 and some of the <lb/>
            cavalry rode up, and harassed their rear as they were making <lb/>
            off towards the city. 53. But the Thebans, when they drew <lb/>
            near the walls, faced about; and the Sciritæ, observing their <lb/>
            motions, retreated at a quick pace, and not a man of them was <lb/>
            killed. Yet the Thebans erected a trophy, because their as­ <lb/>
            sailants had retreated. 54. Agesilaus, as it was now time, <lb/>
            marched off and encamped in the place where he had found <lb/>
            the enemy drawn up; and the next day led his forces back to <lb/>
            Thespiæ. The peltasts in the pay of Thebes hung intrepidly <lb/>
            on his rear, and called out to Chabrias to reproach him for <lb/>
            not keeping up with them; when the Olynthian cavalry (for <lb/>
            they were now, according to the treaty, in the field with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians) wheeled round, and, in the course of pur­ <lb/>
            suit, drove them to a hill, and killed a great many of them ; <lb/>
            for foot-soldiers, going up a slope that horses can ascend, are <lb/>
            easily overtaken by cavalry.</p>
          <p>55. When Agesilaus came back to Thespiæ, he found the <lb/>
            people of that city divided into parties, and as those who pro­ <lb/>
            fessed attachment to the Lacedæmonians were for putting their <lb/>
            adversaries, among whom was Melon, to death, he would not <lb/>
            allow them to do so, but, having reconciled them, and obliged, <lb/>
            them to take an oath to continue at peace with each other, <lb/>
            he went back over Citlunron to Megara; from whence he <lb/>
            sent away the troops of the allies, and conducted the Spartan <lb/>
            forces home. <note type="footnote"> 1 c. 2. sect. 24. </note></p><pb n="470"/>

          <p>56. The Thebaus, who were now suffering from want at <lb/>
            corn, as they had had no produce from their land for the last two <lb/>
            years, sent people in two galleys to buy corn at Pagasæ, <lb/>
            giving them ten talents for the purpose. But Alcetas, a Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian, who was in garrison at Oreus,l proceeded, while <lb/>
            they were purchasing their corn, to man three galleys, taking <lb/>
            care that what he was doing should not be made known ; and <lb/>
            when the corn was being taken off, he seized both it and the <lb/>
            galleys, and made prisoners of the men on board, who were <lb/>
            not less than three hundred. These he confined in the citadel <lb/>
            at Oreus, where he himself had his quarters. 57. But as a <lb/>
            certain youth, a son of one of the people of Oreus, and, as they <lb/>
            reported, of a handsome and noble figure, used to follow Al­ <lb/>
            cetas, he would go down from the citadel and converse with <lb/>
            him; and the prisoners, observing this negligence of his, <lb/>
            made themselves masters of the citadel, when the town re­ <lb/>
            volted from the Lacedæmonians, and the Thebans brought off <lb/>
            their corn.</p>
          <p>58. When the spring came on, Agesilaus was confined to <lb/>
            his bed; for when he was leading home the army from <lb/>
            Thebes, and while he was at Megara, as he was going up from <lb/>
            the temple of Venus to the town hall, a vein, whatever vein <lb/>
            it was, burst in his body, and the blood flowed down from it <lb/>
            into his sound leg. As the leg was in consequence excessively <lb/>
            swollen, and the pain in it intolerable, a Syracusan surgeon <lb/>
            opened the vein at the ancle ; and when the blood once began <lb/>
            to flow, it continued running a whole night and day, and, <lb/>
            though they used every contrivance, they were unable to <lb/>
            stop it till he fainted, and then it ceased. In this condition <lb/>
            he was convened to Lacedæmon, and was ill the rest of the <lb/>
            summer and throughout the winter.</p>
          <p>59. The Lacedæmonians, however, as soon as spring ap­ <lb/>
            peared, called out their troops for an expedition, and desired <lb/>
            Cleombrotus to take the command of it. He accordingly led <lb/>
            out the troops, and when he drew near Mount Cithæron, his <lb/>
            peltasts advanced before him to secure the heights above the <lb/>
            pass ; when a party of Thebans and Athenians, who had pre­ <lb/>
            viously taken possession of the post, allowed them, for a while, <lb/>
            to prosecute their ascent, but, as soon as they came close upon <lb/>
            them, they started up, pursued, and killed about forty of them. <note type="footnote"> 1 A city of Eubœa previously called Histiæa. Schneider. </note> <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            After this had happened, Cleombrotus, thinking it impracti­ <lb/>
            cable to pass over into the territory of the Thebans, led back <lb/>
            the army and disbanded it.</p>
          <p>60. The allies having met at Lacedæmon, remarks wer <lb/>
            made among them that " their strength would be wasted In <lb/>
            the war for want of spirit; for that the Lacedæmonians might <lb/>
            man a far greater number of ships than the Athenians, and <lb/>
            reduce their city by famine ; and that they might, in the same <lb/>
            ships, carry over1 troops to attack Thebes, landing them, if <lb/>
            they thought proper, on the coast of Phocis, or, if they pre­ <lb/>
            ferred, at Creusis." 61. Taking these remarks into consider­ <lb/>
            ation, they manned a fleet of sixty vessels, and Pollis was <lb/>
            appointed admiral of it. Nor were those who recommended <lb/>
            this course disappointed, for the Athenians were quite blocked <lb/>
            up; their corn vessels had come as far as Geræstus,2 but from <lb/>
            thence they could not venture to sail, as the fleet of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians was hovering about Ægina, Ceos, and Andros. <lb/>
            But the people of Athens, feeling the necessity of doing some­ <lb/>
            thing, went on board their ships themselves, and coming, un­ <lb/>
            der the leadership of Chabrias, to an engagement with Pollis, <lb/>
            obtained a victory; and thus the corn was brought into <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>62. As the Lacedæmonians were preparing to carry over <lb/>
            their forces to attack the Bœotians, the Thebans requested the <lb/>
            Athenians to send an army round the Peloponnesus, thinking <lb/>
            that, if this should be done, it would be impossible for the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to guard their own coast, and the cities in <lb/>
            alliance with them in the neighbourhood, and to send over the <lb/>
            water, at the same time, a sufficient force to maintain the con­ <lb/>
            test with Thebes. 63. The Athenians, accordingly, who were <lb/>
            still full of resentment against the Lacedæmonians for the <lb/>
            affair of Sphodrias, cheerfully fitted out sixty ships, and sent <lb/>
            them round the Peloponnesus, making choice of Timotheus to <lb/>
            have the command of them. But as the enemy had not in­ <lb/>
            vaded the territory of Thebes, either while Cleombrotus had <lb/>
            the conduct of the army, or while Timotheus was sailing <lb/>
            round the coast, the Thebans boldly assailed the neighbouring <lb/>
            towns, and recovered them all. 64. Timotheus, during his <note type="footnote">1 Over the Corinthian Gulf. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See iii. 4. 4. It was a promontory of Eubœa, an island friendly <lb/>

            cruise, reduced, in a very short time, the island of Corcyra. <lb/>
            but did not make slaves of any of the people, or banish any, <lb/>
            or make any change in the laws; on which account he found <lb/>
            the towns in those parts the more favourable to him.</p>
          <p>65. The Lacedæmonians, on their part, also sent out a fleet, <lb/>
            with Nicoloclius, a man of great bravery, as commander of <lb/>
            it; who, when he caught sight of the fleet of Timotheus, <lb/>
            made no delay, although six vessels from Ambracia had not <lb/>
            yet joined him, but, with fifty-five ships of his own, came to <lb/>
            battle with sixty on the side of Timotheus. On this occasion <lb/>
            he was defeated, and Timotheus erected a trophy at Alyzia. <lb/>
            66. But while the ships of Timotheus were drawn on shore <lb/>
            and under repair, Nicolochus, as the six ships from Ambracia <lb/>
            had now come up, sailed to Alyzia, where Timotheus was, <lb/>
            and as Timotheus did not come out against him, erected a <lb/>
            trophy on the nearest islets. But Timotheus, after he had <lb/>
            refitted the ships which he had, and had manned some others <lb/>
            from Corcyra, became far superior in naval power, as his <lb/>
            vessels were in all more than seventy. However, he had to <lb/>
            send for money to Athens; for having a numerous fleet, he <lb/>
            needed large supplies.</p>

            Polydamas of Pharsalus solicits support from the Lacedæmonians against <lb/>

          <p>1. IN such affairs were the Athenians and Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            engaged. The Thebans, after they had reduced the towns in <lb/>
            Bœotia, made an incursion also into Phocis; and as the Pho­ <lb/>
            cians sent an embassy to Lacedæmon, representing that if the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            to submit to the Thebans, the Lacedæmonians, in consequence, <lb/>
            sent over the sea into Phocis their king, Cleombrotus, with <lb/>
            four battalions of their own forces, and the due complement <lb/>
            of troops from the allies.1</p>
          <p>2. Just at this time also Polydamas, a Pharsalian, came <lb/>
            from. Thessaly with some communications for the government <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians; a man who was held in great esteem <lb/>
            throughout Thessaly in general, and bore, in his own city of <lb/>
            Pharsalus, so noble and honourable a character, that the Pliar­ <lb/>
            salians, when divided into factions, committed their citadel to <lb/>
            his custody, and allowed him to receive the revenues, and to <lb/>
            expend on sacrifices, and other matters of public concern, <lb/>
            whatever was appointed by the laws; 3. and he, with this <lb/>
            money, guarded and preserved the citadel for them, managed <lb/>
            other affairs, and gave an account of his proceedings every <lb/>
            year. When he was in want of funds, he made up the defi­ <lb/>
            ciency from his own purse; and when he found a superfluity <lb/>
            of income, he repaid himself. He was besides, after the <lb/>
            fashion of Thessaly,2 hospitable and munificent. This man, <lb/>

            dressed me thus : 5. That I am able, Polydamas, to bring <lb/>
            your city under my power, even against its will, you may <lb/>
            judge from the following considerations: for I have,' he con­ <lb/>
            tinued, ‘ most of the strongest cities of Thessaly in alliance <lb/>
            with me; I subdued them, notwithstanding you took the field <lb/>
            in their behalf against me; and I have mercenary troops, <lb/>
            you are aware, to the number of six thousand, with whom, as <lb/>
            I think, no single city would easily be able to contend. An <lb/>
            equal number, indeed, might come against me from other <lb/>
            quarters; but the troops from the cities contain men that are <lb/>
            far advanced in age, and others not yet come to maturity; <lb/>
            and very few in each city exercise themselves sufficiently; <lb/>
            while no one receives pay from me who is not as able to sus­ <lb/>
            tain toil as I am.' 6. Jason himself, for I must tell you the <lb/>
            truth, 1 is of a very strong frame, as well as extremely fond <lb/>
            of exercise, and accordingly puts his men to the proof every <lb/>
            day; for he leads them out, under arms, in the places of ex­ <lb/>
            ercise, as well as on any warlike expedition ; and such of his <lb/>
            mercenaries as lie finds unequal to the toil, he discharges, but <lb/>
            such as he observes to be lovers of toil and danger in the field, <lb/>
            he distinguishes with double, triple, or quadruple pay, and <lb/>
            with other presents, as well as with attendance when they are <lb/>
            sick, and honours at their funerals; so that all his mercenaries <lb/>
            are well aware that valour in war will secure them a life of <lb/>
            the greatest honour and plenty.</p>
          <p>7. " He pointed out to me also, what I well knew, that the <lb/>
            Maracians,2 Dolopians, and Alcetas3 who rules over Epirus, <lb/>
            are already at his command. ‘ And what should I apprehend, <lb/>
            therefore,' said he, ‘ to make me suppose that I could not <lb/>
            easily reduce you Pharsalians ? Perhaps somebody who does <lb/>
            not know me may think with himself, And why then do you <lb/>

            to attach you to me with your own consent, than against your <lb/>
            will; for if you are brought under my power by compulsion, <lb/>
            you will be meditating what harm you can do me, and I shall <lb/>
            desire you to be in as weak a condition as possible; but if <lb/>
            you come over to me on persuasion, we shall doubtless seek to <lb/>
            strengthen one another to the utmost of our power.</p>
          <p>8. " ‘ I am well aware, Polydamas,' he continued, that your <lb/>
            native city looks up to you; and if you can induce it to be <lb/>
            friendly to me, I promise that I will make you the greatest <lb/>
            man in Greece next to myself. And of what power I offer <lb/>
            you the second share, listen while I state to you, and believe <lb/>
            nothing of what I say that does not appear credible to you on <lb/>
            reflection. It is plain, then, to both of us, that if Pharsalus, <lb/>
            and the towns dependent upon you, be united to me, I should <lb/>
            easily be made Tagos 1 of all the people of Thessaly; and it <lb/>
            is certain2 that when Thessaly is under one Tagos, cavalry <lb/>
            will be at his disposal to the number of six thousand, while <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops may be raised to the number of more <lb/>
            than ten thousand. 9. When I contemplate, too, the vigour <lb/>
            and spirit that will be in them, if any one heads them judi­ <lb/>
            ciously, I think that there is no nation to which the Thes­ <lb/>
            salians would willingly submit; and as Thessaly is a very <lb/>
            extensive country, all the nations around must yield to it, <lb/>
            when once a Tagos is established over it; and all the people <lb/>
            in these parts are skilled in the use of the spear, so that our <lb/>
            forces, it is likely, will be superior in the number of peltasts. <lb/>
            10. The Bœotians, moreover, and all the people of Greece <lb/>
            that are hostile to the Lacedæmonians, are my allies,3 and <lb/>
            profess themselves, accordingly, quite ready to follow me, if I <lb/>
            but free them from the yoke of the Lacedæmonians. The <lb/>
            Athenians, I am certain, would do anything to become our <lb/>
            allies; but I believe that I shall not form any friendship with <lb/>
            them; for I think that I may gain power by sea still more <note type="footnote"> 1 The title by which the Thessalians distinguished their com­ <lb/>

            easily than power by land. 11. Whether I reason rightly on <lb/>
            this point,' he continued, ‘ look to the following considerations: <lb/>
            When we are in possession of Macedonia, from whence the <lb/>
            Athenians bring their timber, we shall be able to build a much <lb/>
            larger number of ships than they; and as to furnishing these <lb/>
            ships with men, whether is it likely that the Athenians or <lb/>
            ourselves will be better able to do so, when we have such a <lb/>
            multitude of slaves ? To maintain sailors, too, whether is it <lb/>
            probable that we shall be in better condition, who, from our <lb/>
            abundance, send out corn to other people, or the Athenians <lb/>
            who have not sufficient even for themselves, unless they buy <lb/>
            it ? 12. In regard to money, we must certainly have a larger <lb/>
            supply, as we have not to look to little islands1 for it, but can <lb/>
            exact supplies from nations on a large continent; for all the <lb/>
            surrounding people have to pay tribute, when the government <lb/>
            of Thessaly is in the hands of a Tagos. The king of the <lb/>
            Persians, you know, collects his tribute, not from islands, but <lb/>
            from the continent, and is the richest of men ; and I think it <lb/>
            more easy to render that monarch submissive to me than <lb/>
            Greece; for I know that all the people in his dominions, ex­ <lb/>
            cept one, are more inclined to slavery than to resistance; and <lb/>
            I know by how small a force, such as that which went up <lb/>
            with Cyrus, and that under Agesilaus, the king of Persia was <lb/>
            placed in the greatest danger.'</p>
          <p>13. "When, after he had made these observations, I replied <lb/>
            that what he said as to other matters was reasonable enough, <lb/>
            but that we, who are friends to the Lacedæmonians, should go <lb/>
            over to their enemies, without having anything to lay to their <lb/>
            charge, seemed to me impossible. He commended my plain­ <lb/>
            ness of speech, and, saying that he should now strive still <lb/>
            more to attach me to him, since I was a man of such a cha­ <lb/>
            racter, gave me leave to come hither and acquaint you with <lb/>
            the true state of things, and that he intends to make war on <lb/>
            the Pharsalians, if we do not comply with his wishes. He <lb/>
            told me also to ask assistance from you, ‘ and if they be will- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νησύδρια</foreign>.] He speaks contemptuously of them as little islands <lb/>
            from which much is not to be expected. Yet from these tributary <lb/>

            public expenses ; and even many private persons seem to have put <lb/>
            their money out to use in the islands. See De Rep. Athen. 2. 16 <lb/>

            ing to grant it,' said he, ‘ so that you can induce them to send <lb/>
            you sufficient aid to make war with me, let us submit to what­ <lb/>
            ever may be the result of war; but if they prove themselves <lb/>
            unwilling to assist you sufficiently, you will not justly be free <lb/>
            from blame in the opinion of your country, which now hon­ <lb/>
            ours you, and in which you enjoy the greatest advantages.'</p>
          <p>14. " It is about this affair that I come to you, and I give <lb/>
            you an account of all that I have seen in those parts, and of <lb/>
            all that I heard from Jason. The matter, as I think, stands <lb/>
            thus: that if you, men of Lacedæmon, will send thither a <lb/>
            force which may appear sufficient, not only to me, but to the <lb/>
            other Thessalians, to maintain a war with Jason, the cities <lb/>
            will detach themselves from him, for they all dread the extent <lb/>
            to which the power of the man may advance ; but if you <lb/>
            think that a body of the newly-enfranchised citizens, and an <lb/>
            ordinary commander, 1 will suffice, I advise you to remain <lb/>
            quiet; is. for be assured that it will be a struggle against a <lb/>
            vast force, and against a man of such skill as a commander, <lb/>
            that whatever he attempts, either by secret machinations, or <lb/>
            in anticipation of the schemes of others, or by open force, he <lb/>
            is by no means likely to fail. He is able to take advantage <lb/>
            of the night as well as of the day; and, when he is hurried, <lb/>
            can attend to business while he takes his dinner or supper. <lb/>
            Rest he thinks he ought to take only when he has arrived at the <lb/>
            place to which he was going, or has accomplished the object <lb/>
            which he had in view ; and he has accustomed all about him to <lb/>
            act like himself. When his troops, by great exertion, have <lb/>
            gained any important success, he knows how to gratify them, <lb/>
            so that all who serve under him have learned that pleasures <lb/>
            are the fruit of labour. 16. As to sensual gratifications, he is <lb/>
            the most temperate of all men that I know ; nor does he ever <lb/>
            lose time, under their influence, so as not to be able to do <lb/>
            whatever is necessary. Consider, therefore, of these matters, <lb/>
            and tell me, as becomes you, what you will be able, and what <lb/>
            you propose, to do."</p>
          <p>17. Such was the statement of Polydamas. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians deferred giving an answer on that day, and on the <lb/>
            next, and the third day, they calculated how many battalions <lb/>
            they had abroad, and how many galleys round Lacedæmon to <note type="footnote"> I "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανδρα ἰδιώότην</foreign>.] Ducem unum de multis. Schneider-</note> <pb n="478"/>

            oppose to those sent out from Athens, and to maintain the <lb/>

            in the best manner that he could." is. After commending, <lb/>
            therefore, the sincerity of the Lacedæmonians, he returned <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>He then entreated Jason not to oblige him to deliver up <lb/>
            the citadel of Pharsalus, so that he might preserve it in safety <lb/>
            for those who had intrusted it to him. He gave his own sons <lb/>
            also to Jason as hostages, promising to make the city, by per­ <lb/>
            suasion, a willing ally to him, and to aid in procuring his <lb/>
            election as Tagos. When they had accordingly exchanged <lb/>
            pledges with one another, the Pharsalians were at once in <lb/>
            the enjoyment of peace, and Jason was soon appointed indis­ <lb/>
            putably Tagos of Thessaly. 19. As soon as he was invested <lb/>
            with this office, he settled what number of cavalry, and of <lb/>
            heavy-armed infantry, each city should, according to its re­ <lb/>
            sources, furnish. Thus there were raised for him cavalry, in­ <lb/>
            cluding that of the allies, to the number of more than eight <lb/>
            thousand; his heavy-armed foot were computed at riot less <lb/>
            than twenty thousand; and his peltasts were enough to op­ <lb/>
            pose any people whatever; for it would be a labour even to <lb/>
            number the towns that supplied them.</p>
          <p>Such was the way in which this matter terminated. I shall <lb/>

            affairs of Jason.</p><pb n="479"/>

          <p>The Athenians, seeing the power of the Thebans increased, and their own <lb/>
            diminished, make peace with the Lacedæmonians, and recall Timotheus, <lb/>
            who, however, in his voyage homeward, re-establishes certain exiles at <lb/>
            Zacynthus, and thus gives rise to a renewal of hostilities. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians send out a large fleet under Mnasippus to wrest Corcyra from the <lb/>
            Athenians, who despatch Iphicrates to its relief. Before his arrival, the <lb/>
            Corcyræans make a sally on the Lacedæmonians, many of whom, with <lb/>
            Mnasippus, are killed, and the rest seek refuge at Leucas. Praise of <lb/>
            Iphicrates and his discipline. He captures ten vessels sent to Corcyra by <lb/>
            Dionysius of Syracuse, and meditates an invasion of Laconia.</p>
          <p>1. THE Lacedæmonians and their allies were now assembled <lb/>
            to support the Phocians ; 1 and the Thebans, returning to their <lb/>
            own country, kept guard at the passes. The Athenians, <lb/>
            meanwhile, seeing that the Thebans, though they had been <lb/>
            strengthened by their means, contributed nothing to the sup­ <lb/>
            port of their fleet,2 while they themselves were exhausted by <lb/>
            raising money, by piratical attacks from Ægina,3 and by <lb/>
            maintaining the defences of their own country, grew desirous <lb/>
            of bringing the war to an end, and, sending ambassadors to <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, concluded a peace for themselves.</p>
          <p>2. Two of those ambassadors immediately sailed from Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon, according to the appointment of their countrymen, <lb/>
            and told Timotheus to return home, as there was now peace. <lb/>
            Timotheus, on his voyage, landed the exiles from Zacynthus4 <lb/>
            on the shores of their own island. 3. But as the people of <lb/>
            Zacynthus sent to the Lacedæmonians, and acquainted them <lb/>

            immediately came to a resolution that " the Athenians had <lb/>
            committed injustice, 'and, preparing again to send out a fleet, <lb/>
            collected vessels to the number of sixty from Lacedæmon <lb/>
            itself, from Corinth, Leucas, Ambracia, Elis, Zacynthus, <lb/>
            Achaia, Epidaurus, Trcezen, Hermion, and the Halians.1 4. <lb/>
            Appointing Mnasippus admiral, they instructed him to attend <lb/>
            to affairs in that sea2 in general, and to make an attempt <lb/>
            upon Corcyra. They sent also to Dionysius,3 respresenting <lb/>
            that it was for his interest that Corcyra should not be in the <lb/>
            power of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>5. Mnasippus, when his fleet was collected, set sail for Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra. He had with him, in addition to the troops from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, a body of mercenaries to the amount of not less <lb/>
            than fifteen hundred. 6. When he landed on the island, he <lb/>
            at once became master of it, and laid waste the country, which <lb/>
            was excellently cultivated and planted, and exhibited, through­ <lb/>
            out the fields, fine houses and well constructed wine-vaults ; 4 <lb/>
            so that the soldiers, they said, arrived at such a height of <lb/>
            luxury, that they would drink no wine but such as was of a <lb/>
            fragrant odour. Slaves and cattle in great numbers were <lb/>
            carried off from the fields. 7. At length be encamped with <lb/>
            his land forces on a hill, distant about five stadia from the <lb/>
            city, and overlooking the country, so that if any of the Cor­ <lb/>
            cyræans should come out into the fields, he might cut off their <lb/>
            retreat; his ships he stationed on the opposite side of the city, <lb/>
            at a point where he thought that they would observe and stop <lb/>
            whatever vessels might approach the coast. In addition to <lb/>
            these arrangements, he anchored galleys, when foul weather <lb/>
            did not prevent, in front of the harbour. Thus he kept the <lb/>
            city in a state of blockade.</p>
          <p>8. As the Corcyræans, in consequence, could get no supplies <lb/>
            from their grounds, since they were overpowered by land, <lb/>
            while nothing could be brought them by sea, because they <lb/>
            were inferior in naval force, they suffered greatly from want <lb/>
            of provisions, and, sending to the Athenians, entreated aid of <note type="footnote">1 The people of an obscure town on the coast of Laconia. Weiske. <lb/>

            them, and represented that " they would lose a very valuable <lb/>
            possession if they should be deprived of Corcyra, and would <lb/>
            greatly increase, at the same time, the strength of their ene­ <lb/>
            mies ; for that from no state in Greece, except Athens, could <lb/>
            more ships or money be raised;" they added, also, that <lb/>
            " the island of Corcyra was favourably situated with regard <lb/>
            to the Gulf of Corinth, and the cities lying upon it, and <lb/>
            favourably, too, for ravaging the territory of Laconia, but <lb/>
            most favourably of all with reference to the opposite conti­ <lb/>
            nent, and the passage from Sicily to the Peloponnesus." 10 <lb/>
            The Athenians, on hearing these representations, were of <lb/>
            opinion that they must pay careful attention to the matter, <lb/>
            and sent out Stesicles, as general, with six hundred peltasts, <lb/>
            requesting Alcetas to assist in conveying 2 them over the <lb/>
            water. 11. These troops were accordingly landed some­ <lb/>
            where on the coast by night, and made their way into the <lb/>
            city of Corcyra.</p>
          <p>The Athenians also resolved to man sixty additional ships, <lb/>
            and elected Timothcus as commander of them. 12. Timotheus, <lb/>
            not being able to man these vessels at home, sailed about to <lb/>
            the different islands, and endeavoured to complete his crews <lb/>
            from thence; thinking it would be no light matter to sail <lb/>
            round 3 without due preparation against ships so well dis­ <lb/>
            ciplined as those of the enemy. 13. But the Athenians, <lb/>
            imagining that he was wasting the whole of the season suit­ <lb/>
            able for the expedition, had no patience with him, and, de­ <lb/>
            priving him of his command, appointed Iphicrates in his room. <lb/>
            14. Iphicrates, as soon as he was made commander, manned <lb/>
            his vessels with the utmost expedition, and obliged the trier­ <lb/>
            archs 4 to exert themselves. He took from the Athenians, <lb/>
            also, whatever ships were on the coast of Attica, as well as <lb/>
            the Paralus and Salaminian ships,5 observing that " if affairs <note type="footnote"> 1 The same argument, observes Morus, is used in Thucydides, <lb/>

            of ships." His fleet amounted in all to about seventy.</p>
          <p>is. During this time the people of Corcyra were so griev­ <lb/>
            ously oppressed with famine, that, in consequence of the num­ <lb/>
            ber of deserters, Mnasippus made proclamation that “ all <lb/>
            deserters for the future should be sold as slaves." But when <lb/>
            they continued to desert nevertheless, he at last scourged <lb/>
            them, and sent them back. The people in the city, however, <lb/>
            refused to receive any slaves into the town, and many, in <lb/>
            consequence, perished without the walls. 16. Mnasippus, ob­ <lb/>
            serving this, imagined that he was all but in possession of the <lb/>
            city, and began to make new arrangements as to his mercen­ <lb/>
            aries, some of whom he dismissed from his service, while to <lb/>
            those who remained he continued in debt two months’ pay, <lb/>
            though not, as it was said, for want of money, for the greater <lb/>
            number of the towns, in consequence of the expedition being <lb/>
            over the sea, had sent him money instead of men. 17. But as <lb/>
            the people in the city observed from their towers that the <lb/>
            lines of the enemy were guarded with less strictness than be­ <lb/>
            fore, and that the men were straggling over the country, they <lb/>
            made a sally upon them, and took some of them prisoners and <lb/>
            killed some. is. Mnasippus, perceiving what had happened, <lb/>
            armed himself, and hastened, with all the heavy-armed troops <lb/>
            that he had, to the succour of his men, ordering also the cap­ <lb/>
            tains and centurions to lead out the mercenaries. 19. Some <lb/>
            of the captains observing that " it was not easy for those to <lb/>
            have their men obedient who gave them no subsistence," he <lb/>
            struck one of them with his staff, and another with the handle <lb/>
            of his spear. Thus they all came out without spirit, and <lb/>
            with feelings of hatred towards their general ; a state of mind <lb/>
            by no means favourable for fighting. 20. However, when he <lb/>
            had drawn up his force, he put to flight those of the enemy <lb/>
            that were near the gates of the city, and pressed forward in <lb/>
            pursuit of them ; but the pursued, when they were close to <lb/>
            the wall, faced about, and hurled stones and darts at him from <lb/>
            the tombs ; while others, sallying forth from the other gates, <lb/>
            fell, in a dense body, upon the extremity of his line. 21. Mna­ <lb/>
            sippus's men there, being formed but eight deep, and think­ <lb/>
            in- their wing too weak, endeavoured to wheel round, but <lb/>
            when they began to withdraw from their position, the enemy <lb/>
            rushed upon them as if they were going to flee, when they <pb n="483"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            themselves no longer attempted to turn, and those that were <lb/>
            nearest to them took to flight. 22. Mnasippus, at the same <lb/>
            time, was unable to support the party that were in difficulties, <lb/>
            as the enemy were pressing upon him in front, and he was <lb/>
            continually left with fewer and fewer men. At last the ene­ <lb/>
            my, collecting in a body, made a general attack upon those <lb/>
            remaining with Mnasippus, now reduced to a very small <lb/>
            number indeed; while the people from the city, observing <lb/>
            how things stood, sallied forth, and, after killing Mnasippus, <lb/>
            joined in a general pursuit. 23. The pursuers would proba­ <lb/>
            bly have taken the camp and entrenchment, had they not ob­ <lb/>
            served the crowd in the market, and that of the servants and <lb/>
            slaves, and, imagining it an efficient body of defenders, re­ <lb/>
            traced their steps. 24. The Corcyræans however erected a <lb/>
            trophy, and restored the dead under a truce.</p>
          <p>After this affair, the people in the city grew bolder, while <lb/>
            those without were in extreme dejection ; for it was said that <lb/>
            Iphicrates was almost at hand ; and the Corcyræans actually <lb/>
            proceeded to fit out their vessels. 25. But Hypermenes, who <lb/>
            had been second in command to Mnasippus, manned all the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian ships that were there, and, sailing round to the <lb/>
            encampment, loaded them every one with slaves and other <lb/>
            effects, and sent them off. 26. He himself, with the marines, and <lb/>
            such of the other soldiers as survived, stayed to guard the en­ <lb/>
            trenchment, but at last these also got on board, in the utmost <lb/>
            disorder, and sailed away, leaving behind them a great quan­ <lb/>
            tity of corn and wine, and a number of slaves and sick per­ <lb/>
            sons ; for they were extremely afraid that they would be <lb/>
            surprised in the island by the Athenians. However, they ar­ <lb/>
            rived in safety at Leucas.</p>
          <p>27. Iphicrates, as soon as he commenced his voyage, con­ <lb/>
            tinued, while he pursued his way, to prepare everything <lb/>
            necessary for an engagement. He left his large sails 1 at <lb/>
            home at starting, as standing out for a battle, and of his other <lb/>
            sails, 1 even if the wind was favourable, he made little use; <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ μεγάλα ἱστία</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">το</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς άκατίοις</foreign>.] How these two kinds of sails <lb/>
            are to be distinguished, the commentators find it hopeless to dis­ <lb/>
            cover. Schneider, referring to Hesychius and others, makes them <lb/>
            identical, but it is plain that Xenophon, if the text be correct, op­ <lb/>
            poses one to the other. Yet, as it is generally understood that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άκατίον</foreign> is a large sail, Weiske ingeniously conjectures that we <lb/>
            should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μὲν ἂλλα ἱστία</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <pb n="484"/>

            but, making his passage with the oar, caused his men, by that <lb/>
            means, to keep themselves in better condition, and his ship3 <lb/>
            to pursue their course better.1 28. Frequently, too, wherever <lb/>
            the crews were going to dine or sup, he would draw off one <lb/>
            extremity of the fleet to a distance from the land over against <lb/>
            the place, and, when he had turned about, and ranged his <lb/>
            vessels in a line with their prows towards it, would start <lb/>
            them, at a signal, to race against each other to the shore; <lb/>
            when it was a great advantage for such as could first take <lb/>
            their water, and whatever else they needed, and first finish <lb/>
            their meal; while, to such as came last, it was a great pun­ <lb/>
            ishment to have the disadvantage in all these respects, since <lb/>
            they were all obliged to put out to sea again when he gave the <lb/>
            signal; for it was the fortune of those that landed first to do <lb/>
            everything at their leisure, but of those that were last, to do <lb/>
            all with hurry. 29. If he landed to take a meal in the ene­ <lb/>
            my's country, he not only posted sentinels, as was proper, on <lb/>
            the shore, but also, raising the masts in his ships, kept a look- <lb/>
            out from thence. The men stationed on the masts, indeed, <lb/>
            saw much farther than those on the level ground, as they <lb/>
            looked down from a higher position. Wherever he supped or <lb/>
            slept, he kindled no fire in the camp at night, but kept a light <lb/>
            burning in front of the encampment, that no one might ap­ <lb/>
            proach undiscovered. Often, moreover, if the weather was <lb/>
            calm, he would resume his voyage as soon as supper was <lb/>
            over; and, if a breeze propelled the vessels, the men reposed <lb/>
            as they ran on, but, if it was necessary to use the oar, he made <lb/>
            them take rest by turns. so. In his course by day, he would <lb/>
            sometimes, at given signals, lead his ships in a line behind <lb/>
            one another, and sometimes in a body side by side; so that, <lb/>
            while they pursued their voyage, they practised and acquired <lb/>
            whatever was necessary for naval warfare, and thus arrived <lb/>
            at the sea which they believed to be occupied by the enemy. <lb/>
            They dined and supped, for the most part, on the enemy's ter­ <lb/>
            ritory ; but, as they did nothing more there than what was <lb/>
            necessary, Iphicrates escaped all attacks by the suddenness <lb/>
            with which he resumed his voyage, which he soon accom­ <lb/>
            plished. 31. About the time of Mnasippus's death he was at <note type="footnote"> 1 "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμεινον</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>.] In consequence of the rowers being well ex­ <lb/>

            the Sphagiæ1 in Laconia. Advancing thence to the coast of <lb/>
            Elis, and sailing past the mouth of the Alpheius, he came to <lb/>
            anchor at the promontory called Icthys. Next day he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded from thence to Cephallenia, with his fleet so arranged, <lb/>
            and keeping his course in such a manner, that he could, if it <lb/>
            should be requisite, get everything needful ready for battle, <lb/>
            and engage at once; for as to the fate of Mnasippus, he had <lb/>
            heard no account from any eye-witness, and suspected that it <lb/>
            might be a report intended to deceive him, and accordingly <lb/>
            kept upon his guard. But when he arrived at Cephallenia, he <lb/>
            received a full statement of facts, and stopped there to refresh <lb/>
            his men.</p>
          <p>32. I am aware that whenever men expect to fight at sea, <lb/>
            all such matters are practised and studied ; but what I com­ <lb/>
            mend in Iphicrates is, that when he had to hasten to the parts <lb/>
            where he thought that he should come to a battle, he con­ <lb/>
            trived that his men should neither grow neglectful of prepara­ <lb/>
            tion for battle by reason of the length of the voyage, nor pursue <lb/>
            their course the more slowly by attending to such preparation.</p>
          <p>33. Having reduced the towns in Cephallenia, he sailed off <lb/>
            to Corcyra. Here the first intelligence he received was, that <lb/>
            ten galleys were coming from Dionysius2 to reinforce the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians; and going in person therefore along the <lb/>
            coast, and considering from what points it was possible to de­ <lb/>
            scry those vessels approaching, and for people making signals <lb/>
            to render them visible at the city, he posted sentinels in those <lb/>
            places, arranging with them what signals they should give <lb/>
            when the enemy sailed up and cast anchor. 34. He then <lb/>
            selected twenty of his own captains, who were to be ready to <lb/>
            follow him whenever he should send a messenger to them, and <lb/>
            gave them notice, that, if any one of them should not follow <lb/>
            him, he must not complain of any penalty imposed upon him. <lb/>
            As soon as these ships, then, were signalled as approaching, <lb/>
            and messengers were sent to the captains, their haste was de­ <lb/>
            serving of admiration; for there was no one, of those that <note type="footnote"> 1 Pliny, H. N. iv. 12, 19, speaks of three Sphagiæ, islands lying <lb/>

            that of Laconia, unless Xenophon or his transcribers have made <lb/>
            some mistake in the name. Weiske however thinks that Messenia <lb/>
            was anciently included under the name of Laconia, referring to <lb/>

            were going to sail, that did not embark with the utmost speed. <lb/>
            35. Standing away to the point where the ships of the enemy <lb/>
            were, he found that the men from the rest of them were gone <lb/>
            ashore, but that Melanippus, a Rhodian captain, was exhort­ <lb/>
            in- the other commanders not to stay there, and, embarking <lb/>
            his own crew, was sailing off. Melanippus, in consequence, <lb/>
            though he met with the ships of Iphicrates, nevertheless <lb/>
            escaped, but all the ships from Syracuse 1 were captured, with <lb/>
            their crews. 36. Iphicrates, cutting off the beaks of the ves­ <lb/>
            sels, brought them in tow into the harbour of Corcyra, and <lb/>
            settled a fixed2 sum for each of the prisoners to pay foi his <lb/>
            ransom, except Crinippus the chief captain, whom he kept <lb/>
            under guard, as if he would exact a vast sum from him, or <lb/>
            sell him as a slave. He however died, through grief, by <lb/>
            his own hands. The other prisoners Iphicrates discharged, <lb/>
            taking security from the Corcyræans for the payment of their <lb/>
            ransom.</p>
          <p>37. He maintained his sailors, chiefly, by employing them <lb/>
            in agriculture in the service of the Corcyræans. With the <lb/>
            peltasts, and the heavy-armed men from the fled he passed <lb/>
            over to Acarnania, where he afforded aid to the friendly towns, <lb/>
            if any required it, and made war upon the Thyreans, a people <lb/>
            of great bravery, and occupying a strongly fortified place. <lb/>
            38. Afterwards, fetching the fleet from Corcyra, consisting <lb/>
            now of about ninety ships, he proceeded first to Cephallenia <lb/>
            and raised contributions there, as well from people that were <lb/>
            willing to give them, as from those that were unwilling. He <lb/>
            then prepared to commit depredations on the territories of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians; and, of the cities in those parts attached to <lb/>
            the enemy, to receive into alliance such as were willing to <lb/>
            join him, and to make war on such as rejected his advances.</p>
          <p>39. I praise this expedition as one of the greatest among <lb/>
            the exploits of Iphicrates, and I commend him also for having <lb/>
            procured Callistratus the popular orator, a man by no means <lb/>
            his friend,3 and Chabrias, who was esteemed an able general, <lb/>
            to be joined with him in the command; for if he regarded <lb/>
            them as sensible men, and wished to take them as counsellors, <lb/>
            he appears to have done what was prudent; or, if he con- <note type="footnote">1 Melanippus's ship was therefore, apparently, from Rhodes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pactus est.

          <p>The Athenians, though displeased with the Thebans, think it best to invite <lb/>
            them to make peace with the Lacedæmonians. Deputies from the several <lb/>
            states accordingly meet at Sparta. Speeches of Callias, Autocles, and <lb/>
            Callistratus. Peace is settled on the understanding that the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans shall recall their harmosts, disband their troops, and give liberty to <lb/>
            their dependent cities ; and that if any state is wronged, any other state <lb/>
            that will, may take its part. The several states swear to observe the con­ <lb/>
            ditions ; except the Thebans, who wish to take the oath in the name of all <lb/>
            the Bœotians, and concerning whom the matter is left doubtful.</p>
          <p>1. THE Athenians, seeing the Platæans,2 their friends, driven <lb/>
            from Bœotia, and seeking refuge at Athens, and the Thespians <lb/>
            entreating them " not to allow them to be deprived of a home <lb/>
            could no longer approve the conduct of the Thebans; yet to <lb/>
            go to war with them they were partly ashamed, and partly <lb/>
            thought it inexpedient. But, when they saw them making <lb/>
            war upon the Phocians, who were old friends to the city of <lb/>
            Athens, and destroying cities that had been faithful in tne <lb/>
            war with the Barbarians, and well disposed to the Thebans <lb/>
            themselves, they refused to have any further concern in what <lb/>
            they were doing. 2. In consequence, the people of Athens, <lb/>
            passing a resolution to make peace, sent, in the first place, <lb/>
            ambassadors to Thebes, to call on the Thebans to send ambas- <note type="footnote">1 The text is in some way defective here, as Morus, Schneider, <lb/>

            conditions of peace. They then sent off ambassadors to Lace­ <lb/>

            before the assembly of Lacedæmonians and allies, Callistratus <lb/>
            the popular orator being present there, (for, having promised <lb/>
            Iphicrates, that, if he would grant him his dismissal, he would <lb/>
            either send him money for his fleet or effect a peace, he had <lb/>
            been in consequence at Athens,1 and endeavoured to settle <lb/>
            about a peace,) when they appeared, I say, before the assem­ <lb/>
            bly of Lacedæmonians and allies, Callias, the torchbearer in <lb/>
            the mysteries of Ceres, was the first of them that spoke. <lb/>
            He was a man that was not less pleased at being praised by <lb/>
            himself than by others, and proceeded to speak, on this occa­ <lb/>
            sion, in some such manner as the following.</p>
          <p>4. " The office of public host,3 0 men of Lacedoemon, by <lb/>
            which I am connected with you, I am not the only one of my <lb/>
            family that has held, for my father's father had it, and left it <lb/>
            as hereditary to his family. I wish also to mention to you, <lb/>
            how our country has always felt towards us; for, when there <lb/>
            is war, it chooses us as commanders, and, when it desires quiet, <lb/>
            sends us out as peace-makers. I have, indeed, been twice, <lb/>
            before at Lacedæmon for the purpose of putting an end to <lb/>
            war, and, in both my embassies, made peace between you and <lb/>
            us; and I now come a third time, and think that I may far <lb/>
            more justly than ever hope to effect a reconciliation ; 5. for I <lb/>
            see that you do not think one thing, and we another, but that <lb/>
            you and we are alike indignant at the ruin of Platææ and <lb/>
            Thespiæ. How can it be otherwise than fit, then, that men <lb/>
            who entertain the same feelings should be friends rather than <lb/>
            enemies to each other ?</p>
          <p>" It is indeed the part of wise men, even if little differ­ <lb/>
            ences of opinion arise between them, not to have recourse to <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθήνησί τε ὴν</foreign>.] Morus thinks that we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθήνηθε <lb/>

            war; and, if we entirely agree in opinion, would it not be <lb/>
            one of the strangest of things, that we should not make peace ? <lb/>
            6. It would be just, let me say, that we should never bear arms <lb/>
            against each other, since Triptolemus, our ancestor, is said to <lb/>
            have communicated the secret mysteries of Ceres and Proser­ <lb/>
            pine to Hercules, your earliest chief, and to the Dioscuri <lb/>
            your countrymen, first of all foreigners, and to have bestowed <lb/>
            the seed of the fruits of Ceres on the Peloponnesus before <lb/>
            any other country. How, therefore, is it just, either that <lb/>
            you should ever come to lay waste the crops of those from <lb/>
            whom you received seed, or that we should not wish as <lb/>
            great an abundance of food as possible to arise to those to <lb/>
            whom we gave seed ? And if it is appointed by the gods <lb/>
            that wars must be among mankind, it at least becomes us to <lb/>
            commence hostilities with the utmost tardiness, and, when <lb/>
            they are commenced, to bring them to an end as soon as we <lb/>
            can."</p>
          <p>7. After him, Autocles, who was regarded as a skilful <lb/>
            orator, spoke to this effect:</p>
          <p>“ I am not ignorant, men of Lacedæmon, that what I am <lb/>
            about to say will not be spoken to your gratification ; but it <lb/>
            appears to me, that those who wish the friendship which they <lb/>
            form to have the longest possible duration, should impress <lb/>
            upon one another the causes of previous wars. You are al­ <lb/>
            ways saying that the cities ought to be independent; yet you <lb/>
            yourselves are the greatest obstruction to their independence ; <lb/>
            for you make this the first condition with people received into <lb/>
            alliance with you, that they follow wherever you lead them ; <lb/>
            and how is such a condition consistent with independence ? <lb/>
            8. You make enemies without consulting your allies, and then <lb/>
            lead your allies to make war upon your enemies ; so that those <lb/>
            who are said to be independent are often compelled to take <lb/>
            the field against people who are their greatest friends.</p>
          <p>" But what is the most adverse of all things to independ­ <lb/>
            ence, you establish in some cities governments of Ten, and in <lb/>
            others governments of Thirty; and you look to these governors, <lb/>
            not that they may rule the cities with justice, but that they <lb/>
            may secure them by force; so that you appear to find more <lb/>
            pleasure in tyrannies than in republics. 9. When the king <lb/>
            of Persia, too, desired that the cities should be independent, <lb/>
            you appeared plainly of opinion that if the Thebans did not <pb n="490"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            allow each city to govern itself, and to use whatever laws it <lb/>
            pleased, they would not act in accordance with the king's let­ <lb/>
            ter ; but, when you got possession of the citadel of Thebes, <lb/>
            you did not allow even the Thebans themselves to be inde­ <lb/>
            pendent. But it is not the part of those who would be friends, <lb/>
            to be anxious to obtain justice from others, and to appear on <lb/>
            their own part making as great encroachments as they can."</p>
          <p>10. As he spoke thus, he not only produced silence in the <lb/>
            whole assembly, but caused such as were unfavourable to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to feel delighted. When he had concluded, <lb/>
            Callistratus said,</p>
          <p>" That there have not been faults, 0 men of Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            both on our side and on yours, I do not imagine that I can <lb/>
            assert; yet I am not of opinion that we must have no further <lb/>
            dealings with those who have done wrong ; for I see no human <lb/>
            being passing through life without error; and sometimes men <lb/>
            who have done wrong appear to me to become more discreet, 1 <lb/>
            especially if they have been punished by their errors as we <lb/>
            have been. 11. To you yourselves, also, I see that many re­ <lb/>
            taliations have at times occurred from imprudent actions; <lb/>
            among which was the seizure of the citadel at Thebes; since <lb/>
            now indeed,2 zealous as you were that the cities should be in­ <lb/>
            dependent, they have all, since the Thebans were wronged, <lb/>
            put themselves again into their hands; so that I now hope <lb/>
            that you, being taught how profitless encroachment is, will <lb/>
            conduct yourselves with moderation in mutual friendship.</p>
          <p>12. " As to what some, who wish to prevent peace, insinuate <lb/>
            against us, intimating that we are come hither, not to seek <lb/>
            your friendship, but from fear that Antalcidas may have come <lb/>
            with money from the king, consider how foolishly they talk ; <lb/>
            for the king wrote that all the cities in Greece should be free, <lb/>
            and why should we then, who conform in word and deed to <lb/>
            the wishes of the king, apprehend anything from him ? Or <lb/>
            does any one think that the king desires, at a vast expense of <lb/>
            money, to make others great, rather than that what he deems <lb/>
            best should be effected for him without expense ? 13. But why <lb/>
            then are we come ? That we do not come from distress, you <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐπορώτεϱοι</foreign>. Fr. Portus supposes this word to be equivalent <lb/>

            may know by looking, if you please, to the state of our affairs <lb/>
            at sea, and also, if you please, to the state of our affairs by <lb/>
            land, at the present time. What, therefore, is the cause of our <lb/>
            coming ?1 It is plain that some of our allies are doing rather <lb/>
            what is unpleasing to us than what is pleasing to you ;2 and <lb/>
            perhaps we may wish to communicate to you what we have <lb/>
            clearly perceived, in return for your preservation of us.3 14. <lb/>
            But that I may still confine myself to the mention of what is <lb/>
            advantageous, there are, among all the cities, some favourable <lb/>
            to your interests, and some to ours; in every city one party <lb/>
            declares for the Lacedæmonians, and another for the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans. But if4 we become friends, from whom can we fairly <lb/>
            expect any effectual opposition? Who, when you are our <lb/>
            friends, will be able to molest us by land ? Or who, when we <lb/>
            are your supporters, will be able to hurt you by sea ?</p>
          <p>15. "That wars arise from time to time, and are brought <lb/>
            to an end, we all know; and we are conscious that we all shall <lb/>
            at some time desire peace, even if we do not desire it now. <lb/>
            Why then should we wait for that period when we shall be <lb/>
            exhausted by a series of disasters, and not rather make peace <lb/>
            at once, before any irremediable evil overtakes us ? 16. For <lb/>
            my part, I can neither commend those persons, who, having <lb/>
            become competitors in public games, and having gained reput­ <lb/>
            ation by several victories, are so fond of contention, that they <lb/>
            will not cease from it until they are beaten and forced to re­ <lb/>
            linquish their profession ; nor can I praise those gamesters, <note type="footnote"> 1 Tt <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήν ἐστιν</foreign> ; ]" This passage of the speech," says Weiske, <lb/>

            From the commencement of section 14 the reader may see that all <lb/>

            bent on us never to reduce ourselves to such a struggle, that <lb/>

          <p>IS. As these speakers appeared to say what was reasonable, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians passed a resolution to agree to the peace, <lb/>
            on the understanding that " they should withdraw their <lb/>
            harmosts from the cities, that they should disband both their <lb/>
            sea and land forces, and that they should leave the cities in­ <lb/>
            dependent ; and that, if any one should act contrary to these <lb/>
            arrangements, whoever was willing might take the part of <lb/>
            such cities as were wronged; but that on him who was not <lb/>
            willing to take their part, it should not be considered as obli­ <lb/>
            gatory by his oath to do so." 19. On these conditions the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians swore to a treaty of peace for themselves and <lb/>
            their allies ; and the Athenians and their allies in the name of <lb/>
            their respective cities. The Thebans, however, having en­ <lb/>
            rolled their name in the list of the cities that took the oath, <lb/>
            their deputies came back the next day, and requested the <lb/>
            council to alter the record, and say, instead of " the Thebans," <lb/>
            that " the Boeotians " had sworn. Agesilaus replied, " that <lb/>
            he would alter nothing of that which they had at first sworn, <lb/>
            and to which they had set their name;" but said that, "if <lb/>
            they did not wish to be included in the treaty, he would erase <lb/>
            their name altogether, should they desire it." 20. Thus the <lb/>
            rest having made peace, and there being a controversy <lb/>
            only with the Thebans, the Athenians thought it was to be <lb/>
            expected that the Thebans, as the saying is, would be deci­ <lb/>
            mated; 1 and the Thebans themselves went off in very great <lb/>
            dejection. <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεκατευθη̃ναι</foreign>.]When Xerxes invaded Greece, many of the <lb/>

          <p>The Thebans refusing to set free the towns of Bœotia, Cleombrotus is di <lb/>

            ans to crush the Lacedæmonians, but, being unsuccessful, apply, with the <lb/>
            same object, to Jason of Thessaly. Jason marches into Bœotia, and dis­ <lb/>
            suades both the Thebans and Lacedæmonians from continuing the war. <lb/>
            Returning home through Phocis, he demolishes the fortifications of He­ <lb/>
            raclea, that it may be no obstacle to his communication with Greece. He <lb/>
            then prepares to celebrate the Pythian games, intending to preside at <lb/>

          <p>1. IMMEDIATELY afterwards, the Athenians withdrew their <lb/>
            garrisons from the several cities, and recalled Iphicrates and <lb/>
            his fleet; desiring him to restore all the places that he had <lb/>
            taken after the oaths were sworn to the treaty at Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>2. As for the Lacedæmonians, they withdrew the harmosts <lb/>
            and garrisons from the cities in general, but when Cleombro­ <lb/>
            tus,l who was at the head of the army in Phocis, sent to <lb/>
            ask the authorities at home how he should act, Prothous <lb/>
            said that " he thought they should disband the army accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the treaty, and send notice to the cities that each of <lb/>
            them should contribute to the temple of Apollo2 as much as it <lb/>
            should think fit, and then, if any people should not leave the <lb/>
            cities independent, they should summon the allies together <lb/>
            again, as many of them at least as were willing to vindicate <lb/>
            the general independence, and lead them against such as op­ <lb/>
            posed it, for by such conduct," he added, " he thought the <lb/>
            gods would be best rendered propitious, and the cities be least <lb/>
            dissatisfied." 3. The assembly, on hearing these observations, <lb/>
            were of opinion that he spoke foolishly, (for an evil spirit, as <lb/>
            it seems, was now leading them on,) and the government sent <note type="footnote"> I This is a long sentence, which, as Weiske says, the author be­ <lb/>

            orders to Cleombrotus " not to disband his army, but to march <lb/>
            at once against the Thebans unless they set the cities at <lb/>
            liberty." 1 When therefore he perceived that they were not <lb/>
            only not liberating the cities, but were even forbearing from <lb/>
            disbanding their forces, in order that they might make head <lb/>
            against him, he accordingly led his army into Bœotia. Where <lb/>
            the Thebans expected that he would enter their country from <lb/>
            Phocis, and where they were keeping guard at a narrow pass, <lb/>
            he did not make his entrance, but. marching through Thisbæ, <lb/>
            by a mountainous and uncontemplated route, arrived at Creu­ <lb/>
            sis, when he took the fortress, and possessed himself of twelve <lb/>
            galleys belonging to the Thebans. 4. Having done this, and <lb/>
            gone up from the sea, he encamped at Leuctra in the territory <lb/>
            of Thespiæ. The Thebans encamped on the hill opposite to <lb/>
            him, at no great distance, having no auxiliaries except Bœo <lb/>
            tians. 5. Some of the friends of Cleombrotus then went to <lb/>
            him, and said, " If you allow the Thebans to go off without <lb/>
            fighting, you will be in danger of suffering the greatest pun­ <lb/>
            ishment from your countrymen; for they will call to mind re­ <lb/>
            specting you the time when you went to Cynoscephalæ,2and <lb/>
            did no damage to the Theban territory, and the subsequent <lb/>
            occasion, when, after taking the field, you were prevented <lb/>
            from entering their country, whereas Agesilaus had always <lb/>
            entered it by the pass of Cithæron. If therefore you have <lb/>
            any regard for yourself, or any desire to live in your own <lb/>
            country, you must lead on your army against that of the ene­ <lb/>
            my." In such a manner did his friends address him; while <lb/>
            his enemies said, " He will now show whether he is really a <lb/>
            friend to the Thebans, as he is said to be." 6. Cleombrotus, <lb/>
            hearing these remarks, was incited to come to a battle.</p>
          <p>The chief men of the Thebans, on the other hand, were <lb/>
            arguing that if they did not fight, the surrounding cities <lb/>
            would revolt from them, and they themselves would be be­ <lb/>
            sieged ; and that, if the populace of Thebes should be in want <lb/>
            of provisions, the government would be likely to turn against <lb/>
            them, and, as many of them had already been exiles, they <lb/>
            considered that it would be better to die on the field of battle <note type="footnote"> 1 Four lines, which are mere repetition, through the error, ap­ <lb/>

            than to be banished a second time. 7. In addition to this, an <lb/>
            oracle that was mentioned gave them some encouragement, <lb/>
            importing that " the Lacedæmonians would be conquered <lb/>
            where the tomb of the virgins 1 stood," who were said to have <lb/>
            killed themselves because they had suffered violence from <lb/>
            some Lacedæmonians. This tomb the Thebans decorated be­ <lb/>
            fore the battle. Intelligence was also brought them from <lb/>
            Thebes that all the temples had opened of their own accord, <lb/>
            and that the priestesses declared that the gods predicted vic­ <lb/>
            tory. From the temple of Hercules they said that the arms <lb/>
            had disappeared, as if Hercules himself had gone forth to <lb/>
            battle. Some however say that all these occurrences were <lb/>
            mere artifices on the part of the leaders.2</p>
          <p>8. For the battle everything was adverse on the side of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, while to the enemy everything was rendered <lb/>
            favourable by fortune. It was after dinner that the last council <lb/>
            of war was held by Cleombrotus; and, as the officers had <lb/>
            drunk a little at noon, it was said that the wine in some de­ <lb/>
            gree inspired them. 9. And as, when both sides were fully <lb/>
            armed, and it was now evident that a battle would take place, <lb/>
            the people who had provisions for sale, with some of the bag­ <lb/>
            gage-carriers, and others who were unwilling to fight, were <lb/>
            proceeding first of all to quit the camp of the Bœotians, the <lb/>
            mercenaries under Hiero, the Phocian peltasts, and the Hera­ <lb/>
            clean and Phliasian cavalry, making a circuit, fell upon them <lb/>
            as they were going off, turned them back, and pursued them <lb/>
            to the Bœotian camp; so that they made the army of the <lb/>
            Boeotians larger and more numerous3 than before. 10. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, as there was a plain between the armies, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians drew up their cavalry before their main body, and <lb/>
            the Thebans drew up theirs over against them; but the <lb/>
            cavalry of the Thebans had been exercised in wars with the <lb/>
            Orchomenians and Thespians, while that of the Lacedæmo- <note type="footnote">1 They were the daughters of Leuctrus, from whom Leuctra had <lb/>

            nians was at that time in a very inefficient condition ; 11. for <lb/>
            the richest men maintained the horses, and, when notice of <lb/>
            an expedition was given, the men appointed came to ride <lb/>
            them, and each taking his horse, and whatever arms were <lb/>
            given him, proceeded at once to the field; and thus the weak­ <lb/>
            est and least spirited of all the men were mounted on horse­ <lb/>
            back. 12. Such was the cavalry on either side. Of the foot, <lb/>
            it was said that the Lacedæmonians advanced with each <lb/>
            enomotia2 drawn up three deep; this arrangement making <lb/>
            them not more than twelve deep in all. The Theban infantry, <lb/>
            in close array, were not less than fifty deep, considering that <lb/>
            if they could defeat the body of the enemy posted around the <lb/>
            king, the rest of the army would be an easy conquest.</p>
          <p>13. As soon as Cleombrotus began to lead forward against <lb/>
            the enemy, and even before the troops about him were aware <lb/>
            that he was putting them in motion, the cavalry had already <lb/>
            engaged, and those of the Lacedæmonians were at once de­ <lb/>
            feated, who, as they fled, fell in among their own heavy-armed <lb/>
            infantry, on which the troops of the Thebans were also <lb/>
            pressing. But that the troops round Cleombrotus had <lb/>
            at first the advantage in the contest, any one may be con­ <lb/>
            vinced by certain proof; for they would not have been able to <lb/>
            take him and carry him off alive, unless those who fought in <lb/>
            front of him had been at that time victorious. 14. When, how­ <lb/>
            ever, Deimon the polemarch, Sphodrias, one of the attendants <lb/>
            at the royal tent,3 and Cleonymus his son, were killed, and <lb/>
            the horse-guard,4 those who are called supporters of the pole­ <lb/>
            march, and the rest, being overpowered by the mass of the <lb/>
            enemy, were forced to fall back, the Lacedæmonians on the <note type="footnote"> 1 Was it ever otherwise? But cavalry from Heraclea and Phlius <lb/>

            left, seeing the right wing thus repulsed, also gave way, yet, <lb/>
            though many were killed, and they were quite defeated, they <lb/>

            front of their camp, to form themselves under arms in the <lb/>
            place from which they had set out. Their camp was nevertheless <lb/>
            not on level ground, but rather somewhat on an acclivity.</p>
          <p>Some of the Lacedæmonians, at the time, who thought their <lb/>
            disaster an insupportable disgrace, exclaimed that they ought <lb/>
            to prevent the enemy from erecting a trophy, and endeavour <lb/>
            to recover the dead, not by making a truce, but by fighting <lb/>
            another battle. 15. But the polemarchs, seeing that of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in all nearly a thousand had lost their lives; <lb/>
            and that of the Spartans, who were in the field to the number <lb/>
            of about seven hundred, about four hundred had fallen ; and <lb/>
            observing, also, that all the auxiliaries were too dispirited to <lb/>
            renew the combat, and some of them not even concerned at <lb/>
            what had happened, called a council of the chief officers, and <lb/>
            deliberated what course they ought to pursue ; and as all were <lb/>
            of opinion that " they ought to fetch off the dead by truce," <lb/>
            they accordingly despatched a herald to treat respecting a <lb/>
            truce. The Thebans soon after erected a trophy, and gave up <lb/>
            the dead under truce.</p>
          <p>16. After these occurrences, the messenger who was sent <lb/>
            with the news of the calamity to Lacedæmon, arrived there on <lb/>
            the last day of the Gymnopædiæ,1 after the chorus of men had <lb/>
            made their entry. The ephori, when they heard of the cala­ <lb/>
            mity, were greatly concerned, as, I think, they naturally must <lb/>
            have been; yet they did not order that chorus to withdraw, <lb/>
            but allowed them to finish the entertainment. They then <lb/>
            sent the names of the dead to their several relatives, and gave <lb/>
            notice to the women to make no lamentation, but to bear their <lb/>
            affliction in silence. The day after, a person might have seen <lb/>
            those whose relatives had died, appearing in public with looks <lb/>
            of cheerfulness and joy; but of those whose relatives were <lb/>
            said to be alive, he would have seen but few. and those going <lb/>
            about with gloomy and dejected countenances.</p>
          <p>17. Soon after, the ephori called forth into service the re­ <lb/>
            maining battalions, consisting of men up to fifty-eight years <lb/>
            of age. With these they sent some from the battalions already <note type="footnote"> 1 A festival at Sparta in honour of Apollo, Diana, and Latona, <lb/>

            from his illness; and the government, therefore, appointed <lb/>
            his son Archidamus to take the command. The Tegeans <lb/>
            readily joined him in the field; for the party of Stasippus,l <lb/>
            who were favourable to the Lacedæmonians, and had the <lb/>
            greatest influence in the city, were still in existence. The <lb/>
            Mantineans also marched forth in great strength from their <lb/>
            villages; for they were under an aristocratical government.2 <lb/>
            The Corinthians, Sicyonians, Phliasians, and Achæans fol­ <lb/>
            lowed with much cheerfulness; and other towns sent out <lb/>
            troops. The Lacedæmonians too, and Corinthians, manned <lb/>
            their vessels, and called on the Sicyonians to man theirs, in <lb/>
            which the Lacedæmonians thought of transporting their troops. <lb/>
            Archidamus next proceeded to sacrifice with a view to cross­ <lb/>
            ingthe borders.</p>
          <p>19. The Thebans, immediately after the battle, despatched <lb/>
            a herald to Athens with a chaplet on his head, by whom they <lb/>
            sent an account of the greatness of the victory, and a request, <lb/>
            at the same time, for aid, saying that " it was now in the <lb/>
            power of the Athenians to take vengeance on the Spartans <lb/>
            for all that they had done to them." 20. The senate of the <lb/>
            Athenians happened then to be sitting in the acropolis; and, <lb/>
            when they heard what had occurred, it was evident to everyone <lb/>
            that they were greatly troubled ; for they showed no hospitality <lb/>
            to the herald, and gave no answer at all to the request for aid. <lb/>
            The herald accordingly took his departure from Athens.</p>
          <p>The Thebans also sent in haste to Jason, who was their <lb/>
            ally, urging him to send them succour, and meditating what <lb/>
            results the future would have. 21. Jason immediately manned <lb/>
            his galleys, as if intending to support them by sea, and, col­ <lb/>
            lecting his mercenary force and the cavalry that he had with <lb/>
            him, proceeded, though the Phocians were in implacable hos­ <lb/>
            tility with him, through their country into Bœotia, showing <lb/>
            himself in many of the towns before it was made known whither <lb/>
            he was marching. He had accordingly proceeded a long way <lb/>
            in advance, before any force could be collected from the dif- <note type="footnote"> See c. 5, sect. 5, 6. See v. 2. 7. </note> <pb n="499"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            ferent parts of the country, showing that expedition frequently <lb/>
            effects its objects more successfully than strength. 22. When <lb/>
            he had entered Bœotia, and the Thebans said that the time <lb/>
            was come for overwhelming the Lacedæmonians, proposing <lb/>
            that Jason, with his mercenaries, should pour upon them from <lb/>
            the hills,1 while they themselves charged them in front, Jason <lb/>
            dissuaded them, observing that, after so noble a victory, it did <lb/>
            not become them to court any further peril, with the risk of <lb/>
            either gaining greater success, or losing the fruits of what they <lb/>
            had already attained. 23. " Do you not see," said he, " that <lb/>
            you yourselves obtained a victory when you were under the <lb/>
            necessity of lighting ? It behoves you to reflect, therefore, <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians, if they be forced to relinquish the <lb/>
            hope of life, will fight with desperation; and the divine pow­ <lb/>
            ers, as it seems, often take delight in making the little great, <lb/>
            and the great little." 24. By such remarks he dissuaded the <lb/>
            Thebans from incurring further hazard. The Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            on the other hand, he reminded of the difference between a <lb/>
            vanquished and a victorious army; " and if you desire," said <lb/>
            he, "to extinguish the memory2 of your late calamity, I ad­ <lb/>
            vise you to breathe and rest awhile, and, when you are grown <lb/>
            stronger, to come to battle with these unconquered Thebans. <lb/>
            But at the present time," added he, " be assured that there <lb/>
            are some of your allies who are treating about peace with your <lb/>
            enemies; and therefore endeavour, by all means, to obtain a <lb/>
            truce for yourselves. This object I have at heart, as I wish <lb/>
            to save you, both because of the friendship which my father <lb/>
            entertained for you, and because I am publicly connected with <lb/>
            you by the laws of hospitality." 25. Such were the senti­ <lb/>
            ments that he expressed, and his object perhaps was, that both <lb/>
            these parties, then at variance with one another, might look <lb/>
            to him for support. However this might be, the Lacedæ- <note type="footnote"> I "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανωθεν</foreign>. Weiske supposes that the hill or slope is meant on <lb/>

            monians listened to him, and desired him to treat for them <lb/>
            respecting a truce; and, as soon as it was announced that a <lb/>
            truce was arranged, the officers gave orders that all the men <lb/>
            should collect their baggage after supper, in order to march <lb/>
            off in the night, so that, by day-break, they might reach the <lb/>
            ascent of Mount Cithæron. When the men had supped, there­ <lb/>
            fore, and before they could take any rest, the officers gave the <lb/>
            word " to follow," and led off, at the close of the evening. <lb/>
            along the road through Creusis, trusting more to the secrecy <lb/>
            of their movements than to the truce. 26. Advancing in <lb/>
            great discomfort, as men retreating in the night under the <lb/>
            influence of fear, and pursuing a very difficult road, they <lb/>
            reached Ægosthena in the territory of Megara, where they <lb/>
            joined the troops under the command of Archidamus; who, <lb/>
            having halted there till all the allies arrived, conducted the <lb/>
            whole army in a body as far as Corinth. Here he dismissed <lb/>
            the allies, and led his own countrymen home.</p>
          <p>27. Jason, as he retired through Phocis, took the suburbs <lb/>
            of Hyampolis, laid waste the adjacent country, and put to <lb/>
            death many of the inhabitants. The rest of Phocis he tra­ <lb/>
            versed without doing any injury. Arriving at Heraclea,l he <lb/>
            threw down the walls of that city, not fearing lest, when that <lb/>
            way was opened, any of his enemies should invade his do­ <lb/>
            minions, but rather apprehending that some of them might <lb/>
            seize Heraclea, which lay on a narrow pass, and stop him if <lb/>
            he wished to march into any part of Greece. 28. When he <lb/>
            returned to Thessaly, he was regarded as a great man, both <lb/>
            because he was made Tagos of the Thessalians by law, and <lb/>
            because he maintained about him a large body of mercenaries, <lb/>
            both infantry and cavalry, all exercised in such a manner as <lb/>
            to be in the best possible condition. He was considered as <lb/>
            still greater, because many people had already become his <lb/>
            allies, and others were desirous to be in the number of them. <lb/>
            But he was greatest of all men of his time from being of such <lb/>
            i character that he could be despised by no one.</p>
          <p>29. When the Pythian games approached, he sent orders to <lb/>
            each of the cities to prepare oxen, sheep, goats, and swine, as <lb/>
            for the sacrifice; and it was said that though but a very mo­ <lb/>
            derate number was required from each city, the oxen amounted <note type="footnote">1 Heraclea Trachinia. Diod. Sic. xv. 57. </note> <pb n="501"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            to not less than a thousand, and the other cattle to more than <lb/>
            ten thousand. He made proclamation also that whichsoever <lb/>
            of the cities should produce the finest ox, worthy of being <lb/>
            first sacrificed to the god,1 its reward should be a golden <lb/>
            crown. so. He gave orders to the Thessalians, too, to be <lb/>
            ready to take the field at the time of the Pythian games; for <lb/>
            he intended, as people said, to preside2 in person at the sacred <lb/>
            assembly and at the games in honour of the god. What de­ <lb/>
            sign he had with regard to the sacred treasures, is still un­ <lb/>
            known ; but it is said that when the people of Delphi in­ <lb/>
            quired " how they should act if he appropriated any part of <lb/>
            the treasures of the deity," the god answered that " he himself <lb/>
            would attend to that matter."</p>
          <p>31. But this man, possessed of such power, and meditating <lb/>
            such vast and peculiar schemes, when, on a certain occasion, <lb/>
            lie was holding a review and examination of the cavalry of <lb/>
            Pheræ, and was sitting and answering applications, if any one <lb/>
            came forward to make a petition to him, was stabbed and <lb/>
            murdered by seven young men, who approached him on pre <lb/>
            tence of having a dispute among themselves. 32. As his <lb/>
            guards who were at hand ran promptly to his defence, one of <lb/>
            the assailants, while striking at Jason, was pierced with a <lb/>
            lance and killed ; another was seized as he was mounting his <lb/>
            horse, and put to death after receiving several wounds; the <lb/>
            rest sprung upon horses ready prepared for them, and made <lb/>
            their escape : and to whatever cities of Greece they afterwards <lb/>
            went, they were in most of them received with honour. Hence <lb/>
            it is evident that the Greeks had a great dread of Jason, lest <lb/>
            he should prove a tyrant over them.</p>
          <p>33. After his death, Polydorus, his brother, and Polyphron,3 <lb/>
            were chosen Tagi. Polydorus, as they were both travelling <lb/>
            to Larissa, died while he was asleep at night, by the hands, as <note type="footnote"> I Bovv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡγεμόνα</foreign>.] A <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βου̃ς ἡγεμών</foreign>, in the opinion of Goldhagen, is <lb/>

            was supposed, of his brother Polyphron ; for his death was <lb/>
            sudden, and from no apparent cause. 34. Polyphron held the <lb/>
            government for a year, and made his rule similar to that of a <lb/>
            tyrant; for he put to death, at Pharsalus, Polydamas and eight <lb/>
            others of the most respectable citizens, and drove several per­ <lb/>
            sons from Larissa into exile. As he was conducting himself <lb/>
            in this manner, he was killed by Alexander, on the pretext of <lb/>
            avenging Polydorus and overthrowing a tyranny. 35. But <lb/>
            when Alexander got the government into his own hands, he <lb/>
            proved himself a severe ruler to the Thessalians, and a violent <lb/>
            enemy to the Thebans and Athenians, and an unprincipled <lb/>
            robber by land and sea. After showing that such was his <lb/>
            character, he was himself killed, by the hands indeed of his <lb/>
            wife's brothers, but by the entire contrivance of his wife her­ <lb/>
            self; 36. for she told her brothers that Alexander had a design <lb/>
            on their lives, and concealed them a whole day in the house, <lb/>
            and, taking Alexander in a state of intoxication, she removed <lb/>
            his sword, after she had put him to sleep, while the lamp was <lb/>
            left burning, and perceiving that her brothers were afraid to <lb/>
            go into the room to Alexander, she declared that if they did <lb/>
            not do the deed at once, she would awake him. As soon as <lb/>
            they had entered, she closed the door, and kept fast hold of <lb/>
            the bolt, until her husband was despatched. 37. Her hatred <lb/>
            to Alexander is said by some to have arisen from the circum­ <lb/>
            stance, that when Alexander had imprisoned a youth of whom <lb/>
            he was fond, a boy of great beauty, and she entreated him to <lb/>
            set him at liberty, he brought him out and put him to death. <lb/>
            Others say that as he had no children by her, he sent to <lb/>
            Thebes, and paid court to the widow of Jason to make her <lb/>
            his wife.1 The causes of the plot against him by his wife are <lb/>
            thus related. Of the brothers who were agents in the affair, <lb/>
            Tisiphonus, the eldest, has held the government till the time <lb/>
            when this account was written. <note type="footnote"> 1 Schneider refers to Cic. Off. ii. 7 ; Ovid. Ibis, 323. H. Stephens <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The Peloponnesians being still under the influence of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            the Athenians endeavour to enjoin upon the several states a strict adherence <lb/>
            to the terms of the peace of Antalcidas. All comply with their wishes <lb/>
            except the Eleians, who are unwilling to grant freedom to certain of their <lb/>
            towns. The Mantineans, contrary to the desire of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            re-unite themselves into one city. Factions of Collibius and Stasippus at <lb/>
            Tegea; that of Stasippus is overthrown by the aid of the Mantineans. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians send out Agesilaus, at the head of an army, to pun­ <lb/>
            ish the Mantineans for their interference, but, though they make war also <lb/>
            on the Orchomenians, he delays, and returns home without doing any­ <lb/>
            thing. The Thebans, who had been called to the support of the Tegeans <lb/>
            and other Arcadians, wish to return home as soon as Agesilaus went <lb/>
            away, but are induced by the solicitations of their party to invade the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian territories, which they lay waste, and march up nearly to <lb/>
            the city itself. The Lacedæmonians, in their alarm, arm a large number <lb/>
            of the helots, and show such determination to defend themselves, that the <lb/>
            nemy at length withdraw. They also send an embassy to Athens to <lb/>
            elicit succour, which the Athenians are chiefly induced to grant by the <lb/>
            consideration that the Lacedæmonians had opposed the Thebans when <lb/>
            they wished to destroy Athens. Excellent speech of Procles of Phlius. <lb/>
            Iphicrates sent out, who does but little; the Thebans contmue their <lb/>
            march homewards.</p>
          <p>1. THE affairs of Thessaly, such as took place in the time <lb/>
            of Jason, and such as occurred immediately after his death <lb/>
            until the assumption of the government by Tisiphonus, have <lb/>
            been narrated. I shall now return to the point from which I <lb/>
            digressed to give the account of them.</p>
          <p>When Archidamus brought his army back, after his march <lb/>
            to the relief of the troops at Leuctra, the Athenians, reflect­ <lb/>
            ing that the Peloponnesians would still think it their duty to <lb/>
            follow the Lacedæmonians, and that the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            not' yet reduced to the state to which they had reduced the <lb/>
            Athenians,1 summoned deputies from as many of the states as <lb/>
            wished to be parties to the peace which the king of Persia <lb/>
            had prescribed. 2. When they were assembled, they passed <lb/>
            a resolution, in conjunction with those who desired to share in <lb/>
            the peace, that each should take the following oath: " I will <lb/>
            adhere to the treaty which the king has sent down to us, and <lb/>
            to the decrees of the Athenians and their allies; and if any <note type="footnote"> 1 For it was by means of the Lacedæmonians that the peace of <lb/>
            Antalcidas was effected, by the terms of which the Athenians had lost <lb/>
            their command over the cities that had been in alliance with them. <lb/>
            Weiske. </note> <pb n="504"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            power attack any one of the cities that have taken this oath, I will <lb/>
            defend that city with all my strength." All who were present <lb/>
            were pleased with this oath, except the Eleians, who stated, <lb/>
            in objection to it, that they were not called upon to leave <lb/>
            either the Marganeans, the Scilluntians, on the Triphylians, <lb/>
            independent, as those cities belonged to themselves." 3. The <lb/>
            Athenians and the rest, however, having passed a resolution <lb/>
            that both the small and great cities should, as the king had <lb/>
            specified, be alike independent," sent out a deputation to ad­ <lb/>
            minister the oath, and required the chief magistrates in every <lb/>
            city to take it. All took it except the Eleians.</p>
          <p>Hence the people of Mantineia, as being now entirely their <lb/>
            own masters, assembled in a body, and came to a determina­ <lb/>
            tion that they would make the city of Mantineia one, 1 and <lb/>
            fortify the city." 4. But the Lacedæmonians, on their part, <lb/>
            thought it would be a grievous thing if such a project should <lb/>
            be carried into execution without their consent. They there­ <lb/>
            fore sent Agesilaus as an ambassador to the Mantineans, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was regarded as their friend since the time of his <lb/>
            father. When he went to them, the magistrates of the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans refused to assemble the people to hear him speak, but <lb/>
            desired him to state what he wished to themselves alone. He <lb/>
            then promised them, that " if they would desist for the present <lb/>
            from building the wall, he would procure that it should after­ <lb/>
            wards be built with the consent of the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            without expense to them." 5. As they replied that " it was <lb/>
            impossible for them to desist, as a resolution had been passed <lb/>
            by their whole community to build a wall at once," Agesilaus <lb/>
            immediately went off in anger. Yet it was not thought prac­ <lb/>
            ticable to make war upon them, as the peace was based on the <lb/>
            condition that the cities should be independent. Some of the <lb/>
            Arcadian towns, too, sent people to the Mantineans to assist <lb/>
            them in building their wall, and the Eleians gave them three <lb/>
            talents of silver to assist in defraying the expense of the work. <lb/>
            In this manner were the Mantineans occupied.</p>
          <p>6. Among the people of Tegea, the party of Callibius and <lb/>
            Proxenus were combining to procure that the whole body of <lb/>
            Arcadians should meet together, and that whatever was voted <lb/>
            by a majority of them in council, should be law in the several <note type="footnote"> I It had been divided into four, v. 2. 7. </note> <pb n="505"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            cities. But the party of Stasippus contended for allowing the <lb/>
            city to remain as it was,l and for using their own hereditary <lb/>
            laws. 7. The party of Proxenus and Callibius, being out­ <lb/>
            voted in all the theatres,2 imagined that if the whole people <lb/>
            should meet together, they would overpower the other party <lb/>
            by their numbers, and accordingly brought out their arms. <lb/>
            The party of Stasippus, perceiving this movement, armed <lb/>
            themselves in opposition, and were not inferior to the others <lb/>
            in number; and, when they came to an engagement, they <lb/>
            killed Proxenus and some few others with him, and put the <lb/>
            rest to flight, but did not pursue them; for Stasippus was a <lb/>
            man of such a character as to be unwilling to put many of his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens to death. 8. The followers of Callibius retreat­ <lb/>
            ed to the part of the wall, and the gates, on the side of Man­ <lb/>
            tineia, and, as the enemy no longer molested them, remained <lb/>
            there quiet in a body. Some time before they had sent to the <lb/>
            Mantineans to request assistance, and they now spoke with <lb/>
            the party of Stasippus about a reconciliation. As the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans, however, were seen advancing, some of Callibius's <lb/>
            men leaped upon the wall, and called to them to come forward <lb/>
            with their utmost speed, shouting to them, and urging them <lb/>
            to hasten, while others opened the gates for them. 9. The <lb/>
            party of Stasippus, when they saw what was going on, rushed <lb/>
            out at the gates opening towards Pallantium,3 and succeeded in <lb/>
            escaping, before they were overtaken by their pursuers, to the <lb/>
            temple of Diana, when they shut themselves in and continued <lb/>
            quiet. But their enemies, following close upon them, climbed <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εα̃ν τε κατὰ χώραν τὴν πόλιν</foreign>.] Morus interprets, nihil immutare <lb/>

            upon the temple, broke through the roof, and pelted them with <lb/>
            tiles. Seeing the necessity to which they were driven, there­ <lb/>
            fore, they called on their adversaries to desist, and promised <lb/>
            to come out. But the others, as they had them in their power, <lb/>
            bound them, and, putting them on a carriage, conveyed them <lb/>
            back to Tegea; where, in conjunction with the Mantineans, <lb/>
            they sentenced them after a trial, and put them to death. 10. <lb/>
            As soon as this took place, such of the people of Tegea as had <lb/>
            been of the party of Stasippus, in number about eight hun­ <lb/>
            dred, fled to Lacedaemon.</p>
          <p>Upon these proceedings, it appeared to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            that they must, according to their oaths, take the field in the <lb/>
            cause of the dead and exiled Tegeans. They accordingly <lb/>
            made war upon the Mantineans, as having, contrary to their <lb/>
            oath, gone under arms against the people of Tegea. The <lb/>
            ephori gave notice of a foreign expedition, and the people de­ <lb/>
            sired Agesilaus to take the command of it. 11. The rest of <lb/>
            the Arcadians were now assembled at Asea;1 but as the Or­ <lb/>
            chomenians declined to take part in the Arcadian confederacy, <lb/>
            on account of their hostility to the Mantineans, and had even <lb/>
            received into their city the mercenaries which had assembled <lb/>
            at Corinth, and of which Polytropus had the command, the <lb/>
            Mantineans remained at home to watch their proceedings. <lb/>
            The Heræans and Lepreans joined the Lacedæmonians in the <lb/>
            field against the Mantineans. 12. Agesilaus, as soon as the <lb/>
            sacrifices for crossing the borders were favourable, proceeded <lb/>
            at once into Arcadia. Having taken Eutæa, a town lying on <lb/>
            the frontier, and found the old men, women, and children left <lb/>
            in the houses there, while those of military age were gone to <lb/>
            join the Arcadian confederacy, he did no harm to the town, <lb/>
            but allowed them to continue in their houses ; and his men <lb/>
            purchased whatever they wanted; or, if anything had been <lb/>
            taken by force when he entered the place, he ordered it to be <lb/>
            searched for and restored. He also repaired the walls, as far <lb/>
            as they needed, whilst he halted there waiting for the merce­ <lb/>
            naries under Polytropus.</p>
          <p>13. In the mean time the Mantineans were taking the field <lb/>
            against the Orchomenians. From the walls2 they retired <note type="footnote"> 1 A village of Arcadia. Steph. By.-. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Yet we have not been informed that they went to the walls <lb/>

            with great difficulty, and some of them were killed ; but when, <lb/>
            in their retreat, they reached Elymia,l and, though the heavy- <lb/>
            armed Orchomenians no longer pursued them, the mercenaries <lb/>
            under Polytropus pressed upon their rear with the utmost <lb/>
            boldness, the Mantineans, seeing that unless they repulsed <lb/>
            them, many of their own men would be killed by their missiles, <lb/>
            faced about and joined battle with their pursuers. 14. Here <lb/>
            Polytropus died fighting; and of his men, who took to flight, <lb/>
            many would have been killed, had not the Phliasian horse <lb/>
            come up, and, riding round to the rear of the Mantineans, <lb/>
            stopped their pursuit. The Mantineans, after they had ended <lb/>
            this affair, went off home.</p>
          <p>15. Agesilaus, hearing of these occurrences, and thinking <lb/>
            that the mercenaries from Orchomenus would not now join <lb/>
            him, set forward from Eutæa. On the first day he supped in <lb/>
            the territory of Tegea, but on the next he crossed over into <lb/>
            that of Mantineia, and encamped at the foot of the hills to the <lb/>
            west of the city, whence he plundered the country and laid <lb/>
            waste the cultivated lands. Those of the Arcadians, however, <lb/>
            who were assembled at Asea, advanced in the night to Tegea. <lb/>
            16. The next day Agesilaus encamped about twenty stadia <lb/>
            from Mantineia. The Arcadians from Tegea, meanwhile, <lb/>
            keeping close to the mountains between Mantineia and Tegea, <lb/>
            were advancing with a great number of heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            eagerly desiring to join the Mantineans; for the Argives, <lb/>
            though not with their whole force, were following them; and <lb/>
            there were some who persuaded Agesilaus to attack them <lb/>
            separately; but he, fearing that while he was marching <lb/>
            against them, the Mantineans might sally from the city and <lb/>
            assail him in flank and rear, thought it best to allow them to <lb/>
            form their junction, and, if they wished to fight, to engage <lb/>
            them both on a fair and open field. The Arcadians now accord <lb/>
            ingly united themselves to the Mantineans.</p>
          <p>17. The peltasts from Orchomenus, and the cavalry of <lb/>
            the Phliasians with them, having passed along under the <lb/>
            walls of Mantineia by night, showed themselves at day- <lb/>
            break to Agesilaus as he was sacrificing in front of his <lb/>
            camp, and made the rest run to their posts, and Age- <note type="footnote"> I Not, as Morus supposes, the same with Elimia in v. 2. 38. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            silaus himself to retire to his heavy-armed men. But when <lb/>
            they were perceived to be friends, and Agesilaus had favour­ <lb/>
            able omens from the sacrifice, he led forward his army, after <lb/>
            breakfast, and, as evening came on, encamped, without being <lb/>
            observed by the enemy, in a hollow behind the Mantinean <lb/>
            territory, very close at hand, and entirely surrounded by hills, <lb/>
            is. The next day at dawn he sacrificed in front of the camp, <lb/>
            and seeing the enemy assembling from Mantineia upon the <lb/>
            hills in the rear of his army, concluded that he must advance <lb/>
            out of the hollow without loss of time. But if he led on <lb/>
            straight forward, he was apprehensive lest the enemy should <lb/>
            attack his rear; he therefore remained quiet himself, and, <lb/>
            turning his arms towards the enemy, sent orders to those in <lb/>
            the rear to wheel to the right, and to march forward behind <lb/>
            the main body towards him. Thus he at once drew them <lb/>
            from the confined space, and rendered his main body con­ <lb/>
            tinually stronger. 19. When his main body was doubled, <lb/>
            he advanced into the plain with his heavy-armed troops thus <lb/>
            disposed, and then extended his line so as to be only nine <lb/>
            or ten men in depth. The Mantineans, however, desisted <lb/>
            -from coming out to engage him; for the Eleians, who had <lb/>
            united their forces with them, persuaded them not to give <lb/>
            battle till the Thebans came up; for they were well assured," <lb/>
            they said, “that they would come, as they had borrowed ten <lb/>
            talents from themselves for the expenses of the expedition." <lb/>
            20. The Arcadians, hearing these assurances, remained quiet <lb/>
            in Mantineia. But Agesilaus, though he was very desirous <lb/>
            to lead off the army, for it was the middle of winter, yet <lb/>
            stayed three days where he was, that he might not seem to <lb/>
            hasten his departure through fear. On the fourth day, in the <lb/>
            morning, he set out after breakfast, with the intention of en­ <lb/>
            camping on the ground where he had encamped on his first <lb/>
            day's march from Eutæa. 21. But as none of the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians showed themselves, he proceeded, with the utmost ex­ <lb/>
            pedition, as far as Eutæa itself, though he arrived there late <lb/>
            in the evening; being desirous to bring off the heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops before they saw the enemy's fires, that no one might <lb/>
            say his departure was a flight. He seemed to have sum­ <lb/>
            ciently revived his countrymen from their former despondency, <lb/>
            since he had invaded Arcadia, and no one had thought fit to <lb/>
            encounter him while he was laying the country waste. As <pb n="509"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            soon as lie reached Laconic he disbanded the Spartans and <lb/>
            sent them home, and dismissed the periœci to their respective <lb/>
            towns.</p>
          <p>22. The Arcadians, when Agesilaus was gone, and they <lb/>
            heard that his army was disbanded, while they themselves re­ <lb/>
            mained collected, marched against the Heræans, because they <lb/>
            had refused to join the Arcadian confederacy, and because <lb/>
            they had joined the Lacedæmonians in the invasion of Arca­ <lb/>
            dia. They burst into their territory, burnt their houses, and <lb/>
            cut down their trees.</p>
          <p>But when the Thebans were reported to have come with <lb/>
            succour to Mantineia, they drew off from the lands of He­ <lb/>
            ræum, and went to join the Thebans. 23. When they came <lb/>
            together, the Thebans were of opinion that enough had been <lb/>
            done for their honour, since they had come to the aid of their <lb/>
            friends, and no longer saw any enemy in the country; and <lb/>
            they accordingly prepared to return home. But the Arcadi­ <lb/>
            ans, Argives, and Eleians persuaded them to march with all <lb/>
            possible expedition into Laconia, expatiating on their own <lb/>
            numbers, and highly extolling the Theban troops; for the <lb/>
            Bœotians, indeed, had all continued to exercise themselves in <lb/>
            arms, ever since they were elated with their victory at Leuc­ <lb/>
            tra; and the Phocians, who had submitted to their rule, the <lb/>
            Eubœans from every city of the island, both the tribes of <lb/>
            Locrians, the Acarnanians, Heracleans, and Melians were <lb/>
            following them, as well as cavalry and peltasts from Thessaly. <lb/>
            Seeing such a force collected, and insisting on the defenceless <lb/>
            condition of Lacedæmon, they entreated them " not to return <lb/>
            until they had made an incursion into the territory of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians.” 24. The Thebans listened to these argu­ <lb/>
            ments, but alleged, in reply to them, that "Laconia was said <lb/>
            to be very difficult to enter, and that they felt sure that <lb/>
            troops were posted at such points as afforded easiest admit­ <lb/>
            tance ;" for Ischolaus, in truth, was stationed at CEon in <lb/>
            Sciritis, with a party of newly-enfranchised Spartans, and the <lb/>
            youngest of the exiles from Tegea, in number about four <lb/>
            hundred ; and there was another party at Leuctrum1 above <lb/>
            the territory of Malea. The Thebans also reflected that the <note type="footnote"> I A small town in Laconia. Plutarch, Pelop. c. 20 ; Pausan. iii. <lb/>

            forces of the Lacedæmonians could soon be brought together, <lb/>
            and that they would nowhere fight better than on their owii <lb/>
            ground. Taking all these things into consideration, they were <lb/>
            not very eager to march against Lacedæmon. 25. As people, <lb/>
            however, came from Caryæ, who confirmed the account of the <lb/>
            defenceless state of the city. and offered to guide them on the <lb/>
            march, bidding them, " if they were found deceiving them <lb/>
            in anyway, to put them to death;" and as some of the <lb/>
            periœci, too, came to invite them, promising to revolt if they <lb/>
            would but show themselves in the country, and stating that <lb/>
            the periœci, when summoned by the Spartans, would not <lb/>
            even now give them any assistance," the Thebans, hearing all <lb/>
            these representations from everybody, at last yielded; and <lb/>
            they themselves entered Laconia by Caryæ, and the Arcadi­ <lb/>
            ails by Œon in Sciritis. 26. Had Ischolaus, however, ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to the part most difficult of entrance, and made a stand <lb/>
            there, it is said that no one could have gone up that way; but <lb/>
            from wishing to have the people of Œon to support him, he <lb/>
            remained in that village; and the Arcadians advanced up the <lb/>
            ascent in great numbers. Here the party of Ischolaus, as <lb/>
            long as they fought face to face with the enemy, had the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage ; but when the enemy came round them on the rear <lb/>
            and on the flank, and, climbing on the houses, assailed them <lb/>
            with spears and missiles from thence, Ischolaus was killed on <lb/>
            the spot, with all his people, unless one or two escaped unob­ <lb/>
            served. 27. The Arcadians, having been thus successful, <lb/>
            marched off towards Caryæ to join the Thebans.</p>
          <p>The Thebans, when they heard what had been done by the <lb/>
            Arcadians, marched down into the country with increased <lb/>
            spirit. They immediately burnt and devastated Sellasia, and <lb/>
            when, in proceeding through the plain, they had come to the <lb/>
            precincts of the temple of Apollo, they encamped there. Next <lb/>
            day they resumed their march; but they did not attempt to <lb/>
            cross over the bridge1 leading to the city of Sparta, for <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops of the enemy were observed in the temple <lb/>
            of Minerva Alea;2 but, keeping the Eurotas on their right, <lb/>
            they advanced along its banks, burning and laying waste <note type="footnote"> I Over the Eurotas. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Minerva Prædatrix. Pausanias, lib. iii. p. 258, says that he <lb/>

            houses full of much valuable property. 28. Of the people in <lb/>
            the city, the women could not endure to look even on the <lb/>
            smoke, as they had never seen an enemy before; while the <lb/>
            men of Sparta, having a city without walls, were stationed at <lb/>
            different posts, and, though they both were and seemed few in <lb/>
            number, kept guard round the place. The magistrates thought <lb/>
            proper, also, to issue a proclamation to the helots, that “if <lb/>
            any of them were willing to take arms, and to go into the <lb/>
            ranks, they might receive pledges that such as aided in the <lb/>
            war should be free." 29. It was said that they at once wrote <lb/>
            down the names of more than six thousand, so that, when they <lb/>
            took their places among the troops, they caused some alarm, <lb/>
            and seemed to be far too many. But after the mercenaries <lb/>
            from Orchomenus consented to stay with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and the Phliasians, Corinthians, Epidaurians, Pellenians, and <lb/>
            people from some of the other cities, came to their support, <lb/>
            they then began to have less fear of those who were enrolled.</p>
          <p>30. As for the forces of the enemy, when they had advanced <lb/>
            as far as Amyclæ, they then crossed the Eurotas. The The­ <lb/>
            bans, wherever they encamped, immediately threw as many <lb/>
            as they could of the trees which they had felled before their <lb/>
            lines, and thus made a defence for themselves; but the Area­ <lb/>
            dians took no such precautions ; for, leaving their arms, they <lb/>
            went off into the houses for plunder. On the third or fourth <lb/>
            day afterwards, all the Theban and Eleian cavalry, and as <lb/>
            many of the Phocian, Thessalian, or Locrian cavalry as were <lb/>
            with the army, advanced, in separate bodies, to the Hippo­ <lb/>
            drome at the temple of Neptune. 31. The Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            cavalry, who appeared but very few, were drawn up to op­ <lb/>
            pose them ; and, as they had placed an ambush of the younger <lb/>
            heavy-armed men, about three hundred in number, at the <lb/>
            house 1 of the Tyndaridæ, at the same moment that these men <lb/>
            in ambush started forth, the "cavalry charged that of the ene­ <lb/>
            my, who did not sustain their onset, but gave way, and many <lb/>
            of the infantry, seeing this, took to flight. But as the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians came to a stop in their pursuit, and the Theban <lb/>
            army kept its ground, they again encamped ; and it now ap- <note type="footnote">1 'Ev <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῃ̃ τω̃ν Τυνδαριδω̃ν</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκία̨</foreign>. The house which Castor <lb/>

            peared somewhat more a matter of confidence to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians that the enemy would make no further attack on the <lb/>
            city. 32. The Thebans however broke up their camp from <lb/>
            thence, and advanced along the road towards Helos and <lb/>
            Gytheium; the unwalled towns they set on fire, and made <lb/>
            assaults on Gytheium, where the dockyards of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians were, during three days. There were some of the <lb/>
            periœci, too, who rose against the Lacedæmonians and joined <lb/>
            the party of the Thebans.</p>
          <p>33. The Athenians, hearing of these proceedings, began to <lb/>
            consider how they ought to act with regard to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and, in accordance with a decree of the senate, con­ <lb/>
            voked an assembly of the people. Ambassadors from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and such of their allies as still adhered to <lb/>
            them, happened then to be at Athens ; of whom the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, Aracus, Ocyllus, Pharax, Etymocles, and Olontheus, <lb/>
            almost all spoke in a similar way; for they reminded the <lb/>
            Athenians that " the people of Athens and Lacedæmon had <lb/>
            always, on occasions of the greatest emergency, stood by-one <lb/>
            another for good ; since the Lacedæmonians,” they said, " had <lb/>
            assisted in expelling the tyrants1 from Athens, and the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans, when the Lacedæmonians were besieged by the Messeni­ <lb/>
            ans, readily came to their assistance ;” 34. they enumerated <lb/>
            also what advantages had ensued, when they both acted in con­ <lb/>
            cert, putting them in mind how they had fought in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion against the Barbarians, and bidding them recollect that <lb/>
            "the Athenians were chosen leaders of the fleet, and guardi­ <lb/>
            ans of the common treasure.2 by the advice of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and that the Lacedæmonians were confessedly pre­ <lb/>
            ferred by all the Greeks to be leaders by land through the <lb/>
            advice of the Athenians to that effect." 35. One of them also <lb/>
            expressed himself to this purpose: " If you and we, men of <lb/>
            Athens, act in unanimity, there may now be hope, according <lb/>
            to the old saying, that the Thebans will be decimated." 3 The <lb/>
            Athenians however did not listen altogether cordially to what <lb/>
            they said; for a murmur of this kind went through the as­ <lb/>
            sembly : " they say so now, but, when they were in prosperity, <lb/>
            they oppressed us." But the strongest argument used by the <note type="footnote"> 1 The Peisistratidæ. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Corn. Nep. Aristid. c. 3; Thucyd. i. 96. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See c. 3. sect. 20 </note> <pb n="513"/>

            Lacedæmonians seems to have been, that, " when they had <lb/>
            subdued the Athenians, and the Thebans wished to destroy <lb/>
            Athens utterly,1 they opposed the Thebans." 36. What they <lb/>
            most insisted2 on, however, was that " the Athenians ought <lb/>
            to send them aid in conformity with their oath, as they had <lb/>
            committed no injustice when the Arcadians and their con­ <lb/>
            federates attacked them, but were merely supporting the <lb/>
            Tegeans because the Mantineans made war on them contrary <lb/>
            to their oath." At these words, also, a great murmur per­ <lb/>
            vaded the assembly; for some said that " the Mantineans had <lb/>
            acted justly in assisting the party of Proxenus when they were <lb/>
            being put to death by that of Stasippus;" others said that <lb/>
            " they had acted unjustly in taking arms against the Tegeans."</p>
          <p>37. As these points were discussed by the assembly, Clei­ <lb/>
            teles, a Corinthian, rose and spoke thus: “It is, perhaps, a <lb/>
            point for dispute, men of Athens, who it was that began to <lb/>
            act unjustly. But with regard to ourselves, who, since the <lb/>
            peace was made, can bring a charge against us, either that we <lb/>
            have attacked any city, or have taken money from any people, <lb/>
            or have laid waste any land belonging to others ? Yet the <lb/>
            Thebans have marched into our country, have cut down our <lb/>
            trees, have burned our houses, and have carried off our cattle <lb/>
            and other property. How, therefore, if you do not assist us <lb/>
            who are thus openly in treated, will you fail of violating your <lb/>
            oaths ? oaths, too, which you yourselves took care to adminis­ <lb/>
            ter, that we might, all of us, swear religiously to all of you." <lb/>
            Here the Athenians uttered a shout, signifying that Cleiteles <lb/>
            spoke with truth and justice. 38. After him Procles of Phlius <lb/>
            arose, and spoke as follows:</p>
          <p>“That the Thebans, 0 men of Athens, will, if the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians be put out of their way, make war upon you next,1 <lb/>
            is, I think, manifest to every one ; for they regard you alone, <lb/>
            of all other people, as the obstacle that prevents them from <lb/>
            being supreme rulers of Greece. 39. If such, then, be the <lb/>
            case, I consider that, when you take the field, you will not aid <lb/>
            the cause of the Lacedæmonians more than your own; for <note type="footnote"> 1 See ii. 2. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ‘O <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ πλει̃στος ἦν λόγος</foreign>.] The meaning of these words is, “what <lb/>

            that the Thebans, who are your enemies, and who dwell upon <lb/>
            your borders, should become leaders of the Greeks, will, I <lb/>
            think, give you much more trouble than you experienced <lb/>
            when you had enemies at a distance. At least you would <lb/>
            support the Lacedæmonians, while there are still allies left to <lb/>
            them, with far more prospect of advantage to yourselves, than <lb/>
            if you should be compelled, when they are utterly overthrown, <lb/>
            to contend alone against the Thebans.</p>
          <p>40. “But if any of you are apprehensive that, if the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians now escape destruction, they may hereafter give <lb/>
            you trouble, reflect that it is not those to whom a person has <lb/>
            done good, but those to whom he has done ill, that he has <lb/>
            cause to dread, in case they should become powerful. It be­ <lb/>
            hoves you to reflect, also, that it is the duty both of individuals <lb/>
            and of communities, while they are in a flourishing condition, to <lb/>
            lay up for themselves some real advantage, in order that if ever <lb/>
            they become weak, they may have support from their previous <lb/>
            labours; and to you, by the favour of some god, is now pre­ <lb/>
            sented an opportunity, if you assist the Lacedæmonians in <lb/>
            their need, of attaching them to you as sincere friends for <lb/>
            ever. 41. For they will be seen, not by a few witnesses merely, <lb/>
            to have received kindness from you, but the gods, who see all <lb/>
            things now and for ever, will know your conduct; and both <lb/>
            your allies and your enemies, and all the Greeks and Barbari­ <lb/>
            ans besides, will be aware of what you have done; for by no <lb/>
            one will your acts be unregarded ; so that, if they show them­ <lb/>
            selves ungrateful towards you, who will ever again be ready <lb/>
            to serve them ? 42. It is fair to hope, however, that they will <lb/>
            behave well rather than ill to you ; for they may certainly <lb/>
            deserve the character, if any people ever deserved it, of having <lb/>
            persevered in the pursuit of praise, and of having abstained <lb/>
            from whatever was dishonourable.</p>
          <p>43. “In addition to these considerations, reflect also, if <lb/>
            danger should ever again fall upon Greece from the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians, in whom would you place confidence more strongly <lb/>
            than in the Lacedemonians ? Whom would you choose for <lb/>
            supporters more willingly than that people, of whom those <lb/>
            who were posted at Thermopylae preferred rather to fight and <lb/>
            die to a man, than to save their lives and let the Barbarians <lb/>
            into Greece? How can it be otherwise than just, therefore, <lb/>
            that both you and we, in whose defence they stood as brave <pb n="515"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            men in conjunction with you, and in whose defence it is to be <lb/>
            hoped that they may similarly exert themselves hereafter, should <lb/>
            manifest the utmost alacrity to serve them. 44. It is right also <lb/>
            that you should show zeal for them, from regard for their present <lb/>
            allies ; for be assured that those who continue faithful to them <lb/>
            in their calamities, will be ashamed not to show gratitude to <lb/>
            you. And though our cities, who are willing to share danger <lb/>
            with them, may seem but small, reflect that if your city joins <lb/>
            us, we shall no longer be unimportant cities for their defence.</p>
          <p>45. " I, indeed, 0 men of Athens, formerly admired this <lb/>
            city from report, because I heard that all who suffered injus­ <lb/>
            tice, or were afraid of suffering it, might seek refuge here, <lb/>
            and obtain relief. I now, however, no longer hear, but am <lb/>
            myself present among you, and see the much-extolled Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and their most faithful adherents with them, <lb/>
            coming to you and entreating you to aid them. 46. I see <lb/>
            also the Thebans, who once in vain desired the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            to enslave you, now beseeching you to allow those who saved <lb/>
            you to be destroyed. It is told to the honour of your an­ <lb/>
            cestors, that they did not suffer the dead bodies of the Argives, <lb/>
            who fell at the citadel of Thebes, to remain uninterred; but <lb/>
            it will be much more honourable to you, if you do not allow <lb/>
            such of the Lacedæmonians as are still alive, to be either ill- <lb/>
            treated or brought to nought. 47. And though it was a praise­ <lb/>
            worthy act, when you restrained the insolence of Eurystheus, <lb/>
            and preserved the children of Hercules, would it not be far <lb/>
            more praiseworthy, if you, who saved the patron-heroes1 of <lb/>
            Sparta, should save also its whole community ? But it would <lb/>
            be most praiseworthy of all, if, as the Spartans then saved <lb/>
            you by a vote without danger to themselves, you should now <lb/>
            march to their relief under arms at your own peril. 48. And <lb/>
            while we rejoice, who have exhorted you by our words to suc­ <lb/>
            cour brave men, it will appear noble in you, who are able to <lb/>
            assist them by deeds, if, after having been often friends and <lb/>
            often enemies to the Lacedæmonians, you remember not the <lb/>
            injuries which you have suffered, but the services which you <lb/>
            have received from them, and make fair repayment, not on <lb/>
            behalf of yourselves only, but on that of all Greece, because <lb/>
            they proved themselves brave men in its defence." <note type="footnote">1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρχηγέτας</foreign>.] The Lacedæmonians considered that their kinp-3 <lb/>

          <p>49. After this speech was ended, the Athenians proceeded <lb/>
            to deliberate. They could not listen with patience to those <lb/>
            who spoke against the aid, but passed a resolution “to sue­ <lb/>
            cour the Lacedæmonians with all their forced and chose Iphi­ <lb/>
            crates as commander. But when the sacrifices were auspicious, <lb/>
            and he issued orders that “the soldiers should take their slip­ <lb/>
            per in the Academy," it was said that many marched forth <lb/>
            before Iphicrates himself. However, he soon took the lead, <lb/>
            and they followed him, imagining that he was conducting <lb/>
            them to some honourable enterprise. But as, when he reached <lb/>
            Corinth, he wasted several days there, they at once blamed <lb/>
            him, in the first place, for such delay, yet, when at length he <lb/>
            led them out again, they readily followed whithersoever he <lb/>
            conducted them, and, to whatever strong-hold he brought <lb/>
            them, they readily attacked it. so. Of the enemies that had <lb/>
            been before Lacedæmon, however, the Arcadians, Argives, <lb/>
            and Eleians, had mostly withdrawn, as they dwelt on the bor­ <lb/>
            ders, and were carrying or driving off the booty that they <lb/>
            had taken. The Thebans and others, too, were inclined to <lb/>
            leave the country, partly because they saw their force daily <lb/>
            diminishing, and partly because provisions were growing in­ <lb/>
            sufficient, as some had been consumed, some carried off as <lb/>
            plunder, some wasted, and some burnt. It was, besides, <lb/>
            winter ; so that everybody was desirous to go home. 51. And <lb/>
            as the enemy thus withdrew from Lacedæmon, Iphicrates led <lb/>
            off the Athenians from Arcadia to Corinth.</p>
          <p>Whatever other enterprise Iphicrates conducted with hon­ <lb/>
            our, I have no wish to detract from the merit of it; but as to <lb/>
            all that he did on this occasion, I find that it was managed <lb/>
            by him either without judgment or with no advantage. At­ <lb/>
            tempting to post a guard at Oneium, that the Boeotians might <lb/>
            be unable to return home, he left the best pass, near Cen­ <lb/>
            chreiæ, unguarded. Wishing to ascertain whether the Thebans <lb/>
            had passed Oneium, he sent out all the Athenian and Cor­ <lb/>
            inthian cavalry to watch them; though a few might have <lb/>
            been able to observe them as well as many, and, in case they <lb/>
            were obliged to retire, it would have been much more easy <lb/>
            for a few than for many to find a commodious road and to re­ <lb/>
            treat at their ease; but to send forward large numbers, and <lb/>
            yet inferior to those of the enemy, what was it but the greatest <lb/>
            folly ? For this body of horse, drawn up, as being numerous, <pb n="517"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            over a large space, fell in, when they were obliged to retire, <lb/>
            with many difficult pieces of ground, so that not less than <lb/>
            twenty horse-soldiers were killed; and the Thebans then <lb/>
            marched off just as they pleased.</p>

          <p>An embassy is sent by the Lacedæmonians to Athens to treat of peace. <lb/>
            Procles proposes that the Athenians shall have the chief command by sea, <lb/>
            and the Lacedæmonians by land; but it is at last decided, on the pro­ <lb/>
            position of Cephisodotus, that they shall take the command alternately, <lb/>
            each for five days. The Lacedæmonians and Athenians, meeting at Cor­ <lb/>
            inth, post themselves at the mountain Oneium, whence the Thebans dis­ <lb/>
            lodge them, and, in conjunction with the Arcadians, Eleians, and Argives, <lb/>
            lay waste much of the country, but receive a check at Corinth. Twenty <lb/>
            triremes come from Dionysius, bringing cavalry that severely harass the <lb/>
            Thebans, who soon after return home. Rise of Lycomedes among the <lb/>
            Arcadians, who, excited by his counsels, incur the dislike of the Thebans <lb/>
            and Eleians. Philiscus comes into Greece with a large sum of money from <lb/>
            Ariobarzanes, and assembles the Thebans and Lacedæmonians at Delphi, <lb/>
            to re-establish peace, but, as the Lacedæmonians refuse to leave Messene <lb/>
            free, the war is continued. Auxiliaries are again sent by Dionysius ; <lb/>
            operations of Archidamus in conjunction with them. The Thebans, <lb/>
            aspiring to the supremacy in Greece, send Pelopidas as ambassador to the <lb/>
            king of Persia, whom Pelopidas induces to prescribe terms of peace ; but <lb/>
            the Corinthians, and some other states, refuse to swear to the terms of it, <lb/>
            and the attempt of the Thebans is frustrated. Epaminondas, wishing to <lb/>
            attach Achaia to the party of the Thebans, marches into the country ; the <lb/>
            chief men meet him submissively, and he makes a treaty of alliance with <lb/>
            them. Rise of Euphron at Sicyon.</p>
          <p>1. THE following year, commissioners from the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and their allies arrived at Athens, with full powers <lb/>
            to settle on what terms an alliance offensive and defensive <lb/>
            might be made between the Lacedæmonians and Athenians. <lb/>
            After several of the foreign commissioners, and several of the <lb/>
            Athenians, had signified that the alliance ought to be made on <lb/>
            fair and equal conditions, Procles of Phlius delivered the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing speech:</p>
          <p>2. "Since it has seemed good to you, 0 men of Athens, <lb/>
            to make the Lacedæmonians your friends, it appears to me <lb/>
            that you ought to consider by what means friendship may en- <pb n="518"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            dure between you as long as possible. If, therefore, we make <lb/>
            a treaty on such grounds as shall be advantageous to both <lb/>
            parties, we shall, according to all probability, mutually adhere <lb/>
            to it. As to other points, then, both parties are nearly agreed; <lb/>
            the consideration now is concerning the supremacy. By the <lb/>
            senate it has been already arranged that the supremacy at sea <lb/>
            should be yours, while that on land should belong to the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians; and this is an arrangement which appears to <lb/>
            me to be ordained, not more by human thought, than by the <lb/>
            Divine power and by circumstances. 3, In the first place, <lb/>
            you inhabit a country excellently adapted by nature for such <lb/>
            an adjustment; for many cities, that need supplies by sea, arc <lb/>
            situated around your city; and fill of them are weaker than <lb/>
            your own. You have also harbours, without which it is not <lb/>
            possible to maintain a naval power; you have numbers of <lb/>
            vessels; and to enlarge your force by sea is the occupation of <lb/>
            your country. 4. You, moreover, possess all the arts neces­ <lb/>
            sary for such purposes, as your own ; and you far excel other <lb/>
            nations in nautical experience; for subsistence is gained by <lb/>
            most of your people from the sea, so that, while you attend <lb/>
            to your private pursuits, you are acquiring the knowledge <lb/>
            requisite for naval warfare. Add to this the considera­ <lb/>
            tion, that from no harbours can more numerous fleets <lb/>
            have issued than from your own ; a consideration which is <lb/>
            indeed one of the strongest reasons for assigning you the <lb/>
            supremacy by sea; for to that which is already strong all <lb/>
            men willingly unite themselves. 5. By the gods, likewise, it <lb/>
            has been granted you to be successful in this pursuit; for, <lb/>
            having engaged in very many and most important contests by <lb/>
            sea; you have been unfortunate In but few, and have succeed­ <lb/>
            ed in the far greater number. It is natural, therefore, that <lb/>
            your allies should share the dangers of such contests with you <lb/>
            with the greatest alacrity.</p>
          <p>6. “ How necessary to you, moreover, and how naturally <lb/>
            incumbent upon you, this attention to the sea is. convince your­ <lb/>
            selves from the following considerations. The Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            were once at war with you for many years, and, though they <lb/>
            became masters of your country, could not even then attain <lb/>
            such success as to overthrow you ; but when the gods at length <lb/>
            allowed them to conquer you by sea, you at once fell entirely un­ <lb/>
            der their power. 7. It is hence, therefore, manifest that all your <pb n="519"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            safety depends on the sea; and such being the state of things,1 <lb/>
            how can it be proper for you to give up to the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            the supremacy by sea ? especially when they themselves con­ <lb/>
            fess, in the first place, that they are less skilful than you in <lb/>
            the naval art; and when, in the next place, the peril in con­ <lb/>
            tests between you at sea is not equal on both sides, for they <lb/>
            are concerned only for the men in the vessels, while you con­ <lb/>
            tend for your children, your wives, and your whole community.</p>
          <p>8. "Such is the condition of things on your side ; consider <lb/>
            next what it is on that of the Lacedæmonians. In the first <lb/>
            place, they inhabit an inland country ; so that, while they are <lb/>
            masters on land, they can even, if debarred from the sea, live <lb/>
            with sufficient comfort. Conscious of their situation, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, they practise from their very childhood exercises to <lb/>
            qualify them for warfare on land ; and, in what is of the ut­ <lb/>
            most importance, obedience to commanders,2 they are most <lb/>
            distinguished by land and you by sea. 9. Besides, as you can <lb/>
            go forth with the greatest numbers and greatest expedition <lb/>
            by sea, so can the Lacedæmonians by land ; so that their allies <lb/>
            must necessarily join them on land with the greatest confidence. <lb/>
            The gods have also granted, as to you to be successful by <lb/>
            sea, so to them to be successful by land; for, having fought <lb/>
            many battles on land, they have failed in very few, and been <lb/>
            successful in the far greater number.</p>
          <p>10. " That attention to affairs on land, therefore, is not <lb/>
            less necessary to them than attention to those at sea is to you, <lb/>
            may be readily understood from past events; for you, after <lb/>
            being at war with them for many years, and defeating them <lb/>
            several times at sea, made no progress towards subjugating <lb/>
            them; but, when they were once3 beaten by land, they were <lb/>
            immediately in peril respecting their families, their wives, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὕτως οὖν πεφυκότων</foreign>.] Se. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πραγμάτων</foreign> : just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">προχωρούντων</foreign> <lb/>

            16, and iv. 4. 15; where he observes that the republic of Lacedæ­ <lb/>

            and their whole political existence. 11. How then would it <lb/>
            be otherwise than wonderful that they should suffer others to <lb/>
            take the chief command by land, when they themselves can <lb/>
            manage affairs by land better than any other people ?</p>
          <p>“Such suggestions have I offered, in accordance with what <lb/>
            was arranged by the senate, and believe that I have recom­ <lb/>
            mended that which is most advantageous for both parties. <lb/>
            May you happily succeed in determining on the best course <lb/>
            for us all!"</p>
          <p>12. Thus spoke Procles; and the Athenians, and such of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians as were present, agreed in bestowing <lb/>
            great commendation on his advice. But Cephisodotus1 came <lb/>
            forward and said, " You do not perceive, men of Athens, that <lb/>
            you are misled, but, if you will listen to me, I will at once <lb/>
            make the matter plain to you. You are now to have the <lb/>
            command by sea; but, if the Lacedæmonians send you aux* <lb/>
            iliaries, it is certain that they will furnish you with Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nian captains, and perhaps with Lacedæmonian marines; while <lb/>
            the sailors, doubtless, will be helots or hirelings. It is over such <lb/>
            as these that you will have the command. 13. But whenever <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians call you to an expedition by land, you will <lb/>
            assuredly send them your own heavy-armed troops and cavalry; <lb/>
            and they, therefore, thus become commanders of you your­ <lb/>
            selves, while you will be commanders only of their slaves and <lb/>
            men of no value. Tell me," added he, “Timocrates of Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon, did you not just now say2 that you came hither to make <lb/>
            an alliance upon fair and equal terms?" 14. "I did say <lb/>
            so," replied Timocrates. "Can anything, then, be fairer," said <lb/>
            Cephisodotus, " than that each party should have the com­ <lb/>
            mand of the fleet alternately, and of the land forces alternate­ <lb/>
            ly ; and that you, if there is any advantage in taking the <lb/>
            command by sea, may have a share in it, as well as we in the <lb/>
            command by land?" The Athenians, on hearing this pro­ <lb/>
            posal, changed their opinion, and passed a resolution that <lb/>
            each should hold the chief command alternately for five days.</p>
          <p>15. As both parties, with their allies, then marched towards <note type="footnote">1 ‘O <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ Κεραμέων</foreign>, who was supreme in public speaking, until De­ <lb/>

            Corinth, it seemed proper to them to guard Oneium1 in con­ <lb/>
            junction ; and when the Thebans and their party approached <lb/>
            they drew up, and stood on their defence, part on one side of <lb/>
            Oneium, and part on the other, the Lacedæmonians and Pel­ <lb/>
            lenians, however, being on the quarter that was most assail­ <lb/>
            able. The Thebans and their party, when they were about <lb/>
            thirty stadia from the force on guard, encamped in the plain, <lb/>
            and calculating when they thought they might start so as to <lb/>
            accomplish the whole distance, set forward, at twilight in the <lb/>
            morning,2 to attack the force of the Lacedæmonians. 16. <lb/>
            Nor were they deceived in the time ; for they came up to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and Pellenians just when the night-watches <lb/>
            ended, and the men were rising from their couches to proceed <lb/>
            to their several duties. At this moment the Thebans3 as­ <lb/>
            sailed them, falling, as men prepared for action, upon men that <lb/>
            were unprepared, and, as men in regular order, upon men that <lb/>
            were in total disorder. 17. But when those who saved them­ <lb/>
            selves from the danger retired to the nearest eminence, and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian commander, taking as many heavy-armed <lb/>
            men from the allies, and as many peltasts, as he pleased, might <lb/>
            have kept possession of the place, (for he might have safely <lb/>
            brought provisions from Cenchreiæ,) he would not make the <lb/>
            attempt, but, though the Thebans were perplexed how to <lb/>
            descend from the heights toward Sicyon,4 or how to go back <lb/>
            again, he made a truce, more for the advantage of the The­ <lb/>
            bans, as most people thought, than of his own party, and ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly withdrew and led off his troops.</p>

            a force of ten thousand men, and that there were as many in the <lb/>

            thousand; and that, to stop the march of the Bœotians, he had <lb/>

            in safety, and joining their allies, the Arcadians, Argives, an <lb/>
            Eleians, immediately proceeded to attack1 Sicyon and Pel <lb/>
            lene. Marching also against Epidaurus, they laid waste its <lb/>
            whole territory ; and retreating from thence, in a manner that <lb/>
            showed contempt for all their enemies, they advanced, when <lb/>
            they drew near the city of Corinth, at full speed up to the <lb/>
            gates on the side towards Phlius, intending to rush in if they <lb/>
            chanced to be open. 19. But a party of light-armed men, <lb/>
            rallying forth from the city, met the chosen men of the <lb/>
            Thebans not four hundred feet distant from the wall, and, <lb/>
            mounting upon the monuments and higher places, hurled <lb/>
            down stones and javelins upon them, killed a great number <lb/>
            of the foremost, and, putting them to flight, pursued them for <lb/>
            three or four stadia. When the affair was over, the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, having dragged the bodies of the slain to the wall, and <lb/>
            afterwards restored them by truce, erected a trophy. At <lb/>
            this turn of fortune the allies of the Lacedæmonians found <lb/>
            their spirits revived.</p>
          <p>20. While these occurrences were taking place, the suc­ <lb/>
            cour from Dionysius to the Lacedæmonians arrived, consist­ <lb/>
            ing of more than twenty triremes, which carried Celts, Iberi­ <lb/>
            ans,3 and about fifty horsemen. Next day, the Thebans and <lb/>
            their allies, forming in order of battle, and covering the plain <lb/>
            down to the sea, and up to the hills near the city, destroyed <lb/>
            whatever was on the ground that could be of any service. As <lb/>
            for the Athenian and Corinthian cavalry, they made no near <lb/>
            approach to the army of the enemy, seeing how strong and <lb/>
            numerous were the troops opposed to them ; 21. but those sent <note type="footnote"> 1With what success, Xenophon does not say. Diodorus Sicu­ <lb/>

            laid waste all the neighbouring country, but without capturing any <lb/>
            town; though, at the same time, he gained over to his side Sicyon, <lb/>
            Phlius, and some other places in those parts. Pausanias casually <lb/>

            by Dionysius, few as they were, spreading themselves over <lb/>
            the plain, and galloping forward at different points, hurled <lb/>
            their javelins as they rode up, and, when the enemy started <lb/>
            forward to attack them, retreated, and then wheeled round <lb/>
            and discharged their javelins a second time. In the midst of <lb/>
            these feats, too, they would dismount from their horses and <lb/>
            rest, but if any of the enemy rode at them while they were <lb/>
            dismounted, they would easily vault into their seats and ride <lb/>
            off. Or if any pursued them to a distance from the main <lb/>
            body, they would press upon them, as soon as they began to <lb/>
            retreat, hurling their javelins at them and wounding them <lb/>
            severely, and would oblige the whole army to advance or re­ <lb/>
            tire according to their movements. 22. After these events <lb/>
            the Thebans stayed but a few days, and went off with their <lb/>
            allies to their respective homes.</p>
          <p>Soon afterwards, the auxiliaries from Dionysius made an <lb/>
            attack upon Sicyon,l and defeated the Sicyonians in a battle <lb/>
            on the plain, killing about seventy of them. They also took <lb/>
            the fortress of Dera by assault. And, having completed these <lb/>
            operations, this first2 auxiliary force from Dionysius sailed <lb/>
            away to return to Syracuse.</p>
          <p>Hitherto the Thebans, and all who had revolted from the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, had acted and taken the field with the ut­ <lb/>
            most unanimity, the Thebans retaining the command. 23. <lb/>
            But now arose3 a man named Lycomedes, a Mantinean, a <lb/>
            person of birth inferior to none, of superior wealth, and, with <lb/>
            all these advantages, of extraordinary ambition, who filled <lb/>
            the Arcadians with notions of their own importance, telling <lb/>
            them that " the Peloponnesus was their own proper country, <lb/>
            for that they alone were the original inhabitants of it; and <lb/>
            that the Arcadians were the most numerous people of Greece, <lb/>
            and in the best condition for military service." He also en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to show that they were the bravest of the Greeks, <lb/>
            offering as proofs of this assertion, that “ whenever any peo <lb/>
            ple required auxiliaries, they chose none in preference to the <lb/>
            Arcadians;" and that, "without their support, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>

            nor would the Thebans now, without the Arcadians, have <lb/>

            continued he, " you will desist from following whither othei <lb/>

            manding in return, you will perhaps soon find the Thebans <lb/>
            to be second Lacedæmonians.”</p>
          <p>The Arcadians, on hearing these arguments, were ex­ <lb/>
            tremely puffed up, and quite in love with Lycomedes, seeming <lb/>
            to think him the only mail among them; so that they ap­ <lb/>
            pointed as officers whomsoever he desired. 25. From the <lb/>
            events that had occurred, too, the Arcadians were greatly <lb/>
            exalted; for, when the Argives invaded the territory of <lb/>
            Epidaurus,1 and were prevented from retreating by the mer­ <lb/>
            cenary troops of Chabrias, and by the Athenians and Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, the Arcadians, coming to their aid, set them at liberty <lb/>
            when they were closely blockaded, though they had to contend, <lb/>
            not only with the enemy, but the difficulties of the ground. <lb/>
            Having undertaken an expedition, too, against Asine in La­ <lb/>
            conia, they overcame the Lacedæmonian garrison, killed <lb/>
            Geranor the commander, a genuine Spartan,2 and destroyed <lb/>
            the suburbs of the place. Wherever, indeed, they resolved <lb/>
            to march, neither night, nor winter, nor length of way, nor <lb/>
            difficult mountains, could stop their course, so that at that <lb/>
            time they thought themselves the most valiant of mankind <lb/>
            26. On these accounts, the Thebans began to regard the Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians with envy, and ceased to entertain feelings of friend­ <lb/>
            ship towards them. The Eleians too, as, when they solicited <lb/>
            from the Arcadians repossession of the cities of which they <lb/>
            had been deprived by the Lacedæmonians, they found that <lb/>
            they paid no attention to their requests, but showed great <lb/>
            regard for the Triphylians and others that had revolted from <lb/>
            them, because they alleged that they were Arcadians, began <lb/>
            also themselves to be unfavourably disposed towards them.</p>
          <p>27. While each3 of the allied states were thus forming high <note type="footnote">1 He means that expedition of the Argives to which he had <lb/>

            notions of themselves, Philiscus of Abydos came with a large <lb/>
            sum of money from Ariobarzanes ;1 and he, in the first place, <lb/>
            convened2 the Thebans and their allies, with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, to a consultation at Delphi concerning a peace. <lb/>
            Having assembled there, they did not consult the god how a <lb/>
            peace might be arranged, but proceeded to deliberate them­ <lb/>
            selves. But as the Thebans could not agree that Messene3 <lb/>
            should be under the Lacedæmonians, Philiscus next collected <lb/>
            a large body of mercenaries, that he might support the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians in the field.</p>
          <p>28. During these proceedings, the second4 body of auxili­ <lb/>
            aries from Dionysius arrived; and the Athenians observing <lb/>
            that it would be proper to send them into Thessaly5 to act <lb/>
            against the Thebans, while the Lacedæmonians proposed to <lb/>
            despatch them into Laconia, the latter suggestion found <lb/>
            greater favour among the allies. The troops, therefore, from <lb/>

            them under his command, and marched with them and the <note type="footnote"> But we are to understand that all were looking enviously, and with <lb/>

            Proceeding from thence, with the same force, against the <lb/>
            Parrhasians of Arcadia, he laid waste their country; but <lb/>
            when the Arcadians and Argives came to their support, he <lb/>
            retreated and encamped upon the hills at Midea.2 While he <lb/>
            was there, Cissidas, the commander of the auxiliaries from <lb/>
            Dionysius, apprized him that “the time which was appointed <lb/>
            for him to remain was expired;" and he had no sooner <lb/>
            given them this intimation than he went off towards Sparta. <lb/>
            29. But as the Messenians stopped him on his march, at a <lb/>
            narrow pass in the road, he sent back to Archidamus and so­ <lb/>
            licited succour. Archidamus accordingly proceeded to his <lb/>
            relief. But when his troops arrived at the turning towards <lb/>
            Eutresii,3 the Arcadians and Argives advanced into Laconia, <lb/>
            to cut him off from his way homewards, when he, turning <lb/>
            aside into the level piece of ground lying at the junction cf <lb/>
            the roads to Eutresii and Midea, drew up his force as if de­ <lb/>
            termined upon a battle ; and it is said that he rode along be­ <lb/>
            fore the several companies and addressed to them the follow­ <lb/>
            ing exhortation:</p>
          <p>“Soldiers and citizens, let us now, acting as brave men, <lb/>
            look up with undaunted eyes. Let us deliver our country to <lb/>
            our descendants as we received it from our forefathers. Let <lb/>
            us cease to be ashamed before our children and wives, before <lb/>
            older men and foreigners, in whose eyes we were formerly <lb/>
            the most admirable of all the Greeks."</p>
          <p>31. When these words were uttered, it is said that thunder <lb/>
            and lightning, of a propitious nature, appeared from a clear <lb/>
            sky; and there happened to be also on his right wing a <lb/>
            sacred grove and statue of Hercules, of whom Archidamus is <lb/>
            said to be a descendant.4 From all these circumstances, in <lb/>
            consequence, it is said that such spirit and boldness was pro­ <lb/>
            duced in his men, that it was difficult for the officers to re- <note type="footnote">1 A town in the territory of Laconia, which had recently re­ <lb/>

            strain them from rushing forward at once to charge the <lb/>
            enemy. Accordingly, when Archidamus led them on, those <lb/>
            few of the enemy who received their charge at the point of <lb/>
            the spear,1 were killed ; and the rest, who fled, fell some by <lb/>
            the hands of the cavalry, and others by those of the Celts. <lb/>
            32. When the battle was over, and he had erected a trophy, <lb/>
            he immediately sent home Demoteles, the herald, to announce <lb/>
            the greatness of the victory, and to say that not one of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians was killed, but a very large number of the <lb/>
            enemy. It was said, however, that the people at Sparta, <lb/>
            when they heard the news, all, beginning with Agesilaus. the <lb/>
            senators, and the ephori, shed tears; so common are tears both <lb/>
            to sorrow and joy.1 At this ill fortune of the Arcadians the <lb/>
            Thebans and Eleians were not much less pleased than the Lace­ <lb/>
            demonians ; so much were they offended at their presumption.</p>
          <p>33. As the Thebans were constantly contriving how to at­ <lb/>
            tain the sovereignty of Greece, they thought that if they sent <lb/>
            to the king of Persia, they might forward their views in some <lb/>
            degree by his means. Having accordingly summoned a meet­ <lb/>
            ing of their allies, on the pretext that Euthycles the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian was now with the king, there went up into Persia, of <lb/>
            the Thebans, Pelopidas ; of the Arcadians, Antiochus the <lb/>
            pancratiast; of the Eleians, Archidamus, and Argivus also <lb/>
            followed; and the Athenians, hearing of their departure, sent <lb/>
            up Timagoras and Leon. 34. When they had all arrived, <lb/>
            Pelopidas gained far the most influence with the Persian <lb/>
            monarch; for he could say that " the Thebans alone, of all <lb/>
            the Greeks, had joined the king of Persia at Platææ; that <lb/>
            they had never since been engaged in hostilities against the <lb/>
            king ; and that the Lacedæmonians had made war upon them <lb/>
            for this reason only, that they refused to go with Agesilaus <lb/>
            against him, and would not allow him to sacrifice to Diana at <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰς δόρυ</foreign>.] Not signifying here, as in many other places, dex­ <lb/>

            Aulis,l where Agamemnon sacrificed when he sailed to Asia <lb/>
            and took Troy." 35. It also contributed to gain Pelopidas <lb/>
            honourable attention, that the Thebans had been victorious in <lb/>
            the battle at Leuctra, and that they were known2 to have laid <lb/>
            waste the Lacedæmonian territory. Pelopidas also added that <lb/>
            “the Argives and Arcadians had been defeated by the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, because the Thebans were not with them." Tima­ <lb/>
            goras, the Athenian, bore witness to Pelopidas that he spoke <lb/>
            the truth in all these particulars, and was in consequence held <lb/>
            in honour next to Pelopidas. 36. Afterwards, Pelopidas be­ <lb/>
            ing asked by the king " what he wished to be written in the <lb/>
            letter for him," replied, that “Messene should be left inde­ <lb/>
            pendent by the Lacedæmonians, and that the Athenians should <lb/>
            lay up their fleet; that, if they refused to comply with these <lb/>
            requisitions, war should be made upon them ; and that, if any <lb/>
            state declined to follow to the field, hostilities should be di­ <lb/>
            rected against that state first." 37. These particulars being <lb/>
            accordingly committed to writing, and read over to the am­ <lb/>
            bassadors, Leon exclaimed, in the bearing of the king, “By <lb/>
            Jupiter, Athenians, it is time for you, as it appears to me, to <lb/>
            seek some other friend in place of the king." After the se­ <lb/>
            cretary had interpreted3 what the Athenian said, he again <lb/>
            brought out4 the letter with the following clause added: " but <lb/>
            if the Athenians think of anything more reasonable than this, <lb/>
            they are to go to the king and make him acquainted with it."</p>
          <p>38. As soon as the ambassadors had returned to their se­ <lb/>
            veral homes, the Athenians put Timagoras to death ; for Leon <lb/>
            brought a charge against him, that “he refused to lodge in <lb/>
            the same apartments with him," and that " he supported Pelo­ <lb/>
            pidas in all his objects." Of the other ambassadors, Archi­ <lb/>

            because he gave the preference to Elis5 over Arcadia; but <note type="footnote"> 1 See iii. 4. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐφαίνοντο</foreign>.] Not videbantur, but palam erat eos vastâsse.

            Antiochus, because the Arcadian power was slighted by him, <lb/>
            and because he received no presents, reported to the Ten <lb/>
            Thousand1 that the king had an infinite number of bakers, <lb/>
            cooks, cup-bearers, and door-keepers, but men who would be <lb/>
            capable of fighting with the Greeks he said that he had not <lb/>
            been able to see, though he looked about for them with the <lb/>
            utmost diligence; besides, he observed that that vast quantity <lb/>
            of wealth appeared to him mere ostentation, since the golden <lb/>
            plane-tree,2 so much celebrated, would be unable to afford <lb/>
            shade even to a grasshopper.</p>
          <p>39. When the Thebans had summoned deputies from all the <lb/>
            states to hear the king's letter, and the Persians who brought <lb/>
            it, after showing the king's seal, had read the contents, the <lb/>
            Thebans called on all who wished to be friends to the king <lb/>
            and to themselves, to take an oath to obey the requisitions; <lb/>
            but the deputies from the states replied that “they were not <lb/>
            sent to swear, but to hear," and told them, “if they required <lb/>
            oaths, to send to the different states to that effect." Lyco­ <lb/>
            medes the Arcadian also observed that “the congress should <lb/>
            not have been held at Thebes, but in the place where the war <lb/>
            was;”3 and as the Thebans expressed displeasure at what he <lb/>
            said, and told him that he was dissolving the confederacy, he <lb/>
            refused even to sit any longer in the council, but took his de­ <lb/>
            parture, and all the deputies from Arcadia went off with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>40. But as the deputies assembled at Thebes still declined <lb/>
            to take the oath, the Thebans sent commissioners to the <lb/>
            several states to desire them to take it, thinking that they <lb/>
            would act according to the king's letter, and that each of the <lb/>

            wanted to take no common oaths to the king," many others ot <lb/>

            having with him provisions for seven days. 42. During those <lb/>
            days the Thebans came up, and passed Oneium ; and then all <lb/>
            the confederates marched into Achaia, under the leadership of <lb/>
            Epaminondas. But as the chief men of Achaia made sub­ <lb/>
            mission2 to him, Epaminondas prevailed with them, by his in­ <lb/>
            fluence, that they should send none of the aristocracy into <lb/>
            exile, nor make any change in the government, and, having <lb/>
            received pledges from the Achæans that they would be faith­ <lb/>
            ful allies, and follow whithersoever the Thebans should lead <lb/>
            them, he turned his course homewards. 43. But as the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians, and such as were opposed to him, accused him of march­ <lb/>
            ing off home after having put Achaia in a favourable condition <lb/>
            for the Lacedæmonians,3 it was resolved by the Thebans to <lb/>
            send harmosts into the cities of Achaia, who, on their arrival, <lb/>
            expelled the aristocracy with the aid of the common people, <lb/>
            and established aristocracies throughout Achaia. However <lb/>
            the persons thus exiled, concerting soon after together, made <lb/>
            attempts upon each of the cities separately, and, being by no <lb/>
            means few in number, effected their return, and kept posses- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περιβολή</foreign>.] Conatus, stulium imperii acquirendi, as Morus rightly <lb/>

            sion of the cities. And as, on their return, they no longer <lb/>
            acted a moderate part, but zealously supported the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian interest, the Arcadians were pressed on one side by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, and on the other by the Achæans.</p>
          <p>44. At Sicyon, down to this period, the government had <lb/>
            been maintained in conformity with their ancient1 laws. But <lb/>
            at this time Euphron, who, being the most considerable of the <lb/>
            citizens in the estimation of the Lacedæmonians,2 desired also <lb/>
            to take the lead among the party opposed to them, intimated <lb/>
            to the Argives and Arcadians that if the most wealthy citizens <lb/>
            should hold the chief power at Sicyon, the city, wherever an <lb/>
            opportunity offered, would doubtless go over again to the side <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians ; "but if a democracy be established," <lb/>
            said he, " be assured that the state will continue to adhere to <lb/>
            you. If, therefore, you will support me," he added, " I will <lb/>
            take upon myself to convene the people; and I will offer you <lb/>
            this3 as a pledge of sincerity on my part, and will engage to <lb/>
            keep the city firmly in alliance with you. This course I <lb/>
            adopt," continued he, "because, you may be certain, I have <lb/>
            long been dissatisfied, like yourselves, with the haughtiness of <lb/>
            the Lacedemonians, and would willingly escape from bond­ <lb/>
            age." 45. The Arcadians and Argives, accordingly, listening <lb/>
            to these representations with pleasure, prepared to give him <lb/>
            their support; and he, without delay, assembled the people in <lb/>
            the forum, in the presence of deputies from the Argives and <lb/>
            Arcadians, as if intending that " the government should be <lb/>
            established on a basis just and equal for all." When the people <lb/>
            had met, he desired them to choose as military commanders <lb/>
            whomsoever they pleased; and they in consequence chose <lb/>
            Euphron himself, Hippodamus, Oleander, Acrisius, and Ly­ <lb/>
            sander. This matter being arranged, he appointed his own <lb/>
            son Adeas over the mercenary troops, setting aside Lysimenes <lb/>
            who had commanded them before. 46. Of these mercenary <lb/>
            troops, Euphron soon attached some to him by conferring <note type="footnote"> 1 Dindorf justly prefers <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαίους</foreign>, which is found in at least two <lb/>

            favours upon them; others lie gained by bribery, sparing <lb/>
            neither the public money nor the treasures in the temples. <lb/>
            Whatever persons, too, he banished for favouring the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, he put their property to a similar use. Of his <lb/>
            colleagues in command, he put some to death, and sent others <lb/>
            into exile; so that he brought everything under his own <lb/>
            power, and became undoubtedly a tyrant. And in order that <lb/>
            the allies might allow him to pursue this course, he partly <lb/>
            prevailed with them by sending them money, and partly by <lb/>
            following them readily to the field with his mercenaries, wher­ <lb/>

            Phlius were very much distressed and in want of provisions. <lb/>

          <p>On great states, if they have done anything to their honour, <lb/>

            a digression from the course of the history to celebrate the praises <lb/>
            of the Phliasians. There is much reference to the events related <lb/>

            small state has achieved many honourable acts, it is even still <lb/>
            more proper to set forth its praises.</p>
          <p>2. The Phliasians, for instance, became friends to the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians when they were in the greatest height of power; <lb/>
            and, when they were overthrown in the battle of Leuctra, <lb/>
            when many of the neighbouring people withdrew from them, <lb/>
            and when all the helots, and all their allies except a few, re­ <lb/>
            volted, and when all the Greeks, so to speak, made war upon <lb/>
            them, they still continued faithful to them; and though they <lb/>
            had the Arcadians and Argives for their enemies, the most <lb/>
            powerful people in the Peloponnesus, they nevertheless gave <lb/>
            them assistance; and when it was their lot to go over1 to <lb/>
            Prasiæ last of all the confederates, (and these were the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians, Epidaurians, Troezenians, Hermionians, Halians, Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians, and Pellenians,) they did not even then withdraw their <lb/>
            aid; 3. nor, though the commander of the confederates took <lb/>
            those that had crossed first, and went off leaving them behind, <lb/>
            did they turn back, but, hiring a guide at Prasiæ, penetrated <lb/>
            through the country as well as they were able, though the <lb/>
            enemy were close upon Amyclæ, and arrived at Sparta. The <lb/>
            Lacedemonians, besides paying them other marks of honour, <lb/>
            sent them an ox to entertain themselves.</p>
          <p>4. When, too, after the army had withdrawn from Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, the Argives, exasperated at the attachment of the Phlia­ <lb/>
            sians to the Lacedæmonians, directed their whole force against <lb/>
            Phlius, and laid waste their territories, they did not even on <lb/>
            that occasion submit, but when the enemy, after having spread <lb/>
            as much devastation as they could, commenced their retreat, <lb/>
            the cavalry of the Phliasians sallied forth and pursued them, <lb/>
            and though all the horse, with some companies of infantry be­ <lb/>
            hind them, guarded the rear of the Argives, they, though but <lb/>
            sixty in number, fell upon them, and put the whole rear-guard <lb/>
            tc flight. It was but a few that they killed; yet they erected <lb/>
            a trophy in the sight of the Argives, with not less boldness <lb/>
            than if they had killed them all.</p>
          <p>5. On another occasion, while the Lacedæmonians and their <note type="footnote">1 Over the Lerna, says Gail, in his version. Prasiæ was a small <lb/>

            allies were keeping guard at Oneium, and the Thebans were <lb/>
            advancing with an intention to go beyond it,1 and while the <lb/>
            Arcadians and Eleians, at the same time, were proceeding <lb/>
            through Nemea to form a junction with the Thebans, some <lb/>
            exiles from Phlius gave intimation to [the Thebans],2 that "if <lb/>
            they would only show themselves to the Phliasians, they might <lb/>
            take the city;” and as it was agreed to make the attempt, the <lb/>
            exiles, and others with them, to the number of about six hun­ <lb/>
            dred, took a position close under the wall3 by night with lad­ <lb/>
            ders ; and when the sentinels gave notice that the enemy were <lb/>
            advancing from Tricaranon,4 and the people directed their at­ <lb/>
            tention to their adversaries in that quarter, those who were <lb/>
            ready to betray their city5 made a signal to those sitting under <lb/>
            the wall to mount, 6. who, mounting accordingly, and seizing on <lb/>
            such arms belonging to the garrison as were lying unguarded, <lb/>
            went in pursuit of the day-sentinels,6 who were ten in num­ <lb/>
            ber, (for one out of every five was left as a sentinel,)7 and <note type="footnote"> 1 So as to effect an entrance, over the higher grounds, into the <lb/>

            the Thebans or their allies ; nor is it made sufficiently clear who <lb/>
            placed themselves under the walls of the citadel. It appears, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the Thebans themselves are to be understood." Schneider. <lb/>
            The account of the movements of the different parties, in this at­ <lb/>
            tack on Phlius, is so extremely obscure, that I can but faintly hope <lb/>
            that, with the help of the notes, which I borrow chiefly from <lb/>
            Schneider, I may make the narrative intelligible to the reader. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Close under the citadel. Schneider. The citadel seems not to <lb/>

            the sentinels gave notice as advancing from Tricaranon ; and the <lb/>

            killed one while he was still asleep, and another as he was <lb/>
            fleeing to the temple of Juno; and as the other sentinels in <lb/>
            their flight leaped down from the part of the wall1 that looks <lb/>
            towards the city, those who had climbed up the wall of the <lb/>
            city were indisputably masters of the citadel. 7. But as, on <lb/>
            the noise reaching the city, the citizens came out with suc­ <lb/>
            cour, the enemy,2 sallying forth from the citadel, contended <lb/>
            with them, at first in the space before the gates opening to­ <lb/>
            wards the city; but afterwards, being hemmed in by the de­ <lb/>
            fenders3 of the place, they retreated back to the citadel, and <lb/>
            the citizens rushed in with them. The space between the <lb/>
            walls and the citadel,4 accordingly, became at once clear; but <lb/>
            the enemy, climbing on the walls and the towers, hurled jave­ <lb/>
            lins and stones at those within, who defended themselves stand­ <lb/>
            ing on the ground, and maintained the contest at the foot of <lb/>
            the stairs leading up to the wall; 8. and when the citizens <lb/>
            became masters of some of the towers on each side of them, <lb/>
            they closed hand to hand, in desperation, with those that had <lb/>
            mounted them; but, being hard pressed by them, in their au­ <lb/>
            dacity and fury, were driven together into still smaller and <lb/>
            smaller space. At this very time the Arcadians and Argives <lb/>
            collected around the city, and began to make a breach in the <lb/>
            wall of the citadel at the upper part of the city; while, of <lb/>
            the people within,6 some struck at those on the wall, and some <lb/>
            at those mounting up, with their feet still on the ladders, while <lb/>
            others made head against those who had now ascended the <lb/>
            towers, and, having found fire in the tents, applied it to the <lb/>
            towers, bringing up to them from the citadel some bundles of <lb/>

            the towers, dreading the flame, then leaped down, while those <lb/>
            on the wall were struck and hurled down by the citizens; <lb/>
            and when the enemy once began to give way, the whole cita­ <lb/>
            del was soon cleared of them. The Phliasian cavalry imme­ <lb/>
            diately sallied out, and the enemy, at the sight of them, made <lb/>
            off altogether, leaving behind them the scaling-ladders and <lb/>
            the dead, and some, too, alive, that had been maimed. Of the <lb/>
            enemy, such as fought within the wall, and such as leaped <lb/>
            down from it, there were killed not less than eighty. A per­ <lb/>
            son might then have seen the men shaking each other by the <lb/>
            hand, with mutual congratulations on their safety, and the <lb/>
            women bringing them drink, and weeping, at the same time, <lb/>
            for joy. Indeed, smiles mingled with tears prevailed among <lb/>
            all those who were present on the occasion.</p>
          <p>10. Next year the Argives and Arcadians made an attack <lb/>
            upon Phlius with their whole force. The cause of their <lb/>
            continued hostility to them, was partly that they were ex­ <lb/>
            asperated with them, and partly that they saw the town of <lb/>
            Phlius lying between them, and were constantly in hopes <lb/>
            that they would reduce them to submission through want of <lb/>
            provisions. But, in this invasion also, the cavalry, and picked <lb/>
            infantry of the Phliasians, with such of the Athenian horse <lb/>
            as were with them, attacked the enemy at the crossing of the <lb/>
            river,1 and, having the advantage, forced the enemy, for the <lb/>
            remainder of the day, to retire to the tops of the hills, as if <lb/>
            anxious not to trample down any of the corn of their friends <lb/>
            in the plain.2</p>
          <p>11. On another occasion the Theban commander at Sicyon <lb/>
            made an expedition against Phlius, taking with him the Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians and Pellenians whom he had in the garrison; (for <lb/>
            those people were then accustomed to follow the Thebans;) <lb/>
            and Euphron also joined in the enterprise with his mercenaries, <lb/>

            down by Tricaranon towards the temple of Juno, as if intend­ <lb/>

            wards Corinth, lest the Phliasians, going round in that direc­ <lb/>
            tion, should occupy still higher ground above the temple of <lb/>
            Juno. 12. But when the people in the city learned that the <lb/>
            enemy were marching into the plain, the cavalry and chosen <lb/>
            infantry of Phlius went out to meet them, and, engaging with <lb/>
            them, prevented them from entering the plain. The greater <lb/>
            part of the day they spent in skirmishing on the field, the <lb/>
            troops of Euphron pursuing as far as the ground was adapted <lb/>
            for cavalry, and the people of the city as far as the temple of <lb/>
            Juno. 13. But when the enemy thought it time to retreat, <lb/>
            they went off by a circuit round Tricaranon, for the ravine <lb/>
            before the wall prevented them from taking the shortest road <lb/>
            to the Pellenians.1 The Phliasians, having followed them, a <lb/>
            short distance, to the ascent, turned off and went along the <lb/>
            road by the wall towards the Pellenians and those with them. <lb/>
            14. The party with the Theban commander, observing the <lb/>
            haste of the Phliasians, made all possible expedition to out­ <lb/>
            strip them and aid the Pellenians. But the Phliasian cavalry, <lb/>
            arriving first, attacked the Pellenians, but, as they withstood <lb/>
            their first charge, they returned to a second in conjunction <lb/>
            with such of the foot as had come up, and engaged them hand, <lb/>
            to hand, when the enemy soon gave way, and some of the <lb/>
            Sicyonians, and a large number of the bravest men of the Pel­ <lb/>
            lenians, were killed, is. Such being the case, the Phliasians <lb/>
            erected a trophy, and sung, as they had just reason, the pæan <lb/>
            of victory ; whilst the Theban commander, Euphron, and <lb/>
            their troops, stood looking at their proceedings, as if they had <lb/>
            come out on an excursion2 only to see a sight. After such a <lb/>
            termination to the affair, the one party went off to Sicyon, <lb/>
            and the others retreated into the city.</p>
          <p>16. The following is another honourable act that the Phli­ <lb/>
            asians performed. Having taken Proxenus3 of Pellene pri­ <lb/>
            soner, they gave him his liberty, though they were in want of <lb/>
            every necessary, without requiring any ransom. Who would <lb/>
            deny that people who did such things were high-minded and <lb/>
            gallant men ? <note type="footnote">1 Those who had been left with the Sicyonians, sect. 11? </note> <note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περιδεδραμηκότες</foreign>.] Morus would prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραδεδραμηκότες</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 That this word is the proper name of a man, has already been <lb/>

          <p>17. That they maintained their fidelity to their friends <lb/>
            with the most persevering constancy, is known to all; for, <lb/>
            when they were prevented from raising crops from their <lb/>
            lands, they procured subsistence, partly by taking provisions <lb/>
            from the enemy's territories, and partly by purchasing from <lb/>
            Corinth, going to market amidst many perils,1 with difficulty <lb/>
            finding money to pay, and with difficulty conciliating those <lb/>
            that could furnish them with provisions, as they could scarcely <lb/>
            produce sureties for the beasts to take them away. is. At <lb/>
            length, when they were in total distress, they prevailed upon <lb/>
            Chares to afford them a convoy. When Chares and his men <lb/>
            came to Phlius, they begged him to take the useless part of <lb/>
            the population with him as far as Pellene,2 where they left <lb/>
            them; and, having made their purchases,3 and laden as many <lb/>
            beasts as they could, they commenced their return by night, <lb/>
            not ignorant that they would be exposed to an ambush from <lb/>
            the enemy, but thinking that to want food was worse than to <lb/>
            fight. 19. They proceeded accordingly in company with <lb/>
            Chares, and, as they fell in with the enemy, they immediately <lb/>
            engaged them, and, encouraging one another, pressed them <lb/>
            with the utmost vigour, shouting at the same time to Chares <lb/>
            to support them. The victory at last being theirs, and the <lb/>
            enemy being driven from the road, they got safe back, them­ <lb/>
            selves and what they were conveying, to Phlius. As they had <lb/>
            passed the night without sleep, they slept far into the next <lb/>
            day. 20. But as soon as Chares had risen, the cavalry, and <lb/>
            the most efficient of the heavy-armed men, went to him, and <lb/>
            said,</p>
          <p>" It is in your power, Chares, to achieve to-day a most <lb/>
            honourable exploit; for the Sicyonians are building a fortress4 <note type="footnote">1 The way to Corinth passed close by the mountain on which <lb/>

            on our confines, having with them a great number of masons, <lb/>
            and but a small party of heavy-armed men. We, therefore, <lb/>
            the cavalry and the strongest of the infantry, will march <lb/>
            forth as your guides, and if you, with your mercenaries, will <lb/>
            follow us, perhaps you will find the matter settled when you <lb/>
            come to the place; or, perhaps, by merely showing yourself, <lb/>
            you will cause the enemy to take flight, as was the case at <lb/>
            Pellene.1 But if what we propose seems formidable to you, <lb/>
            consult the gods by sacrifice ; for we think that the gods will <lb/>
            exhort you, even more strongly than ourselves, to undertake <lb/>
            the enterprise; and you may be well assured, Chares, that if <lb/>
            you succeed in the attempt, you will have secured possession <lb/>
            of a fortress 2 to bear upon the enemy, you will have saved a <lb/>
            friendly city, you will be highly honoured in your own coun­ <lb/>
            try, and be greatly celebrated both among allies and enemies."</p>
          <p>21. Chares, being moved by these representations, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to sacrifice; and the horsemen of the Phliasians imme­ <lb/>
            diately put on their corselets, and bridled their horses; and <lb/>
            the heavy-armed troops made whatever preparations are ne­ <lb/>
            cessary for infantry. When they had taken their arms, and <lb/>
            were going to the place where the sacrifice was being offered, <lb/>
            Chares and the augur met them, and said that the omens were <lb/>
            propitious. " But stay a little," they added, " for we will go <lb/>
            out at once with you." As soon as notice was given by the <lb/>
            herald, accordingly, the mercenaries hastened forth with an <lb/>
            alacrity that seemed prompted by the gods. 22. When Chares <lb/>
            commenced his march, the Phliasians, horse and foot, went on <lb/>
            in front of him; they led off, at the very first, with expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, and still quickened their pace; at length the cavalry <lb/>
            hurried forward at full speed, and the infantry followed as <lb/>
            fast as they could without breaking their ranks, Chares <lb/>
            briskly keeping up with them. The time of day was a little <lb/>
            before sun-set; and, of the enemy at the fortress, they found <lb/>
            some bathing, some dressing their meat, some kneading their <lb/>
            bread, and others preparing their couches. 23. But when <lb/>
            they saw the impetuosity of the invaders' approach, they were <lb/>
            immediately struck with a panic, and took to flight, leaving <note type="footnote"> I Compare sect. 14. Schneider. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοι̃Ϛ μἐν πολεμίοιϚ ἐπιτετιχικὼϚ ἒσεὶ</foreign>.] If you seize on a fortress <lb/>

            all their provisions for the use of their brave assailants, who, <lb/>
            accordingly, supped upon what they found, and what they had <lb/>
            brought from Phlius, and, pouring libations and singing a <lb/>
            pæan for their good success, and then placing sentinels, went <lb/>

            and beasts of burden, and, loading them with corn, drove off <lb/>
            to Phlius ; and, until the building of the fortress was com­ <lb/>

          <p>Æneas, general of the Arcadians, endeavours to put an end to civil discord <lb/>
            at Sicyon. Euphron, fearing for his life, takes refuge in the harbour, <lb/>
            which he delivers into the hands of the Lacedæmonians. He afterwards <lb/>
            goes to Thebes, to bribe the Thebans to make him master of Sicyon. He <lb/>
            is put to death at Thebes by a party of his countrymen. The man that <lb/>
            killed him pleads his cause before the Theban senate, and is pronounced <lb/>
            to have acted justifiably.</p>
          <p>1. CONCERNING the Phliasians, how faithful they were to <lb/>
            their friends, how bravely they conducted themselves through­ <lb/>
            out the war, and how, though in want of every necessary, <lb/>
            they still adhered to their alliance, has now been related.</p>
          <p>About the same time Æneas of Stymphalus, being appointed <lb/>
            general of the Arcadians, and thinking that the proceedings at <lb/>
            Sicyon1 were not to be endured, marched up with his troops <lb/>
            into the citadel, called an assembly of the principal Sicyonians <lb/>
            that were in the city, and sent for such of them as had been <lb/>
            banished without any public decreed 2. Euphron, being <lb/>
            alarmed at these transactions, took refuge in the harbour of <lb/>
            Sicyon, and sending for Pasimelus from Corinth, delivered <lb/>
            up the harbour, through him, to the Lacedæmonians, and re­ <lb/>
            presented himself as in alliance with them, saying that “he <note type="footnote"> 1 On the state of things established at Sicyon, see c. 1, sect. 44. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            had still remained faithful to the Lacedæmonians; for when <lb/>
            it was put to the vote in the city, whether the Sicyonians <lb/>
            should revolt, he had voted against doing so with the mi­ <lb/>
            nority, and had afterwards instituted the democracy only from <lb/>
            a desire to be revenged on those who had deserted him. <lb/>
            3. And now," added he, “ all those who deserted you are in <lb/>
            banishment by my means. If, therefore, I had been able, I <lb/>
            should have come over to yon with the whole city; the bar­ <lb/>
            bour, of which I was master, I now give up to you." Many <lb/>
            heard these statements proceed from him; but how many be­ <lb/>
            lieved him is not at all certain.</p>
          <p>4. But since I have begun to speak of what concerned <lb/>
            Euphron, I should wish to finish the account of it. The <lb/>
            aristocracy and the common people of Sicyon being at vari­ <lb/>
            ance, Euphron, bringing with him some mercenaries from <lb/>
            Athens, returned thither, and, with the aid of the populace, <lb/>
            made himself master of the city ; but, as the Theban harmost <lb/>
            still held the citadel, and he was conscious that he should be <lb/>
            unable, as long as the Thebans were in possession of that <lb/>
            strong-hold, to retain the city under his power, he collected a <lb/>
            sum of money and went off to Thebes, designing to prevail on <lb/>
            the Thebans, by means of that money, to eject the aristocracy, <lb/>
            and to put the city again into his hands. 5. But those who <lb/>
            had previously been exiled became aware of his journey and <lb/>
            intention, and proceeded to Thebes to counteract it. As they <lb/>
            found him, however, conversing familiarly with the principal <lb/>
            men, and grew apprehensive that he would effect what he de­ <lb/>
            sired, some of them put their lives in peril, and assassinated him <lb/>
            in the citadel, while the magistrates and senate were sitting in <lb/>
            council. The magistrates then brought those who had done <lb/>
            the deed before the senate, and spoke to the following effect:</p>
          <p>6. "We arraign these persons, fellow-citizens, who have <lb/>
            killed Euphron, as guilty of death; knowing that well-prin­ <lb/>
            cipled men do nothing unjust or impious, and that wicked <lb/>
            men commit crimes indeed, but endeavour to keep themselves <lb/>
            undiscovered; but these persons have so far exceeded all <lb/>
            other men in daring and atrocity, that they have, of their own <lb/>
            will, assassinated this man before the very magistracy, and in <lb/>
            presence of you yourselves, who have the sole authority of <lb/>
            pronouncing who ought and who ought not to die. If these <lb/>
            persons, therefore, shall not suffer the severest penalty of the <pb n="542"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            law, who will ever visit your city with confidence ? Or <lb/>
            what indeed will become of the city, if any one that pleases <lb/>
            shall be allowed to kill a stranger, before he has even made <lb/>
            known to us for what purpose lie has come ? We therefore, <lb/>
            I say, arraign these men as guilty of the greatest impiety and <lb/>
            injustice, and of having shown the utmost contempt for this <lb/>
            city. You, after giving them a hearing, award them what­ <lb/>
            ever kind of punishment they appear to deserve."</p>
          <p>7. Thus spoke the magistrates. Of the assassins, all the <lb/>
            rest, except one, severally denied that they had struck the <lb/>
            blow; but that one avowed himself guilty, and proceeded to <lb/>
            plead in his defence to the following effect:</p>
          <p>" It is impossible, 0 Thebans, for a man who is aware that <lb/>
            you have absolute power to do whatever you please with him, <lb/>
            to show disrespect for you. On what, then, did I place my <lb/>
            confidence, when I killed the man in this place ? Be assured <lb/>
            that I trusted, in the first place, to a conviction that I was <lb/>
            doing what was right, and, in the next, to a persuasion that <lb/>
            you would form a just judgment concerning the deed. For <lb/>
            I knew that you yourselves, in the case of Archias, Hypates, <lb/>
            and their accomplices,1 whom you found guilty of practices <lb/>
            like those of Euphron, did not wait for a legal decision, but <lb/>
            inflicted vengeance on them as soon as you could, in the per­ <lb/>
            suasion that sentence of death has already been pronounced <lb/>
            by all men on those who are openly impious, acknowledged <lb/>
            traitors, and attempting to make themselves tyrants. s. Was <lb/>
            not Euphron, then, guilty of all these crimes ? Having found <lb/>
            the temples full of gold and silver offerings, he exhibited them <lb/>
            stripped of all. A traitor who could more manifestly be than <lb/>
            Euphron, who, though most friendly to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            chose your side instead of theirs, and, having given you <lb/>
            pledges, and received pledges from you, deserted you again, <lb/>
            and gave up the harbour of Sicyon to your enemies ? Was <lb/>
            not he a tyrant, too, without excuse, who made slaves, not <lb/>
            merely free, but even citizens, and who put to death, banished, <lb/>
            and deprived of their property, not those who had been guilty <lb/>
            of crimes, but those whom he pleased, and who were the most <lb/>
            honourable men in Sicyon ? 9. Returning again also to the city, <lb/>
            by the aid of the Athenians, your greatest enemies, he took <note type="footnote"> 1 Who were killed by the Theban conspirators when the citadel <lb/>
            Df Thebes was recovered from the Lacedæmonians. B. iv. c. 4. </note> <pb n="543"/>

            up arms against your own harmost, and, when he was unable <lb/>
            to expel him from the citadel, he collected a sum of money, <lb/>
            and came off hither. Had he openly collected an armed force <lb/>
            against you, you would have felt grateful to me for killing <lb/>
            him ; and now, when I have taken vengeance on the man <lb/>
            who came prepared with money, intending to corrupt you with <lb/>
            it, and to persuade you to make him once more master of Si­ <lb/>
            cyon, how can I with justice meet death at your hands ? Men <lb/>
            who are compelled to any act by force of arms, are wronged, <lb/>
            but are not proved to be unjust; but those who are corrupted <lb/>
            by money to act contrary to justice, are not only wronged, <lb/>
            but covered with disgrace.</p>
          <p>10. “If indeed he had been an enemy to me, and a friend <lb/>
            to yon, I confess that it would not have been well for me to <lb/>
            put him to death before you ;but how could he who was a <lb/>

            But some one, by Jupiter, may say, ‘He came hither of <lb/>
            his own free will.”1 Then, if any one had killed him at a <lb/>
            distance from your city, he would have received praise; and <lb/>
            now, when he had actually come back to it to add other crimes <lb/>
            to his previous ones, will any one say that he was not justly <lb/>
            put to death ? When can any man show that there are terms <lb/>
            of peace to be observed by Greeks with traitors, or persons <lb/>
            that change sides time after time, or tyrants? 11. Recollect, <lb/>
            besides, that you yourselves made a decree that exiles might <lb/>
            be brought off to justice out of any of the allied cities; and <lb/>
            as for that man who, though an exile, returned without the <lb/>
            sanction of a common decree3 of the allies, can any one say <lb/>
            that it was not just that he should die ? I say therefore, 0 <lb/>
            men of Thebes, that if you put me to death, you will have <lb/>
            avenged the cause of your greatest enemy; but that, if you <note type="footnote"> 1 These words are nothing to the purpose. I think that Xenophon <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The town of Oropus, in alliance with the Athenians, is seized by a party o. <lb/>
            exiles from it. The Arcadians enter into an alliance with the Athenians, <lb/>
            who, at the same time, in vain attempt to make themselves masters of <lb/>
            Corinth. The Corinthians become allies of the Lacedæmonians and The­ <lb/>
            bans, on condition that they be allowed to abstain from war. Dionysius <lb/>
            the younger sends aid to the Lacedæmonians, who take Sellasia. The <lb/>
            Eleians take possession of Lasion. The Arcadians, after occupying Elis, <lb/>
            are driven from it, but, as the Eleians are divided into factions, overcome <lb/>
            one faction by the aid of the other. The Achæans join the Eleians ; the <lb/>
            Arcadians occupy Olurus, but are expelled from it. The Arcadians are <lb/>
            successful in another expedition. The Lacedæmonians, incited by the <lb/>
            Eleians to make war on the Arcadians, seize on Cromnus, which is imme­ <lb/>
            diately besieged by the Arcadians. Ill success of Archidamus. Exiles <lb/>
            from Elis take Pylos. The Lacedæmonians endeavour to bring off their <lb/>
            garrison from Cromnus, but more than a hundred of them fall into the <lb/>
            hands of the Arcadians. The time of the Olympic games approaches ; <lb/>
            contentions between the Arcadians and Eleians as to the celebration of <lb/>
            them. The Arcadians appropriate the sacred treasures at Olympia to the <lb/>
            payment of their soldiers; the Mantineans and others oppose this sacri­ <lb/>
            lege. The Arcadians ask assistance from the Thebans, who refuse it, and <lb/>
            make peace with the Eleians. The chief men of the Arcadians, and a <lb/>
            Theban general, make several of the Eleians and Mantineans prisoners at <lb/>
            a banquet; but most of them escape. The Theban general is accused by <lb/>
            the Arcadians at Thebes; Epaminondas is favourable to him, and threat­ <lb/>
            ens to make war on the Arcadians for having made peace without the <lb/>
            authority of the Thebans.</p>
          <p>i. THE affair of Euphron has now been related ; and I <lb/>
            shall return to the point from which I digressed to give an <lb/>
            account of it. While the Phliasians were still fortifying <lb/>
            Thyamia, and Chares continued with them, Oropus1 was <lb/>
            seized by the citizens who had been exiled from it. As the <note type="footnote"> 1 A town on the frontiers of Boeotia and Attica, for the possession <lb/>
            of which the inhabitants of both countries were frequently contend­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            Athenians took the field with their whole force to recover it, <lb/>
            and recalled Chabrias from Thyamia, the harbour of Sicyon <lb/>
            was again occupied by the citizens themselves and Arcadians. <lb/>
            But of the allies of the Athenians none came to their aid; <lb/>
            and they in consequence retreated, putting Oropus into the <lb/>
            hands of the Thebans until the disputes about the possession <lb/>
            of it should be judiciously settled.</p>
          <p>2. Lycomedes, understanding that the Athenians were dis­ <lb/>
            satisfied with their allies, because, though they themselves had <lb/>
            taken great trouble in their behalf, no one gave them assist­ <lb/>
            ance in return, prevailed on the Ten Thousand1 to treat with <lb/>
            them respecting an alliance. At first, some of the Athenians <lb/>
            were displeased that, as they were friends to the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, they should join in alliance with their enemies, but <lb/>
            when, after some consideration, they found that it was not <lb/>
            less for the interest of the Lacedæmonians than for their own, <lb/>
            that the Arcadians should stand in no need of the Thebans, <lb/>
            they consented to form an alliance with the Arcadians. 3. <lb/>
            Lycomedes, after completing the negotiation, lost his life, as <lb/>
            he was returning from Athens, by a most singular interposi­ <lb/>
            tion of the gods ; for when there were a large number of ships <lb/>
            going to sail, and he had fixed upon the one which he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred, agreeing with the captain to land him wherever he <lb/>
            might desire, he determined on landing in that very spot where <lb/>
            the exiles happened to be, and thus lost his life; but the alli­ <lb/>
            ance was ratified.</p>
          <p>4. Demotion2 having chanced to observe in the public as­ <lb/>
            sembly of the Athenians, that the alliance with the Arcadians <lb/>
            appeared to him to be a judicious measure," but adding that <lb/>
            " they ought to enjoin upon the generals to take care that <lb/>
            Corinth might be preserved to the people of Athens," the <lb/>
            Corinthians, hearing of this remark, immediately despatched <lb/>
            efficient garrisons of their own men to all places where there <lb/>
            were Athenians in garrison, and gave them notice " to depart, <lb/>
            as they no longer wanted men for their garrisons." They <lb/>
            complied with this requisition; and when the Athenians from <lb/>
            the garrisons had assembled in the city of Corinth, the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians made proclamation, that “if any Athenian had been <lb/>
            wronged, he should give in his name, as he would receive <note type="footnote"> I See c. 1, sect. 38. </note><note type="footnote">2 Of this man I find no mention elsewhere. Schneider. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. II. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 N </note> <pb n="546"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            what was just.”1 5. While affairs were in this state, Chares <lb/>
            arrived with his fleet at Cenchreiæ; and, when he learned <lb/>
            what had been done, he gave out that, " having heard of a <lb/>
            design formed upon the city, he had come to its aid." The <lb/>
            Corinthians, though they did not refuse him commendation, <lb/>
            would nevertheless not admit his ships into the harbour, but <lb/>
            desired him to steer off. To the heavy-armed troops2 they <lb/>
            did justice, and sent them away. In this manner were the <lb/>
            Athenians kept out of Corinth. 6. Their cavalry, however, they <lb/>
            were obliged to send to the aid of the Arcadians, in conform­ <lb/>
            ity with the terms of the alliance, if any hostile power in­ <lb/>
            vaded Arcadia. But they never entered Laconia in a hostile <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>The Corinthians, reflecting how difficult it would be for <lb/>
            them to maintain themselves in security, as they had previ­ <lb/>
            ously been overpowered by land, and as the Athenians were <lb/>
            also become unfavourable to them, resolved to take into their <lb/>
            pay bodies both of foot and horse. At the head of these, they <lb/>
            at once protected their city, and did great damage to their <lb/>
            neighbouring enemies. However, they sent deputies also to <lb/>
            Thebes, to ask " whether, if they came thither in form, they <lb/>
            could obtain peace?" 7. The Thebans desiring them to <lb/>
            come, as peace would be made with them, the Corinthians <lb/>
            entreated them also to allow them to consult their allies, "since <lb/>
            they would make peace," they said, "in conjunction with such <lb/>
            as desired it, and leave such as preferred war to continue at <lb/>
            war." As the Thebans allowed them to do so, the Corinthians <lb/>
            went to Lacedæmon, and said,</p>
          <p>8. " We are come to you, men of Lacedæmon, as your <lb/>
            friends, and we entreat, that if you see any prospect of safety <lb/>
            for us, should we continue at war, to inform us what it is, <lb/>
            but, if you think our affairs reduced to the utmost extremity, <lb/>
            to make peace in concert with us, should it be for your ad­ <lb/>
            vantage ; for with no people would we more gladly secure <lb/>
            safety than with you. But if you think it for your interest <lb/>
            to continue the war, we beg you at least to allow us to make <lb/>
            peace for ourselves; for, if we are now preserved, we may <lb/>
            again, at some time, be in a condition to serve you; but if <note type="footnote"> 1 As to their pay, since they were mercenaries. Compare sect. 5. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4 ].</note> <lb/>
            we are ruined, it is plain that we shall never be of service to <lb/>
            you hereafter."</p>
          <p>9. The Lacedæmonians, on hearing these solicitations, ad­ <lb/>
            vised the Corinthians to make peace, and gave permission to <lb/>
            such of the other confederates as were unwilling to continue <lb/>
            the war with them,1 to desist from it; as for themselves, they <lb/>
            said that “they would go on with the war, and do whatever <lb/>
            might please the gods, but would never submit to be deprived <lb/>
            of Messene,2 which they had inherited from their forefathers."</p>
          <p>10. The Corinthians, on receiving this permission, proceeded <lb/>
            to Thebes to make peace. The Thebans, however, required <lb/>
            of them "to swear to an alliance with them;" but they re­ <lb/>
            plied that “an alliance with them would not be peace, but <lb/>
            merely a change in the war;" adding that “ they were come <lb/>
            to make, if the Thebans would consent, a fair peace.”3 The <lb/>
            Thebans, admiring their spirit, since, though in peril, they <lb/>
            would not go to war with their benefactors,4 consented to a, <lb/>
            peace with them and the Phliasians, and whatever other <lb/>
            parties had come with them to Thebes, on the condition that <lb/>
            " they should each keep their own territory;" and oaths were <lb/>
            taken to the observance of it.</p>
          <p>u. The Phliasians, when an arrangement was thus made, <lb/>
            withdrew at once from Thyamia; but the Argives, though <lb/>
            they had sworn to make peace on the same terms as the Phli­ <lb/>
            asians, yet, when they could not arrange that the Phliasian <lb/>
            exiles5 should remain in Tricaranon, as if they were in their <lb/>
            own city,G took possession of the place, and put a garrison in <lb/>
            it, saying that the land on which it stood, and which they had <lb/>
            lately laid waste as belonging to their enemies, was their own; <lb/>
            and though the Phliasians invited them to submit the matter <lb/>
            to arbitration, they refused to comply.</p>

            his arrival, assisted them in the reduction of Sellasia,l and, <lb/>
            having accomplished that object, sailed off home.</p>
          <p>Not long after this the Eleians took possession of Lasion,2 <lb/>

            overlook the proceeding, but instantly called their forces to­ <lb/>
            gether, and marched to the relief of the place. The three <lb/>
            hundred, and also four hundred,3 of the Eleians, came out to <lb/>
            oppose them. After the Eleian troops had lain encamped in <lb/>
            front of the enemy during the day, on a level piece of ground, <lb/>
            the Arcadians in the night went up to the top of the hill <lb/>
            which overhung the Eleians, and, at day-break the next <lb/>
            morning, marched down upon them. The Eleians, seeing that <lb/>
            the Arcadians were coming on with the advantage of the <lb/>
            ground, and that they were far more numerous than them­ <lb/>
            selves, were ashamed to flee while they were yet at a distance, <lb/>
            and advanced to meet them, but, on receiving their charge, <lb/>
            took to flight; and, as they had to retreat through difficult <lb/>
            places, they lost many of their men and many of their arms.</p>
          <p>14. The Arcadians, having achieved this object, proceeded <lb/>
            against the towns of the Acroreians,4 and having captured <lb/>
            them all, except Thraustus, arrived at Olympia, where they <lb/>
            erected a palisading round the hill of Saturn,5 placed a gar­ <lb/>
            rison on it, and made themselves masters of the mountain of <lb/>
            Olympia. They took also the town of the Marganians, some <lb/>
            of the people delivering the place into their hands. Such <lb/>
            being the success of the Arcadians, the Eleians were in utter <lb/>
            despair; the Arcadians advanced up to the city of Elis, and <lb/>
            penetrated into it as far as the forum, where however the <lb/>

          <p>15. There had been for some time previous discord in Elis ; <lb/>
            for the party of Charopus, Thrasonides, and Argivus1 were <lb/>
            forming the government in a democracy; while that of Stal­ <lb/>
            cas, Hippias, and Stratolas were trying to bring it to an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy. But when the Arcadians, with so large a force, <lb/>
            appeared as supporters to those inclined to a democracy, the <lb/>
            party of Charopus grew consequently bolder, and having bar­ <lb/>
            gained with the Arcadians for aid, took possession of the <lb/>
            citadel. 16. The cavalry and the three hundred, however, <lb/>
            were not slow to act, but instantly marched up and expelled <lb/>
            them; so that about four hundred of the citizens, with Ar­ <lb/>
            givus and Charopus, were forced to become exiles. But not <lb/>
            long after, these exiles, uniting with them a party of Arcadians, <lb/>
            seized upon Pylas ;2 and many of the populace from the city <lb/>
            went out to join them, as it was a fine place, and they had the <lb/>
            great force of the Arcadians to support them.</p>
          <p>The Arcadians, too, afterwards made another incursion <lb/>
            into the territory of the Eleians, being persuaded by the exiles <lb/>
            that the city of Elis would come over to them. 17. But the <lb/>
            Achæans, who were then in friendship with the Eleians, de­ <lb/>
            fended their city; so that the Arcadians retired without <lb/>
            doing anything further than laying waste the country. Hear­ <lb/>
            ing, however, as soon as they had quitted the territory of Elis, <lb/>

            when they heard of the seizure of Olurus, they made a circuit, <lb/>
            as large as they could, and lodged themselves in their own city <lb/>
            of Pellene. They then maintained a war with the Arcadians <lb/>
            in Olurus, and with all their own populace;4 and, though <note type="footnote"> 1 See c. 1, sect. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Not the city on the coast of Messene, but a town in Elis, dis­ <lb/>

            had reduced Olurus by siege.</p>
          <p>19. The Arcadians made yet another incursion into Elis. <lb/>
            But as they were encamped between Cyllene and the city of <lb/>
            Elis, the Eleians made an attack upon them; but the Arca­ <lb/>
            dians sustained their charge, and defeated them. Androma­ <lb/>
            chus, the commander of the Eleian cavalry, who appears to <lb/>
            have been the adviser of the engagement, committed suicide; <lb/>
            the rest of the Eleians retreated into their city. There was <lb/>
            killed in this battle a Spartan named Soclides, who chanced <lb/>
            to be present; for the Lacedæmonians were now become allies <lb/>
            to the Eleians. 20. But the Eleians, being hard pressed within <lb/>
            their own territory, sent ambassadors to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            and entreated them to make war on the Arcadians, thinking <lb/>
            that they should thus stop the course of the Arcadians most <lb/>
            effectually, if they were assailed on both sides. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence Archidamus took the field with the forces of Sparta, <lb/>
            and seized upon Cromnus; and then, leaving there three of <lb/>
            his twelve1 companies as a garrison, returned home. 21. The <lb/>
            Arcadians, however, as their troops were still assembled after <lb/>
            their expedition into Elis, hastened to the relief of Cromnus, <lb/>
            and encircling it with a double line of palisading, besieged, <lb/>
            while they themselves were within defences, the Lacedfemo­ <lb/>
            nians who were in the town. The government of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, annoyed at this siege of their own countrymen, <lb/>
            sent out an army, Archidamus taking the command also on <lb/>
            that occasion. Having arrived at the scene of warfare, Ar­ <lb/>
            chidamus laid waste as much as he could of Arcadia and Sci­ <lb/>
            ritis, and tried every means in his power to draw off the <lb/>
            besiegers. But the Arcadians were not the more induced to <lb/>
            move, and paid no regard to all his proceedings. 22. Archida­ <lb/>
            mus, however, taking a view of a hill, over which the Arcadians <lb/>
            had carried their exterior line of palisading,2 thought that he <lb/>
            might secure it, and that, if he had it in his possession, the <lb/>
            besiegers at the foot of it would not be able to maintain their <lb/>
            position. As he was leading round his troops, accordingly, <lb/>
            towards that quarter, and his peltasts, advancing before the <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare c. 5, sect. 10. Dindorf. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Arcadians had extended their outermost circuit of palisading <lb/>

            rest, caught sight of the Epariti1 on the outside of the palis­ <lb/>
            ading, they at once fell upon them, and the cavalry endeavoured <lb/>
            to support their charge. The Arcadians did not retreat, but <lb/>
            collected themselves into a body, and remained quiet. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians charged them a second time, but as they did <lb/>
            not then retire, but even advanced upon their assailants, and <lb/>
            as a great noise now arose, Archidamus himself came up to <lb/>
            the support of his party, turning aside into the carriage-road <lb/>
            that leads to Cromnus, and leading on his men two abreast, <lb/>
            the order in which he happened to have them. 23. When they <lb/>
            drew near each other, the party of Archidamus in a line,2 as <lb/>
            men proceeding along a road, and the Arcadians in a body, <lb/>
            with their shields close together, the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            unable to withstand the mass of Arcadians, and Archidamus <lb/>
            was soon wounded through the thigh, and those that fought <lb/>
            in front of him, Polyænidas, and Chilon who had married <lb/>
            the sister of Archidamus, were killed; and indeed in all not <lb/>
            less than thirty of the Spartans lost their lives on the occa­ <lb/>
            sion. 24. When the Lacedæmonians however had retreated <lb/>
            along the road, and reached the open ground, they then formed <lb/>
            again to receive the enemy; while the Arcadians stood their <lb/>
            ground, in battle-array as they were, and, though inferior In <lb/>
            number, were in much higher spirits, as having advanced on <lb/>
            the retreating enemy, and having killed several men. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians indeed were greatly dejected, as they saw <lb/>
            Archidamus wounded, and heard the names of those who <lb/>
            were killed, men of great bravery and almost of the highest <lb/>
            rank. 25. And as, when they were near each other, one of <lb/>
            the old men exclaimed, " Why should we prolong the contest, <lb/>
            my fellow-soldiers, and not rather make a truce and separ­ <lb/>
            ate ? " both sides listened to the proposal gladly, and made a <lb/>
            truce. The Lacedæmonians then took up their dead and <lb/>
            marched away; and the Arcadians, returning to the spot from <lb/>
            which they first began to advance, erected a trophy.</p>
          <p>26. While the Arcadians were thus employed round Crom- <note type="footnote"> 1 See note on sect. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Kara <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέϱας</foreign>.] In the Anabasis, iv. 6. 6, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ κέρας ἂγειν</foreign> signifies <lb/>

            nus, the Eleians from the city went in the first place against <lb/>
            Pylos,1 and fell in with the Pylians who had been repulsed <lb/>
            from Thalamæ.2 The cavalry of the Eleians, catching sight <lb/>
            of them as they were riding up, made no hesitation, but at­ <lb/>
            tacked them at once, and killed some of them, while others <lb/>
            fled to a hill. When the infantry however came up, they <lb/>
            overthrew those on the hill also, of whom they killed some, <lb/>
            and took others alive to the number of nearly two hundred. <lb/>
            Whatever of their prisoners were foreigners they sold; all <lb/>
            that were exiles they put to the sword. The Pylians, with <lb/>
            their town, as none came to their aid, they soon after reduced <lb/>
            under their power, and also recovered the town of the Marga­ <lb/>
            neans. But the Lacedæmonians, marching to Cromnus some <lb/>
            time after in the night, made themselves masters of that part <lb/>
            of the palisading which was in the quarter of the Argives,3 <lb/>
            and instantly called on such of the Lacedæmonians as were <lb/>
            besieged in the place to come forth. As many, accordingly, <lb/>
            as happened to be near, and quickly took advantage of the <lb/>
            opportunity, came out, but those whom a number of the <lb/>
            Argives, gathering to the rescue, intercepted, were shut up <lb/>
            within,4 and being made prisoners, were divided among the <lb/>
            captors, the Argives taking one part, the Thebans one, the <lb/>
            Arcadians another, and the Messenians another. The number <lb/>
            of Spartans and periœci captured at this time was in all more <lb/>
            than a hundred.</p>
          <p>28. As soon as the Arcadians ceased to be engaged with <lb/>
            affairs at Cromnus, they again turned their attention to the <lb/>
            Eleians, and not only occupied Olympia with a stronger <lb/>
            garrison, but, as the Olympic year was coming on, prepared <lb/>
            to celebrate the Olympic games in conjunction with the people <lb/>
            of Pisa, who assert that they were the original guardians of <lb/>

            Olympiad, in which everything was conducted by force, and the <lb/>
            Pisans and Arcadians took the management of the games, in the </note> <pb n="553"/>

            Olympic games are performed, and the days on which the <lb/>
            grand assembly comes together, the Eleians, making open <lb/>
            preparations for the purpose, and calling on the Achæans to <lb/>
            aid them, began to march along the road to Olympia. 29. The <lb/>
            Arcadians had not supposed that they would come to inter­ <lb/>
            rupt them, and were, with the people of Pisa, conducting the <lb/>
            festival. The chariot-race they had already finished, as well <lb/>
            as the foot-race of the pentathlum;1 and those who had come <lb/>
            to wrestle were not then on the course, but were wrestling <lb/>
            between the course and the altar; for the Eleians had now ad­ <lb/>
            vanced under arms to the sacred grove. The Arcadians ad­ <lb/>
            vanced towards them only so far as to draw themselves up on <lb/>
            the bank of the river Cladaus, which, running by the Altis,2 <lb/>
            discharges itself into the Alpheius; and some allies were <lb/>
            there to support them, about two thousand heavy-armed <lb/>
            Argives, and about four hundred Athenian cavalry.3 30. <lb/>
            The Eleians drew themselves up on the other side of the river, <lb/>
            and, after sacrificing, advanced at once to charge them; and <lb/>
            though in former times they had been held in contempt, as to <lb/>
            warlike qualifications, by the Arcadians and Argives, and <lb/>
            held in contempt also by the Achæans and Athenians, they <lb/>
            nevertheless, on that day, advanced at the head of their <lb/>
            allies as if they were the bravest of mankind, and put the <lb/>
            Arcadians, with whom they engaged first, immediately to <lb/>
            flight, and, receiving the charge of the Argives, who came <lb/>
            to their support, got the advantage over them. 31. Even <lb/>
            when they had repulsed the enemy as far as the space be­ <lb/>
            tween the senate-house and the temple of Vesta, and the <lb/>
            theatre which extends towards them, they, nevertheless, con­ <lb/>
            tinued the contest, and forced them back to the very altar, <lb/>
            but, being galled with missiles from the porticos, the senate- <lb/>
            house, and the great temple, and having to contend with the <lb/>
            enemy also on the ground, a number of the Eleians were <lb/>
            killed, and among them Stratolas, the commander of the three <note type="footnote"> number of the Olympiads. The month was the Athenian Heca­ <lb/>

            hundred.1 The conflict being ended, they retired to their <lb/>
            own camp; but the Arcadians and their party were so much <lb/>
            in dread of the following day, that they did not rest the whole <lb/>
            night, employing themselves in cutting up the elaborately <lb/>
            decorated tents, and constructing a rampart for their defence. <lb/>
            The Eleians, on their part, advancing towards the enemy <lb/>
            next day, and seeing the strong wall in front of them, with <lb/>
            numbers of men mounted on the temples, retired to the city, <lb/>
            having proved themselves such characters as a god, by in­ <lb/>
            spiring them with valour, may enable men to show themselves <lb/>
            even in a single day, and such characters as men, even in the <lb/>
            longest time, could not enable those who are not naturally <lb/>
            brave to be.</p>
          <p>33. As the commanders of the Arcadians were appropriat­ <lb/>
            ing the sacred treasures to their own use, and maintaining their <lb/>
            Epariti2 with the aid of them, the Mantineans were the first <lb/>
            to pass a resolution that they should not use the sacred <lb/>
            money;" and having themselves raised the contribution due <lb/>
            from their own city for the payment of the Epariti, they sent <lb/>
            it to the commanders. But the commanders, charging them <lb/>
            with weakening the Arcadian power, summoned their magis­ <lb/>
            trates before the Ten Thousand, and, as they did not obey <lb/>
            the summons, passed sentence upon them, and despatched the <lb/>
            Epariti to bring the condemned before them. The Manti­ <lb/>
            neans however closed their gates, and would not admit them <lb/>
            into the city. 34. But, in consequence, some others, even <lb/>
            among the Ten Thousand themselves, soon proceeded to re­ <lb/>
            mark that " they ought not to use the sacred money, nor to <lb/>
            leave on their posterity for ever the stain of such a crime against <lb/>
            the gods.” As it was therefore resolved in the council that <note type="footnote">1 Sect. 13, 16. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Epariti, mentioned here and in sect. 22 and 36, are mer­ <lb/>
            cenary soldiers in the army of the Arcadians. In c. 5, sect. 3, de­ <lb/>
            puties from the Epariti are also said to have been sent by the Arca­ <lb/>

            read. Morus supposes them to have been a body of Arcadian <lb/>
            soldiers, and I can offer no better suggestion ; they seem to me to <lb/>
            have been somewhat similar to the three hundred of the Eleians. <lb/>

            deserted their ranks, while such other persons as could, en­ <lb/>

            not that they might be subject to the others, but that the <lb/>
            others might be subject to them. But such of the command­ <lb/>
            ers as had had the management of the sacred money, knowing <lb/>
            that if they were called to account, they would be in danger <lb/>
            of being put to death, sent messengers off to Thebes, and ac­ <lb/>
            quainted the Thebans that " unless they despatched an army <lb/>
            thither, the Arcadians would be likely to join the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians again." 35. The Thebans accordingly prepared to take <lb/>
            the field; but those who most consulted the interests of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus, prevailed on the supreme council of the Area­ <lb/>
            dians to send ambassadors to the Thebans, and to request them <lb/>
            " not to enter Arcadia under arms, unless the government of <lb/>
            the Arcadians invited them." Nor did they only send this <lb/>
            message to the Thebans, but also reasoned among themselves <lb/>
            that " they had no need of war;" for they thought that they <lb/>
            had no cause to hold the presidency of the temple of Jupiter, <lb/>
            but that they should act with greater justice and piety by re­ <lb/>
            storing it to the Eleians, and should by that means give <lb/>
            greater satisfaction to the god; and as the Eleians had <lb/>
            similar wishes, it was resolved by both sides to establish a <lb/>
            peace. A truce was made accordingly.</p>
          <p>36. The oaths being taken, and not only all the other <lb/>
            parties, but also the Tegeans, and the Theban captain who <lb/>
            was then in Tegea with three hundred heavy-armed Bœotians, <lb/>
            having sworn, the other Arcadians, who were then in Tegea, <lb/>
            remained there, and made feasts and enjoyed themselves, pour­ <lb/>
            ing libations and singing pæans in the belief that peace was <lb/>
            settled; but the Theban captain, and such of the Arcadian <lb/>
            commanders as feared to be called to account, shut the gates <lb/>
            in the wall of Tegea, in concert with the Boeotians and such <lb/>
            of the Epariti as were ready to support them, and then, sending <lb/>
            parties to those who were carousing together, made prisoners <lb/>
            of the principal personages; and as Arcadians were there <lb/>
            from all the cities of the country, all desirous of having peace, <lb/>
            the prisoners must have been very numerous; so that the <lb/>
            gaol was soon filled with them, as well as the town-house. <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            there were many, too, that leaped down from the wall, and <lb/>
            many others that had been let out through the gates, (for no <lb/>
            one used violent measures with another, who was not afraid of <lb/>
            losing his own life,) it threw the Theban officer, and those <lb/>
            that acted with him, into great perplexity, to find that of the <lb/>
            Mantineans, whom they most wished to have in their power, <lb/>
            they had secured but few, for, as their city was near at hand, <lb/>
            almost all of them had gone off home.</p>
          <p>38. When it was day, and the whole people of Mantineia <lb/>
            knew what had taken place, they immediately sent to the <lb/>
            other cities of Arcadia, and told them to be ready under arms, <lb/>
            and to guard the roads. These measures they themselves <lb/>
            adopted, and sending also messengers to the people of Tegea, <lb/>
            demanded such of the Mantineans as they had in custody, and <lb/>
            stated, at the same time, that “they thought it just that no one <lb/>
            of the Arcadians should be kept in prison or put to death, be­ <lb/>
            fore he was brought to trial; and, if any persons had charges to <lb/>
            make against them," the messengers added that " the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the Mantineans would be responsible for producing <lb/>
            before the general assembly of the Arcadians whatever indi­ <lb/>
            viduals any one might require." 39. The Theban captain, <lb/>
            hearing of this communication, was at a loss how to act in the <lb/>
            affair, but at last released all the prisoners; and, on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing day, having called together as many of the Arcadians <lb/>
            as were willing to meet, he stated, in defence of his conduct, <lb/>
            that "he had been deceived; for he had heard," he said, <lb/>
            “that the Lacedæmonians were under arms upon the frontiers, <lb/>
            and that certain of the Arcadians were going to betray Tegea <lb/>
            into their hands." Those who heard this statement let him <lb/>
            depart indeed, (though they knew that he spoke falsely as to <lb/>
            themselves,) but sending deputies afterwards to Thebes, they <lb/>
            accused him as deserving of death. 40. But they reported <lb/>
            that Epaminondas (for he was then commander-in-chief) ob­ <lb/>
            served that the Theban captain acted much more properly <lb/>
            when he seized the men than when he set them at liberty; <lb/>
            “for inasmuch as you, when we went to war on your account, <lb/>
            made peace without our consent, why may not any person, in <lb/>
            that particular, justly charge you with treachery? But be <lb/>
            assured," added he, " that we will both march into Arcadia, <lb/>
            and will prosecute the war in concert with those who are of <lb/>
            our sentiments."</p><pb n="557"/>

          <p>Epaminondas, at the head of the Thebans and their allies, invades the Pelo <lb/>
            ponnesus, and having in vain waited for the Athenians, whom he hoped to <lb/>
            intercept, proceeds to Tegea; whence, having heard that Agesilaus had <lb/>
            left home with his forces, he directs his course towards Sparta, which he <lb/>
            would have surprised in a defenceless condition. had not Agesilaus hast­ <lb/>
            ened his return. Epaminondas is unsuccessful in a battle near Sparta, and <lb/>
            hurries off to Tegea, despatching his cavalry to Mantineia, where the <lb/>
            cavalry of the Athenians had arrived, who save a supply of provisions for <lb/>
            the Mantineans. Epaminondas prepares for another engagement, and, <lb/>
            after deceiving the enemy by a short delay, breaks through their line, and <lb/>
            forces them to retire, but is himself killed. His troops being unable to <lb/>
            turn their success to advantage, many of them are killed, and it begins to <lb/>
            be doubted to which side the victory ought to belong. Nor was anything <lb/>
            settled by this battle, though almost all the forces of Greece were engaged <lb/>
            in it; on the contrary, greater disturbances ensued.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN these words were reported to the general assem­ <lb/>
            bly of the Arcadians, and throughout the several cities, the <lb/>
            Mantineans, and such other Arcadians as cared for the inter­ <lb/>
            ests of the Peloponnesus, as well as the Eleians and Achæans, <lb/>
            forthwith concluded that the Thebans evidently wished the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus to be in as weak a condition as possible, in order <lb/>
            that they might without difficulty enslave it. 2. " For why," <lb/>
            said they, " do they wish us to continue at war, but that we <lb/>
            may distress one another, and may both stand in need of their <lb/>
            Interference ? Or why, when we tell them that we do not <lb/>
            want them at present, are they preparing to take the field ? <lb/>
            Is it not plain that they intend to march forth for the purpose <lb/>
            of doing us injury?" 3. They also sent to Athens to ask as­ <lb/>
            sistance ; and deputies from the Epariti proceeded tc Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, calling on the Lacedæmonians, " should any power come <lb/>
            to enslave the Peloponnesus, to join, if they pleased, in stop­ <lb/>
            ping1 its progress." Concerning the command, however, they <lb/>
            settled at once2 that each people should lead in its own ter <lb/>
            ritory.</p>
          <p>4. While these matters were in progress, Epaminondas took <lb/>
            the field, with all the Bœotians and Eubœans, and many of <lb/>
            the Thessalians, who had been sent partly from Alexander,3 <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κοινη̃ διακωλύειν</foreign>.] "To hinder in common." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὐτόθεν</foreign>.] Ex eo ipso tempore.

             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            and partly from his adversaries.1 The Phocians did not ac­ <lb/>
            company him, for they said that " the treaty made with them <lb/>
            was such, that they were to give assistance if any enemy came <lb/>
            against Thebes, but that it was not expressed in the treaty <lb/>
            that they were to take the field against other powers. 5. <lb/>
            Epaminondas however considered that the Argives and Mes­ <lb/>
            senians would join him in the Peloponnesus, as well as such <lb/>
            of the Arcadians as favoured the Theban interests, and these <lb/>
            were the people of Tegea, Megalopolis, Asea, Pallantium, and <lb/>
            whatever other towns, from being small, and situated in the <lb/>
            midst of the greater states, were compelled to take part with <lb/>
            them. 6. Epaminondas accordingly marched forth with ex­ <lb/>
            pedition ; but when he came to Nemea, he made some delay <lb/>
            there, hoping that he would surprise the Athenians as they <lb/>
            were passing by,2 and thinking that such good fortune would <lb/>
            not only have a great effect on the Theban allies, so as to <lb/>
            raise their spirits, but on the enemy, so that they would fall into <lb/>
            despondency; and, to say all in a word, he thought that in <lb/>
            whatever way the Athenians suffered loss, it would be all gain <lb/>
            to the Thebans. 7. During his stay at Nemea, all the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians that were of the same sentiments met together at <lb/>
            Mantineia. But as Epaminondas heard that the Athenians <lb/>
            had given up the thought of going by land, and were prepar­ <lb/>
            ing to proceed by sea, in order to go to the support of the Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians through Laconia,3 he removed his camp from Nemea <lb/>
            and went off to Tegea.</p>
          <p>8. That the expedition proved fortunate for him, I cannot <lb/>
            say ; but whatever proofs could be given of forethought and <lb/>
            valour, he appears to me to have been wanting in none. I <lb/>
            cannot but commend in him, in the first place, that he formed <lb/>
            his camp within the walls of Tegea, where it was much safer <lb/>
            than it would have been if he had pitched it without, and <lb/>
            whatever he did was much better concealed from the enemy; <note type="footnote"> formerly been the bitterest enemy of the Thebans, but, after he was <lb/>
            defeated by Pelopidas, the Thebais had obliged him to promise <lb/>

            while, if he found himself in want of anything, it was much <lb/>
            easier for him, being in a city, to procure it. As the enemy, <lb/>
            on the other hand, were encamped on open ground, it was <lb/>
            easy to see whether everything went right among them, or <lb/>
            whether they committed any error. And though he judged <lb/>
            himself to be superior to the enemy, he did not lead out his <lb/>
            troops to attack them, as long as he saw that they had the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of the ground. 9. But finding that no city came over <lb/>
            to him, and that the term of his command was fast advancing, <lb/>
            he thought that he must do something, or else he expected to <lb/>
            bring on himself much dishonour in place of his former glory. <lb/>
            When he learned, therefore, that the enemy were keeping on <lb/>
            their guard round Mantineia, and were sending for Agesilaus <lb/>
            and all the Lacedæmonians, and was also informed that Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus had marched out, and was then at Pellene,l he gave, one <lb/>
            night after supper, the necessary orders to his troops, and led <lb/>
            them off straight towards Sparta ; 10. and had not a Cretan, <lb/>
            under some divine influence, gone and told Agesilaus that the <lb/>
            army was advancing, Epaminondas would have taken the city <lb/>
            like a bird's nest deserted by those that should have defended <lb/>
            it. But as Agesilaus had notice of his approach, and antici­ <lb/>
            pated him in returning to the city, the Spartans were in array <lb/>
            and on their guard, though they were but few indeed in num­ <lb/>
            ber, for all their cavalry was absent in Arcadia, as well as <lb/>
            their mercenary troops, and the three of their twelve2 com­ <lb/>
            panies of foot. 11. Epaminondas, therefore, when he went into <lb/>
            the city3 of the Spartans, where, while he and his men would <note type="footnote"> 1 A: esilaus was not at this time in Achaia, as appears from the <lb/>
            course of Xenophon's narrative, as well as from Pausanias, ix. 8, <lb/>
            and especially from Plutarch, Agesil. c. 34. It is therefore not <lb/>
            Pellene, the well-known town of Achaia, mentioned above, c. 2, <lb/>
            sect. 13, and c. 4, sect. 18, which is to be understood here, but a fat <lb/>
            more obscure town of Laconia, on the borders of Arcadia, whicl <lb/>
            Pliny, H. N. iv. 6, and Schol. Apoll. Rhod. i. 177, assign to Arcadia, <lb/>
            and which appears to be the same that Pausanias, iii. 20, calls in <lb/>
            the Doric dialect Pellana, and which Schneider shows to be men­ <lb/>

            by ad urbem, prope urbem. But Polybius, as Schneider observes, <lb/>
            says (ix. 8) that Epaminondas took a portion of the city of Sparta, <lb/>
            and entered as far as the forum, but retired on hearing that Agesi­ <lb/>
            laus was approaching. Xenophon's words seem certainly to have </note> <pb n="560"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            have had to fight on the ground, they would also have been <lb/>
            assailed with missiles from the tops of the houses; and where <lb/>
            the larger would have had no superiority in the struggle over the <lb/>
            smaller number, he did not enter it, but, after taking possession <lb/>
            of an eminence, where he thought that he should have some <lb/>
            advantage, he went down, and did not go up, to the city.1 12. <lb/>
            As to what happened afterwards, we may ascribe it either to <lb/>
            divine influence, or we may say that none can resist desperate <lb/>
            men ; for when Archidamus,2 though he had not even a hun­ <lb/>
            dred men, advanced against him, and, having crossed that3 <lb/>
            which might have proved some hindrance, proceeded up the <lb/>
            ascent to charge the enemy, then those fire-breathing Thebans, <lb/>
            who had previously defeated the Lacedæmonians, who were <lb/>
            infinitely superior in number, and who had also the advantage <lb/>
            of the ground, did not even stand the charge of Archidamus <lb/>
            and his party, but gave way before them. 13. The men in the <lb/>
            front ranks of Epaminondas were killed, but as those from <lb/>
            the city, exulting in their success, pursued farther than was <lb/>
            prudent, they also suffered loss;4 for it had been prescribed <lb/>
            by divine providence, as it would seem, how far victory should <lb/>
            be granted to each party. Archidamus erected a trophy on <lb/>
            the spot where he had had the superiority, and gave up under <lb/>
            truce the bodies of the enemy who had fallen there.</p>
          <p>14. Epaminondas, concluding that the Arcadians would come <lb/>
            to the aid of Sparta, had no desire to fight with them and all <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians in conjunction, especially when they had <lb/>
            met with success, while his own men were under disappoint­ <lb/>
            ment. lIe therefore marched back with all possible expedition <lb/>
            to Tegea, where he caused his heavy-armed men to halt, but <note type="footnote"> a larger meaning than Morus and Weiske allow them. Mr. Grote, <lb/>
            chap. lxxx., represents Epaminondas as " actually entering the city <lb/>
            of Sparta," referring to this passage of Xenophon as his authority. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέβαινε και οὐκ ἀνέαινεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν</foreign>.] From the brevity of <lb/>

            thing fully without having an exact knowledge of the ground. But <lb/>
            of this we may feel assured, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατααίνειν</foreign> means to descend to <lb/>

            despatched his cavalry to Mantineia, entreating them to bear <lb/>
            up under the toil, and telling them it was likely that all the <lb/>
            cattle of the Mantineans were without the city, as well as all <lb/>
            the people, especially as it was the season for gathering in their <lb/>
            corn. 15. The cavalry accordingly commenced their march. <lb/>
            But the cavalry of the Athenians, which had started from <lb/>
            Eleusis, and, after supping on the Isthmus, had passed by <lb/>
            Cleonæ, happened to have come up to Mantineia, and had <lb/>
            quartered themselves in the houses within the walls. As soon <lb/>
            as the enemy, therefore, were seen riding up, the Mantineans <lb/>
            besought the Athenian cavalry " to give them whatever sup­ <lb/>
            port they could, since all their cattle and farm-slaves, as well <lb/>
            as many children and old men of the free population, were <lb/>
            without the city;" and the Athenians, on hearing their en­ <lb/>
            treaties, sallied out to give aid, though both themselves and <lb/>
            their horses were still without refreshment. 16. Who again1 <lb/>
            must not admire, on this occasion, the spirit of those men, <lb/>
            who, though they saw before them an enemy far more numer­ <lb/>
            ous than themselves, and though ill success had attended their <lb/>
            cavalry at Corinth,2 took no thought of those matters, nor were <lb/>
            daunted at having to fight with Theban and Thessalian ca­ <lb/>
            valry, considered to be of all cavalry the best, but, thinking <lb/>
            that they would be disgraced if, when they were present, they <lb/>
            should give no assistance to their allies, engaged with the <lb/>
            enemy as soon as they saw them, longing to maintain their <lb/>
            hereditary glory ? 17. By their exertions in the field, they <lb/>
            were the cause of everything belonging to the Mantineans, <lb/>
            that was out of the city, being preserved. Many brave men <lb/>
            on their side were killed; and they themselves killed many <lb/>
            brave men on that of the enemy; for none on either side had <lb/>
            weapons so short that they could not reach one another. <lb/>
            Their own dead they did not abandon ; some of the dead <lb/>
            bodies of the enemy they gave up under a truce.</p>

            should die, his death would be glorious in the endeavour to <lb/>
            leave the sovereignty of the Peloponnesus to his country. 19. <lb/>
            That he should have reasoned thus, appears to me by no <lb/>
            means surprising; for such are the reasonings of men ambi­ <lb/>
            tious of honour ; but that he had so disciplined his army, that <lb/>
            they sunk under no toil, either by night or day, shrunk from <lb/>
            no danger, and, though they had but scanty provisions, were <lb/>
            yet eager to obey, seems to me far more wonderful. 20. For <lb/>
            when at last he gave them orders to prepare for battle, the <lb/>
            cavalry, at his word, began eagerly to polish their helmets, <lb/>
            the heavy-armed troops of the Arcadians marked the clubs <lb/>
            on their shields as if they were Thebans,2 and all the men <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the union of this people with the others, Xenophon has <lb/>
            not previously mentioned any regular treaty; for that of which lie <lb/>
            speaks in c. 1, sect. 43, was not of such force that they should be <lb/>
            compelled to act as allies to the Lacedæmonians in the field. But <lb/>
            that they were present in this battle is confirmed by Diodorus Sicu­ <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοντες</foreign>, which is wanting in four manuscripts, with the following <lb/>
            note : “As we.have noticed above, iv. 4. 10, that the shields of dif­ <lb/>
            ferent nations or tribes were inscribed with the initial letters of <lb/>
            their names, so the Thebans, and the Arcadians who on this occasion <lb/>
            imitated them, had a club, the insigne of the Theban Hercules, <lb/>
            painted on their shields. The only man that was able to extract this <lb/>
            sense from the passage was Eckhel, in his Doctr. Num. vol. ii. p. <lb/>
            203, where he has illustrated a Theban coin stamped with a Boeo­ <lb/>

            discovery that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοντες</foreign> should be omitted, as it is in two manuscripts <lb/>
            of Pans and two of ours.” </note> <pb n="563"/>

            sharpened their spears and swords, and brightened their <lb/>
            bucklers.</p>
          <p>21. After he had led them out thus prepared, it is well to <lb/>
            consider how he acted. First of all, as was to be expected, <lb/>
            he drew up his forces, and, in doing so, appeared to give <lb/>
            manifest indications that he was preparing for a battle. When <lb/>
            his army however was drawn up as he wished, he did not <lb/>
            lead it the shortest way towards the enemy, but conducted it <lb/>
            towards the mountains on the west and over against Tegea ; <lb/>
            so as to produce a notion in the enemy that he would not <lb/>
            fight that day ; 22. for when he came near the hills, after his <lb/>
            main body was drawn out to its full extent, he ordered his <lb/>
            men to file their arms at the foot of the heights, so that he <lb/>
            appeared to be encamping. By acting in this manner, he <lb/>
            slackened the determination for engaging which was in the <lb/>
            hearts of most of the enemy, and caused them to quit their <lb/>
            posts on the field. But when he had brought up to the front <lb/>
            the companies which on the march had been in the wings, <lb/>
            and had made the part in which he was posted strong and in <lb/>
            the shape of a wedge, he immediately gave orders for his <lb/>
            troops to resume their arms, and began to advance, while <lb/>
            they followed him. As for the enemy, when they saw the <lb/>
            Thebans advancing, contrary to what they had expected, not <lb/>
            one of them could remain quiet, but some ran to their posts, <lb/>
            some formed themselves In line, others bridled their horses <lb/>
            others put on their breastplates; yet all were more like mer <lb/>
            going to suffer some harm than to inflict any on others.</p>
          <p>23. Epaminondas led on his army like a ship of war with <lb/>
            its beak directed against the enemy, expecting that wherever <lb/>
            he assailed and cut through their ranks, he would spread <lb/>
            disaster among their whole force; for he was prepared to <lb/>
            settle the contest with the strongest part of his troops; the <lb/>
            weaker he had removed to a distance; knowing that if they <lb/>
            were defeated they would cause dismay among his own men <lb/>
            and confidence in the enemy. 24. The enemy, on their part, had <lb/>
            drawn up their cavalry like a body of heavy-armed infantry, <lb/>
            of a close depth,1 without any foot to support them;2 but <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Ωσπερ ὁπλιτω̃ν φάλαγγα βάθος ἐφεξη̃ς</foreign>.] The last word, says <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            Epaminondas, on the contrary, had formed of his cavalry a <lb/>
            strong wedge-like body, and had posted companies of foot to <lb/>
            support them, judging that when he had broken through the <lb/>
            cavalry of the enemy, he would have defeated their whole <lb/>
            force, since it is hard to find men that will stand when they <lb/>
            see some of their own party in flight; and that the Athenians <lb/>
            might not send succour from their left wing to the part of the <lb/>
            enemy nearest them, he posted over against them, upon some <lb/>
            high grounds, parties of horse and heavy-armed foot, wishing <lb/>
            to inspire them with the apprehension that if they stirred to <lb/>
            aid others his own troops would attack them in the rear.</p>
          <p>25. Such was the mode in which he commenced the en­ <lb/>
            gagement; nor was he deceived in his expectations; for, <lb/>
            being successful in the part on which he made his attack, he <lb/>
            forced the whole body of the enemy to take to flight. But <lb/>
            when he himself fell,1 those who survived him could make no <lb/>
            efficient use of their victory; for though the main body of the <lb/>
            enemy fled before them, his heavy-armed troops killed none of <lb/>
            them, nor even advanced beyond the spot where the charge <lb/>
            took place; and though the cavalry also retreated, his own <lb/>
            cavalry did not pursue, or make any slaughter either of horse <lb/>
            or foot, but, like men who had been conquered, slipped away <lb/>
            in trepidation amidst their fleeing adversaries. The other <lb/>
            parties of foot, indeed, and the peltasts, who had shared in the <lb/>
            success of the cavalry, advanced up to the enemy's left wing, <lb/>
            as if masters of the field, but there the greater part of them <lb/>
            were put to the sword by the Athenians.</p>
          <p>26. When the conflict was ended, the result of it was quite <lb/>
            contrary to what all men had expected that it would be; for <lb/>
            as almost the whole of Greece was assembled on the occasion, <lb/>
            and arrayed in the field, there was no one who did not sup­ <lb/>
            pose that, if a battle took place, one side would conquer and <lb/>
            be masters, and the other be conquered and become subjects ; <lb/>
            but the divine power so ordered the event, that both parties <lb/>
            erected trophies as being victorious, neither side hindering <note type="footnote">the cavalry, or interspersed among them; as those of the Germans <lb/>
            mentioned by Cæsar, B. G. i. 48, and those of the Dahæ, by Quintus <lb/>
            Curtius, vii. 7. Weiske. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 He fell by the hand of Gryllus, the son of Xenophon, as Pausa­ <lb/>

            the other in the erection; both parties, as conquerors, resided <lb/>
            the dead under a truce, and both parties, as defeated, received <lb/>
            them under truce; and neither party, though each asserted <lb/>
            the victory to be its own, was seen to gain any more, either in <lb/>
            land, or towns, or authority, than it possessed before the <lb/>
            battle took place. Indeed there was still greater confusion <lb/>
            and disturbance in Greece after the conflict than there had <lb/>
            been before it.</p>
