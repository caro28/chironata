            <title type="main">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE only version of the entire works of Plato, which <lb/>
            has appeared in the English language, is that published <lb/>
            by Taylor; in which nine of the Dialogues previously <lb/>
            translated by Floyer Sydenham are introduced. Tay­ <lb/>
            lor's portion of the work is far from correct, and <lb/>
            betrays an imperfect knowledge of Greek: that by <lb/>
            Sydenham is much better, and evidently the work of <lb/>
            a scholar, but in many instances, and tbuse chiefly <lb/>
            where difficulties present themselves, he obscures his <lb/>
            authors meaning by too great amplification. Trans­ <lb/>
            lations of several detached Dialogues have appeared at <lb/>
            various times, but of those which have fallen into my <lb/>
            hands none appear to me deserving of notice, with the <lb/>
            exception of a little volume containing the Phædrus, <lb/>
            Lysis, and Protagoras, by Mr. J. Wright, of Trinity <lb/>
            College, Cambridge, the production of a promising <lb/>
            scholar.</p>
          <p>In the volume now offered to the public, I have <lb/>
            endeavoured to keep as closely to the original as the <lb/>
            idioms of the two languages would allow.</p><pb n="viii"/>
            
          <p>In the introduction to each Dialogue I have con­ <lb/>
            tented myself with giving a brief outline of the argu­ <lb/>
            ments ; sufficient, I trust, to enable a reader not fami­ <lb/>
            liar with the rigid dialectics of Plato to follow the <lb/>
            chain of his reasoning, and catch the points at which <lb/>
            he so frequently diverges from, and again returns to, <lb/>
            the main subject of each Dialogue.</p>
          <p>The editions which have been made use of are those <lb/>
            of Bekker, Ast, and Stallbaum, though with very few <lb/>
            exceptions the readings of the latter have been adopted. <lb/>
            The division into sections, according to the London <lb/>
            edition of Bekker, has been retained, because the ar­ <lb/>
            rangement is convenient, and it is believed that that <lb/>
            edition is more generally to be met with in this country <lb/>
            than any other.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Two charges were brought against Socrates, one, that he <lb/>
            did not believe in the gods received by the state, the other, that <lb/>
            he corrupted the Athenian youth by teaching them not to <lb/>
            believe.</p>
          <p>Plato, who was present at the trial, probably gives us the <lb/>
            very arguments employed by the accused on that occasion. <lb/>
            Socrates disdained to have recourse to the usual methods <lb/>
            adopted by the popular orators of the day to secure an acquit­ <lb/>
            tal ; and, having devoted his whole life to the search after and <lb/>
            the inculcation of religious, philosophical, and moral truth, <lb/>
            resolved to bear himself in this extremity in a manner con­ <lb/>
            sistent with his established character, and to take his stand on <lb/>
            his own integrity and innocence, utterly uninfluenced by that <lb/>
            imaginary evil, death. From this cause it is that his defence <lb/>
            is so little artificial. In his discussions with others, on what­ <lb/>
            ever subject, it was his constant habit to keep his opponents <lb/>
            to the question before them, and he would never suffer them to <lb/>
            evade it, but by a connected series of the most subtle questions <lb/>
            or arguments compelled them to retract any erroneous opinion <lb/>
            they might have advanced: whereas, in defending himself, he <lb/>
            never once fairly grapples with either of the charges brought <lb/>
            against him. With regard to the first accusation, that he did <lb/>
            not believe in the established religion, he neither confesses nor <lb/>
            denies it, but shews that he had in some instances conformed <lb/>
            to the religious customs of his country, and that he did believe <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            in God, so much so indeed that even if they would acquit him <lb/>
            on condition of his abandoning his practice of teaching others, <lb/>
            he could not consent to such terms, but must persevere in ful­ <lb/>
            filling the mission on which the Deity had sent him, for that <lb/>
            he feared God rather than man. With reference to the second <lb/>
            charge which he meets first, by his usual method of a brief <lb/>
            but close cross-examination of his accuser Melitus, he brings <lb/>
            him to this dilemma, that he must either charge him with cor­ <lb/>
            rupting the youth designedly, which would be absurd, or with <lb/>
            doing so undesignedly, for which he could not be liable to <lb/>
            punishment.</p>
          <p>The Defence itself properly ends with the twenty-fourth <lb/>
            section. The second division to the twenty-ninth section re­ <lb/>
            lates only to the sentence which ought to be passed on him. <lb/>
            And in the third and concluding part, with a dignity and <lb/>
            fulness of hope worthy even of a Christian, he expresses his <lb/>
            belief that the death to which he is going is only a passage to <lb/>
            a better and a happier life.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I KNOW not, 0 Athenians, how far you have been influenced <lb/>
            by my accusers: for my part, in listening to them I almost <lb/>
            forgot myself, so plausible were their arguments : however, so <lb/>
            to speak, they have said nothing true. But of the many false­ <lb/>
            hoods which they uttered I wondered at one of them espe­ <lb/>
            cially, that in which they said that you ought to be on your <lb/>
            guard lest you should be deceived by me, as being eloquent in <lb/>
            speech. For that they are not ashamed of being forthwith <lb/>
            convicted by me in fact, when I shall shew that I am not by <lb/>
            any means eloquent, this seemed to me the most shameless <lb/>
            thing in them, unless indeed they call him eloquent who speaks <lb/>
            the truth. For, if they mean this, then I.would allow that I <lb/>
            am an orator, but not after their fashion : for they, as I affirm, <lb/>
            have said nothing true; but from me you shall hear the whole <lb/>
            truth. Not indeed, Athenians, arguments highly wrought, as <lb/>
            theirs were, with choice phrases and expressions, nor adorned, <lb/>
            but you shall hear a speech uttered without premeditation, in <lb/>
            such words as first present themselves. For I am confident <lb/>
            that what I say will be just, and let none of you expect other­ <lb/>
            wise : for surely it would not become my time of life to come <lb/>
            before you like a youth with a got up speech. Above all <lb/>
            things therefore I beg and implore this of you, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            if you hear me defending myself in the same language as that <lb/>
            in which I am accustomed to speak both in the forum at the <lb/>
            counters, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere, <lb/>
            not to be surprised or disturbed on this account. For the case <lb/>
            is this: I now for the first time come before a court of justice, <lb/>
            though more than seventy years old; I am therefore utterly a <lb/>
            stranger to the language here. As, then, if I were really a <lb/>
            stranger, you would have pardoned me if I spoke in the lan­ <lb/>
            guage and the manner in which I had been educated, so now <lb/>
            I ask this of you as an act of justice, as it appears to me, to <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            disregard the manner of my speech, for perhaps it may be <lb/>
            somewhat worse, and perhaps better, and to consider this only, <lb/>
            and to give your attention to this, whether I speak what is just <lb/>
            or not ; for this is the virtue of a judge, but of an orator to <lb/>
            speak the truth.</p>
          <p>2. First then, 0 Athenians, I am right in defending myself <lb/>
            against the first false accusations alleged against me, and my <lb/>
            first accusers, and then against the latest accusations, and the <lb/>
            latest accusers. For many have been accusers of me to you, <lb/>
            and for many years, who have asserted nothing true, of whom <lb/>
            I am more afraid than of Anytus and his party, although they <lb/>
            too are formidable; but those are still more formidable, Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, who laying hold of many of you from childhood, have <lb/>
            persuaded you, and accused me of what is not true :—“ that <lb/>
            there is one Socrates, a wise man, who occupies himself about <lb/>
            celestial matters, and has explored every thing under the earth, <lb/>
            and makes the worse appear the better reason." Those, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, who have spread abroad this report are my formid­ <lb/>
            able accusers: for they who hear them think that such as <lb/>
            search into these things do not believe that there are gods. <lb/>
            In the next place, these accusers are numerous, and have <lb/>
            accused me now for a long time ; moreover they said these <lb/>
            things to you at that time of life in which you were most <lb/>
            credulous, when you were boys and some of you youths, and <lb/>
            they accused me altogether in my absence, when there was no <lb/>
            one to defend me. But the most unreasonable thing of all is, <lb/>
            that it is not possible to learn and mention their names, except <lb/>
            that one of them happens to be a comic poeta. Such, however, <lb/>
            as influenced by envy and calumny have persuaded you, and <lb/>
            those who, being themselves persuaded, have persuaded others, <lb/>
            all these are most difficult to deal with ; for it is not possible <lb/>
            to bring any of them forward here, nor to confute any; but it <lb/>
            is altogether necessary, to fight as it were with a shadow, in <lb/>
            making my defence, and to convict when there is no one to <lb/>
            answer. Consider, therefore, as I have said, that my accusers <lb/>
            are twofold, some who have lately accused me, and others long <lb/>
            since, whom I have made mention of; and believe that I ought <lb/>
            to defend myself against these first; for you heard them <lb/>
            accusing me first, and much more than these last.</p>
          <p>Well. I must make my defence then, 0 Athenians, and <note type="footnote"> a Aristophanes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            endeavour in this so short a space of time to remove from <lb/>
            your minds the calumny which you have long entertained. <lb/>
            I wish, indeed, it might be so, if it were at all better both for <lb/>
            you and me, and that in making my defence I could effect some­ <lb/>
            thing more advantageous still: I think however that it will be <lb/>
            difficult, and I am not entirely ignorant what the difficulty is. <lb/>
            Nevertheless let this turn out as may be pleasing to God, I <lb/>
            must obey the law, and make my defence.</p>
          <p>3. Let us then repeat from the beginning what the accusa­ <lb/>
            tion is from which the calumny against me has arisen, and <lb/>
            relying on which Melitus has preferred this indictment against <lb/>
            me. Well. What then do they who charge me say in their <lb/>
            charge ? For it is necessary to read their deposition as of <lb/>
            public accusers. " Socrates acts wickedly, and is criminally <lb/>
            curious in searching into things under the earth, and in the <lb/>
            heavens, and in making the worse appear the better cause, and <lb/>
            in teaching these same things to others." Such is the accusa­ <lb/>
            tion : for such things you have yourselves seen in the comedy <lb/>
            of Aristophanes, one Socrates there carried about, saying that <lb/>
            he walks in the air, and acting many other buffooneries, of <lb/>
            which I understand nothing whatever. Nor do I say this as <lb/>
            disparaging such a science, if there be any one skilled in such <lb/>
            things, only let me not be prosecuted by Melitus on a charge <lb/>
            of this kind; but I say it, 0 Athenians, because I have no­ <lb/>
            thing to do with such matters. And I call upon most of you <lb/>
            as witnesses of this, and require you to inform and tell each <lb/>
            other, as many of you as have ever heard me conversing; and <lb/>
            there are many such among you. Therefore tell each other, if <lb/>
            any one of you has ever heard me conversing little or much on <lb/>
            such subjects. And from this you will know that other things <lb/>
            also, which the multitude assert of me, are of a similar nature.</p>
          <p>4. However not one of these things is true ; nor, if you have <lb/>
            heard from any one that I attempt to teach men, and require pay­ <lb/>
            ment, is this true. Though this indeed appears to me to be an <lb/>
            honourable thing, if one should be able to instruct men, like <lb/>
            Gorgias the Leontine, Prodicus the Cean, and Hippias the Elean. <lb/>
            For each of these, 0 Athenians, is able, by going through the <lb/>
            several cities, to persuade the young men, who can attach them­ <lb/>
            selves gratuitously to such of their own fellow citizens as they <lb/>
            please, to abandon their fellow citizens and associate with them, <lb/>
            giving them money and thanks besides. There is also another <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            wise man here, a Parian, who I hear is staying in the city. For <lb/>
            I happened to visit a person who spends more money on the <lb/>
            sophists than all others together, I mean Callias, son of Hip­ <lb/>
            ponicus. I therefore asked him, for he has two sons, " Callias," <lb/>
            I said, " if your two sons were colts or calves, we should have <lb/>
            had to choose a master for them and hire a person who would <lb/>
            make them excel in such qualities as belong to their nature : <lb/>
            and he would have been a groom or an agricultural labourer. <lb/>
            But now, since your sons are men, what master do you intend <lb/>
            to choose for them ? Who is there skilled in the qualities that <lb/>
            become a man and a citizen ? For I suppose you must have <lb/>
            considered this, since you have sons. Is there any one," I said, <lb/>
            " or not?" " Certainly," he answered. " Who is he?" said <lb/>
            I, " and whence does he come ? and on what terms does he <lb/>
            teach ?" He replied, " Evenus the Parian, Socrates, for five <lb/>
            minæ.” And I deemed Evenus happy, if he really possesses <lb/>
            this art, and teaches so admirably. And I too should think <lb/>
            highly of myself and be very proud, if I possessed this know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; but I possess it not, 0 Athenians.</p>
          <p>5. Perhaps, one of you may now object: " But, Socrates, <lb/>
            what have you done then ? Whence have these calumnies <lb/>
            against you arisen ? For surely if you had not busied yourself <lb/>
            more than others, such a report and story would never have <lb/>
            got abroad, unless you had done something different from what <lb/>
            most men do. Tell us, therefore, what it is, that we may not <lb/>
            pass a hasty judgment on you." He who speaks thus appears <lb/>
            to me to speak justly, and I will endeavour to shew you what <lb/>
            it is that has occasioned me this character and imputation. <lb/>
            Listen then : to some of you perhaps I shall appear to jest, yet <lb/>
            be assured that I shall tell you the whole truth. For I, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, have acquired this character through nothing else <lb/>
            than a certain wisdom. Of what kind, then, is this wisdom ? <lb/>
            Perhaps it is merely human wisdom. For in this, in truth I <lb/>
            appear to be wise. They probably, whom I just now men­ <lb/>
            tioned, possessed a wisdom more than human, otherwise <lb/>
            I know not what to say about it; for I am not acquainted <lb/>
            with it, and whosoever says I am, speaks falsely and for the <lb/>
            purpose of calumniating me. But, 0 Athenians, do not cry <lb/>
            out against me, even though I should seem to you to speak <lb/>
            somewhat arrogantly. For the account which I am going to <lb/>
            give you, is not my own, but I shall refer to an authority whom <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            you will deem worthy of credit. For I shall adduce to you the <lb/>
            god at Delphi as a witness of my wisdom, if I have any, and of <lb/>
            what it is. You doubtless know Chærepho: he was my asso­ <lb/>
            ciate from youth, and the associate of most of you ; he accom­ <lb/>
            panied you in your late exile and returned with you. You know, <lb/>
            then, what kind of a man Chærepho was, how earnest in what­ <lb/>
            ever he undertook. Having once gone to Delphi, he ventured <lb/>
            to make the following inquiry of the oracle, (and, as I said, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, do not cry out,) for he asked if there was any one <lb/>
            wiser than me. The Pythian thereupon answered that there <lb/>
            was not one wiser: and of this, his brother here will give you <lb/>
            proofs, since he himself is dead.</p>
          <p>6. Consider then why I mention these things: it is because <lb/>
            I am going to shew you whence the calumny against me arose. <lb/>
            For when I heard this, I reasoned thus with myself, What does <lb/>
            the god mean? What enigma is this? For I am not conscious <lb/>
            to myself that I am wise, either much or little. What then <lb/>
            does he mean by saying that I am the wisest ? For assuredly <lb/>
            he does not speak falsely: that he cannot do. And for a long <lb/>
            time, I was in doubt what he meant; afterwards with con­ <lb/>
            siderable difficulty I had recourse to the following method of <lb/>
            searching out his meaning. I went to one of those who have <lb/>
            the character of being wise, thinking that there, if any <lb/>
            where, I should confute the oracle, and shew in answer to the <lb/>
            response that This man is wiser than I, though you affirmed <lb/>
            that I was the wisest. Having then examined this man, (for <lb/>
            there is no occasion to mention his name, he was however one <lb/>
            of our great politicians, in examining whom I felt as I proceed <lb/>
            to describe, 0 Athenians,) having fallen into conversation with <lb/>
            him, this man appeared to me to be wise in the opinion of most <lb/>
            other men, and especially in his own opinion, though in fact he <lb/>
            was not so. I thereupon endeavoured to shew him that he <lb/>
            fancied himself to be wise, but really was not. Hence I became <lb/>
            odious both to him, and to many others who were present. <lb/>
            When I left him, I reasoned thus with myself, I am wiser <lb/>
            than this man, for neither of us appear to know any thing <lb/>
            great and good : but he fancies he knows something, although <lb/>
            he knows nothing, whereas I, as I do not know any thing, so I <lb/>
            do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear <lb/>
            to be wiser than him, because I do not fancy I know what I do <lb/>
            not know. After that I went to another who was thought to <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            be wiser than the former, and formed the very same opinion. <lb/>
            Hence I became odious to him and to many others.</p>
          <p>. 7. After this I went to others in turn, perceiving indeed and <lb/>
            grieving and alarmed that I was making myself odious; how­ <lb/>
            ever it appeared necessary to regard the oracle of the god as <lb/>
            of the greatest moment, and that in order to discover its mean­ <lb/>
            ing, I must go to all who had the reputation of possessing any <lb/>
            knowledge. And by the dog, 0 Athenians, for I must tell <lb/>
            you the truth, I came to some such conclusion as this: those <lb/>
            who bore the highest reputation appeared to me to be most <lb/>
            deficient, in my researches in obedience to the god, and others <lb/>
            who were considered inferior, more nearly approaching to the <lb/>
            possession of understanding. But I must relate to you my <lb/>
            wandering, and the labours which I underwent, in order that <lb/>
            the oracle might prove incontrovertible. For after the politi­ <lb/>
            cians I went to the poets as well the tragic as the dithyrambic <lb/>
            and others, expecting that here I should in very fact find my­ <lb/>
            self more ignorant than them. Taking up, therefore, some of <lb/>
            their poems, which appeared to me most elaborately finished, <lb/>
            I questioned them as to their meaning, that at the same time I <lb/>
            might learn something from them. I am ashamed, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, to tell you the truth; however it must be told. For, in <lb/>
            a word, almost all who were present could have given a better <lb/>
            account of them than those by whom they had been composed. <lb/>
            I soon discovered this, therefore, with regard to the poets, that <lb/>
            they do not effect their object by wisdom, but by a certain <lb/>
            natural inspiration and under the influence of enthusiasm like <lb/>
            prophets and seers; for these also say many fine things, but <lb/>
            they understand nothing that they say. The poets appeared <lb/>
            to me to be affected in a similar manner : and at the same time <lb/>
            I perceived that they considered themselves, on account of their <lb/>
            poetry, to be the wisest of men in other things, in which they <lb/>
            were not. I left them, therefore, under the persuasion that I <lb/>
            was superior to them, in the same way that I was to the poli­ <lb/>
            ticians.</p>
          <p>8. At last, therefore, I went to the artizans. For I was <lb/>
            conscious to myself that I knew scarcely any thing, but I was <lb/>
            sure that I should find them possessed of much beautiful know­ <lb/>
            ledge. And in this I was not deceived; for they knew things <lb/>
            which I did not, and in this respect they were wiser than me. <lb/>
            But, 0 Athenians, even the best workmen appeared to me to <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            nave fallen into the same error as the poets: for each, because he <lb/>
            excelled in the practice of his art, thought that he was very wise <lb/>
            in other most important matters, and this mistake of theirs ob­ <lb/>
            scured the wisdom that they really possessed. I therefore asked <lb/>
            myself in behalf of the oracle, whether I should prefer to con. <lb/>
            tinue as I am, possessing none either of their wisdom or their <lb/>
            ignorance, or to have both as they have. I answered, therefore, <lb/>
            to myself and to the oracle, that it was better for me to con­ <lb/>
            tinue as I am.</p>
          <p>9. From this investigation, then, 0 Athenians, many enmities <lb/>
            have arisen against me, and those the most grievous and severe, <lb/>
            so that many calumnies have sprung from them and amongst <lb/>
            them this appellation of being wise. For those who are from <lb/>
            time to time present think that I am wise in those things, with <lb/>
            respect to which I expose the ignorance of others. The god how­ <lb/>
            ever, 0 Athenians, appears to be really wise, and to mean this by <lb/>
            his oracle, that human wisdom is worth little or nothing; and it <lb/>
            is clear that he did not say this of Socrates, but made use of my <lb/>
            name, putting me forward as an example, as if he had said, that <lb/>
            man is the wisest among you, who, like Socrates, knows that he <lb/>
            is in reality worth nothing with respect to wisdom. Still there­ <lb/>
            fore I go about and search and inquire into these things, in <lb/>
            obedience to the god, both among citizens and strangers, if I <lb/>
            think any one of them is wise ; and when he appears to me not <lb/>
            to be so, I take the part of the god, and shew that he is not <lb/>
            wise. And in consequence of this occupation I have no leisure <lb/>
            to attend in any considerable degree to the affairs of the state <lb/>
            or my own; but I am in the greatest poverty through my devo­ <lb/>
            tion to the service of the god.</p>
          <p>10. In addition to this, young men, who have much leisure <lb/>
            and belong to the wealthiest families, following me of their own <lb/>
            accord, take great delight in hearing men put to the test, and <lb/>
            often imitate me, and themselves attempt to put others to the <lb/>
            test: and then, I think, they find a great abundance of men <lb/>
            who fancy they know something, although they know little or <lb/>
            nothing. Hence those who are put to the test by them are <lb/>
            angry with me, and not with them, and say that " there is one <lb/>
            Socrates, a most pestilent fellow, who corrupts the youth." <lb/>
            And when any one asks them by doing or teaching what, they <lb/>
            have nothing to say, for they do not know: but that they may <lb/>
            not seem to be at a loss, they say such things as are ready at <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            hand against all philosophers ; " that he searches into things in <lb/>
            heaven and things under the earth, that he does not believe <lb/>
            there are gods, and that he makes the worse appear the better <lb/>
            reason." For they would not, I think, be willing to tell the <lb/>
            truth, that they have been detected in pretending to possess <lb/>
            knowledge, whereas they know nothing. Therefore, I think, <lb/>
            being ambitious and vehement and numerous, and speaking <lb/>
            systematically and persuasively about me, they have filled your <lb/>
            ears, for a long time and diligently calumniating me. From <lb/>
            amongst these, Melitus, Anytus, and Lycon, have attacked me; <lb/>
            Melitus being angry on account of the poets, Anytus on account <lb/>
            of the artizans and politicians, and Lycon on account of the <lb/>
            rhetoricians. So that as I said in the beginning, I should <lb/>
            wonder if I were able in so short a time to remove from your <lb/>
            minds a calumny that has prevailed so long. This, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, is the truth; and I speak it without concealing or dis­ <lb/>
            guising any thing from you, much or little; though I very well <lb/>
            know that by so doing I shall expose myself to odium. This <lb/>
            however is a proof that I speak the truth, and that this is the <lb/>
            nature of the calumny against me, and that these are its causes. <lb/>
            And if you will investigate the matter, either now or hereafter, <lb/>
            you will find it to be so.</p>
          <p>11. With respect then to the charges which my first accusers <lb/>
            have alleged against me, let this be a sufficient apology to you. <lb/>
            To Melitus, that good and patriotic man, as he says, and to my <lb/>
            later accusers, I will next endeavour to give an answer; and <lb/>
            here again, as there are different accusers let us take up their <lb/>
            deposition. It is pretty much as follows: " Socrates," it says, <lb/>
            " acts unjustly in corrupting the youth, and in not believing in <lb/>
            those gods in whom the city believes, but in other strange <lb/>
            divinities." Such is the accusation; let us examine each par­ <lb/>
            ticular of it. It says that I act unjustly in corrupting the youth. <lb/>
            But I, 0 Athenians, say that Melitus acts unjustly, because he <lb/>
            jests on serious subjects, rashly putting men upon trial, under <lb/>
            pretence of being zealous and solicitous about things in which <lb/>
            he never at any time took any concern. But that this is the <lb/>
            case I will endeavour to prove to you.</p>
          <p>12. Come then, Melitus, tell me; do you not consider it of <lb/>
            the greatest importance that the youth should be made as vir­ <lb/>
            tuous as possible ?</p>
          <p>Mel. I do.</p><pb n="11"/>
            
          <p>Soer. Well now, tell the judges who it is that makes them <lb/>
            better, for it is evident that you know, since it concerns you <lb/>
            so much: for, having detected me in corrupting them, as you <lb/>
            say, you have cited me here and accused me; come then, say, <lb/>
            and inform the judges who it is that makes them better. Do <lb/>
            you see, Melitus, that you are silent, and have nothing to say ? <lb/>
            But does it not appear to you to be disgraceful and a sufficient <lb/>
            proof of what I say, that you never took any concern about the <lb/>
            matter? But tell me, friend, who makes them better?</p>
          <p>Mel. The laws.</p>
          <p>Soer. I do not ask this, most excellent sir, but what man, <lb/>
            who surely must first know this very thing, the laws ?</p>
          <p>Mel. These, Socrates, the judges.</p>
          <p>Socr. How say you, Melitus ? Are these able to instruct the <lb/>
            youth, and make them better?</p>
          <p>Mel. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether all, or some of them, and others not?</p>
          <p>Mel. All.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say well, by Juno, and have found a great <lb/>
            abundance of those that confer benefit. But what further? <lb/>
            Can these hearers make them better, or not ?</p>
          <p>Mel. They too can.</p>
          <p>Socr. And what of the senators ?</p>
          <p>Mel. The senators also.</p>
          <p>Soer. But, Melitus, do those who attend the public assemblies <lb/>
            corrupt the younger men ? or do they all make them better ?</p>
          <p>Mel. They too.</p>
          <p>Socr. All the Athenians therefore, as it seems, make them <lb/>
            honourable and good, except me, but I alone corrupt them. <lb/>
            Do you say so ?</p>
          <p>Mel. I do assert this very thing.</p>
          <p>Socr. You charge me with great ill-fortune. But answer <lb/>
            me: does it appear to you to be the same with respect to <lb/>
            horses ? do all men make them better, and is there only some <lb/>
            one that spoils them ? or does quite the contrary of this take <lb/>
            place? is there some one person who can make, them better, <lb/>
            or very few, that is the trainers? but if the generality of <lb/>
            men should meddle with and make use of horses, do they spoil <lb/>
            them ? Is not this the case, Melitus, both with respect to horses <lb/>
            and all other animals? It certainly is so, whether you and <lb/>
            Anytus deny it or not. For it would be a great good-fortune <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            for the youth if only one person corrupted, and the rest bene­ <lb/>
            fited them. However, Melitus, you have sufficiently shewn <lb/>
            that you never bestowed any care upon youth ; and you clearly <lb/>
            evince your own negligence, in that you have never paid any <lb/>
            attention to the things with respect to which you accuse me.</p>
          <p>. 13. Tell us further, Melitus, in the name of Jupiter, whether <lb/>
            is it better to dwell with good or bad citizens? Answer, my <lb/>
            friend: for I ask you nothing difficult. Do not the bad work <lb/>
            some evil to those that are continually near them, but the good <lb/>
            some good ?</p>
          <p>Mel. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is there any one that wishes to be injured rather than <lb/>
            benefited by his associates ? Answer, good man: for the law <lb/>
            requires you to answer. Is there any one who wishes to be <lb/>
            injured ?</p>
          <p>Mel. No, surely.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, whether do you accuse me here, as one that <lb/>
            corrupts the youth, and makes them more depraved, designedly <lb/>
            or undesignedly?</p>
          <p>Mel. Designedly, I say.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then, Melitus, are you at your time of life so <lb/>
            much wiser than me at my time of life, as to know that the evil <lb/>
            are always working some evil to those that are most near to <lb/>
            them, and the good some good; but I have arrived at such a <lb/>
            pitch of ignorance as not to know, that if I make any one of <lb/>
            my associates depraved, I shall be in danger of receiving some <lb/>
            evil from him, and yet I designedly bring about this so great <lb/>
            evil, as you say ? In this I cannot believe you, Melitus, nor <lb/>
            do I think would any other man in the world: but either I do <lb/>
            not corrupt the youth, or if I do corrupt them, I do it unde­ <lb/>
            signedly: so that in both cases you speak falsely. But if I <lb/>
            corrupt them undesignedly, for such involuntary offences it is <lb/>
            not usual to accuse one here, but to take one apart and teach <lb/>
            and admonish one. For it is evident that if I am taught, I <lb/>
            shall cease doing what I do undesignedly. But you shunned <lb/>
            me, and were not willing to associate with and instruct me, but <lb/>
            you accuse me here, where it is usual to accuse those who need <lb/>
            punishment, and not instruction.</p>
          <p>14. Thus, then, 0 Athenians, this now is clear that I have <lb/>
            said, that Melitus never paid any attention to these matters, <lb/>
            much or little. However tell us, Melitus, how you say I cor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            rupt the youth ? Is it not evidently, according to the indict­ <lb/>
            ment which you have preferred, by teaching them not to be­ <lb/>
            lieve in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other strange <lb/>
            deities ? Do you not say that by teaching these things, I corrupt <lb/>
            the youth ?</p>
          <p>Mel. Certainly I do say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. By those very gods, therefore, Melitus, of whom the <lb/>
            discussion now is, speak still more clearly both to me and to <lb/>
            these men. For I cannot understand whether you say that I <lb/>
            teach them to believe that there are certain gods, (and in that <lb/>
            case I do believe that there are gods, and am not altogether an <lb/>
            atheist, nor in this respect to blame,) not however those which <lb/>
            the city believes in, but others, and this it is that you accuse <lb/>
            me of, that I introduce others; or do you say outright that I <lb/>
            do not myself believe that there are gods, and that I teach <lb/>
            others the same?</p>
          <p>Mel. I say this, that you do not believe in any gods at all. <lb/>
            Socr. 0 wonderful Melitus, how come you to say this ? Do <lb/>
            I not then like the rest of mankind, believe that the sun and <lb/>
            moon are gods ?</p>
          <p>Mel. No, by Jupiter, 0 judges : for he says that the sun is <lb/>
            a stone, and the moon an earth.</p>
          <p>Socr. You fancy that you are accusing Anaxagoras, my dear <lb/>
            Melitus, and thus you put a slight on these men, and suppose <lb/>
            them to be so illiterate, as not to know that the books of Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras of Clazomene are full of such assertions. And the young, <lb/>
            moreover, learn these things from me, which they might pur­ <lb/>
            chase for a drachma, at most, in the orchestra, and so ridicule <lb/>
            Socrates, if he pretended they were his own, especially since <lb/>
            they are so absurd? I ask then, by Jupiter, do I appear to you <lb/>
            to believe that there is no god?</p>
          <p>Mel. No, by Jupiter, none whatever.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say what is incredible, Melitus, and that, as ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me, even to yourself. For this man, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            appears to me to be very insolent and intemperate, and to have <lb/>
            preferred this indictment through downright insolence, intem­ <lb/>
            perance and wantonness. For he seems, as it were, to have <lb/>
            composed an enigma for the purpose of making an experiment. <lb/>
            Whether will Socrates the wise know that I am jesting, and <lb/>
            contradict myself, or shall I deceive him and all who hear <lb/>
            me ? For in my opinion he clearly contradicts himself in the <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            indictment, as if he should say, Socrates is guilty of wrong in <lb/>
            not believing that there are gods, and in believing that there <lb/>
            are gods. And this, surely, is the act of one who is trifling.</p>
          <p>5. Consider with me now, Athenians, in what respect he ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me to say so. And do you, Melitus, answer me; and <lb/>
            do ye, as I besought you at the outset, remember not to make <lb/>
            an uproar if I speak after my usual manner.</p>
          <p>Is there any man, Melitus, who believes that there are human <lb/>
            affairs, but does not believe that there are men? Let him <lb/>
            answer, judges, and not make so much noise. Is there any <lb/>
            one who does not believe that there are horses, but that there <lb/>
            are things pertaining to horses ? or who does not believe that <lb/>
            there are pipers, but that there are things pertaining to pipes ? <lb/>
            There is not, 0 best of men : for since you are not willing to <lb/>
            answer, I say it to you and to all here present. But answer to <lb/>
            this at least: is there any one who believes that there are things <lb/>
            relating to demons, but does not believe that there are demons ?</p>
          <p>Mel. There is not.</p>
          <p>Socr. How obliging you are in having hardly answered, <lb/>
            though compelled by these judges. You assert then that I do <lb/>
            believe and teach things relating to demons, whether they be <lb/>
            new or old ; therefore, according to your admission, I do believe <lb/>
            in things relating to demons, and this you have sworn in the <lb/>
            bill of indictment. If then I believe in things relating to <lb/>
            demons, there is surely an absolute necessity that I should <lb/>
            believe that there are demons. Is it not so? It is. For I <lb/>
            suppose you to assent, since you do not answer. But with <lb/>
            respect to demons, do we not allow that they are gods, or the <lb/>
            children of gods ? Do you admit this or not ?</p>
          <p>Mel. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Since then I allow that there are demons as you ad­ <lb/>
            mit, if demons are a kind of gods, this is the point in which I <lb/>
            say you speak enigmatically and divert yourself in saying that <lb/>
            I do not allow there are gods, and again that I do allow there <lb/>
            are, since I allow that there are demons ? But if demons are <lb/>
            the children of gods, spurious ones, either from nymphs or any <lb/>
            others, of whom they are reported to be, what man can think <lb/>
            that there are sons of gods, and yet that there are not gods ? <lb/>
            For it would be just as absurd, as if any one should think that <lb/>
            there are mules the offspring of horses and asses, but should <lb/>
            not think there are horses and asses. However, Melitus, it <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            cannot be otherwise than that you have preferred this indict­ <lb/>
            ment for the purpose of trying me, or because you were at a <lb/>
            loss what real crime to allege against me : for that you should <lb/>
            persuade any man who has the smallest degree of sense, that <lb/>
            the same person can think that there are things relating to <lb/>
            demons and to gods, and yet that there are neither demons; <lb/>
            nor gods, nor heroes, is utterly impossible.</p>
          <p>16. That I am not guilty then, 0 Athenians, according to <lb/>
            the indictment of Melitus, appears to me not to require a length­ <lb/>
            ened defence ; but what I have said is sufficient. And as to <lb/>
            what I said at the beginning, that there is a great enmity to­ <lb/>
            wards me among the multitude, be assured it is true. And this <lb/>
            it is which will condemn me, if I am condemned, not Melitus, <lb/>
            nor Anytus, but the calumny and envy of the multitude, which <lb/>
            have already condemned many others, and those good men, and <lb/>
            will I think condemn others also; for there is no danger that it <lb/>
            will stop with me.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, some one may say, " Are you not ashamed, <lb/>
            Socrates, to have pursued a study, from which you are now in <lb/>
            danger of dying?" To such a person I should answer with <lb/>
            good reason, You do not say well, friend, if you think that a man, <lb/>
            who is even of the least value, ought to take into the account <lb/>
            the risk of life or death, and ought not to consider that alone <lb/>
            when he performs any action, whether he is acting justly or <lb/>
            unjustly, and the part of a good man or bad man. For accord­ <lb/>
            ing to your reasoning, all those demi-gods that died at Troy <lb/>
            would be vile characters, as well all the rest as the son of Thetis, <lb/>
            who so far despised danger in comparison of submitting to dis­ <lb/>
            grace, that when his mother, who was a goddess, spoke to him, <lb/>
            in his impatience to kill Hector, something to this effect, <lb/>
            as I think b, " My son, if you revenge the death of your friend <lb/>
            Patroclus, and slay Hector, you will yourself die, for," she <lb/>
            said, " death awaits you immediately after Hector." But <lb/>
            he, on hearing this, despised death and danger, and dreading <lb/>
            much more to live as a coward, and not avenge his friends <lb/>
            said ; " May I die immediately, when I have inflicted punish­ <lb/>
            ment on the guilty, that I may not stay here an object of ridi­ <lb/>
            cule, by the curved ships, a burden to the ground ?” Do you <lb/>
            think that he cared for death and danger? For thus it is, <lb/>
            O Athenians, in truth ; wherever any one has posted himself, <note type="footnote"> b Iliad. lib. xviii. ver. 94, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            either thinking it to be better, or has been posted by his chief, <lb/>
            there, as it appears to me, he ought to remain and meet danger, <lb/>
            taking no account either of death or any thing else in compari­ <lb/>
            son with disgrace.</p>
          <p>17. I then should be acting strangely, 0 Athenians, if, when <lb/>
            the generals whom you chose to command me assigned me my <lb/>
            post at Potidsea, at Amphipolis, and at Delium, I then remained <lb/>
            where they posted me, like any other person, and encountered <lb/>
            the danger of death, but when the deity as I thought and be­ <lb/>
            lieved, assigned it as my duty to pass my life in the study of <lb/>
            philosophy, and in examining myself and others, I should on <lb/>
            that occasion, through fear of death or any thing else whatso­ <lb/>
            ever, desert my post. Strange indeed would it be, and then in <lb/>
            truth any one might justly bring me to trial, and accuse me of <lb/>
            not believing in the gods, from disobeying the oracle, fearing <lb/>
            death, and thinking myself to be wise when I am not. For to fear <lb/>
            death, 0 Athenians, is nothing else than to appear to be wise, <lb/>
            without being so; for it is to appear to know what one does <lb/>
            not know. For no one knows but that death is the greatest of <lb/>
            all goods to man ; but men fear it, as if they well knew that it <lb/>
            is the greatest of evils. And how is not this the most repre­ <lb/>
            hensible ignorance, to think that one knows what one does not <lb/>
            know ? But I, 0 Athenians, in this perhaps differ from most <lb/>
            men; and if I should say that I am in any thing wiser than <lb/>
            another, it would be in this, that not having a competent know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the things in Hades, I also think that I have not such <lb/>
            knowledge. But to act unjustly, and to disobey my superior, <lb/>
            whether God or man, I know is evil and base. I shall never, <lb/>
            therefore, fear or shun things which, for aught I know, may be <lb/>
            good, before evils which I know to be evils. So that even if <lb/>
            you should now dismiss me, not yielding to the instances of <lb/>
            Auytus, who paid that either I should notc appear here at all, <lb/>
            or that, if I did appear, it was impossible not to put me to <lb/>
            death, telling you that if I escaped, your sons, studying what <lb/>
            Socrates teaches, would all be utterly corrupted; if you should <lb/>
            address me thus, " Socrates, we shall not now yield to Anytus, <lb/>
            but dismiss you, on this condition however, that you no longer <lb/>
            persevere in your researches nor study philosophy, and if here­ <lb/>
            after you are detected in so doing, you shall die,”—if, as I said, <lb/>
            you should dismiss me on these terms, I should say to you: <note type="footnote"> c See the Crito, s. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            " 0 Athenians, I honour and love you: but I shall obey God <lb/>
            rather than you ; and as long as I breathe and am able, I shall <lb/>
            not cease studying philosophy, and exhorting you and warning <lb/>
            any one of you I may happen to meet, saying as I have been ac­ <lb/>
            customed to do: '0 best of men, seeing you are an Athenian, <lb/>
            of a city the most powerful and most renowned for wisdom and <lb/>
            strength, are you not ashamed of being careful for riches, how <lb/>
            you may acquire them in greatest abundance, and for glory and <lb/>
            honour, but care not nor take any thought for wisdom and <lb/>
            truth, and for your soul, how it may be made most perfect ?' " <lb/>
            And if any one of you should question my assertion, and affirm <lb/>
            that he does care for these things, I shall not at once let him <lb/>
            go, nor depart, but I shall question him, sift and prove him. <lb/>
            And if he should appear to me not to possess virtue, but to <lb/>
            pretend that he does, I shall reproach him for that he sets the <lb/>
            least value on things of the greatest worth, but the highest on <lb/>
            things that are worthless. Thus I shall act to all whom I meet, <lb/>
            both young and old, stranger and citizen, but rather to you my <lb/>
            fellow citizens, because ye are more nearly allied to me. For <lb/>
            be well assured, this the deity commands. And I think that <lb/>
            no greater good has ever befallen you in the city, than my zeal <lb/>
            for the service of the god. For I go about doing nothing else <lb/>
            than persuading you, both young and old, to take no care <lb/>
            either for the body, or for riches, prior to or so much as for the <lb/>
            soul, how it may be made most perfect, telling you that virtue <lb/>
            does not spring from riches, but riches and all other human <lb/>
            blessings, both private and public, from virtue. If, then, by <lb/>
            saying these things, I corrupt the youth, these things must be <lb/>
            mischievous; but if any one says that I speak other things than <lb/>
            these, he misleads youd. Therefore I must say, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            either yield to Anytus or do not, either dismiss me or not, since <lb/>
            I shall not act otherwise, even though I must die many deaths.</p>
          <p>18. Murmur not, 0 Athenians, but continue to attend to my <lb/>
            request, not to murmur at what I say, but to listen, for as I <lb/>
            think, you will derive benefit from listening. For I am going <lb/>
            to say other things to you, at which perhaps you will raise a <lb/>
            clamour ; but on no account do so. Be well assured, then, if <lb/>
            you put me to death, being such a man as I say I am, you will <note type="footnote"> d <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐδὲν λέγει</foreign>, literally " he says nothing on se trompe, on l'on vous <lb/>
            impose, Cousin. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            not injure me more than yourselves. For neither will Melitus <lb/>
            nor Anytus harm me ; nor have they the power: for I do not <lb/>
            think that it is possible for a better man to be injured by a <lb/>
            worse. He may perhaps have me condemned to death, or <lb/>
            banished or deprived of civil rights ; and he or others may per­ <lb/>
            haps consider these as mighty evils : I however do not consider <lb/>
            them so, but that it is much more so to do what he is now <lb/>
            doing, to endeavour to put a man to death unjustly. Now, <lb/>
            therefore, 0 Athenians, I am far from making a defence on my <lb/>
            own behalf, as any one might think, but I do so on your behalf, <lb/>
            lest by condemning me you should offend at all with respect to <lb/>
            the gift of the deity to you. For, if you should put me to death, <lb/>
            you will not easily find such another, though it may be ridi­ <lb/>
            culous to say so, altogether attached by the deity to this city <lb/>
            as to a powerful and generous horse, somewhat sluggish from <lb/>
            his size, and requiring to be roused by a gad-fly; so the deity <lb/>
            appears to have united me, being such a person as I am, to the <lb/>
            city, that I may rouse you, and persuade and reprove every one <lb/>
            of you, nor ever cease besetting you throughout the whole day. <lb/>
            Such another man, 0 Athenians, will not easily be found, there­ <lb/>
            fore, if you will take my advice, you will spare me. But you, <lb/>
            perhaps, being irritated, like drowsy persons who are roused from <lb/>
            sleep, will strike me, and, yielding to Anytus, will unthinkingly <lb/>
            condemn me to death ; and then you will pass the rest of your <lb/>
            life in sleep, unless the deity, caring for you, should send some <lb/>
            one else to you. But that I am a person who has been given by <lb/>
            the deity to this city, you may discern from hence; for it is not <lb/>
            like the ordinary conduct of men, that I should have neglected <lb/>
            all my own affairs and suffered my private interest to be neglect­ <lb/>
            ed for so'many years, and that I should constantly attend to your <lb/>
            concerns, addressing myself to each of you separately, like a <lb/>
            father, or elder brother, persuading you to the pursuit of virtue. <lb/>
            And if I had derived any profit from this course, and had re­ <lb/>
            ceived pay for my exhortations, there would have been some <lb/>
            reason for my conduct; but now you see yourselves, that my <lb/>
            accusers, who have so shamelessly calumniated me in every <lb/>
            thing else, have not had the impudence to charge me with this, <lb/>
            and to bring witnesses to prove that I ever either exacted or <lb/>
            demanded any reward. And I think I produce a sufficient <lb/>
            proof that I speak the truth, namely, my poverty.</p>
          <p>19. Perhaps, however, it may appear absurd, that I, going <lb/>

            about, thus advise you in private and make myself busy, but <lb/>
            never venture to present myself in public before your assem­ <lb/>
            blies and give advice to the city. The cause of this is that <lb/>
            which you have often and in many places heard me mention: <lb/>
            because I am moved by a certain divine and spiritual influence, <lb/>
            which also Melitus, through mockery, has set out in the indict­ <lb/>
            ment. This began with me from childhood, being a kind of <lb/>
            voice which, when present, always diverts me from what I am <lb/>
            about to do, but never urges me on. This it is which opposed <lb/>
            my meddling in public politics; and it appears to me to have <lb/>
            opposed me very properly. For be well assured, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            if I had long since attempted to intermeddle with politics, I <lb/>
            should have perished long ago, and should not have at all bene­ <lb/>
            fited you or myself. And be not angry with me for speaking <lb/>
            the truth. For it is not possible that any man should be safe, <lb/>
            who sincerely opposes either you, or any other multitude, and <lb/>
            who prevents many unjust and illegal actions from being com­ <lb/>
            mitted in a city; but it is necessary that he who in earnest <lb/>
            contends for justice, if he will be safe for but a short time, <lb/>
            should live privately, and take no part in public affairs.</p>
          <p>20. I will give you strong proofs of this, not words, but, what <lb/>
            you value, facts. Hear then what has happened to me, that <lb/>
            you may know that I would not yield to any one contrary to <lb/>
            what is just, through fear of death, at the same time that, by not <lb/>
            yielding, I must perish. I shall tell you what will be displeas­ <lb/>
            ing and wearisome e, yet true. For I, 0 Athenians, never bore <lb/>
            any other magisterial office in the city, but have been a senator: <lb/>
            and our Antiochean tribe happened to supply the Prytanes <lb/>
            when you chose to condemn in a body the ten generals, who <lb/>
            had not taken off those that perished in the sea-fight, in viola­ <lb/>
            tion of the law, as you afterwards all thought. At that time <lb/>
            I alone of the Prytanes opposed your doing any thing con­ <lb/>
            trary to the laws, and I voted against you; and when the orators <lb/>
            were ready to denounce me, and to carry me before a magis­ <lb/>
            trate, and you urged and cheered them on, I thought I ought <lb/>
            rather to meet the danger with law and justice on my side, than <lb/>
            through fear of imprisonment or death to take part with you in <lb/>
            your unjust designs. And this happened while the city was <note type="footnote"> e But for the authority of Stallbaum, I should have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικανικὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            " forensic," that is, such arguments as an advocate would use in a court <lb/>
            of justice. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            governed by a democracy. But when it became an oligarchy, <lb/>
            the Thirty, having sent for me with four others to the Tholus, <lb/>
            ordered us to bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, that he <lb/>
            might be put to death; and they gave many similar orders to <lb/>
            many others, wishing to involve as many as they could in guilt. <lb/>
            Then however I shewed, not in word but in deed, that I did not <lb/>
            care for death, if the expression be not too rude, in the smallest <lb/>
            degree, but that all my care was to do nothing unjust or unholy. <lb/>
            For that government, strong as it was, did not so overawe me <lb/>
            as to make me commit an unjust action; but when we came <lb/>
            out from the Tholus, the four went to Salamis, and brought <lb/>
            back Leon ; but I went away home. And perhaps for this I <lb/>
            should have been put to death, if that government had not been <lb/>
            speedily broken up. And of this you can have many wit­ <lb/>
            nesses.</p>
          <p>21. Do you think, then, that I should have survived so many <lb/>
            years, if I had engaged in public affairs, and, acting as becomes <lb/>
            a good man, had aided the cause of justice, and, as I ought, <lb/>
            had deemed this of the highest importance ? Far from it, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians : nor would any other man have done so. But I, <lb/>
            through the whole of my life, if I have done any thing in public, <lb/>
            shall be found to be a man, and the very same in private, who <lb/>
            has never made a concession to any one contrary to justice, <lb/>
            neither to any other, nor to any one of these whom my calum­ <lb/>
            niators say are my disciples. I however was never the pre­ <lb/>
            ceptor of any one; but if any one desired to hear me speaking <lb/>
            and to see me busied about my own mission, whether he were <lb/>
            young or old, I never refused him. Nor do I discourse when <lb/>
            I receive money, and not when I do not receive any, but I allow <lb/>
            both rich and poor alike to question me, and, if any one wishes <lb/>
            it, to answer me and hear what I have to say. And for these, <lb/>
            whether any one proves to be a good man or not, I cannot justly <lb/>
            be responsible, because I never either promised them any in­ <lb/>
            struction or taught them at all. But if any one says that he <lb/>
            has ever learnt or heard any thing from me in private, which <lb/>
            all others have not, be well assured that he does not speak the <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>22. But why do some delight to spend so long a time with <lb/>
            me ? Ye have heard, 0 Athenians. I have told you the whole <lb/>
            truth, that they delight to hear those closely questioned who <lb/>
            think that they are wise but are not: for this is by no means <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            disagreeable. But this duty, as I say, has been enjoined me <lb/>
            by the deity, by oracles, by dreams, and by every mode by <lb/>
            which any other divine decree has ever enjoined any thing to <lb/>
            man to do. These things, 0 Athenians, are both true, and <lb/>
            easily confuted if not true. For if I am now corrupting some <lb/>
            of the youths, and have already corrupted others, it were fitting, <lb/>
            surely, that if any of them, having become advanced in life, had <lb/>
            discovered that I gave them bad advice when they were young, <lb/>
            they should now rise up against me, accuse me, and have me <lb/>
            punished; or if they were themselves unwilling to do this, some <lb/>
            of their kindred, their fathers, or brothers, or other relatives, if <lb/>
            their kinsmen have ever sustained any damage from me, should <lb/>
            now call it to mind. Many of them however are here present, <lb/>
            whom I see : first, Onto, my contemporary and fellow-burgher, <lb/>
            father of this Critobulus; then, Lysanias of Sphettus, father of <lb/>
            this Æschines; again, Antiphon of Cephisus, father of Epi­ <lb/>
            genes; there are those others too, whose brothers maintained <lb/>
            the same intimacy with me, namely, Nicostratus, son of Theos­ <lb/>
            dotidus, brother of Theodotus—Theodotus indeed is dead, so <lb/>
            that he could not deprecate his brother's proceedings, and <lb/>
            Paralus here, son of Demodocus, whose brother was Theages; <lb/>
            and Adimantus son of Ariston, whose brother is this Plato; <lb/>
            and Æantodorus, whose brother is this Apollodorus. I could <lb/>
            also mention many others to you, some one of whom certainly <lb/>
            Melitus ought to have adduced in his speech as a witness. If <lb/>
            however he then forgot to do so, let him now adduce them, I <lb/>
            give him leave to do so, and let him say it, if he has any thing <lb/>
            of the kind to allege. But quite contrary to this, you will find, <lb/>
            0 Athenians, all ready to assist me, who have corrupted and <lb/>
            injured their relatives, as Melitus and Anytus say. For those <lb/>
            who have been themselves corrupted might perhaps have some <lb/>
            reason for assisting me ; but those who have not been corrupted, <lb/>
            men now advanced in life, their relatives, what other reason <lb/>
            can they have for assisting me, except that right and just one, <lb/>
            that they know that Melitus speaks falsely, and that I speak <lb/>
            the truth.</p>
          <p>23. Well then, Athenians; these are pretty much the things <lb/>
            I have to say in my defence, and others perhaps of the same <lb/>
            kind. Perhaps, however, some among you will be indignant <lb/>
            on recollecting his own case, if he, when engaged in a cause <lb/>
            far less than this, implored and besought the judges with many <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            tears, bringing forward his children in order that he might ex­ <lb/>
            cite their utmost compassion, and many others of his relatives <lb/>
            and friends, whereas I do none of these things, although I may <lb/>
            appear to be incurring the extremity of danger. Perhaps, <lb/>
            therefore, some one, taking notice of this, may become more <lb/>
            determined against me, and, being enraged at this very con­ <lb/>
            duct of mine, may give his vote under the influence of anger. <lb/>
            If then any one of you is thus affected,—I do not however <lb/>
            suppose that there is,-but if there should be, I think I may <lb/>
            reasonably say to him ; " I too, 0 best of men, have relatives; <lb/>
            for to make use of that saying of Homer, I am not sprung from <lb/>
            an oak, nor from a rock, but from men, so that I too, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, have relatives, and three sons, one now grown up, and <lb/>
            two boys: I shall not however bring any one of them forward <lb/>
            and implore you to acquit me. Why then shall I not do this ? <lb/>
            Not from contumacy, 0 Athenians, nor disrespect towards you. <lb/>
            Whether or not I am undaunted at the prospect of death, is <lb/>
            another question, but out of regard to my own character, and <lb/>
            yours, and that of the whole city, it does not appear to me to <lb/>
            be honourable that I should do any thing of this kind at my <lb/>
            age, and with the reputation I have, whether true or false. <lb/>
            For it is commonly agreed that Socrates in some respects <lb/>
            excels the generality of men. If, then, those among you who <lb/>
            appear to excel either in wisdom, or fortitude, or any other <lb/>
            virtue whatsoever, should act in such a manner as I have often <lb/>
            seen some when they have been brought to trial, it would be <lb/>
            shameful, who appearing indeed to be something, have con­ <lb/>
            ducted themselves in a surprising manner, as thinking they <lb/>
            should suffer something dreadful by dying, and as if they <lb/>
            would be immortal if you did not put them to death. Such <lb/>
            men appear to me to bring disgrace on the city, so that any <lb/>
            stranger might suppose that such of the Athenians as excel in <lb/>
            virtue, and whom they themselves choose in preference to them­ <lb/>
            selves for magistracies and other honours, are in no respect <lb/>
            superior to women. For these things, 0 Athenians, neither <lb/>
            ought we to do who have attained to any height of reputa­ <lb/>
            tion, nor, should we do them, ought you to suffer us; but you <lb/>
            should make this manifest, that you will much rather condemn <lb/>
            him who introduces these piteous dramas, and makes the city <lb/>
            ridiculous, than him who quietly awaits your decision.</p>
          <p>24. But reputation apart, 0 Athenians, it does not appear <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            to me to be right to entreat a judge, or to escape by en­ <lb/>
            treaty, but one ought to inform and persuade him. For a <lb/>
            judge does not sit for the purpose of administering justice out <lb/>
            of favour, but that he may judge rightly, and he is sworn not <lb/>
            to shew favour to whom he pleases, but that he will decide ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the laws. It is therefore right that neither should <lb/>
            we accustom you, nor should you accustom yourselves to violate <lb/>
            your oaths; for in so doing neither of us would act righteously. <lb/>
            -Think not then, 0 Athenians, that I ought to adopt such a <lb/>
            course towards you as I neither consider honourable, nor just, <lb/>
            nor holy, as well, by Jupiter, on any other occasion, and now <lb/>
            especially when I am accused of impiety by this Melitus. For <lb/>
            clearly, if I should persuade you, and by my entreaties should <lb/>
            put a constraint on you who are bound by an oath, I should <lb/>
            teach you to think that there are no gods, and in reality, while <lb/>
            making my defence, should accuse myself of not believing in <lb/>
            the gods. This, however, is far from being the case: for I <lb/>
            believe, 0 Athenians, as none of my accusers do, and I leave <lb/>
            it to you and to the deity to judge concerning me in such way <lb/>
            as will be best both for me and for you.</p>
          <p>- [Socrates here concludes his defence, and the votes being <lb/>
            taken, he is declared guilty by a majority of voices. He <lb/>
            thereupon resumes his address.]</p>
          <p>25. That I should not be grieved, 0 Athenians, at what <lb/>
            has happened, namely, that you have condemned me, as well <lb/>
            many other circumstances concur in bringing to pass, and <lb/>
            moreover this, that what has happened has not happened <lb/>
            contrary to my expectation; but I much rather, wonder at <lb/>
            the number of votes on either side. For I did not expect <lb/>
            that I should be condemned by so small a number, but by a <lb/>
            large majority; but now, as it seems, if only three more votes <lb/>
            had changed sides, I should have been acquitted. As far as <lb/>
            Melitus is concerned, as it appears to me, I have been already <lb/>
            acquitted, and not only have I been acquitted, but it is clear <lb/>
            to every one that had not Anytus and Lycon come forward to <lb/>
            accuse me, he would have been fined a thousand drachmas, for <lb/>
            not having obtained a fifth part of the votes.</p>
          <p>26. The man then awards me the penalty of death. Well. <lb/>
            But what shall I, on my part, 0 Athenians, award myself? Is <lb/>
            it not clear that it will be such as I deserve ? What then is <lb/>
            that? do I deserve to suffer or to pay a fine, for that I have <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            purposely during my life not remained quiet, but neglecting <lb/>
            what most men seek after, money-making, domestic concerns, <lb/>
            military command, popular oratory, and moreover all the <lb/>
            . magistracies, conspiracies and cabals that are met with in the <lb/>
            city, thinking that I was in reality too upright a man to be <lb/>
            safe if I took part in such things, I therefore did not apply <lb/>
            myself to those pursuits, by attending to which I should have <lb/>
            been of no service either to you or to myself; but in order to <lb/>
            confer the greatest benefit on each of you privately, as I affirm, <lb/>
            I thereupon applied myself to that object, endeavouring to per­ <lb/>
            suade every one of you, not to take any care of his own affairs, <lb/>
            before he had taken care of himself, in what way he may be­ <lb/>
            come the best and wisest, nor of the affairs of the city before <lb/>
            he took care of the city itself; and that he should attend to other <lb/>
            things in the same manner. What treatment then do I deserve, <lb/>
            seeing I am such a man? Some reward, 0 Athenians, if at <lb/>
            least I am to be estimated according to my real deserts; and <lb/>
            moreover such a reward as would be suitable to me. What <lb/>
            then is suitable to a poor man, a benefactor, and who has need <lb/>
            of leisure in order to give you good advice ? There is nothing <lb/>
            so suitable, 0 Athenians, as that such a man should be main­ <lb/>
            tained in the Prytaneum, and this much more than if one of <lb/>
            you had been victorious at the Olympic games in a horse race, <lb/>
            or in the two or four-horsed chariot race: for such a one makes <lb/>
            you appear to be happy, but I, to be so: and he does not need <lb/>
            support, but I do. If, therefore, I must award a sentence ac­ <lb/>
            cording to my just deserts, I award this, maintenance in the <lb/>
            Prytaneum.</p>
          <p>27. Perhaps, however, in speaking to you thus, I appear to <lb/>
            you to speak in the same presumptuous manner as I did re­ <lb/>
            specting commiseration and entreaties: but such is not the <lb/>
            case, 0 Athenians, it is rather this. I am persuaded that I <lb/>
            never designedly injured any man, though I cannot persuade <lb/>
            you of this, for we have conversed with each other but for a <lb/>
            short time. For if there was the same law with you as with <lb/>
            other men, that in capital cases the trial should last not only <lb/>
            one day but many, I think you would be persuaded; but it is <lb/>
            not easy in a short time to do away with great calumnies. <lb/>
            Being persuaded then that I have injured no one, I am far <lb/>
            from intending to injure myself, and of pronouncing against <lb/>
            myself that I am deserving of punishment, and from awarding <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            myself any thing of the kind. Through fear of what ? lest I <lb/>
            should suffer that which Melitus awards me, of which I say <lb/>
            I know not whether it be good or evil ? instead of this, shall I <lb/>
            choose what I well know to be evil, and award that ? Shall I <lb/>
            choose imprisonment ? And why should I live in prison, a slave <lb/>
            to the established magistracy, the Eleven ? Shall I choose a fine, <lb/>
            and to be imprisoned until I have paid it ? But this is the same <lb/>
            as that which I just now mentioned, for I have not money to pay <lb/>
            it. Shall I then award myself exile? For perhaps you would <lb/>
            consent to this award. I should indeed be very fond of life, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, if I were so devoid of reason as not to be able to re­ <lb/>
            flect that you, who are my fellow citizens, have been unable to <lb/>
            endure my manner of life and discourses, but they have become <lb/>
            so burdensome and odious to you, that you now seek to be rid <lb/>
            of them: others however will easily bear them: far from it, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians. A fine life it would be for me at my age to go out <lb/>
            wandering and driven from city to city, and so to live. For I <lb/>
            well know that, wherever I may go, the youth will listen to me <lb/>
            when I speak, as they do here. And if I repulse them, they <lb/>
            will themselves drive me out, persuading the elders; and if I <lb/>
            do not repulse them, their fathers and kindred will banish me <lb/>
            on their account.</p>
          <p>28. Perhaps however some one will say, Can you not, <lb/>
            Socrates, when you have gone from us, live a silent and quiet <lb/>
            life ? This is the most difficult thing of all to persuade some <lb/>
            of you. For if I say that that would be to disobey the deity, <lb/>
            and that therefore it is impossible for me to live quietly, you <lb/>
            would not believe me, thinking I spoke ironically. If, on the <lb/>
            other hand, I say that this is the greatest good to man, to dis­ <lb/>
            course daily on virtue, and other things which you have heard <lb/>
            me discussing, examining both myself and others, but that a <lb/>
            life without investigation is not worth living for, still less would <lb/>
            you believe me if I said this. Such however is the case, as I <lb/>
            affirm, 0 Athenians, though it is not easy to persuade you. And <lb/>
            at the same time I am not accustomed to think myself deserv­ <lb/>
            ing of any ill. If indeed I were rich, I would amerce myself <lb/>
            in such a sum as I should be able to pay; for then I should <lb/>
            have suffered no harm, but now-for I cannot, unless you are <lb/>
            willing to amerce me in such a sum as I am able to pay. But <lb/>
            perhaps I could pay you a mina of silver: in that sum then I <lb/>
            amerce myself. But Plato here, 0 Athenians, and Crito, Crito­ <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            bulus, and Apollodorus bid me amerce myself in thirty minæ, <lb/>
            and they offer to be sureties. I amerce myself then to you in <lb/>
            that sum; and they will be sufficient sureties for the money.</p>
          <p>[The judges now proceeded to pass the sentence, and con­ <lb/>
            demned Socrates to death ; whereupon he continued:]</p>
          <p>29. For the sake of no long space of time, 0 Athenians, you <lb/>
            will incur the character and reproach at the hands of those <lb/>
            who wish to defame the city, of having put that wise man, <lb/>
            Socrates, to death. For those who wish to defame you will <lb/>
            assert that I am wise, though I am not. If, then, you had <lb/>
            waited for a short time, this would have happened of its own <lb/>
            accord; for observe my age, that it is far advanced in life, and <lb/>
            near death. But I say this not to you all, but to those only <lb/>
            who have condemned me to die. And I say this too to the <lb/>
            same persons. Perhaps you think, 0 Athenians, that I have <lb/>
            been convicted through the want of arguments, by which I <lb/>
            might have persuaded you, had I thought it right to do and <lb/>
            say any thing, so that I might escape punishment. Far other­ <lb/>
            wise : I have been convicted through want indeed, yet not of <lb/>
            arguments, but of audacity and impudence, and of the incli­ <lb/>
            nation to say such things to you as would have been most <lb/>
            agreeable for you to hear, had I lamented and bewailed and <lb/>
            done and said many other things unworthy of me, as I affirm, <lb/>
            but such as you are accustomed to hear from others. But <lb/>
            neither did I then think that I ought, for the sake of avoiding <lb/>
            danger, to do any thing unworthy of a freeman, nor do I now <lb/>
            repent of having so defended myself; but I should much rather <lb/>
            choose to die, having so defended myself, than to live in that way. <lb/>
            For neither in a trial nor in battle, is it right that I or any one <lb/>
            else should employ every possible means whereby he may avoid <lb/>
            death; for in battle it is frequently evident that a man might <lb/>
            escape death by laying down his arms, and throwing himself on <lb/>
            the mercy of his pursuers. And there are many other devices in <lb/>
            every danger, by which to avoid death, if a man dares to do and <lb/>
            say every thing. But this is not difficult, 0 Athenians, to escape <lb/>
            death, but it is much more difficult to avoid depravity, for it <lb/>
            runs swifter than death. And now I, being slow and aged, am <lb/>
            overtaken by the slower of the two; but my accusers, being <lb/>
            strong and .active, have been overtaken by the swifter, wicked­ <lb/>
            ness. And now I depart, condemned by you to death; but <lb/>
            they condemned by truth, as guilty of iniquity and injustice : <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            and I abide my sentence and so do they. These things, perhaps, <lb/>
            ought so to be, and I think that they are for the best.</p>
          <p>30. In the next place, I desire to predict to you who have <lb/>
            condemned me, what will be your fate : for I am now in that <lb/>
            condition in which men most frequently prophecy, namely, <lb/>
            when they are about to die. I say then to you, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            who have condemned me to death, that immediately after my <lb/>
            death a punishment will overtake you, far more severe, by <lb/>
            Jupiter, than that which you have inflicted on me. For you <lb/>
            have done this, thinking you should be freed from the necessity <lb/>
            of giving an account of your life. The very contrary however, as I <lb/>
            affirm, will happen to you. Your accusers will be more numerous, <lb/>
            whom I have now restrained, though you did not perceive it; and <lb/>
            they will be more severe, inasmuch as they are younger, and <lb/>
            you will be more indignant. For, if you think that by putting <lb/>
            men to death you will restrain any one from upbraiding you <lb/>
            because you do not live well, you are much mistaken; for this <lb/>
            method of escape is neither possible nor honourable, but that <lb/>
            other is most honourable and most easy, not to put a check <lb/>
            upon others, but for a man to take heed to himself, how he <lb/>
            may be most perfect. Having predicted thus much to those <lb/>
            of you who have condemned me, I take my leave of you.</p>
          <p>31. But with you who have voted for my acquittal, I would <lb/>
            gladly hold converse on what has now taken place, while the <lb/>
            magistrates are busy and I am not yet carried to the place <lb/>
            where I must die. Stay with me then, so long, 0 Athenians, <lb/>
            for nothing hinders our conversing with each other, whilst <lb/>
            we are permitted to do so ; for I wish to make known to you, <lb/>
            as being my friends, the meaning of that which has just now <lb/>
            befallen me. To me then, 0 my judges,-and in calling you <lb/>
            judges I call you rightly,—a strange thing has happened. For <lb/>
            the wonted prophetic voice of my guardian deity, on every <lb/>
            former occasion even in the most trifling affairs opposed me, <lb/>
            if I was about to do any thing wrong; but now, that has be­ <lb/>
            fallen me which ye yourselves behold, and which any one would <lb/>
            think and which is supposed to be the extremity of evil, yet <lb/>
            neither when I departed from home in the morning did the <lb/>
            warning of the god oppose me, nor when I came up here to <lb/>
            the place of trial, nor in my address when I was about to say <lb/>
            any thing; yet on other occasions it has frequently restrained <lb/>
            me in the midst of speaking. But now, it has never through­ <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            out this proceeding opposed me, either in what I did or said. <lb/>
            What then do I suppose to be the cause of this? I will tell <lb/>
            you: what has befallen me appears to be a blessing; and it <lb/>
            is impossible that we think rightly who suppose that death is <lb/>
            an evil. A great proof of this to me is the fact that it is im­ <lb/>
            possible but that the accustomed signal should have opposed <lb/>
            me, unless I had been about to meet with some good,</p>
          <p>32. Moreover we may hence conclude that there is great <lb/>
            hope that death is a blessing.- For to die is one of two things: <lb/>
            for either the dead may be annihilated and have no sensation <lb/>
            of any thing whatever; or, as it is said, there is a certain <lb/>
            change and passage of the soul from one place to another. <lb/>
            And if it is a privation of all sensation, as it were a sleep <lb/>
            in which the sleeper has no dream, death would be a <lb/>
            wonderful gain. For I think that if any one, having selected <lb/>
            a night, in which he slept so soundly as not to have had a <lb/>
            dream, and having compared this night with all the other <lb/>
            nights and days of his life, should be required on considera­ <lb/>
            tion to say how many days and nights he had passed better <lb/>
            and more pleasantly than this night throughout his life, I <lb/>
            think that not only a private person, but even the great king <lb/>
            himself would find them easy to number in comparison with <lb/>
            other days and nights. If, therefore, death is a thing of this <lb/>
            kind, I say it is a gain; for thus all futurity appears to be <lb/>
            nothing more than one night. But if, on the other hand, death <lb/>
            is a removal from hence to another place, and what is said be <lb/>
            true, that all the dead are there, what greater blessing can <lb/>
            there be than this, my judges ? For if, on arriving at Hades, <lb/>
            released from these who pretend to be judges, one shall find <lb/>
            those who are true judges, and who are said to judge there, <lb/>
            Minos and Rhadamanthus, jEacus and Triptolemus, and such <lb/>
            others of the demigods as were just during their own life, <lb/>
            would this be a sad removal ? At what price would you not <lb/>
            estimate a conference with Orpheus and Musæus. Hesiod and <lb/>
            Homer? I indeed should be willing to die often, if this be <lb/>
            true. For to me the sojourn there would be admirable, when <lb/>
            I should meet with Palamedes, and Ajax son of Telamon, and <lb/>
            any other of the ancients who has died by an unjust sentence. <lb/>
            The comparing my sufferings with theirs would, I think, be no <lb/>
            unpleasing occupation. But the greatest pleasure would be to <lb/>
            spend my time in questioning and examining the people there <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            as I have done those here, and discovering who among them is <lb/>
            wise, and who fancies himself to be so but is not. At what <lb/>
            price, my judges, would not any one estimate the opportunity <lb/>
            of questioning him who led that mighty army against Troy, or <lb/>
            Ulysses, or Sisyphus, or ten thousand others, whom one might <lb/>
            mention, both men and women ? with whom to converse and <lb/>
            associate, and to question them, would be an inconceivable <lb/>
            happiness. Surely for that the judges there do not condemn <lb/>
            to death; for in other respects those who live there are more <lb/>
            happy than those that are here, and are henceforth immortal, <lb/>
            if at least what is said be true.</p>
          <p>33. You, therefore; 0 my judges, ought to entertain good <lb/>
            hopes with respect to death, and to meditate on this one truth, <lb/>
            that to a good man nothing is evil, neither while living nor <lb/>
            when dead, nor are his concerns neglected by the gods. And <lb/>
            what has befallen me is not the effect of chance; but this is <lb/>
            clear to me, that now to die, and be freed from my cares, is <lb/>
            better for me. On this account the warning in no way turned <lb/>
            me aside; and I bear no resentment towards those who con­ <lb/>
            demned me, or against my accusers, although they did not con­ <lb/>
            demn and accuse me with this intention, but thinking to injure <lb/>
            me: in this they deserve to be blamed.</p>
          <p>Thus much however I beg of them. Punish my sons, when <lb/>
            they grow up, 0 judges, paining them as I have pained you, if <lb/>
            they appear to you to care for riches or any thing else before <lb/>
            virtue, and if they think themselves to be something when <lb/>
            they are nothing, reproach them as I have done you, for not <lb/>
            attending to what they ought, and for conceiving themselves <lb/>
            to be something when they are worth nothing. If ye do this, <lb/>
            both I and my sons shall have met with just treatment at your <lb/>
            hands.</p>
          <p>But it is now time to depart,-for me to die, for you to live. <lb/>
            But which of us is going to a better state is unknown to every <lb/>
            one but God.</p>

          <p><lb/>
            IT has been remarked by Stallbaum that Plato had a two­ <lb/>
            fold design in this Dialogue; one, and that the primary one, <lb/>
            to free Socrates from the imputation of having attempted to <lb/>
            corrupt the Athenian youth; the other, to establish the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple that under all circumstances it is the duty of a good citi­ <lb/>
            zen to obey the laws of his country. These two points, how­ <lb/>
            ever, are so closely interwoven with each other, that the gene­ <lb/>
            ral principle appears only to be illustrated by the example of <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Onto was one of those friends of Socrates who had been <lb/>
            present at his trial and had offered to assist in paying a fine, <lb/>
            had a fine been imposed instead of the sentence of death. He <lb/>
            appears to have frequently visited his friend in prison after his <lb/>
            condemnation, and now, having obtained access to his cell very <lb/>
            early in the morning, finds him composed in a quiet sleep. He <lb/>
            brings intelligence that the ship, the arrival of which would <lb/>
            be the signal for his death on the following day, is expected to <lb/>
            arrive forthwith, and takes occasion to entreat Socrates to <lb/>
            make his escape, the means of which were already prepared. <lb/>
            Socrates thereupon, having promised to follow the advice of <lb/>
            Crito, if after the matter had been fully discussed it should <lb/>
            appear to be right to do so, proposes to consider the duty of a <lb/>
            citizen towards his country, and having established the divine <lb/>
            principle, that it is wrong to return evil for evil, goes on to <lb/>
            shew that the obligations of a citizen to his country are even <lb/>
            more binding than those of a child to its parent or a slave to <lb/>
            his master, and that therefore it is his duty to obey the esta­ <lb/>
            blished laws, at whatever cost to himself.</p>
          <p>At length Crito admits that he has no answer to make, and <lb/>
            Socrates resolves to submit himself to the will of Providence.</p>

          <p>Socr. WHY have you come at this hour, Crito? Is it not <lb/>
            very early?</p>
          <p>Cri. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. About what time ?</p>
          <p>Cri. Scarce day-break.</p>
          <p>Socr. I wonder how the keeper of the prison came to admit <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>Cri. He is familiar with me, Socrates, from my having fre­ <lb/>
            quently come hither; and he is under some obligations to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have you just now come, or some time since ?</p>
          <p>Cri. A considerable time since.</p>
          <p>Socr. Why then did you not wake me at once, instead of sit­ <lb/>
            ting down by me in silence ?</p>
          <p>Cri. By Jupiter, Socrates, I should not myself like to be so <lb/>
            long awake and in such affliction. But I have been for some <lb/>
            time wondering at you, perceiving how sweetly you slept; and <lb/>
            I purposely did not awake you, that you might pass your time <lb/>
            as pleasantly as possible. And indeed I have often before <lb/>
            throughout your whole life considered you happy in your dis­ <lb/>
            position, but far more so in the present calamity, seeing how <lb/>
            easily and meekly you bear it.</p>
          <p>Socr. However, Crito, it would be disconsonant for a man at <lb/>
            my time of life to repine because he must needs die.</p>
          <p>Cri. But others, Socrates, at your age have been involved in <lb/>
            similar calamities, yet their age has not hindered their repining <lb/>
            at their present fortune.</p>
          <p>Socr. So it is. But why did you come so early?</p>
          <p>Cri. Bringing sad tidings, Socrates; not sad to you, as it <lb/>
            appears, but to me and all your friends sad and heavy; and <lb/>
            which I, I think, shall bear worst of all.</p><pb n="32"/>
            
          <p>Socr. What tidings? Has the ship a arrived from Delos, on <lb/>
            the arrival of which I must die ?</p>
          <p>Cri. It has not yet arrived; but it appears to me that it will <lb/>
            come to-day, from what certain persons report who have come <lb/>
            from Sunium b, and left it there. It is clear, therefore, from <lb/>
            these messengers, that it will come to-day, and consequently it <lb/>
            will be necessary, Socrates, for you to die to-morrow.</p>
          <p>2. Socr. But with good fortune, Crito: and if so it please <lb/>
            the gods, so be it. I do not think, however, that it will come <lb/>
            to-day.</p>
          <p>Cri. Whence do you form this conjecture ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will tell you. I must die on the day after that on <lb/>
            which the ship arrives.</p>
          <p>Cri. So they sayc who have the control of these things.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do not think, then, that it will come to-day, but to- <lb/>
            morrow. I conjecture this from a dream which I had this very <lb/>
            night, not long ago; and you seem very opportunely to have <lb/>
            refrained from waking me.</p>
          <p>Cri. But what was this dream ?</p>
          <p>Socr. A beautiful and majestic woman, clad in white gar­ <lb/>
            ments, seemed to approach me, and to call to me and say, <lb/>
            “ Socrates, three days hence you will reach fertile Phthia d.”</p>
          <p>Cri. What a strange dream, Socrates !</p>
          <p>Socr. Very clear, however, as it appears to me, Crito.</p>
          <p>3. Cri. Very much so, as it seems. But, my dear Socrates, <lb/>
            even now be persuaded by me, and save yourself. For, if you <lb/>
            die, not only a single calamity will befal me, but besides being <lb/>
            deprived of such a friend as I shall never meet with again, I <lb/>
            shall also appear to many who do not know you and me well, <lb/>
            when I might have saved you, had I been willing to spend my <lb/>
            money, to have neglected to do so. And what character can <lb/>
            be more disgraceful than this to appear to value one's riches <lb/>
            more than one's friends ? For the generality of men will not be <lb/>
            persuaded that you were unwilling to depart hence, when we <lb/>
            urged you to it.</p>
          <p>Socr. But why, my dear Crito, should we care so much for <lb/>
            the opinion of the many? For the most worthy men, whom <note type="footnote">a See the Phædo, So 1. </note><note type="footnote"> b A promontory at the southern extremity of Attica. </note><note type="footnote"> c The Eleven. </note><note type="footnote"> d See Homer's Iliad, 1. ix. v. 363. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            we ought rather to regard, will think that matters have trans­ <lb/>
            pired as they really have.</p>
          <p>Cri. Yet you see, Socrates, that it is necessary to attend to <lb/>
            the opinion of the many. For the very circumstances of the <lb/>
            present case shew that the multitude are able to effect not only <lb/>
            the smallest evils, but even the greatest, if any one is calum­ <lb/>
            niated to them.</p>
          <p>Soer. Would, 0 Crito, that the multitude could effect the <lb/>
            greatest evils, that they might also effect the greatest good, for <lb/>
            then it would be well. But now they can do neither; for they <lb/>
            can neither make a man wise, nor foolish; but they do what­ <lb/>
            ever chances.</p>
          <p>4. Cri. So let it be then. But answer me this, Socrates; <lb/>
            are you not anxious for me and other friends, lest, if you should <lb/>
            escape from hence, informers should give us trouble, as having <lb/>
            secretly carried you off, and so we should be compelled either to <lb/>
            lose all our property, or a very large sum, or to suffer something <lb/>
            else beside this? For, if you fear any thing of the kind, dis­ <lb/>
            miss your fears. For we are justified in running this risk to <lb/>
            save you, and, if need be, even a greater than this. But be <lb/>
            persuaded by me, and do not refuse.</p>
          <p>Soer. I aID anxious about this, Crito, and about many other <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Cri. Do not fear this, however; for the sum is not large on <lb/>
            receipt of which certain persons are willing to save you, and <lb/>
            take you hence. In the next place, do you not see how cheap <lb/>
            these informers are, so that there would be no need of a large <lb/>
            sum for them? My fortune is at your service, sufficient, I <lb/>
            think, for the purpose: then if, out of regard to me, you do <lb/>
            not think right to spend my money, these strangers here are <lb/>
            ready to spend theirs. One of them, Simmias the Theban, <lb/>
            has brought with him a sufficient sum for the very purpose. <lb/>
            Cebes, too, is ready, and very many others. So that, as I said, <lb/>
            do not through fears of this kind hesitate to save yourself, nor <lb/>
            let what you said in court give you any trouble, that if you <lb/>
            went from hence you would not know what to do with your­ <lb/>
            self. For in many places, and wherever you go, men will love <lb/>
            you: and if you are disposed to go to Thessaly, I have friends <lb/>
            there who will esteem you very highly, and will ensure your <lb/>
            safety, so that no one in Thessaly will molest you.</p>
          <p>5. Moreover, Socrates, you do not appear to me to pursue a <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            just course in giving yourself up when you might be saved; <lb/>
            and you press on the very results with respect to yourself <lb/>
            which your enemies would press and have pressed in their <lb/>
            anxiety to destroy you. Besides this, too, you appear to me <lb/>
            to betray your own sons, whom, when it is in your power to <lb/>
            rear and educate them, you will abandon, and, as far as you are <lb/>
            concerned, they will meet with such a fate as chance brings <lb/>
            them, and, as is probable, they will meet with such things as <lb/>
            orphans are wont to experience in a state of orphanage. Surely <lb/>
            one ought not to have children, or one should go through the <lb/>
            toil of rearing and instructing them. But you appear to <lb/>
            me to have chosen the most indolent course; though you <lb/>
            ought to have chosen such a course as a good and brave <lb/>
            man would have done, since you profess to have made virtue <lb/>
            your study through the whole of your life ; so that I am <lb/>
            ashamed both for you and for us who are your friends, lest <lb/>
            this whole affair of yours should seem to be the effect of cow­ <lb/>
            ardice on our part; your appearing to stand your trial in the <lb/>
            court, since you appeared when it was in your power not to <lb/>
            have done so, the very manner in which the trial was con­ <lb/>
            ducted, and this last circumstance, as it were a ridiculous con­ <lb/>
            summation of the whole business, your appearing to have es­ <lb/>
            caped from us through our indolence and cowardice, who did <lb/>
            not save you, nor did you save yourself, when it was practi­ <lb/>
            cable and possible, had we but exerted ourselves a little. Think <lb/>
            of these things, therefore, Socrates, and beware, lest, besides the <lb/>
            evil that will result, they be disgraceful both to you and to us ; <lb/>
            advise then with yourself, though indeed there is no longer <lb/>
            time for advising, your resolve should be already made. And <lb/>
            there is but one plan; for in the following night the whole <lb/>
            must be accomplished. If we delay, it will be impossible and <lb/>
            no longer practicable. By all means, therefore, Socrates, be <lb/>
            persuaded by me, and on no account refuse.</p>
          <p>6. Socr. My dear Crito, your zeal would be very commendable <lb/>
            were it united with right principle; otherwise, by how much <lb/>
            the more earnest it is, by so much is it the more sad. We <lb/>
            must consider, therefore, whether this plan should be adopted <lb/>
            or not. For I not now only, but always, am a person who will <lb/>
            obey nothing within me but reason, according as it appears to <lb/>
            me on mature deliberation to be best. And the reasons, which <lb/>
            I formerly professed, I cannot now reject, because this misfor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            tune has befallen me; but they appear to me in much the same <lb/>
            light, and I respect and honour them as before; so that if we are <lb/>
            unable to adduce any better at the present time, be assured that <lb/>
            I shall not give in to you, even though the power of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude should endeavour to terrify us like children; by threaten­ <lb/>
            ing more than it does now, bonds and death, and confiscation of <lb/>
            property. How, therefore, may we consider the matter most <lb/>
            conveniently ? First of all, if we recur to the argument which <lb/>
            you used about opinions, whether on former occasions. it was <lb/>
            rightly resolved or not, that we ought to pay attention to some <lb/>
            opinions, and to others not; or whether, before it was neces­ <lb/>
            sary that I should die, it was rightly resolved, but now it has <lb/>
            become clear that it was said idly for argument's sake, though <lb/>
            in reality it was merely jest and trifling. I desire then, Crito, <lb/>
            to consider, in common with you, whether it will appear to <lb/>
            me in a different light now that I am in this condition, or the <lb/>
            same, and whether we shall give it up or yield to it. It was <lb/>
            said, I think, on former occasions, by those who were thought <lb/>
            to speak seriously, as I just now observed, that of the opinions <lb/>
            which men entertain some should be very highly esteemed <lb/>
            and others not. By the gods, Onto, does not this appear to <lb/>
            you to be well said ? For you, in all human probability, are <lb/>
            out of all danger of dying to-morrow, and the present calamity <lb/>
            will not lead your judgment astray. Consider then: does it <lb/>
            not appear to you to have been rightly settled, that we ought <lb/>
            not to respect all the opinions of men, but some we should and <lb/>
            others not? Nor yet the opinions of all men, but of some we <lb/>
            should and of others not? What say you ? Is not this rightly <lb/>
            resolved ?</p>
          <p>Cri. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, we should respect the good but not the <lb/>
            bad?</p>
          <p>Cri. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And are not the good those of the wise, and the bad <lb/>
            those of the foolish ?</p>
          <p>Cri. How can it be otherwise?</p>
          <p>7. Soer. Come then, how again were the following points set­ <lb/>
            tIed? Does a man who practises gymnastic exercises, and <lb/>
            applies himself to them, ray attention to the praise and cen­ <lb/>
            sure and opinion of every one, or of that one man only who <lb/>
            happens to be a physician or teacher of the exercises ?</p><pb n="36"/>
            
          <p>Cri. Of that one only.</p>
          <p>Socr. He ought, therefore, to fear the censures and covet <lb/>
            the praises of that one, but not those of the multitude.</p>
          <p>Cri. Clearly.</p>
          <p>Socr. He ought, therefore, so to practise and exercise him­ <lb/>
            self, and to eat and drink, as seems fitting to the one who pre­ <lb/>
            sides and knows, rather than to all others together.</p>
          <p>Cri. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well, then, if be disobeys the one, and disregards his <lb/>
            opinion and praise, but respects that of the multitude and of <lb/>
            those who know nothing, will he not suffer some evil ?</p>
          <p>Cri. How should he not?</p>
          <p>Socr. But what is this evil ? whither does it tend, and on <lb/>
            what part of him that disobeys will it fall ?</p>
          <p>Cri. Clearly on his body, for this it ruins.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say well. The case is the same too, Crito, with <lb/>
            all other .things, not to go through them all. With respect, <lb/>
            then, to things just and unjust, base and honourable, good and <lb/>
            evil, about which we are now consulting, ought we to follow <lb/>
            the opinion of the multitude, and to respect it, or that of one, <lb/>
            if there is any one who understands, whom we ought to reve­ <lb/>
            rence and respect rather than all others together ? and if we <lb/>
            do not obey him, shall we not corrupt and injure that part of <lb/>
            ourselves which becomes better by justice, but is ruined by <lb/>
            injustice ? Or is this nothing ?</p>
          <p>Cri. I agree with you, Socrates.</p>
          <p>8. Soer. Come then, if we destroy that which becomes better <lb/>
            by what is wholesome, but is impaired by what is unwhole­ <lb/>
            some, through being persuaded by those who do not under­ <lb/>
            stand, can we enjoy life when that is impaired ? And this is <lb/>
            the body we are speaking of, is it not?</p>
          <p>Cri. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Can we then enjoy life with a diseased and impaired <lb/>
            body ?</p>
          <p>Cri. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. But can we enjoy life when that is impaired which <lb/>
            inj stice ruins, but justice benefits? Or do we think that to <lb/>
            be of less value than the body, whatever part of us it may be, <lb/>
            about which injustice and justice are concerned?</p>
          <p>Cri. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. But of more value ?</p><pb n="37"/>
            
          <p>Cri. Much more.</p>
          <p>Socr. We must not, then, my excellent friend, so milch re­ <lb/>
            gard what the multitude will say of us, but what he will say who <lb/>
            understands the just and unjust; the one, even truth itself; <lb/>
            So that at first you did not set out with a right principle, when <lb/>
            you laid it down that we ought to regard the opinion of the <lb/>
            multitude with respect to things just and honourable and good, <lb/>
            and their contraries. However, some one may say, are not the <lb/>
            multitude able to put us to death ?</p>
          <p>Cri. This, too, is clear, Socrates; any one might say so. <lb/>
            Socr. You say truly. But, my admirable friend, this prin­ <lb/>
            ciple which we have just discussed appears to me to be the <lb/>
            same as it was beforee. And consider this moreover, whether <lb/>
            it still holds good with us or not, that we are not to be anxious <lb/>
            about living, but about living well.</p>
          <p>Cri. It does hold good.</p>
          <p>Socr. And does this hold good or not, that to live well and <lb/>
            honourably and justly, are the same thing?</p>
          <p>Cri. It does.</p>
          <p>9. Socr. From what has been admitted, then, this considera­ <lb/>
            tion arises, whether it is just or not, that I should endeavour to <lb/>
            leave this place without the permission of the Athenians. And <lb/>
            should it appear to be just, we will make the attempt; but if <lb/>
            not, we will give it up; but as to the considerations which you <lb/>
            mention, of an outlay of money, reputation, and the education <lb/>
            of children, beware, Crito, lest such considerations as these in <lb/>
            reality belong to these multitudes, who rashly put one to death, <lb/>
            and would restore one to life, if they could do so, without any <lb/>
            reason at all. But we, since reason so requires, must consider <lb/>
            nothing else than what we just now mentioned, whether we <lb/>
            shall act justly in paying money and contracting obligations to <lb/>
            those who will lead me hence, as well they who lead me as we <lb/>
            who are led hence, or whether in truth we shall not act un­ <lb/>
            justly in doing all these things. And if we should appear in <lb/>
            so doing to be acting unjustly, observe that we must not con­ <lb/>
            sider whether from remaining here and continuing quiet we <lb/>
            must needs die, or suffer any thing else, rather than whether <lb/>
            we shall be acting unjustly. <note type="footnote"> e That is to say, the principle which we bad laid down in former dis­ <lb/>
            cussions, that no regard is to be had to popular opinion, is still found to <lb/>
            hold good. </note></p><pb n="38"/>
            
          <p>Cri. You appear to me to speak wisely, Socrates; but see <lb/>
            what we are to do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us consider the matter together, my friend; and <lb/>
            if you have any thing to object to what I say make good your <lb/>
            objection, and I will yield to you; but if not, cease, my ex­ <lb/>
            cellent friend, to urge upon me the same thing so often, that I <lb/>
            ought to depart hence, against the will of the Athenians. For <lb/>
            I highly esteem your endeavours to persuade me thus to act, <lb/>
            so long as it is not against my will. Consider, then, the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of our enquiry, whether it is stated to your entire <lb/>
            satisfaction, and endeavour to answer the question put to you <lb/>
            exactly as you think right.</p>
          <p>Cri. I will endeavour to do so.</p>
          <p>10. Socr. Say we, then, that we should on no account deli­ <lb/>
            berately commit injustice, or may we commit injustice under <lb/>
            certain circumstances, under others not ? Or is it on no ac­ <lb/>
            count either good or honourable to commit injustice, as we <lb/>
            have often agreed on former occasions, and as we just now <lb/>
            said? Or have all those our former admissions been dissi­ <lb/>
            pated in these few days; and have we, Crito, old men as we <lb/>
            are, been for a long time seriously conversing with each other, <lb/>
            without knowing that we in no respect differ from children ? <lb/>
            Or does the case, beyond all question, stand as we then deter­ <lb/>
            mined ? whether the multitude allow it or not, and whether we <lb/>
            must suffer a more severe or a milder punishment than this, <lb/>
            still is injustice on every account both evil and disgraceful to <lb/>
            him who commits it ? Do we admit this, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cri. We do admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. On no account, therefore, ought we to act unjustly.</p>
          <p>Cri. Surely not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither ought one who is injured to return the injury, <lb/>
            as the multitude think, since it is on no account right to act <lb/>
            unjustly.</p>
          <p>Cri. It appears not.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? Is it right to do evil, Crito, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cri. Surely it is not right, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? To do evil in return when one has been <lb/>
            evil-entreated, is that right or not ?</p>
          <p>Cri. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. For to do evil to men, differs in no respect from com­ <lb/>
            mitting injustice.</p><pb n="39"/>
            
          <p>Cri. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not right, therefore, to return an injury, or to do <lb/>
            evil to any man, however one may have suffered from him. <lb/>
            But take care Crito, that in allowing these things, you do not <lb/>
            allow them contrary to your opinion. For I know that to some <lb/>
            few only these things both do appear and will appear to be <lb/>
            true. They then to whom these things appear true, and they <lb/>
            to whom they do not, have no sentiment in common, and must <lb/>
            needs despise each other, while they look to each other's <lb/>
            opinions. Consider well then, whether you coincide and think <lb/>
            with me; and whether we can begin our deliberations from this <lb/>
            point, that it is never right either to do an injury, or to return <lb/>
            an injury, or when one has been evil-entreated to revenge one's- <lb/>
            self by doing evil in return; or, do you dissent from and not <lb/>
            coincide in this principle? For so it appears to me both long <lb/>
            since and now; but if you in any respect think otherwise, say <lb/>
            so and inform me. But if you persist in your former opinions, <lb/>
            hear what follows.</p>
          <p>Cri. I do persist in them and think with you. Speak on then.</p>
          <p>Socr. I say next then, or rather I ask; whether when a mail <lb/>
            has promised to do things that are just, he ought to do them, <lb/>
            or evade his promise ?</p>
          <p>Cri. He ought to do them.</p>
          <p>11. Socr. Observe then what follows. By departing hence <lb/>
            without the leave of the city, are we not doing evil to some, <lb/>
            and that to those to whom we ought least of all to do it, or <lb/>
            not ? And do we abide by what we agreed on as being just. <lb/>
            or do we not?</p>
          <p>Cri. I am unable to answer your question, Socrates: for I <lb/>
            do not understand it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then consider it thus. If while we were preparing <lb/>
            to run away, or by whatever name we should call it, the laws <lb/>
            and commonwealth should come and, presenting themselves <lb/>
            before us, should say: " Tell me, Socrates, what do you pur­ <lb/>
            pose doing? Do you design any thing else by this proceeding <lb/>
            in which you are engaged, than to destroy'us, the laws, and <lb/>
            the whole city as far as you are able? Or do you think it <lb/>
            possible for that city any longer to subsist and not be sub­ <lb/>
            verted, in which judgments that are passed have no force, but <lb/>
            are set aside and destroyed by private persons ?" What should <lb/>
            we say, Onto, to these and similar remonstrances? For any <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            one, especially an orator, would have much to say on the vio­ <lb/>
            lation of the law, which enjoins that judgments passed shall <lb/>
            be enforced. Shall we say to them that the city has done us <lb/>
            an injustice and not passed a right sentence? Shall we say <lb/>
            this, or what else ?</p>
          <p>Cri. This, by Jupiter, Socrates.</p>
          <p>12. Socr. What then if the laws should say: "Socrates, <lb/>
            was it not agreed between us that you should abide by the <lb/>
            judgments which the city should pronounce?" And if wo <lb/>
            should wonder at their speaking thus, perhaps they would <lb/>
            say, " Wonder not, Socrates, at what we say, but answer, <lb/>
            since you are accustomed to make use of questions and <lb/>
            answers. For come, what charge have you against us and <lb/>
            the city, that you attempt to destroy us? Did we not first <lb/>
            give you being? and did not your father through us take <lb/>
            your mother to wife and beget you? Say then, do you find <lb/>
            fault with those laws amongst us. that relate to marriage as <lb/>
            being bad?" I should say, "I do not find fault with them." <lb/>
            "Do you with those that relate to your nurture when born, <lb/>
            and the education with which you were instructed? Or did <lb/>
            not the laws, ordained on this point, enjoin rightly, in requir­ <lb/>
            ing your father to instruct you in music and gymnastic exer­ <lb/>
            cises?" I should say, rightly. Well then: since you were <lb/>
            born, nurtured, and educated through our means, can you say, <lb/>
            first of all, that you are not both our offspring and our slave, as <lb/>
            well you as your ancestors ? And if this be so, do you think <lb/>
            that there are equal rights between us, and whatever we <lb/>
            attempt to do to you, do you think you may justly do to us <lb/>
            in turn ? Or had you not equal rights with your father, or <lb/>
            master, if you happened to have one, so as to return what <lb/>
            you suffered, neither to retort when found fault with, nor <lb/>
            when stricken to strike again, nor many other things of the <lb/>
            kind; but that with your country and the laws you may do <lb/>
            so; so that if we attempt to destroy you, thinking it to be just, <lb/>
            you also should endeavour as far as you are able, in return to <lb/>
            destroy us, the laws, and your country, and in doing this will <lb/>
            you say that you act justly, you who, in reality, make virtue <lb/>
            your chief object? Or are you so wise as not to know that <lb/>
            one's country is more honourable, venerable and sacred, and <lb/>
            more highly prized both by gods and men possessed of under­ <lb/>
            standing, than mother and father, and all other progenitors, <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            and that one ought to reverence, submit to, and appease one's <lb/>
            country, when angry, rather than one's father, and either per­ <lb/>
            suade it or do what it orders, and to suffer quietly if it bids <lb/>
            one suffer, whether to be beaten, or put in bonds; or if it <lb/>
            sends one out to battle there to be wounded or slain, this <lb/>
            must be done, for justice so requires, and one must not give <lb/>
            way, or retreat, or leave one's post; but that both in war, and <lb/>
            in a court of justice, and every where, one must do what one's <lb/>
            city and country enjoins, or persuade it in such manner as <lb/>
            justice allows : but that to offer violence either to one's mother <lb/>
            or father is not holy, much less to one's country ? What shall <lb/>
            we say to these things, Crito ? That the laws speak the truth <lb/>
            or not ?</p>
          <p>Cri. It seems so to me.</p>
          <p>13. Socr. " Consider, then, Socrates," the laws perhaps <lb/>
            might say, " whether we say truly that in what you are now <lb/>
            attempting you are attempting to do what is not just towards <lb/>
            us. For we, having given you birth, nurtured, instructed you, <lb/>
            and having imparted to you and all other citizens all the good <lb/>
            in our power, still proclaim, by giving the power to every <lb/>
            Athenian who pleases, when he has arrived at years of dis­ <lb/>
            cretion and become acquainted with the business of the state, <lb/>
            and us, the laws, that any one, who is not satisfied with us, <lb/>
            may take his property and go wherever he pleases. And if <lb/>
            any one of you wishes to go to a colony, if he is not satisfied <lb/>
            with us and the city, or to migrate and settle in another <lb/>
            country, none of us, the laws, hinder or forbid him going <lb/>
            whithersoever he pleases, taking with him all his property. <lb/>
            But whoever continues with us after he has seen the manner <lb/>
            in which we administer justice, and in other respects govern <lb/>
            the city, we now say, that he has in fact entered into a com­ <lb/>
            pact with us, to do what we order, and we affirm that he who <lb/>
            does not obey is in three respects guilty of injustice, because <lb/>
            he does not obey us who gave him being, and because he does <lb/>
            not obey us who nurtured him, and because, having made a <lb/>
            compact that he would obey us, he neither does so nor does <lb/>
            he persuade us if we do any thing wrongly, though we pro­ <lb/>
            pose for his consideration, and do not rigidly command him <lb/>
            to do what we order, but leave him the choice of one of two <lb/>
            things, either to persuade us, or to do what we require, and <lb/>
            yet he does neither of these.</p><pb n="42"/>
            
          <p>14. " And we say that you, 0 Socrates, will be subject to <lb/>
            these charges if you accomplish your design, and that not <lb/>
            least of the Athenians, but most so of all." And if I should <lb/>
            ask, for what reason? They would probably justly retort on <lb/>
            me by saying, that among all the Athenians I especially made <lb/>
            this compact with them. For they would say, " Socrates, we <lb/>
            have strong proof of this, that you were satisfied both with us <lb/>
            and the city; for of all the Athenians you especially would <lb/>
            never have dwelt in it, if it had not been especially agreeable <lb/>
            to you. For you never went out of the city to any of the <lb/>
            public spectacles, except once to the Isthmian games, nor any <lb/>
            where else, except on military service, nor have you ever gone <lb/>
            abroad as other men do, nor had you ever had any desire to <lb/>
            become acquainted with any other city or other laws, but we <lb/>
            and our city were sufficient for you; so strongly were you <lb/>
            attached to us, and so far did you consent to submit to our <lb/>
            government, both in other respects and in begetting children in <lb/>
            this city, in consequence of your being satisfied with it. More­ <lb/>
            over in your very trial, it was in your power to have imposed <lb/>
            on yourself a sentence of exile, if you pleased, and might then <lb/>
            have done, with the consent of the city, what you now attempt <lb/>
            against its consent. Then indeed you boasted yourself as not <lb/>
            being grieved if you must needs die ; but you preferred, as you <lb/>
            said, death to exile. Now, however, you are neither ashamed <lb/>
            of those professions, nor do you revere us, the laws, since <lb/>
            you endeavour to destroy us; and you act as the vilest slave <lb/>
            would act, by endeavouring to make your escape contrary to <lb/>
            the conventions and the compacts by which you engaged to <lb/>
            submit to our government. First then, therefore, answer us <lb/>
            this, whether we speak the truth or not in affirming that you <lb/>
            agreed to be governed by us in deed though not in word ?" <lb/>
            What shall we say to this, Crito ? Can we do otherwise than <lb/>
            assent?</p>
          <p>Cri. We must needs do so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. "What else, then," they will say, " are you doing but <lb/>
            violating the conventions and compacts which you made with <lb/>
            us, though you did not enter into them from compulsion or <lb/>
            through deception, or from being compelled to determine in a <lb/>
            short time, but during the space of seventy years, in which you <lb/>
            might have departed if you had been dissatisfied with us, and <lb/>
            the compacts had not appeared to you to be just? You, how­ <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            ever, neither preferred Lacedremon nor Crete, which you seve­ <lb/>
            ral times said are governed by good laws, nor any other of the <lb/>
            Grecian or barbarian cities ; but you have been less out of <lb/>
            Athens than the lame and the blind, and other maimed per­ <lb/>
            sons. So much, it is evident, were you satisfied with the city <lb/>
            and is, the laws, beyond the rest of the Athenians: for who <lb/>
            can be satisfied with a city without laws ? But now will you <lb/>
            not abide by your compacts? You will, if you are persuaded <lb/>
            by us, Socrates, and will not make yourself ridiculous by leav­ <lb/>
            ing the city.</p>
          <p>15. " For consider, by violating these compacts and offending <lb/>
            against any of them, what good you will do to yourself or your <lb/>
            friends. For that your friends will run the risk of being them­ <lb/>
            selves banished, and deprived of the rights of citizenship, or of <lb/>
            forfeiting their property, is pretty clear. And as for yourself, if <lb/>
            you should go to one of the neighbouring cities, either Thebes <lb/>
            or Megara, for both are governed by good laws, you will go <lb/>
            there, Socrates, as an enemy to their polity, and such as have <lb/>
            any regard for their country will look upon you with suspicion, <lb/>
            regarding you as a corrupter of the laws, and you will confirm <lb/>
            the opinion of the judges, so that they will appear to have con­ <lb/>
            demned you rightly, for whoso is a corrupter of the laws will <lb/>
            appear in all likelihood to be a corrupter of youths and weak­ <lb/>
            minded men. Will you then avoid these well-governed cities, <lb/>
            and the best-ordered men ? And should you do so, will it be <lb/>
            worth your while to live ? Or will you approach them, and <lb/>
            have the effrontery to converse with them, Socrates, on sub­ <lb/>
            jects the same as you did here, that virtue and justice, legal <lb/>
            institutions and laws, should be most highly valued by men ? <lb/>
            And do you not think that this conduct of Socrates would be <lb/>
            very indecorous? You must think so. But you will keep <lb/>
            clear of these places, and go to Thessaly, to Crito's friends, for <lb/>
            there is the greatest disorder and licentiousness, and perhaps <lb/>
            they will gladly hear you relating how drolly you escaped from <lb/>
            prison, .clad in some dress or covered with a skin, or in some <lb/>
            other disguise such as fugitives are wont to dress themselves <lb/>
            in, having so changed your usual appearance. And will no <lb/>
            one say that you, though an old man, with but a short time to <lb/>
            live, in all probability, have dared to have such a base desire of <lb/>
            life as to violate the most sacred laws ? Perhaps not, should <lb/>
            you not offend any one. But if you should, you will hear, <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            Socrates, many things utterly unworthy of you. You will <lb/>
            live, too, in a state of abject dependence on all men, and as <lb/>
            their slave. But what will you do in Thessaly besides feast­ <lb/>
            in-, as if you had gone to Thessaly to a banquet? And what <lb/>
            will become of those discourses about justice and all other vir­ <lb/>
            tues ?-But do you wish to live for the sake of your children, <lb/>
            that you may rear and educate them ? What then ? Will you <lb/>
            take them to Thessaly, and there rear and educate them, mak­ <lb/>
            ing them aliens to their country, that they may owe you this <lb/>
            obligation too ? Or if not so, being reared here, will they be <lb/>
            better reared and educated while you are living, though not <lb/>
            with them? for your friends will take care of them. Whether, <lb/>
            if you go to Thessaly, will they take care of them, but if you <lb/>
            go to Hades will they not take care of them ? If, however, <lb/>
            any advantage is to be derived from those that say they are <lb/>
            your friends, we must think they will.</p>
          <p>16. " Then, 0 Socrates, be persuaded by us who have nur­ <lb/>
            tured you, and do not set a higher value on your children, or <lb/>
            on life, or on any thing else than justice, that, when you arrive <lb/>
            in Hades, you may have all this to say in your defence before <lb/>
            those who have dominion there. For neither here in this life, <lb/>
            if you do what is proposed, does it appear to be better, or more <lb/>
            just, or more holy to yourself, or any of your friends; nor will <lb/>
            it be better for you when you arrive there. But now you de­ <lb/>
            part, if you do depart, unjustly treated, not by us, the laws, but <lb/>
            by men; but should you escape, having thus disgracefully re­ <lb/>
            turned injury for injury, and evil for evil, having violated your <lb/>
            own compacts and conventions which you made with us, and <lb/>
            having done evil to those to whom you least of all should have <lb/>
            done it, namely, yourself, your friends, your country, and us, <lb/>
            both we shall be indignant with you as long as you live, and <lb/>
            there our brothers, the laws in Hades, will not receive you fa­ <lb/>
            vourably, knowing that you attempted, as far as you were able, <lb/>
            to destroy us. Let not Onto, then, persuade you to do what <lb/>
            he advises, rather than we."</p>
          <p>17. These things, my dear friend Onto, be assured I seem <lb/>
            to hear, as the votaries of Cybele f seem to hear the flutes. And <lb/>
            the sound of these words booms in my ear, and makes me in­ <lb/>
            capable of hearing any thing else. Be sure, then, so long as I <note type="footnote"> f The Corybantes, priests of Cybele, who in their solemn festivals made <lb/>

            retain my present opinions, if you should say any thing con­ <lb/>

          <p>Cri. But, Socrates, I have nothing to say.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE PHÆDO.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THIS dialogue presents us with an account of the manner <lb/>
            in which Socrates spent the last day of his life, and how he <lb/>
            met his death. The main subject is that of the soul's immor­ <lb/>
            tality, which Socrates takes upon himself to prove with as <lb/>
            much certainty as it is possible for the human mind to arrive <lb/>
            at. The question itself, though none could be better suited to <lb/>
            the occasion, arises simply and naturally from the general con­ <lb/>
            versation that precedes it.</p>
          <p>When his friends visit him in the morning for the purpose of <lb/>
            spending this his last day with him, they find him sitting up in <lb/>
            bed and rubbing his leg, which had just been freed from bonds. <lb/>
            He remarks on the unaccountable alternation and connexion <lb/>
            between pleasure and pain, and adds that Æsop, had he ob­ <lb/>
            served it, would have made a fable from it. This remark <lb/>
            reminds Cebes of Socrates' having put some of Æsop's fa­ <lb/>
            bles into metre since his imprisonment, and he asks, for the <lb/>
            satisfaction of the poet Evenus, what had induced him to do <lb/>
            so. Socrates explains his reason, and concludes by bidding <lb/>
            him tell Evenus to follow him as soon as he can. Simmias <lb/>
            expresses his surprise at this message, on which Socrates asks, <lb/>
            " Is not Evenus a philosopher ?" and on the question being <lb/>
            answered in the affirmative, he says, that he or any philoso­ <lb/>
            pher would be willing to die, though perhaps he would not <lb/>
            commit violence on himself. This, again, seems a contradic­ <lb/>
            tion to Simmias, but Socrates explains it by shewing that our <lb/>
            souls are placed in the body by God, and may not leave it <lb/>
            without His permission. Whereupon Cebes objects, that in <lb/>
            that case foolish men only would wish to die and quit the ser­ <lb/>
            vice of the best of masters, to which Simmias agrees. Socra­ <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            tes, therefore, proposes to plead his cause before them, and to <lb/>
            shew that there is a great probability that after this life he <lb/>
            shall go into the presence of God and good men, and be happy <lb/>
            in proportion to the purity of his own mind.</p>
          <p>He beginsa by stating that philosophy itself is nothing else <lb/>
            than a preparation for and meditation on death. Death and <lb/>
            philosophy have this in common : death separates the soul <lb/>
            from the body, philosophy draws off the mind from bodily <lb/>
            things to the contemplation of truth and virtue: for he is not <lb/>
            a true philosopher who is led away by bodily pleasures, since <lb/>
            the senses are the source of ignorance and all evil; the mind, <lb/>
            therefore, is entirely occupied in meditating on death, and <lb/>
            freeing itself as much as possible from the body. How, then, <lb/>
            can such a man be afraid of death ? He who grieves at the <lb/>
            approach of death cannot be a true lover of wisdom, but is <lb/>
            a lover of his body. And, indeed, most men are temperate <lb/>
            through intemperance, that is to say, they abstain from some <lb/>
            pleasures that they may the more easily and permanently en­ <lb/>
            joy others. They embrace only a shadow of virtue, not virtue <lb/>
            itself, since they estimate the value of all things by the plea­ <lb/>
            sures they afford. Whereas the philosopher purifies his mind <lb/>
            from all such things, and pursues virtue and wisdom for their <lb/>
            own sakes. This course Socrates himself had pursued to the <lb/>
            utmost of his ability, with what success he should shortly <lb/>
            know; and on these grounds he did not repine at leaving his <lb/>
            friends in this world, being persuaded that in another he should <lb/>
            meet with good masters and good friends.</p>
          <p>Upon this Cebesb says that he-agrees with all else that had <lb/>
            been said, but cannot help entertaining doubts of what will be­ <lb/>
            come of the soul when separated from the body, for the com­ <lb/>
            mon opinion is that it is dispersed and vanishes like breath or <lb/>
            smoke, and no longer exists any where. Socrates, therefore, <lb/>
            proposes to enquire into the probability of the case, a fit em­ <lb/>
            ployment for him under his present circumstances. <note type="footnote"> a § 21—39. </note><note type="footnote">b § 39, 40. </note></p><pb n="48"/>
            
          <p>His first argumentc is drawn from the ancient belief preva­ <lb/>
            lent amongst men, that souls departing hence exist in Hades, <lb/>
            and are produced again from the dead. If this be true, it <lb/>
            must follow that our souls are there, for they could not be pro­ <lb/>
            duced again if they did not exist: and its truth is confirmed <lb/>
            by this, that it is a general law of nature that contraries are <lb/>
            produced from contraries, the greater from the less, strong <lb/>
            from weak, slow from swift, heat from cold, and in like man­ <lb/>
            ner life from death, and vice versd. To explain this more <lb/>
            clearly, he proceeds to shew that what is changed passes from <lb/>
            one state to another, and so undergoes three different states, <lb/>
            first the actual state, then the transition, and thirdly the new <lb/>
            state, as from a state of sleep, by awaking to being awake : <lb/>
            in like manner birth is a transition from a state of death to <lb/>
            life, and dying from life to death, so that the soul, by the act <lb/>
            of dying, only passes to another state; if it were not so, all <lb/>
            nature would in time become dead, just as if people did not <lb/>
            awake out of sleep all would at last be buried in eternal sleep. <lb/>
            Whence the conclusion is that the souls of men are not anni­ <lb/>
            hilated by death.</p>
          <p>Cebesd agrees to this reasoning, and adds that he is further <lb/>
            convinced of its truth by calling to mind an argument used <lb/>
            by Socrates on former occasions, that knowledge is nothing <lb/>
            but reminiscence, and if this is so, the soul must have existed <lb/>
            and had knowledge before it became united to the body.</p>
          <p>But in case Simmias should not yet be satisfied, Socrates e <lb/>
            proceeds to enlarge on this, his second argument, drawn from <lb/>
            reminiscence. We daily find that we are carried from the <lb/>
            knowledge of one thing to another. Things perceived by the <lb/>
            eyes, ears, and other senses, bring up the thought of other <lb/>
            things : thus the sight of a lyre or a garment reminds us of a <lb/>
            friend, and not only are we thus reminded of sensible objects, <lb/>
            but of things which are comprehended by the mind alone, and <lb/>
            have no sensitive existence. For we have formed in our minds <note type="footnote"> c § 40—46.</note><note type="footnote">d § 47. </note><note type="footnote">e § 48—57. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            an idea of abstract equality, of the beautiful, the just, the good, <lb/>
            in short, of every thing which we say exists without the aid of <lb/>
            the senses, for we use them only in the perception of individual <lb/>
            things, whence it follows that the mind did not acquire this <lb/>
            knowledge in this life, but must have had it before, and there­ <lb/>
            fore the soul must have existed before.</p>
          <p>Simmias and Cebesf both agree in admitting that Socrates <lb/>
            has proved the pre-existence of the soul, but insist that he has <lb/>
            not shewn it to be immortal, for that nothing hinders but that, <lb/>
            according to the popular opinion, it may be dispersed at the <lb/>
            dissolution of the body. To which Socrates replies, that if <lb/>
            their former admissions are joined to his last argument, the <lb/>
            immortality, as well as the pre-existence of the soul, has been <lb/>
            sufficiently proved. For if it is true that any thing living is <lb/>
            produced from that which is dead, then the soul must exist <lb/>
            after death, otherwise it could not be produced again.</p>
          <p>However to remove the apprehension that the soul may be <lb/>
            dispersed by a wind as it were, Socrates proceeds, in his third <lb/>
            arguments, to examine that doubt more thoroughly. What <lb/>
            then is meant by being dispersed but being dissolved into its <lb/>
            parts ? In order therefore to a thing being capable of dis­ <lb/>
            persion it must be compounded of parts. Now there are two <lb/>
            kinds of things, one compounded, the other simple, the former <lb/>
            kind is subject to change, the latter not, and can be compre­ <lb/>
            hended by the mind alone. The one is visible, the other in­ <lb/>
            visible ; and the soul, which is invisible, when it employs the <lb/>
            bodily senses wanders and is confused, but when it abstracts <lb/>
            itself from the body it attains to the knowledge of that which <lb/>
            is eternal, immortal, and unchangeable. The soul, therefore, <lb/>
            being uncompounded and invisible must be indissoluble, that <lb/>
            is to say immortal.</p>
          <p>Still Simmias and Cebesh are unconvinced. The former <lb/>
            objects, that the soul, according to Socrates' own shewing, <lb/>
            is nothing but a harmony resulting from a combination of the <note type="footnote"> f § 55—59. </note><note type="footnote">g § 61—75. </note><note type="footnote">h § 76-84. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            parts of the body, and so may perish with the body as the <lb/>
            harmony of a lyre does when the lyre itself is broken. And <lb/>
            Cebes, though he admits that the soul is more durable than the <lb/>
            body, yet objects that it is not therefore of necessity immortal <lb/>
            but may in time wear out, and it is by no means clear that this <lb/>
            is not its last period.</p>
          <p>These objections produce a powerful effect on the rest of <lb/>
            the company, but Socrates, undismayed, exhorts them not to <lb/>
            suffer themselves to be deterred from seeking the truth by any <lb/>
            difficulties they may meet with; and then proceedsi to shew, <lb/>
            in a moment, the fallacy of Simmias' objection. It was before <lb/>
            admitted, he says, that the soul existed before the body, but <lb/>
            harmony is produced after the lyre is formed, so that the two <lb/>
            cases are totally different. And further, there are various <lb/>
            degrees of harmony, but every soul is as much a soul as any <lb/>
            other. But then what will a person who holds this doctrine, <lb/>
            that the soul is harmony, say of virtue and vice in the soul ? <lb/>
            Will he call them another kind of harmony and discord ? If so, <lb/>
            he will contradict himself, for it is admitted that one soul is <lb/>
            not more -or less a soul than another, and therefore one cannot <lb/>
            be more or less harmonized than another, and one could not <lb/>
            admit of a greater degree of virtue or vice than another; and <lb/>
            indeed a soul, being harmony, could not partake of vice at all, <lb/>
            which is discord.</p>
          <p>Socrates, having thus satisfactorily answered the argument <lb/>
            adduced by Simmias, goes on to rebut that of Cebesk, who <lb/>
            objected that the soul might in time wear out. In order to <lb/>
            do this, he relates that when a young man he attempted to <lb/>
            investigate the causes of every thing, why they exist and why <lb/>
            they perish; and in the course of his researches finding the <lb/>
            futility of attributing the existence of things to what are called <lb/>
            natural causes, he resolved on endeavouring to find out the <lb/>
            reasons of things. He therefore assumed that there is a <lb/>
            certain abstract beauty, and goodness, and magnitude, and <note type="footnote"> i § 93—99. </note><note type="footnote">k § 100—112. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            so of all other things: the truth of which being granted he <lb/>
            thinks he shall be able to prove that the soul is immortal.</p>
          <p>This then being conceded by Cebes, Socratesl argues that <lb/>
            every thing that is beautiful is so from partaking of ab­ <lb/>
            stract beauty, and great from partaking of magnitude, and <lb/>
            little from partaking of littleness. Now it is impossible he <lb/>
            argues that contraries can exist in the same thing at the <lb/>
            same time, for instance the same thing cannot possess both <lb/>
            magnitude and littleness, but one will withdraw at the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of the other: and not only so, but things which, <lb/>
            though not contrary to each other, yet always contain con­ <lb/>
            traries within themselves cannot co-exist; for instance the <lb/>
            number three has no contrary, yet it contains within itself <lb/>
            the idea of odd, which is the contrary to even, and so three <lb/>
            never can become even; in like manner heat while it is heat <lb/>
            can never admit the idea of its contrary, cold. Now if this <lb/>
            method of reasoning is applied to the soul it will be found to <lb/>
            be immortal; for life and death are contraries, and never can <lb/>
            co-exist, but wherever the soul is there is life, so that it con­ <lb/>
            tains within itself that which is contrary to death, and conse­ <lb/>
            quently can never admit of death ; therefore it is immortal.</p>
          <p>With this he closes his arguments in support of the sours <lb/>
            immortality. Cebes owns himself convinced, but Simmias, <lb/>
            though he is unable to make any objection to the soundness of <lb/>
            Socrates' reasoning, cannot help still entertaining doubts on <lb/>
            the subject. If, however, the soul is immortal, Socrates pro­ <lb/>
            ceedsm, great need is there in this life to endeavour to become <lb/>
            as wise and good as possible. For if death were a deliverance <lb/>
            from every thing it would be a great gain for the wicked, but <lb/>
            since the soul appears to be immortal, it must go to the place <lb/>
            suited to its nature. For it is said that each person's demon <lb/>
            conducts him to a place where he receives sentence according <lb/>
            to his deserts.</p>
          <p>He then" draws a fanciful picture of the various regions of <note type="footnote"> 1 § 112—128. </note><note type="footnote">m § 129—131. </note><note type="footnote">n § 132—145. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            the earth, to which the good and the bad will respectively go <lb/>
            after death, and exhorts his friends to use every endeavour to <lb/>
            acquire virtue and wisdom in this life, " for," he adds, " the <lb/>
            reward is noble and the hope great."</p>
          <p>Having thus brought his subject to a conclusion, Socrates <lb/>
            proposes to bathe himself, in order not to trouble others to <lb/>
            wash his dead body. Crito thereupon asks if he has any com­ <lb/>
            mands to give, and especially how he would be buried, to which <lb/>
            he, with his usual cheerfulness, makes answer, " Just as you <lb/>
            please, if only you can catch me;" and then, smiling, he re­ <lb/>
            minds them that after death he shall be no longer with them, <lb/>
            and begs the others of the party to be sureties to Onto for his <lb/>
            absence from the body, as they had been before bound for his <lb/>
            presence before his judges.</p>
          <p>After he had bathed, and taken leave of his children and the <lb/>
            women of his family, the officer of the Eleven comes in to inti­ <lb/>
            mate to him that it is now time to drink the poison. Crito <lb/>
            urges a little delay, as the sun had not yet set, but Socrates <lb/>
            ' refuses to make himself ridiculous by shewing such a fondness <lb/>
            for life; the man who is to administer the poison is therefore <lb/>
            sent for, and on his holding out the cup, Socrates, neither <lb/>
            trembling nor changing colour or countenance at all, but, as <lb/>
            he was wont, looking stedfastly at the man, asked if he might <lb/>
            make a libation to any one, and being told that no more poison <lb/>
            than enough had been mixed, he simply prayed that his depar­ <lb/>
            ture from this to another world might be happy, and then <lb/>
            drank off the poison readily and calmly. His friends, who had <lb/>
            hitherto with difficulty restrained themselves, could no longer <lb/>
            control the outward expressions of grief, to which Socrates <lb/>
            said, “ What are you doing, my friends ? I, for this reason <lb/>
            chiefly, sent away the women, that they might not commit <lb/>
            any folly of this kind. For I have heard that it is right to die <lb/>
            with good omens. Be quiet, therefore, and bear up."</p>
          <p>When he had walked about for a while his legs began to <lb/>
            grow heavy, so he laid down on his back, and his body, from <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            the feet upwards, gradually grew cold and stiff. His last <lb/>
            words were, "Crito, we owe a cock to Æsculapius: pay it, <lb/>
            therefore, and do not neglect it."</p>
          <p>"This," concludes Phædo, "was the end of our friend, a <lb/>
            man, as we may say, the best of all his time that we have <lb/>
            known, and moreover, the most wise and just."</p>

          <p>Ech. WERE you personally present, Phædo, with Socrates <lb/>
            on that day when he drank the poison in prison ? or did you <lb/>
            hear an account of it from some one else ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. I was there myself, Echecrates.</p>
          <p>Ech. What then did he say before his death ? and how did <lb/>
            he die ? for I should be glad to hear: for scarcely any citizen <lb/>
            of Phlius a ever visits Athens now, nor has any stranger for a <lb/>
            long time come from thence, who was able to give us a clear <lb/>
            account of the particulars, except that he died from drinking <lb/>
            poison ; but he was unable to tell us any thing more.</p>
          <p>2. Phæd. And did you not hear about the trial how it <lb/>
            went off ?</p>
          <p>Ech. Yes ; some one told me this ; and I wondered, that as it <lb/>
            took place so long ago, he appears to have died long afterwards. <lb/>
            What was the reason of this, Phædo ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. An accidental circumstance happened in his favour, <lb/>
            Echecrates : for the poop of the ship which the Athenians send <lb/>
            to Delos, chanced to be crowned on the day before the trial.</p>
          <p>Ech. But what is this ship ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. It is the ship, as the Athenians say, in which Theseus <lb/>
            formerly conveyed the fourteen boys and girls to Crete, and <lb/>
            saved both them and himself. They, therefore, made a vow <lb/>
            to Apollo on that occasion, as it is said, that if they were <lb/>
            saved they would every year despatch a solemn embassy to <note type="footnote"> a Phlius, to which Echecrates belonged, was a town of Sicyonia in <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            Delos ; which from that time to the present, they send yearly <lb/>
            to the god. 3. When they begin the preparations for this <lb/>
            solemn embassy, they have a law that the city shall be purified <lb/>
            during this period, and that no public execution shall take place <lb/>
            until the ship has reached Delos, and returned to Athens: and this <lb/>
            occasionally takes a long time, when the winds happen to im­ <lb/>
            pede their passage. The commencement of the embassy is <lb/>
            when the priest of Apollo has crowned the poop of the ship.' <lb/>
            And this was done, as I said, on the day before the trial: on <lb/>
            this account Socrates had a long interval in prison between the <lb/>
            trial and his death.</p>
          <p>4. Ech. And what, Phædo, were the circumstances of his <lb/>
            death ? what was said and done ? and who of his friends were <lb/>
            with him ? or would not the magistrates allow them to be present, <lb/>
            but did he die destitute of friends ? '</p>
          <p>Phæd. By no means; but some, indeed several, were pre­ <lb/>
            sent.</p>
          <p>Ech. Take the trouble, then, to relate to me all the par­ <lb/>
            ticulars as clearly as you can, unless you have any pressing- <lb/>
            business.</p>
          <p>Phæd. I am at leisure, and will endeavour to give you a full <lb/>
            account: for to call Socrates to mind, whether speaking my­ <lb/>
            self or listening to some one else, is always most delightful <lb/>
            to me.</p>
          <p>5. Ech. And indeed, Phædo, you have others to listen to <lb/>
            you who are of the same mind. However, endeavour to relate <lb/>
            every thing as accurately as you can.</p>
          <p>Phæd. I was indeed wonderfully affected by being present, <lb/>
            for I was not impressed with a feeling of pity, like one <lb/>
            present at the death of a friend ; for the man appeared to me <lb/>
            to be happy, Echecrates, both from his manner and discourse, <lb/>
            so fearlessly and nobly did he meet his death: so much so, <lb/>
            that it occurred to me, that in going to Hades he was not going <lb/>
            without a divine destiny, but that when he arrived there he <lb/>
            would be happy, if any one ever was. For this reason I was <lb/>
            entirely uninfluenced by any feeling of pity, as would seem <lb/>
            likely to be the case with one present-on so mournful an occa­ <lb/>
            sion ; nor was I affected by pleasure from being engaged in <lb/>
            philosophical discussions, as was our custom; for our conver­ <lb/>
            sation was of that kind. But an altogether unaccountable <lb/>
            feeling possessed me, a kind of unusual mixture compounded <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            of pleasure and pain together, when I considered that he was <lb/>
            immediately about to die. And all of us who were present <lb/>
            were affected in much the same manner, at one time laughing, <lb/>
            at another weeping, one of us especially, Apollodorus, for you <lb/>
            know the man and his manner.</p>
          <p>Ech. How should I not ?</p>
          <p>6. Phæd. He, then, was entirely overcome by these emo­ <lb/>
            tions ; and I too was troubled, as well as the others.</p>
          <p>Ech. But who were present, Phsedo ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. Of his fellow-countrymen, this Apollodorus was <lb/>
            present, and Critobulus, and his father Onto, moreover Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes, Epigenes, Æschines, and Antisthenes; Ctesippus the <lb/>
            Pæanian, Menexenus, and some other of his countrymen were <lb/>
            also there : Plato I think was sick.</p>
          <p>Ech. Were any strangers present ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. Yes: Simmias the Theban, Cebes, and Phædondes: <lb/>
            and from Megara, Euclides and Terpsion.</p>
          <p>7. Ech. But what! were not Aristippus and Cleombrotus <lb/>
            present ?</p>
          <p>Phæd. No : for they were said to be at Ægina.</p>
          <p>Ech. Was any one else there?</p>
          <p>Phæd. I think that these were nearly all who were present.</p>
          <p>Ech. Well now: what do you say was the subject of con­ <lb/>
            versation ?</p>
          <p>Phad. I will endeavour to relate the whole to you from the <lb/>
            beginning. On the preceding days I and the others were con­ <lb/>
            stantly in the habit of visiting Socrates, meeting early in the <lb/>
            morning at the court-house where the trial took place, for it <lb/>
            was near the prison. 8. Here then we waited every day <lb/>
            till the prison was opened, conversing with each other; for it <lb/>
            was not opened very early, but, as soon as it was opened we <lb/>
            went in to Socrates, and usually spent the day with him. On <lb/>
            that occasion however, we met earlier than usual; for on the <lb/>
            preceding day, when we left the prison in the evening, we <lb/>
            heard that the ship had arrived from Delos. We therefore <lb/>
            urged each other to come as early as possible to the accustomed <lb/>
            place ; accordingly we came, and the porter, who used to admit <lb/>
            us, coming out, told us to wait, and not enter until he called <lb/>
            us. " For," he said, " the Eleven are now freeing Socrates <lb/>
            from his bonds, and announcing to him that he must die to- <lb/>
            day." But in no long time he returned, and bade us enter.</p><pb n="57"/>
            
          <p>9. When we entered, we found Socrates just freed from <lb/>
            his bonds, and Xantippe, you know her, holding his little boy <lb/>
            and sitting by him. As soon as Xantippe saw us, she wept <lb/>
            aloud and said such things as.women usually do on such occa­ <lb/>
            sions, as " Socrates, your friends will now converse with you <lb/>
            for the last time and you with them." But Socrates, looking <lb/>
            towards Crito, said, " Crito, let some one take her home." <lb/>
            Upon which some of Crito's attendants led her away, wailing <lb/>
            and beating herself.</p>
          <p>But Socrates sitting up in bed, drew up his leg, and rubbed it <lb/>
            with his hand, and as he rubbed it, said; " What an unaccount­ <lb/>
            able thing, my friends, that seems to be, which men call plea­ <lb/>
            sure ; and how wonderfully is it related towards that which <lb/>
            appears to be its contrary, pain ; in that they will not both be <lb/>
            present to a man at the same time, yet, if any one pursues and <lb/>
            attains the one, he is almost always compelled to receive the <lb/>
            other, as if they were both united together from one head.</p>
          <p>10. "And it seems to me," he said, " that if jEsop had ob­ <lb/>
            served this he would have made a fable from it, how the deity, <lb/>
            wishing to reconcile these warring principles, when he could not <lb/>
            do so, united their heads together, and from hence whomsoever <lb/>
            the one visits the other attends immediately after; as ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be the case with me, since I suffered pain in my <lb/>
            leg before from the chain, but now pleasure seems to have <lb/>
            succeeded." I</p>
          <p>Hereupon Cebes, interrupting him, said, " By Jupiter, So­ <lb/>
            crates, you have done well in reminding me: with respect to <lb/>
            the poems which you made, by putting into metre those Fables <lb/>
            of Æsop and the hymn to Apollo, several other persons asked <lb/>
            me, and especially Evenus recently, with what design you <lb/>
            made them after you came here, whereas before you had never <lb/>
            made any. 11. If, therefore, you care at all that I should be <lb/>
            able to answer Evenus, when he asks me again, for I am <lb/>
            sure he will do so, tell me what I must say to him."</p>
          <p>" Tell him the truth then, Cebes," he replied, " that I did <lb/>
            not make them from a wish to compete with him, or his poems, <lb/>
            for I knew that this would be no easy matter; but that I might <lb/>
            discover the meaning of certain dreams, and discharge my <lb/>
            conscience, if this should happen to be the music which they <lb/>
            have often ordered me to apply myself to. For they were to <lb/>
            the following purport: often in my past life the same dream <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            visited me, appearing at different times in different forms, yet <lb/>
            always saying the same thing. ‘ Socrates,' it said, ‘ apply your­ <lb/>
            self to and practise music.' 12. And I formerly supposed that <lb/>
            it exhorted and encouraged me to continue the pursuit I was <lb/>
            engaged in, as those who cheer on racers, so that the dream <lb/>
            encouraged me to continue the pursuit I was engaged in, <lb/>
            namely, to apply myself to music, since philosophy is the <lb/>
            highest music, and I was devoted to it. But now since my <lb/>
            trial took place, and the festival of the god retarded my death, <lb/>
            it appeared to me that, if by chance the dream so frequently <lb/>
            enjoined me to apply myself to popular music, I ought not to <lb/>
            disobey it but do so, for that it would be safer for me not to <lb/>
            depart hence before I had discharged my conscience by making <lb/>
            some poems in obedience to the dream. Thus, then, I first <lb/>
            of all composed a hymn to the god whose festival was pre­ <lb/>
            sent, and after the god, considering that a poet, if he means to <lb/>
            be a poet, ought to make fables and not discourses, and know­ <lb/>
            ing that I was not skilled in making fables, I therefore put <lb/>
            into verse those fables of Æsop, which were at hand, and were <lb/>
            known to me, and which first occurred to me.</p>
          <p>13. Tell this then to Evenus, Cebes, and bid him farewell, <lb/>
            and, if he is wise, to follow me as soon as he can. But I <lb/>
            depart, as it seems, to-day; for so the Athenians order."</p>
          <p>To this Simmias said ; " What is this, Socrates, which you <lb/>
            exhort Evenus to do ? for I often meet with him; and from <lb/>
            what I know of him, I am pretty certain that he will not at <lb/>
            all be willing to comply with your advice."</p>
          <p>" What then," said he. “ is not Evenus a philosopher ?”</p>
          <p>" To me he seems to be so," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>" Then he will be willing," rejoined Socrates, " and so will <lb/>
            every one who worthily engages in this study; perhaps in­ <lb/>
            deed he will not commit violence on himself, for that they say <lb/>
            is not allowable." And as he said this he let down his leg <lb/>
            from the bed on the ground, and in this posture continued <lb/>
            during the remainder of the discussion.</p>
          <p>Cebes then asked him, “ What do you mean, Socrates, by say­ <lb/>
            ing that it is not lawful to commit violence on one's-self, but that <lb/>
            a philosopher should be willing to follow one who is dying ?”</p>
          <p>14. “ What, Cebes, have not you and Simmias, who have <lb/>
            conversed familiarly with Philolaus b on this subject, heard ?" <note type="footnote">b A Pythagorean of Crotona. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            " Nothing very clearly, Socrates.”</p>
          <p>" I however speak only from hearsay; what then I have <lb/>
            heard I have no scruple in telling. And perhaps it is most <lb/>
            becoming for one who is about to travel there, to enquire <lb/>
            and speculate about the journey thither, what kind we think <lb/>
            it is. What else can one do in the interval before sun- <lb/>
            set ?"</p>
          <p>" Why then, Socrates, do they say that it is not allowable to <lb/>
            kill one's-self? for I, as you asked just now, have heard both <lb/>
            Philolaus, when he lived with us, and several others say that it <lb/>
            was. not right to do this; but I never heard any thing clear <lb/>
            upon the subject from any one."</p>
          <p>15. " Then you should consider it attentively," said Socrates, <lb/>
            “ for perhaps you may hear: probably however, it will appear <lb/>
            wonderful to you, if this alone of all other things is an uni­ <lb/>
            versal truth c, and it never happens to a man, as is the case in <lb/>
            all other things, that at sometimes and to some persons only it <lb/>
            is better to die than to live ; yet that these men for whom it is <lb/>
            better to die—this probably will appear wonderful to you—’ <lb/>
            may not without impiety do this good to themselves, but must <lb/>
            await another benefactor."</p>
          <p>16. Then Cebes, gently smiling, said, speaking in his own <lb/>
            dialect d, " Jove be witness."</p>
          <p>" And indeed," said Socrates, " it would appear to be un­ <lb/>
            reasonable, yet still perhaps it has some reason on its side. <lb/>
            The maxim indeed given on this subject in the mystical doc­ <lb/>
            trines e, that we men are in a kind of prison, and that we <lb/>
            ought not to free ourselves from it and escape, appears to me <lb/>
            difficult to be understood, and not easy to penetrate. This <lb/>
            however appears to me, Cebes, to be well said, that the gods <lb/>
            take care of us, and that we men are one of their possessions. <lb/>
            Does it not seem so to you ?"</p>
          <p>" It does," replied Cebes.</p>
          <p>" Therefore," said he, " if one of your slaves were to kill him­ <lb/>
            self, without your having intimated that you wished him to die, <lb/>
            should you not be angry with him, and should you not punish <lb/>
            him if you could ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied. <note type="footnote"> c Namely, that it is better to die than live." </note><note type="footnote"> d <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ιττω</foreign> Bceotian for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴστω</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> e Of Pythagoras. </note></p><pb n="60"/>
            
          <p>" Perhaps then in this point of view, it is not unreasonable <lb/>
            to assert, that a man ought not to kill himself before the deity <lb/>
            lays him under a necessity of doing so, such as that now laid <lb/>
            on me."</p>
          <p>17. "This, indeed," said Cebes, " appears to be probable. <lb/>
            But what you said just now, Socrates, that philosophers should <lb/>
            be very willing to die, appears to be an absurdity, if what we <lb/>
            said just now is agreeable to reason, that it is God who takes <lb/>
            care of us, and that we are his property. For that the wisest <lb/>
            men should not be grieved at leaving that service in which <lb/>
            they govern them who are the best of all masters, namely the <lb/>
            gods, is not consistent with reason. For surely he cannot <lb/>
            think that he will take better care of himself when he has be­ <lb/>
            come free: but a foolish man might perhaps think thus, that <lb/>
            he should fly from his master, and would not reflect that he <lb/>
            ought not to fly from a good one, but should cling to him as <lb/>
            much as possible, therefore he would fly against all reason: <lb/>
            but a man of sense would desire to be constantly with one <lb/>
            better than himself. Thus, Socrates, the contrary of what <lb/>
            you just now said is likely to be the case; for it becomes the <lb/>
            wise to be grieved at dying, but the foolish to rejoice."</p>
          <p>18. Socrates, on hearing this, appeared to me to be pleased <lb/>
            with the pertinacity of Cebes, and looking towards us, said, <lb/>
            " Cebes, you see, always searches out arguments, and is not at <lb/>
            all willing to admit at once any thing one has said."</p>
          <p>Whereupon Simmias replied; " But indeed, Socrates, Cebes <lb/>
            appears to me, now, to say something to the purpose: for <lb/>
            with what design should men really wise fly from masters who <lb/>
            are better than themselves, and so readily leave them ? And <lb/>
            Cebes appears to me to direct his argument against you, because <lb/>
            you so easily endure to abandon both us, and those good rulers, <lb/>
            as you yourself confess, the gods."</p>
          <p>"You speak justly," said Socrates, "for I think you mean <lb/>
            that I ought to make my defence to this charge, as if I were <lb/>
            in a court of justice."</p>
          <p>" Certainly," replied Simmias.</p>
          <p>19. " Come then," said he, " I will endeavour to defend <lb/>
            myself more successfully before you than before the judges. <lb/>
            For," he proceeded, “ Simmias and Cebes, if I did not think <lb/>
            that I should go first of all amongst other deities who are <lb/>
            both wise and good, and, next, amongst men who have de­ <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            parted this life, better than any here, I should be wrong in <lb/>
            not grieving at death: but now be assured, I hope to go <lb/>
            amongst good men, though I would not positively assert it; <lb/>
            that, however, I shall go amongst gods who are perfectly good <lb/>
            masters, be assured I can positively assert this, if I can any <lb/>
            thing of the kind. So that, on this account, I am not so <lb/>
            much troubled, but I entertain a good hope that something <lb/>
            awaits those who die, and that, as was said long since, it will <lb/>
            be far better for the good than the evil."</p>
          <p>20. " What then, Socrates," said Simmias, " would you go <lb/>
            away keeping this persuasion to yourself, or would you impart <lb/>
            it to us ? For this good appears to me to be also common to <lb/>
            us ; and at the same time it will be an apology for you, if you' <lb/>
            can persuade us to believe what you say."</p>
          <p>" I will endeavour to do so," he said. " But first let us <lb/>
            attend to Crito here, and see what it is he seems to have for <lb/>
            some time wished to say."</p>
          <p>" What else, Socrates," said Crito, "but what he who is to <lb/>
            give you the poison told me some time ago, that I should tell. <lb/>
            you to speak as little as possible ? For he says that men he­ <lb/>
            come too much heated by speaking, and that nothing of this <lb/>
            kind ought to interfere with the poison, and that otherwise, <lb/>
            those who did so were sometimes compelled to drink two or <lb/>
            three times."</p>
          <p>To which Socrates replied, " Let him alone, and let him <lb/>
            attend to his own business, and prepare to give it me twice, <lb/>
            or, if occasion requires, even thrice."</p>
          <p>21. "I was almost certain what you would say," answered <lb/>
            Crito, but he has been some time pestering me."</p>
          <p>" Never mind him," he rejoined.</p>
          <p>" But now I wish to render an account to you, my judges, of <lb/>
            the reason why a man who has really devoted his life to phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, when he is about to die, appears to me, on good <lb/>
            grounds, to have confidence, and to entertain a firm hope that <lb/>
            the greatest good will befal him in the other world, when he <lb/>
            has departed this life. How then this comes to pass, Simmias <lb/>
            and Cebes, I will endeavour to explain.</p>
          <p>“ For as many as rightly apply themselves to philosophy <lb/>
            seem to have left all others in ignorance, that they aim at <lb/>
            nothing else than to die and be dead. If this then is true, it <lb/>
            would surely be absurd to be anxious about nothing else than <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            this during their whole life, but, when it arrives, to be grieved <lb/>
            at what they have been long anxious about and aimed at."</p>
          <p>22. Upon this, Simmias, smiling, said, " By Jupiter, Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, though I am not now at all inclined to smile, you have <lb/>
            made me do so; for I think that the multitude, if they heard <lb/>
            this, would think it was very well said in reference to philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, and that our countrymen particularly would agree with <lb/>
            you, that true philosophers do desire death, and that they are <lb/>
            by no means ignorant that they deserve to suffer it."</p>
          <p>" And indeed, Simmias, they would speak the truth, except <lb/>
            in asserting that they are not ignorant; for they are ignorant <lb/>
            of the sense in which true philosophers desire to die, and in <lb/>
            what sense they deserve death, and what kind of death. But," <lb/>
            he said, " let us take leave of them, and speak to one another. <lb/>
            Do we think that death is any thing ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," replied Simmias.</p>
          <p>23. “ Is it any thing else than the separation of the soul from <lb/>
            the body ? and is not this to die, for the body to be apart by <lb/>
            itself separated from the soul, and for the soul to subsist apart <lb/>
            by itself separated from the body ? Is death any thing else <lb/>
            than this ?"</p>
          <p>" No, but this," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Consider then, my good friend, whether you are of the <lb/>
            same opinion as me; for thus I think we shall understand <lb/>
            better the subject we are considering. Does it appear to you <lb/>
            to be becoming in a philosopher to be anxious about pleasures, <lb/>
            as they are called, such as meats and drinks ?”</p>
          <p>" By no means, Socrates," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>" But what ? about the pleasures of love ?"</p>
          <p>" Not at all."</p>
          <p>24. “ What then ? does such a man appear to you to <lb/>
            think other bodily indulgences of value ? for instance, does he <lb/>
            seem to you to value or despise the possession of magnificent <lb/>
            garments and sandals, and other ornaments of the body, except <lb/>
            so far as necessity compels him to use them?"</p>
          <p>" The true philosopher," he answered, " appears to me to <lb/>
            despise them."</p>
          <p>" Does not then," he continued, " the whole employment of <lb/>
            such a man appear to you to be, not about the body, but to <lb/>
            separate himself from it as much as possible, and be occupied <lb/>
            about his soul ?" <pb n="63"/>
            </p>
          <p>" It does."</p>
          <p>“ First of all then, in such matters, does not the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, above all other men, evidently free his soul as much as <lb/>
            he call from communion with the body ?" <lb/>
            " It appears so."</p>
          <p>25. "And it appears, Simmias, to the generality of men, <lb/>
            that he who takes no pleasure in such things, and who does <lb/>
            not use them, does not deserve to live ; but that he nearly ap­ <lb/>
            proaches to death who cares nothing for the pleasures that <lb/>
            subsist through the body."</p>
          <p>" You speak very truly."</p>
          <p>" But what with respect to the acquisition of wisdom, is the <lb/>
            body an impediment or not, if any one takes it with him as a <lb/>
            partner in the search ? What I mean is this : Do sight and <lb/>
            hearing convey any truth to men, or are they such as the poets <lb/>
            constantly sing, who say that we neither bear nor see any thing <lb/>
            with accuracy ? If however these bodily senses are neither ac­ <lb/>
            curate nor clear, much less can the others be so: for they are <lb/>
            all far inferior to these. Do they not seem so to you ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>26. " When then," said he, " does the soul light on the <lb/>
            truth ? for, when it attempts to consider any thing in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with the body, it is plain that it is then led astray by it."</p>
          <p>“ You say truly."</p>
          <p>“ Must it not then be by reasoning, if at all, that any of <lb/>
            the things that really are become known to it ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" And surely the soul then reasons best when none of these <lb/>
            things disturb it, neither hearing, nor sight, nor pain, nor <lb/>
            pleasure of any kind, but it retires as much as possible within <lb/>
            itself, taking leave of the body, and, as far as it can, not com­ <lb/>
            municating or being in contact with it, it aims at the discovery <lb/>
            of that which is."</p>
          <p>" Such is the case."</p>
          <p>“ Does not then the soul of the philosopher, in these cases, <lb/>
            despise the body, and flee from it, and seek to retire within it­ <lb/>
            self ?”</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p>
          <p>" But what as to such things as these, Simmias? Do we <lb/>
            say that justice itself is something or nothing ?"</p>
          <p>"We say it is something, by Jupiter." <pb n="64"/>
            </p>
          <p>" And that beauty and goodness are something ?"•</p>
          <p>" How not ?"</p>
          <p>" Now then have you ever seen any thing of this kind with <lb/>
            your eyes ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Did you ever lay hold of them by any other bodily sense ? but <lb/>
            I speak generally, as of magnitude, health, strength, and, in a <lb/>
            word, of the essence of every thing, that is to say, what each is. <lb/>
            Is then the exact truth of these perceived by means of the body, <lb/>
            or is it thus, whoever amongst us habituates himself to reflect <lb/>
            most deeply and accurately on each several thing about which <lb/>
            he is considering, he will make the nearest approach to the <lb/>
            knowledge of it ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>28. " Would not he, then, do this with the utmost purity, <lb/>
            who should in the highest degree approach each subject by <lb/>
            means of the mere mental faculties, neither employing the sight <lb/>
            in conjunction with the reflective faculty, nor introducing any <lb/>
            other sense together with reasoning ; but who, using pure re­ <lb/>
            flection by itself, should attempt to search out each essence <lb/>
            purely by itself, freed as much as possible from the eyes and <lb/>
            ears, and, in a word, from the whole body, as disturbing <lb/>
            the soul, and not suffering it to acquire truth and wisdom, <lb/>
            when it is in communion with it. Is not he the person, Sim­ <lb/>
            mias, if any one can, who will arrive at the knowledge of <lb/>
            that which is ?"</p>
          <p>29. "You speak with wonderful truth, Socrates," replied <lb/>
            Simmias.</p>
          <p>"Wherefore," he said, " it necessarily follows from all this, that <lb/>
            some such opinion as this should be entertained by genuine philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, so that they should speak among themselves as follows :</p>
          <p>. A by-path, as it were, seems to lead us on in our researches <lb/>
            undertaken by reason,' because as long as we are encumbered with <lb/>
            the body, and our soul is contaminated with such an evil, we can <lb/>
            never fully attain to what we desire ; and this, we say, is truth. <lb/>
            For the body subjects us to innumerable hindrances on account <lb/>
            of its necessary support, and moreover if any diseases befal us, <lb/>
            they impede us in our search after that which is; and it fills <lb/>
            us with longings, desires, fears, all kinds of fancies, and a <lb/>
            multitude of absurdities, so that, as it is said in real truth, by <lb/>
            reason of the body it is never possible for us to make any ad­ <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            vances in wisdom. 30. " For nothing else but the body and its <lb/>
            desires occasion wars, seditions, and contests; for all wars <lb/>
            amongst us arise on account of our desire to acquire wealth; <lb/>
            and we are compelled to acquire wealth on account of the <lb/>
            body, being enslaved to its service; and consequently on all <lb/>
            these accounts we are hindered in the pursuit of philosophy. <lb/>
            But the worst of all is, that if it leaves us any leisure, and we <lb/>
            apply ourselves to the consideration of any subject, it constantly <lb/>
            obtrudes itself in the midst of our researches, and occasions <lb/>
            trouble and disturbance, and confounds us so that we are not <lb/>
            able by reason of it to discern the truth. It has then in reality <lb/>
            been demonstrated to us, that if we are ever to know any <lb/>
            thing purely, we must be separated from the body, and contem­ <lb/>
            plate the things themselves by the mere soul. And then, as <lb/>
            it seems, we shall obtain that which we desire, and which we <lb/>
            profess ourselves to be lovers of, wisdom, when we are dead, as <lb/>
            reason shews, but not while we are alive. 31. For if it <lb/>
            is not possible to know any thing purely in conjunction <lb/>
            with the body, one of these two things must follow, either <lb/>
            that we can never acquire knowledge, or only after we are <lb/>
            dead; for then the soul will subsist apart by itself, separate <lb/>
            from the body, but not before. And while we live, we shall <lb/>
            thus, as it seems, approach nearest to knowledge, if we hold <lb/>
            no intercourse or communion at all with the body, except <lb/>
            what absolute necessity requires, nor suffer ourselves to be pol­ <lb/>
            luted by its nature, but purify ourselves from it, until God <lb/>
            himself shall release us. And thus being pure, and freed from <lb/>
            the folly of body, we shall in all likelihood be with others like <lb/>
            ourselves, and shall of ourselves know the whole real essence, <lb/>
            and that probably is truth; for it is not allowable for the im­ <lb/>
            pure to attain to the pure. Such things, I think, Simmias, <lb/>
            all true lovers of wisdom must both think and say to one another. <lb/>
            Does it not seem so to you ?"</p>
          <p>" Most assuredly, Socrates."</p>
          <p>32. " If this then," said Socrates, "is true, my friend, there <lb/>
            is great hope for one who arrives where I am going, there, <lb/>
            if any where, to acquire that in perfection for the sake of which <lb/>
            we have taken so much pains during our past life; so that the <lb/>
            journey now appointed me is set out upon with good hope, and <lb/>
            will be so by any other man who thinks that his mind has been <lb/>
            as it were purified." <note type="footnote"> F </note></p><pb n="66"/>
            
          <p>" Certainly," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>" But does not purification consist in this, as was said in a <lb/>
            former part of our discourse, in separating as much as possible <lb/>
            the soul from the body, and in accustoming it to gather and <lb/>
            collect itself by itself on all sides apart from the body, and to <lb/>
            dwell, as far as it can, both now and hereafter, alone by itself, <lb/>
            delivered as it were from the shackles of the body ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>33. “ Is this then called death, this deliverance and separa­ <lb/>
            tion of the soul from the body ?" <lb/>
            " Assuredly," he answered.</p>
          <p>But, as we affirmed, those who pursue philosophy rightly, <lb/>
            are especially and alone desirous to deliver it, and this is the <lb/>
            very study of philosophers, the deliverance and separation of <lb/>
            the soul from the body, is it not ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p>
          <p>"Then, as I said at first, would it not be ridiculous for a <lb/>
            man who has endeavoured throughout his life to live as near <lb/>
            as possible to death, then, when death arrives, to grieve ? <lb/>
            would not this be ridiculous ?"</p>
          <p>" How should it not ?"</p>
          <p>"In reality then, Simmias," he continued, "those who <lb/>
            pursue philosophy rightly study to die; and to them of all <lb/>
            men death is least formidable. Judge from this. Since they <lb/>
            altogether hate the body and desire to keep the soul by it­ <lb/>
            self, would it not be irrational if, when this comes to pass, <lb/>
            they should be afraid and grieve, and not be glad to go to <lb/>
            that place, where on their arrival they may hope to obtain <lb/>
            that which they longed for throughout life; but they longed <lb/>
            for wisdom ; and to be freed from association with that which <lb/>
            they hated ? 34. Have many of their own accord wished to <lb/>
            descend into Hades, on account of human objects of affection, <lb/>
            their wives and sons, induced by this very hope of there seeing <lb/>
            and being with those whom they have loved; and shall one <lb/>
            who really loves wisdom, and firmly cherishes this very hope, <lb/>
            that he shall no where else attain it in a manner worthy of <lb/>
            the name, except in Hades, be grieved at dying, and not <lb/>
            gladly go there? We must think that he would gladly go, <lb/>
            my friend, if he be in truth a philosopher; for he will be <lb/>
            firmly persuaded of this, that he will no where else but there <lb/>
            attain wisdom in its purity; and if this be so, would it not be <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            very irrational, as I just now said, if such a man were to be <lb/>
            afraid of death ?"</p>
          <p>“ Very much so, by Jupiter," he replied.</p>
          <p>35. "Would not this then," he resumed, "be a sufficient <lb/>
            proof to you, with respect to a man whom you should see <lb/>
            grieved when about to die, that he was not a lover of wisdom <lb/>
            but a lover of his body ? and this same person is probably a <lb/>
            lover of riches and a lover of honour, one or both of these."</p>
          <p>" It certainly is as you say," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ Does not then," he said, " that which is called fortitude, <lb/>
            Simmias, eminently belong to philosophers ?"</p>
          <p>“ By all means," he answered.</p>
          <p>“ And temperance also, which even the multitude call <lb/>
            temperance, and which consists in not being carried away <lb/>
            by the passions, but in holding them in contempt, and keep­ <lb/>
            ing them in subjection, does not this belong to those only <lb/>
            who most despise the body, and live in the study of <lb/>
            philosophy ?"</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so," he replied.</p>
          <p>36. “For,” he continued, "if you will consider the forti­ <lb/>
            tude and temperance of others, they will appear to you to be <lb/>
            absurd."</p>
          <p>" How so, Socrates ?"</p>
          <p>" Do you know," he said, " that all others consider death <lb/>
            among the great evils ?"</p>
          <p>" They do indeed," he answered.</p>
          <p>"Then do the brave amongst them endure death, when they <lb/>
            do endure it, through dread of greater evils ?"</p>
          <p>" It is so."</p>
          <p>" All men, therefore, except philosophers, are brave through <lb/>
            being afraid and fear; though it is absurd that any one should <lb/>
            be brave through fear and cowardice."</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" But what, are not those amongst them who keep their <lb/>
            passions in subjection, affected in the same way ? and are they <lb/>
            not temperate through a kind of intemperance ? and although <lb/>
            we may say, perhaps, that this is. impossible, nevertheless <lb/>
            the manner in which they are affected with respect to this <lb/>
            silly temperance resembles this; for, fearing to be deprived <lb/>
            of other pleasures, and desiring them, they abstain from some, <lb/>
            being mastered by others. And though they call intemperance <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            the being governed by pleasures, yet it happens to them that, <lb/>
            by being mastered by some pleasures, they master others; <lb/>
            and this is similar to what was just now said, that in a certain <lb/>
            manner they become temperate through intemperance."</p>
          <p>" So it seems."</p>
          <p>37. " My dear Simmias, consider that this is not a right <lb/>
            exchange for virtue, to barter pleasures for pleasures, pains <lb/>
            for pains, fear for fear, and the greater for the lesser, like <lb/>
            pieces of money; but that that alone is the right coin, for <lb/>
            which we ought to barter all these things, wisdom; and for <lb/>
            this, and with this every thing is in reality bought and sold, <lb/>
            fortitude, temperance, and justice, and, in a word, true virtue <lb/>
            subsists with wisdom, whether pleasures and fears, and every <lb/>
            thing else of the kind, are present or absent; but when sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from wisdom, and changed one for another, consider <lb/>
            whether such virtue is not a mere outline, and in reality <lb/>
            servile, possessing neither soundness nor truth ; but the really <lb/>
            true virtue is a purification from all such things, and tempe­ <lb/>
            rance, justice, fortitude, and wisdom itself, are a kind of initi­ <lb/>
            atory purification. 38. And those who instituted the mysteries <lb/>
            for us appear to have been by no means contemptible, but in <lb/>
            reality to have intimated long since that whoever shall arrive <lb/>
            in Hades unexpiated and uninitiated shall lie in mud, hut he <lb/>
            that arrives there purified and initiated, shall dwell with the <lb/>
            gods. ' For there are,' say those who preside at the mysteries, <lb/>
            ‘ many wand-bearers, but few inspired.' These last, in my <lb/>
            opinion, are no other than those who have pursued philo­ <lb/>
            sophy rightly : that I might be of their number, I have, to <lb/>
            the utmost of my ability, left no means untried, but have <lb/>
            endeavoured to the utmost of my power. But whether I have <lb/>
            endeavoured rightly and have in any respect succeeded, on <lb/>
            arriving there I shall know clearly, if it please God, very <lb/>
            shortly, as it appears to me.</p>
          <p>39. Such then, Simmias and Cebes," he added, .. is the <lb/>
            defence I make, for that I, on good grounds, do not repine or <lb/>
            grieve at leaving you and my masters here, being persuaded that <lb/>
            there, no less than here, I shall meet with good masters and <lb/>
            friends. But to the multitude this is incredible. If however <lb/>
            I have succeeded better with you in my defence than I did <lb/>
            with the Athenian judges, it is well."</p>
          <p>When Socrates had thus spoken, Cebes, taking up the dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            cussion said, " Socrates, all the rest appears to me to be said <lb/>
            rightly, but what , you have said respecting the soul will <lb/>
            occasion much incredulity in many from the apprehension that, <lb/>
            when it is separated from the body, it no longer exists any <lb/>
            where, but is destroyed and perishes on the very day in <lb/>
            which a man dies, and that immediately it is separated and <lb/>
            goes out from the body, it is dispersed and vanishes like <lb/>
            breath or smoke, and is no longer any where; since, if it <lb/>
            remained any where united in itself, and freed from those <lb/>
            evils which you have just now enumerated, there would be <lb/>
            an abundant and good hope, Socrates, that what you say is <lb/>
            true. 40. But this probably needs no little persuasion and <lb/>
            proof, that the soul of a man who dies, exists, and possesses <lb/>
            activity and intelligence." \</p>
          <p>" You say truly, Cebes," said Socrates, " but what shall <lb/>
            we do ? Are you willing that we should converse on these <lb/>
            points, whether such is probably the case or not ?"</p>
          <p>" Indeed," replied Cebes, " I should gladly hear your <lb/>
            opinion on these matters."</p>
          <p>"I do not think," said Socrates, " that any one who should <lb/>
            now hear us, even though he were a comic poet, would say <lb/>
            that I am talking idly, or discoursing on subjects that do not <lb/>
            concern me. If you please, then, we will examine into it. Let <lb/>
            us consider it in this point of view, whether the souls of men <lb/>
            who are dead exist in Hades, or not. This is an ancient say­ <lb/>
            ing, which we now call to mind, that souls departing hence <lb/>
            exist there, and return hither again, and are produced from the <lb/>
            dead. 41. And if this is so, that the living are produced again <lb/>
            from the dead, can there be any other consequence than <lb/>
            that our souls- are there ? for surely they could not be pro­ <lb/>
            duced again if they did not exist; and this would be a sum­ <lb/>
            dent proof that these things. are so, if it should in reality be <lb/>
            evident that the living are produced from no other source than <lb/>
            the dead. But, if this is not the case, there will be need of <lb/>
            other arguments."</p>
          <p>“Certainly,” said Cebes.</p>
          <p>" You must not, then," he continued, " consider this only <lb/>
            with respect to men, if you wish to ascertain it with greater <lb/>
            certainty, but also with respect to all animals and plants, and, <lb/>
            in a word, with respect to every thing that is subject to gene­ <lb/>
            ration, let us see whether they are not all so produced, no <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            otherwise than 'contraries from contraries, wherever they have <lb/>
            any such quality, as for instance the honourable is contrary to <lb/>
            the base, and the just to the unjust, and so with ten thousand <lb/>
            other things. 42. Let us consider this, then, whether it is <lb/>
            necessary that all things which have a contrary should be <lb/>
            produced from nothing else than their contrary. As for <lb/>
            instance, -when any thing becomes greater is it not necessary <lb/>
            • that, from being previously smaller, it afterwards became <lb/>
            greater ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>.. And if it becomes smaller, will it not, from being prc­ <lb/>
            viously greater, afterwards become smaller ?”</p>
          <p>" It is so," he replied.</p>
          <p>"And from stronger, weaker ? and from slower, swifter ?"</p>
          <p>"Certainly.""</p>
          <p>" What then ? if any thing becomes worse, must it not be­ <lb/>
            come so from better ? and if more just, from more unjust ?”</p>
          <p>" How should it not ?"</p>
          <p>" We have then," he said, " sufficiently determined this, <lb/>
            that all things are thus produced, contraries from contraries ?”</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>“What next? is there also something of this kind in them, <lb/>
            for instance, between all two contraries a mutual twofold pro­ <lb/>
            duction, from one to the other, and from that other back again ? <lb/>
            for between a greater thing and a smaller there is increase and <lb/>
            decrease, and do we not accordingly call the one to increase, <lb/>
            the other to decrease ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes," he replied.</p>
          <p>43. " And must not to be separated and commingled, to grow <lb/>
            cold and to grow warm, and every thing in the same manner, <lb/>
            even though sometimes we have not names to designate them, <lb/>
            yet in fact be every where thus circumstanced of necessity, as <lb/>
            to be produced from each other, and be subject to a reciprocal <lb/>
            generation ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>"What then?" said Socrates, has life any contrary, as <lb/>
            waking has its contrary, sleeping ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he answered.</p>
          <p>"What?"</p>
          <p>" Death," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Are not these, then, produced from each other, since they <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            are contraries, and are not the modes by which they are pro­ <lb/>
            duced twofold, intervening between these two ?"</p>
          <p>" How should it be otherwise ?"</p>
          <p>" I then," continued Socrates, "will describe to you one <lb/>
            pair of the contraries which I have just now mentioned, both <lb/>
            what it is and its mode of production ; and do you describe to <lb/>
            me the other. I say that one is to sleep, the other to awake; <lb/>
            and from sleeping awaking is produced, and from awaking <lb/>
            sleeping, and that the modes of their production are the one <lb/>
            to fall asleep, the other to be roused. 44. Have I sufficiently <lb/>
            explained this to you or not ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Do you then," he said, " describe to me, in the same <lb/>
            manner, with respect to life and death ? Do you not say that <lb/>
            life is contrary to death?"</p>
          <p>"I do."</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" And that they are produced from each other ?"</p>
          <p>" What then, is produced from life ?"</p>
          <p>"Death," he replied.</p>
          <p>" What, then," said he, " is produced from death ?'</p>
          <p>" I must needs confess," he replied, " that life is."</p>
          <p>" From the dead, then, 0 Cebes, living things and living <lb/>
            men, are produced."</p>
          <p>" It appears so," he said.</p>
          <p>"Our souls, therefore," said Socrates, " exist in Hades."</p>
          <p>" So it seems."</p>
          <p>" With respect, then, to their mode of production, is not <lb/>
            one of them very clear ? for to die surely is clear ? is it not ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>"What then shall we do?" he continued; "shall we not <lb/>
            find a corresponding contrary mode of production, or will na­ <lb/>
            ture be defective in this ? Or must we discover a contrary <lb/>
            mode of production to dying ?"</p>
          <p>" By all means," he said.</p>
          <p>" What is this?"</p>
          <p>“ To revive."</p>
          <p>"Therefore," he proceeded, "if there is such a thing as to <lb/>
            revive, will not this reviving be a mode of production from the <lb/>
            dead to the living ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p><pb n="72"/>
            
          <p>" Thus, then, we have agreed, that the living are produced <lb/>
            from the dead, no less than the dead from the living: but, this <lb/>
            being the case, there appears to me sufficient proof that the <lb/>
            souls of the dead must necessarily exist somewhere, from <lb/>
            whence they are again produced."</p>
          <p>45. " It appears to me, Socrates," he said, " that this must <lb/>
            necessarily follow from what has been admitted."</p>
          <p>"See now, 0 Cebes," he said, " that we have not agreed <lb/>
            on these things improperly, as it appears to me: for if one <lb/>
            class of things were not constantly given back in the place of <lb/>
            another, revolving as it were in a circle, but generation were <lb/>
            direct from one thing alone into its opposite, and did not turn <lb/>
            round again to the other, or retrace its course, do you know <lb/>
            that all things would at length have the same form, be in the <lb/>
            same state, and cease to be produced ?"</p>
          <p>" How say you ?" he asked.</p>
          <p>"It is by no means difficult," he replied, " to understand <lb/>
            what I mean; if, for instance, there should be such a thing as <lb/>
            falling asleep, but no reciprocal waking again produced from a <lb/>
            state of sleep, you know that at length all things would shew <lb/>
            the fable of Endymion to be a jest, and it would be thought <lb/>
            nothing at all of, because every thing else would be in the same <lb/>
            state as him, namely, asleep. And if all things were mingled <lb/>
            together, but never separated, that doctrine of Anaxagoras <lb/>
            would soon be verified, . all things would be together.' 46. <lb/>
            Likewise, my dear Cebes, if all things that partake of life <lb/>
            should die, and after they are dead should remain in this <lb/>
            state of death, and not revive again, would it not necessarily <lb/>
            follow that at length all things should be dead, and nothing <lb/>
            alive ? for if living beings are produced from other things, and <lb/>
            living beings die, what could prevent their being all ab­ <lb/>
            sorbed in death ?"</p>
          <p>"Nothing whatever, I think, Socrates," replied Cebes, "but <lb/>
            you appear to me to speak the exact truth."</p>
          <p>"For, Cebes," he continued, "as it seems to me, such un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly is the case, and we have not admitted these things <lb/>
            under a delusion, but it is in reality true that there is a reviv­ <lb/>
            ing again, that the living are produced from the dead, that the <lb/>
            souls of the dead exist, and that the condition of the good is <lb/>
            better, and of the evil, worse."</p>
          <p>47. "And indeed," said Cebes, interrupting him, " according <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            to that doctrine, Socrates, which you are frequently in the habit <lb/>
            of advancing, if it is true, that our learning is nothing else than <lb/>
            reminiscence, according to this it is surely necessary that we <lb/>
            must at some former time have learned what we now remem­ <lb/>
            ber. But this is impossible, unless our soul existed somewhere <lb/>
            before it came into this human form ; so that from hence also <lb/>
            the soul appears to be something immortal."</p>
          <p>" But, Cebes," said Simmias, interrupting him, " what proofs <lb/>
            are there of these things ? remind me of them, for I do not <lb/>
            very well remember them at present."</p>
          <p>48. " It is proved," said Cebes, "by one argument, and that <lb/>
            a most beautiful one, that men, when questioned, if one ques­ <lb/>
            tions them properly, of themselves describe all things as they <lb/>
            are: however, if they had not innate knowledge and right <lb/>
            reason, they would never be able to do this. Moreover, if one <lb/>
            leads them to diagrams, or any thing else of the kind, it is <lb/>
            then most clearly apparent that this is the case."</p>
          <p>" But if you are not persuaded in this way, Simmias," said <lb/>
            Socrates, " see if you will agree with us on considering the mat­ <lb/>
            ter thus. For do you doubt how that which is called learning <lb/>
            is reminiscence ?"</p>
          <p>" I do not doubt," said Simmias, " but I require this very <lb/>
            thing of which we are speaking, to be reminded; and indeed, <lb/>
            from what Cebes has begun to say, I almost now remember, <lb/>
            and am persuaded; nevertheless, however, I should like to <lb/>
            hear now how you would attempt to prove it."</p>
          <p>" I do it thus," he replied: " we admit surely that if any <lb/>
            one be reminded of any thing, he must needs have known that <lb/>
            thing at some time or other before."</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he said.</p>
          <p>49. " Do we then admit this also, that when knowledge comes <lb/>
            in a certain manner it is reminiscence ? But the manner I <lb/>
            mean is this; if any one, upon seeing or hearing, or perceiv­ <lb/>
            ing through the medium of any other sense, some particular <lb/>
            thing, should not only know that, but also form an idea of <lb/>
            something else, of which the knowledge is not the same, but <lb/>
            different, should we not justly say, that he remembered that <lb/>
            of which he received the idea ?"</p>
          <p>" How mean you ?"</p>
          <p>" For instance; the knowledge of a man is different from <lb/>
            that of a lyre." <pb n="74"/>
            </p>
          <p>" How not ?"</p>
          <p>" Do you not know, then, that lovers when they see a lyre, <lb/>
            or a garment, or any thing else which their favourite is accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to use, are thus affected; they both recognise the lyre, <lb/>
            and receive in their minds the form of the person to whom the <lb/>
            lyre belonged ? This is reminiscence : just as any one, seeing <lb/>
            Simmias, is often reminded of Cebes, and so in an infinite num­ <lb/>
            ber of similar instances."</p>
          <p>" An infinite number indeed, by Jupiter," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>“ Is not then," he said, " something of this sort a kind of <lb/>
            reminiscence ? especially when one is thus affected with re­ <lb/>
            spect to things which, from lapse of time, and not thinking of <lb/>
            them, one has now forgotten ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>50. " But what ?" he continued, " does it happen, that when <lb/>
            one sees a painted horse or a painted lyre, one is reminded of a <lb/>
            man, and that when one sees a picture of Simmias one is re­ <lb/>
            minded of Cebes!"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" And does it not also happen, that on seeing a picture of <lb/>
            Simmias one is reminded of Simmias himself ?"</p>
          <p>" It does indeed," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Does it not happen, then, according to all this, that remi­ <lb/>
            niscence arises partly from things like, and partly from things <lb/>
            unlike ?"</p>
          <p>" It does."</p>
          <p>" But when one is reminded by things like, is it not neces­ <lb/>
            sary that one should be thus further affected, so as to perceive <lb/>
            whether, as regards likeness, this falls short or not of the thing <lb/>
            of which one has been reminded ?"</p>
          <p>" It is necessary," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Consider, then," said Socrates, ., if the case is thus. Do we <lb/>
            allow that there is such a thing as equality ? I do not mean of <lb/>
            one log with another, nor one stone with another, nor any thing <lb/>
            else of this kind, but something altogether different from all <lb/>
            these, abstract equality; do we allow that there is any such <lb/>
            thing or not ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, we most assuredly do allow it," replied Sim­ <lb/>
            mias.</p>
          <p>51. " And do we know what it is itself?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p><pb n="75"/>
            
          <p>" Whence have we derived the knowledge of it ? Is it not <lb/>
            from the things we have just now mentioned, and that from <lb/>
            seeing logs, or stones, or other things of the kind, equal, we <lb/>
            have from these formed an idea of that which is different from <lb/>
            these ? for does it not appear to you to be different ? Con­ <lb/>
            sider the matter thus. Do not stones that are equal, and <lb/>
            logs sometimes that are the same, appear at one time equal, <lb/>
            and at another not ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" But what ? does abstract equality ever appear to you un­ <lb/>
            equal ? or equality inequality ?"</p>
          <p>" Never, Socrates, at any time."</p>
          <p>“ These equal things, then," he said, “ and abstract equality, <lb/>
            are not the same ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means, Socrates, as it appears."</p>
          <p>" However, from these equal things," he said, " which are <lb/>
            different from that abstract equality, have you not formed your <lb/>
            idea and derived your knowledge of it ?"</p>
          <p>" You speak most truly," he replied.</p>
          <p>If Is it not, therefore, from its being like or unlike them ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>"But it makes no difference," he said. "When, therefore, <lb/>
            on seeing one thing, you form, from the sight of it, the notion <lb/>
            of another, whether like or unlike, this," he said, " must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily be reminiscence."</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>52. " What, then, as to this?" he continued; "are we af­ <lb/>
            fected in any such way with regard to logs and the equal things <lb/>
            we have just now spoken of? and do they appear to us to be <lb/>
            equal in the same manner as abstract equality itself is, or do <lb/>
            they fall short in some degree, or not at all, of being such as <lb/>
            equality itself is ?"</p>
          <p>" They fall far short," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Do we admit, then, that when one, on beholding some par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing, perceives that it aims, as that which I now see, <lb/>
            at being like something else that exists, but falls short of it, <lb/>
            and cannot become such as that is, but is inferior to it, do we <lb/>
            admit that he who perceives this must necessarily have had a <lb/>
            previous knowledge of that which he says it resembles, though <lb/>
            imperfectly ?"</p>
          <p>" It is necessary."</p><pb n="76"/>
            
          <p>" What then ? are we affected in some such way, or not, with <lb/>
            respect to things equal and abstract equality itself?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly."</p>
          <p>" It is necessary, therefore, that we must have known ab­ <lb/>
            stract equality before the time when on first seeing equal things, <lb/>
            we perceived that they all aimed at resembling equality, but <lb/>
            failed in doing so."</p>
          <p>" Such is the case."</p>
          <p>53. " Moreover, we admit this too, that we perceived this, and <lb/>
            could not possibly perceive it by any other means than the <lb/>
            sight, or touch, or some other of the senses : for I say the same <lb/>
            of them all."</p>
          <p>" For they are the same, Socrates, so far as our argument is <lb/>
            concerned."</p>
          <p>" However, we must perceive by means of the senses, that <lb/>
            all things which come under the senses aim at that abstract <lb/>
            equality, and yet fall short of it: or how shall we say it is ?”</p>
          <p>" Even so."</p>
          <p>" Before, then, we began to see, and hear, and use our other <lb/>
            senses, we must have had a knowledge of equality itself, what <lb/>
            it is, if we were to refer to it those equal things that come <lb/>
            under the senses, and observe that all such things aim at re­ <lb/>
            sembling that, but fall far short of it."</p>
          <p>" This necessarily follows, Socrates, from what has been <lb/>
            already said."</p>
          <p>" But did we not, as soon as we were born, see and hear, and <lb/>
            possess our other senses ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" But, we have said, before we possessed these, we must <lb/>
            have had a knowledge of abstract equality ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" We must have had it, then, as it seems, before we were <lb/>
            born."</p>
          <p>" It seems so."</p>
          <p>54. " If, therefore, having this before we were born, we were <lb/>
            born possessing it, we knew both before we were born, and as <lb/>
            soon as we were born, not only the equal and the greater and <lb/>
            smaller, but all things of the kind; for our present discussion <lb/>
            is not more respecting equality than the beautiful itself, the <lb/>
            good, the just, and the holy, and in one word, respecting <lb/>
            every thing which we mark with the seal of existence, both in <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            the questions we ask, and the answers we give. So that we <lb/>
            must necessarily have had a knowledge of all these before we <lb/>
            were born."</p>
          <p>" Such is the case."</p>
          <p>" And if, having once had it, we did not constantly forget it, <lb/>
            we should always be born with this knowledge, and should <lb/>
            always retain it through life: for to know is this, when one <lb/>
            has got a knowledge of any thing, to retain and not lose it; <lb/>
            for do we not call this oblivion, Simmias, the loss of know­ <lb/>
            ledge ?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>55. " But if, having had it before we were born, we lose it at <lb/>
            our birth, and afterwards, through exercising the senses about <lb/>
            these things, we recover the knowledge which we once before <lb/>
            possessed, would not that which we call learning be a recovery <lb/>
            of our own knowledge ? and in saying that this is to remember <lb/>
            should we not say rightly ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" For this appeared to be possible, for one having perceived <lb/>
            any thing, either by seeing or hearing, or employing any other <lb/>
            sense, to form an idea of something different from this, which <lb/>
            he had forgotten, and with which this was connected by being <lb/>
            unlike or like. So that, as I said, one of these two things <lb/>
            must follow, either we are all born with this knowledge, and <lb/>
            we retain it through life, or those whom we say learn after­ <lb/>
            wards do nothing else but remember, and this learning will be <lb/>
            reminiscence."</p>
          <p>" Such certainly is the case, Socrates."</p>
          <p>56. " Which, then, do you choose, Simmias: that we are <lb/>
            born with knowledge, or that we afterwards remember what <lb/>
            we had formerly known ?"</p>
          <p>" At present, Socrates, I am unable to choose ? ”</p>
          <p>" But what ? are you able to choose in this case, and what <lb/>
            do you think about it ? Can a man, who possesses knowledge, <lb/>
            give a reason for the things that he knows, or not?"</p>
          <p>" He needs must be able to do so, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" And do all men appear to you, to be able to give a reason <lb/>
            for the things of which we have just now been speaking?"</p>
          <p>"I wish they could," said Simmias; "but I am much more <lb/>
            afraid, that at this time to-morrow, there will no longer be any <lb/>
            one able to do this properly."</p><pb n="78"/>
            
          <p>"Do not all men then, Simmias,'' he said, " seem to you to <lb/>
            know these things ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means."</p>
          <p>" Do they remember, then, what they once learned ?”</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so."</p>
          <p>" When did our souls receive this knowledge ? not surely, <lb/>
            since we were born into the world."</p>
          <p>" Assuredly not."</p>
          <p>" Before then."</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Our souls therefore, Simmias, existed before they were in <lb/>
            a human form, separate from bodies, and possessed intelli­ <lb/>
            gence."</p>
          <p>57. " Unless, Socrates, we receive this knowledge at our <lb/>
            birth, for this period yet remains."</p>
          <p>" Be it so, my friend. But at what other time do we lose <lb/>
            it ? for we are not born with it, as we have just now admitted. <lb/>
            Do we lose it then at the very time in which we receive it ? <lb/>
            Or can you mention any other time ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means, Socrates : I was not aware that I was say­ <lb/>
            ing nothing to the purpose."</p>
          <p>" Does the case then stand thus with us, Simmias," he pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded. " If those things which we are continually talking <lb/>
            about really exist, the beautiful, the good, and every such <lb/>
            essence, and to this we refer all things that come under the <lb/>
            senses, as finding it to have a prior existence, and to be our <lb/>
            own, and if we compare these things to it, it necessarily follows, <lb/>
            that as these exist, so likewise our soul exists even before we <lb/>
            are born; but if these do not exist this discussion will have <lb/>
            been undertaken in vain. Is it not so ? and is there not an <lb/>
            equal necessity, both that these things should exist, and our <lb/>
            souls also before we are born, and if not the former neither the <lb/>
            latter ?"</p>
          <p>58. " Most assuredly, Socrates," said Simmias, "there appears <lb/>
            to me to be the same necessity, and the argument admirably <lb/>
            tends to prove that our souls exist before we are born, just as <lb/>
            that essence does which you have now mentioned. For I hold <lb/>
            nothing so clear to me as this, that all such things most cer­ <lb/>
            tainly exist, as the beautiful, the good, and all the rest that you <lb/>
            just now spoke of; and as far as I am concerned the case is <lb/>
            sufficiently demonstrated." <pb n="79"/>
            </p>
          <p>" But how does it appear to Cebes," said Socrates ; “ for it <lb/>
            is necessary to persuade Cebes too."</p>
          <p>" He is sufficiently persuaded, I think," said Simmias, " al­ <lb/>
            though he is the most pertinacious of men in distrusting argu­ <lb/>
            ments. Yet I think he is sufficiently persuaded of this, that <lb/>
            our soul existed before we were born. But whether when we <lb/>
            are dead, it will still exist, does not appear to me to have been <lb/>
            demonstrated, Socrates," he continued, " but that popular <lb/>
            doubt, which Cebes just now mentioned, still stands in our <lb/>
            way, whether, when a man dies, the soul is not dispersed, and <lb/>
            this is the end of its existence. 59. For what hinders its <lb/>
            being born, and formed from some other source, and existing <lb/>
            before it came into a human body, and yet when it has come, <lb/>
            and is separated from this body, its then also dying itself, and <lb/>
            being destroyed?"</p>
          <p>" You say well, Simmias," said Cebes ; " for it appears that <lb/>
            only one half of what is necessary has been demonstrated, <lb/>
            namely, that our soul existed before we were born: but it is <lb/>
            necessary to demonstrate further, that when we are dead, it <lb/>
            will exist no less than before we were born, if the demonstration <lb/>
            is to be made complete."</p>
          <p>" This has been even now demonstrated, Simmias and Cebes," <lb/>
            said Socrates, " if you will only connect this last argument <lb/>
            with that which we before assented to, that every thing living <lb/>
            is produced from that which is dead. For if the soul exists be­ <lb/>
            fore, and it is necessary for it when it enters into life, and is <lb/>
            born, to be produced from nothing else than death, and from <lb/>
            being dead, how is it not necessary for it also to exist after death, <lb/>
            since it must needs be produced again ? 60. What you re­ <lb/>
            quire then, has been already demonstrated. However, both <lb/>
            you and Simmias appear to me as if you wished to sift this <lb/>
            argument more thoroughly, and to be afraid like children, lest <lb/>
            on the soul's departure from the body the winds should blow it <lb/>
            away and disperse it, especially if one should happen to die not <lb/>
            in a calm, but in a violent storm."</p>
          <p>Upon this Cebes smiling said, " Endeavour to teach us bet­ <lb/>
            ter, Socrates, as if we were afraid, or rather not as if we were <lb/>
            afraid, though perhaps there is some boy f within us, who has <lb/>
            such a dread. Let us then endeavour to persuade him not to <lb/>
            be afraid of death, as of hobgoblins." <note type="footnote"> f Some boyish spirit. </note></p><pb n="80"/>
            
          <p>" But you must charm him every day," said Socrates, " until <lb/>
            you have quieted his fears."</p>
          <p>" But whence, Socrates," he said, " can we procure a skilful <lb/>
            charmer for such a case, now that you are about to leave us ?"</p>
          <p>61. " Greece is wide, Cebes," he replied, " and in it surely <lb/>
            there are skilful men, there are also many barbarous nations, <lb/>
            all of which you should search through, seeking such a charmer, <lb/>
            sparing neither money nor toil, as there is nothing on which <lb/>
            you can more seasonably spend your money. You should also <lb/>
            seek for him among yourselves; for perhaps you could not <lb/>
            easily find any more competent than yourselves to do this."</p>
          <p>" This shall be done," said Cebes, " but, if it is agreeable to <lb/>
            you, let us return to the point from whence we digressed."</p>
          <p>" It will be agreeable to me, for how should it not ?"</p>
          <p>" You say well," rejoined Cebes.</p>
          <p>"We ought then," said Socrates, "to ask ourselves some <lb/>
            such question as this, to what kind of thing it appertains to be <lb/>
            thus affected, namely to be dispersed, and for what we ought to <lb/>
            fear, lest it should be so affected, and for what not. And <lb/>
            after this, we should consider which of the two the soul is ; and <lb/>
            in the result should either be confident or fearful for our soul."</p>
          <p>" You speak truly," said he.</p>
          <p>62. " Does it not, then, appertain to that which is formed by <lb/>
            composition, and is naturally compounded, to be thus affected, <lb/>
            to be dissolved in the same manner as that in which it was <lb/>
            compounded; and if there is any thing not compounded, does <lb/>
            it not appertain to this alone, if to any thing, not to be thus <lb/>
            affected ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears to me to be so," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>" Is it not most probable then that things which are always <lb/>
            the same, and in the same state, are uncompounded, but that <lb/>
            things which are constantly changing, and are never in the <lb/>
            same state, are compounded ?”</p>
          <p>“ To me it appears so."</p>
          <p>" Let us return then," he said, “ to the subjects on which we <lb/>
            before discoursed. Whether is essence itself, of which we gave <lb/>
            this account that it exists, both in our questions and answers, <lb/>
            always the same, or does it sometimes change ? Does equality <lb/>
            itself, the beautiful itself, and each several thing which is, ever <lb/>
            undergo any change, however small ? Or does each of them <lb/>
            which exists, being an unmixed essence by itself, continue <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            always the same, and in the same state, and never undergo <lb/>
            any variation at all under any circumstances</p>
          <p>" They must of necessity continue the same and in the same <lb/>
            state, Socrates," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>63. " But what shall we say of the many beautiful things, <lb/>
            such as men, horses, garments, or other things of the kind, <lb/>
            whether equal, or beautiful, or of all things synonymous with <lb/>
            them ? Do they continue the same, or, quite contrary to the <lb/>
            former, are they never at any time, so to say, the same, either <lb/>
            with respect to themselves or one another?"</p>
          <p>" These on the other hand," replied Cebes, "never continue <lb/>
            the same."</p>
          <p>" These then you can touch, or see, or perceive by the other <lb/>
            senses; but those that continue the same, you cannot appre­ <lb/>
            hend in any other way than by the exercise of thought; for <lb/>
            such things are invisible, and are not seen ?"</p>
          <p>" You say what is strictly true," replied Cebes.</p>
          <p>64. " We may assume then, if you please," he continued, <lb/>
            “ that there are two species of things, the one visible, the other <lb/>
            invisible ?"</p>
          <p>"We may," he said.</p>
          <p>" And the invisible always continuing the same, but the visi­ <lb/>
            ble never the same ?"</p>
          <p>" This too," he said, " we may assume."</p>
          <p>" Come then," he asked, " is there any thing else belonging <lb/>
            to us, than on the one hand body, and on the other soul ?"</p>
          <p>" Nothing else," he replied.</p>
          <p>" To which species, then, shall we say the body is more <lb/>
            like, and more nearly allied ?"</p>
          <p>"It is clear to every one," he said, "that it is to the <lb/>
            visible."</p>
          <p>" But what of the soul ? Is it visible or invisible ?"</p>
          <p>" It is not visible to men, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But we speak of things which are visible or not so to the <lb/>
            nature of men : or to some other nature, think you ?"</p>
          <p>" To that of men."</p>
          <p>" What then shall we say of the soul, that it is visible, or not <lb/>
            visible ?"</p>
          <p>“ Not visible."</p>
          <p>“ Is it then invisible ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes." <note type="footnote"> G </note></p><pb n="82"/>
            
          <p>" The soul then is more like the invisible than the body, and <lb/>
            the body, the visible ?"</p>
          <p>" It must needs be so, Socrates."</p>
          <p>65. " And did we not some time since say this too, that the <lb/>
            soul, when it employs the body to examine any thing, either by <lb/>
            means of the sight or hearing, or any other sense, (for to ex­ <lb/>
            amine any thing by means of the body is to do so by the <lb/>
            senses,) is then drawn by the body to things that never continue <lb/>
            the same, and wanders and is confused, and reels as if intoxi­ <lb/>
            cated through coming into contact with things of this kind r"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>"But when it examines any thing by itself, does it approach <lb/>
            that which is pure, eternal, immortal, and unchangeable, and, <lb/>
            as being allied to it, continue constantly with it, so long as it <lb/>
            subsists by itself, and has the power, and does it cease from its <lb/>
            wandering, and constantly continue the same with respect to <lb/>
            those things, through coming into contact with things of this <lb/>
            kind ? and is this affection of the soul called wisdom ?”</p>
          <p>" You speak," he said, " in every respect, well and truly, <lb/>
            Socrates."</p>
          <p>" To which species of the two, then, both from what was <lb/>
            before, and now said, does the soul appear to you to be more <lb/>
            like and more nearly allied ?"</p>
          <p>66. " Every one, I think, would allow, Socrates," he replied, <lb/>
            " even the dullest person, from this method of reasoning that the <lb/>
            soul is in every respect more like that which continues con­ <lb/>
            stantly the same, than that which does not so."</p>
          <p>" But what as to the body ?"</p>
          <p>" It is more like the other."</p>
          <p>Consider it also thus, that, when soul and body are to­ <lb/>
            gether, nature enjoins the latter to be subservient and obey, <lb/>
            the former to rule and exercise dominion. And in this way, <lb/>
            which of the two appears to you to be like the divine, and <lb/>
            which the mortal ? Does it not appear to you to be natural <lb/>
            that the divine should rule and command, but the mortal obey <lb/>
            and be subservient?"</p>
          <p>" To me it does so."</p>
          <p>“ Which then, does the soul resemble ?”</p>
          <p>" It is clear, Socrates, that the soul resembles the divine, but <lb/>
            the body, the mortal."</p>
          <p>" Consider then, Cebes," said he, " whether, from all that has <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            been said, these conclusions follow, that the soul is most like <lb/>
            that which is divine, immortal, intelligent, uniform, indissolu­ <lb/>
            ble, and which always continues in the same state, but that the <lb/>
            body on the other hand is most like that which is human, mor­ <lb/>
            tal, unintelligent, multiform, dissoluble, and which never con­ <lb/>
            tinues in the same state. Can we say any thing against this, <lb/>
            my dear Cebes, to shew that it is not so ?"</p>
          <p>" We cannot."</p>
          <p>67. " What then ? Since these things are so, does it not <lb/>
            appertain to the body to be quickly dissolved, but to the soul, <lb/>
            on the contrary, to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly so ?"</p>
          <p>" How not</p>
          <p>" You perceive, however," he said, "that when a man dies, the <lb/>
            visible part of him, the body, which is exposed to sight, and which <lb/>
            we call a corpse, to which it appertains to be dissolved, to fall <lb/>
            asunder and be dispersed, does not immediately undergo any of <lb/>
            these affections, but remains for a considerable time, and es­ <lb/>
            peqially so if any one should die with his body in full vigour, <lb/>
            and at a corresponding age s; for when the body has collapsed <lb/>
            and been embalmed, as those that are embalmed in Egypt, <lb/>
            it remains almost entire for an incredible length of time ; and <lb/>
            some parts of the body, even though it does decay, such as the <lb/>
            bones and nerves, and every thing of that kind, are neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, as one may say, immortal. Is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>68. " Can the soul, then, which is invisible, and which goes <lb/>
            to another place like itself, excellent, pure, and invisible, and <lb/>
            therefore truly called the invisible worldh, to the presence of a <lb/>
            good and wise God, (whither if God will, my soul also must <lb/>
            shortly go,) can this soul of ours, I ask, being such and of such <lb/>
            a nature, when separated from the body be immediately dis­ <lb/>
            persed and destroyed, as most men assert ? Far from it, my <lb/>
            dear Cebes and Simmias. But the case is much rather thus ; <lb/>
            if it is separated in a pure state, taking nothing of the body with <lb/>
            it, as not having willingly communicated with it in the present <lb/>
            life, but having shunned it and gathered itself within itself, as <lb/>
            constantly studying this; but this is nothing else than to pursue <note type="footnote">e That is, at a time of life when tne body is in full vigour. </note><note type="footnote"> hIn the original there is a play on the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἃιδης</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀείδης</foreign>, which <lb/>

            philosophy aright, and in reality to study how to die easily; <lb/>
            would not this be to study how to die ?"</p>
          <p>" Most assuredly."</p>
          <p>" Does not the soul, then, when in this state, depart to that <lb/>
            which resembles itself, the invisible, the divine, immortal, and <lb/>
            wise ? and on its arrival there, is it not its lot to be happy, free <lb/>
            from error, ignorance, fears, wild passions, and all the other <lb/>
            evils to which human nature is subject, and, as is said of the <lb/>
            initiated, does it not in truth pass the rest of its time with the <lb/>
            gods ? Must we affirm that it is so, Cebes, or otherwise ?"</p>
          <p>" So, by Jupiter," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>69. " But, I think, if it departs from the body polluted and <lb/>
            impure, as having constantly held communion with the body, <lb/>
            and having served and loved it, and been bewitched by it, <lb/>
            through desires and pleasures, so as to think that there is <lb/>
            nothing real except what is corporeal, which one can touch <lb/>
            and see, and drink and eat, and employ for sensual purposes; <lb/>
            but what is dark and invisible to the eyes, which is intellec­ <lb/>
            tual and apprehended by philosophy, having been accustomed <lb/>
            to hate, fear, and shun this, do you think that a soul thus <lb/>
            affected can depart from the body by itself, and uncontami­ <lb/>
            nated ?"</p>
          <p>“By no means whatever," he replied.</p>
          <p>“But I think it will be impressed with that which is corpo­ <lb/>
            real, which the intercourse and communion of the body, through <lb/>
            constant association and great attention, have made natural <lb/>
            to it.,,</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" We must think, my dear Cebes, that this is ponderous and <lb/>
            heavy, earthly and visible, by possessing which such a soul is <lb/>
            weighed down, and drawn again into the visible world through <lb/>
            dread of the invisible and of Hades, wandering, as it is said, <lb/>
            amongst monuments and tombs, about which, indeed, certain <lb/>
            shadowy phantoms of souls have been seen, being such images <lb/>
            as those souls produced which have not departed pure from <lb/>
            the body, but which partake of the visible, on which account <lb/>
            also they are visible."</p>
          <p>" That is probable, Socrates."</p>
          <p>70. " Probable indeed, Cebes; and not that these are the souls <lb/>
            of the good, but of the wicked, which are compelled to wander <lb/>
            about such places, paying the penalty of their former conduct, <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            which was evil; and they wander about so long, until, through <lb/>
            the desire of the corporeal nature that accompanies them, they <lb/>
            are again united to a body; and they are united, as is proba­ <lb/>
            ble, to animals having the same habits as those they have given <lb/>
            themselves up to during life."</p>
          <p>" But what do you say these are, Socrates ?"</p>
          <p>" For instance, those who have given themselves up to glut­ <lb/>
            tony, wantonness, and drinking, and have put no restraint on <lb/>
            themselves, will probably be clothed in the form of asses and <lb/>
            brutes of that kind. Do you not think so ?"</p>
          <p>" You say what is very probable."</p>
          <p>, " And that such as have set great value on injustice, tyranny, <lb/>
            and rapine, will be clothed in the species of wolves, hawks, <lb/>
            and kites ? Where else can we say such souls go ?"</p>
          <p>"Without doubt," said Cebes, "into such as these."</p>
          <p>" Is it not then evident," he continued, " as to the rest, whi­ <lb/>
            ther each will go, according to the resemblances of their several <lb/>
            pursuits?"</p>
          <p>71. " It is evident," he replied, " how not?"</p>
          <p>" Of these, then," he said, " are not they the most happy, <lb/>
            and do they not go to the best place, who have practised that <lb/>
            social and civilized virtue, which they call temperance and jus­ <lb/>
            tice, and which is produced from habit and exercise, without <lb/>
            philosophy and reflection?"</p>
          <p>" In what respect are these the most happy ?"</p>
          <p>" Because it is probable that these should again migrate <lb/>
            into a corresponding civilized and peaceable kind of animals, <lb/>
            such as bees perhaps, or wasps, or ants, or even into the <lb/>
            same human species again, and from these become moderate <lb/>
            men."</p>
          <p>" It is probable."</p>
          <p>" But it is not lawful for any one, who has not studied philo­ <lb/>
            sophy and departed this life perfectly pure, to pass into the <lb/>
            rank of gods, but only for the true lover of wisdom. And on <lb/>
            this account, my friends Simmias and Cebes, those who philoso­ <lb/>
            phize rightly abstain from all bodily desires, and persevere in <lb/>
            doing so, and do not give themselves up to them, not fearing <lb/>
            the loss of property and poverty, as the generality of men and <lb/>
            the lovers of wealth; nor again dreading disgrace and igno­ <lb/>
            miny like those who are lovers of power and honour, do they <lb/>
            then abstain from them." <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            " For it would not become them to do so, Socrates," says <lb/>
            Cebes.</p>
          <p>72. " It would not, by Jupiter," he rejoined. " Wherefore, <lb/>
            Cebes, they who care at all for their soul, and do not spend <lb/>
            their lives in the culture of their bodies, despising all these, <lb/>
            proceed not in the same way with them, as being ignorant whi­ <lb/>
            ther they are going, but being convinced that they ought not <lb/>
            to act contrary to philosophy, but in accordance with the free­ <lb/>
            dom and purification she affords, they give themselves up to <lb/>
            her direction, following her wherever she leads."</p>
          <p>" How, Socrates ?"</p>
          <p>" I will tell you," he replied. " The lovers of wisdom know, <lb/>
            that philosophy receiving their soul plainly bound and glued to <lb/>
            the body, and compelled to view things through this, as through <lb/>
            a prison, and not directly by herself, and sunk in utter igno- . <lb/>
            ranee, and perceiving too the strength of the prison, that it <lb/>
            arises from desire, so that he that is bound as much as possible <lb/>
            assists in binding himself. 73. I say, then, the lovers of wis­ <lb/>
            dom know that philosophy, receiving their soul in this state, <lb/>
            gently exhorts it, and endeavours to free it, by shewing that <lb/>
            the view of things by means of the eyes is full of deception, <lb/>
            as also is that through the ears and the other senses, per­ <lb/>
            suading an abandonment of these so far as it is not abso­ <lb/>
            lutely necessary to use them, and advising the soul to be col­ <lb/>
            lected and concentrated within itself, and to believe nothing <lb/>
            else but herself, with respect to what she herself understands <lb/>
            of things that have a real subsistence, and to consider nothing <lb/>
            true which she views through the medium of others, and which <lb/>
            differ under different aspectsi; for that a thing of this kind is <lb/>
            sensible and visible, but that what she herself perceives is in­ <lb/>
            telligible and invisible. The soul of the true philosopher, <lb/>
            therefore, thinking that she ought not to oppose this deliver­ <lb/>
            ance, accordingly abstains as much as possible from pleasures <lb/>
            and desires, griefs and fears, considering that when any one <lb/>
            is exceedingly delighted or alarmed, grieved or influenced by <lb/>
            desire, he does not merely suffer such evil from these things as <lb/>
            one might suppose, such as either being sick or wasting his <note type="footnote">1 By this I understand him to mean that the soul alone can perceive <lb/>
            the truth, but the senses, as they are different, receive and convey differ­ <lb/>
            ent impressions of the same thing; thus the eye receives one impression <lb/>
            of an object, the ear a totally different one. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            property, through indulging his desires; but that which is the <lb/>
            greatest evil, and the worst of all, this he suffers and is not <lb/>
            conscious of it."</p>
          <p>" But what is this evil, Socrates ?" said Cebes.</p>
          <p>74. " That the soul of every man is compelled to be either <lb/>
            vehemently delighted or grieved about some particular thing, <lb/>
            and at the same time to consider that the thing about which it <lb/>
            is thus strongly affected is most real and most true, though <lb/>
            it is not so. But these are chiefly visible objects; are they <lb/>
            not?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" In this state of affection, then, is not the soul especially <lb/>
            shackled by the body ?"</p>
          <p>" How so?"</p>
          <p>" Because each pleasure and pain, having a nail as it were, <lb/>
            nails the soul to the body, and fastens it to it, and causes it to <lb/>
            become corporeal, deeming those things to be true whatever <lb/>
            the body asserts to be so. For, in consequence of its forming <lb/>
            the same opinions with the body, and delighting in the same <lb/>
            things, it is compelled, I think, to possess similar manners, <lb/>
            and to be similarly nourished, so that it can never pass into <lb/>
            Hades in a pure state, but must ever depart polluted by the <lb/>
            body, and so quickly falls again into another body, and grows <lb/>
            up as if it were sown, and consequently is deprived of all asso­ <lb/>
            ciation with that which is divine, and pure, and uniform."</p>
          <p>" You speak most truly, Socrates," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>75. " For these reasons, therefore, Cebes, those who are truly <lb/>
            lovers of wisdom are moderate and resolute, and not for the <lb/>
            reasons that most people say. Do you think as they do ?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly not."</p>
          <p>" No, truly. But the soul of a philosopher would reason <lb/>
            thus, and would not think that philosophy ought to set it free, <lb/>
            and that when it is freed it should give itself up again to plea­ <lb/>
            sures and pains, to bind it down again, and make her work <lb/>
            void, weaving a kind of Penelope's web the reverse way. On <lb/>
            the contrary, effecting a calm of the passions, and following <lb/>
            the guidance of reason, and being always intent on this, con­ <lb/>
            templating that which is true and divine, and not subject to <lb/>
            opinion, and being nourished by it, it thinks that it ought to <lb/>
            live in this manner as long as it does live, and that when it <lb/>
            dies it shall go to a kindred essence, and one like itself, and <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            shall be freed from human evils. From such a regimen as <lb/>
            this the soul has no occasion to fear, Simmias and Cebes, while <lb/>
            it strictly attends to these things, lest being torn to pieces at <lb/>
            its departure from the body it should be blown about and dis­ <lb/>
            sipated by the winds, and no longer have an existence any <lb/>
            where."</p>
          <p>76. When Socrates had thus spoken, a long silence ensued; <lb/>
            and Socrates himself was pondering upon what had been said, <lb/>
            as he appeared, and so did most of us : but Cebes and Simmias <lb/>
            were conversing a little while with each other. At length <lb/>
            Socrates perceiving them, said, " What think you of what has <lb/>
            been said ? does it appear to you to have been proved suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently? for many doubts and objections still remain if any one <lb/>
            will examine them thoroughly. If, then, you are considering <lb/>
            some other subject, I have nothing to say; but if you are <lb/>
            doubting about this, do not hesitate both yourselves to speak <lb/>
            and express your opinion, if it appears to you in any respect <lb/>
            that it might have been argued better, and to call me in again <lb/>
            to your assistance, if you think you can be at all benefited by <lb/>
            my help."</p>
          <p>Upon this Simmias said, " Indeed, Socrates, I will tell you <lb/>
            the truth: for some time each of us, being in doubt, has been <lb/>
            urging and exhorting the other to question you, from a desire <lb/>
            to hear our doubts solved, but we were afraid of giving you <lb/>
            trouble, lest it should be disagreeable to you in your present <lb/>
            circumstances."</p>
          <p>77. But he, upon hearing this, gently smiled, and said, <lb/>
            " Bless me, Simmias ; with difficulty indeed, could I persuade <lb/>
            other men that I do not consider, my present condition a cala­ <lb/>
            mity, since I am not able to persuade even you ; but you are <lb/>
            afraid lest I should be more morose now than during the former <lb/>
            part of my life. And, as it seems, I appear to you to be <lb/>
            inferior to swans with respect to divination, who, when they <lb/>
            perceive that they must needs die, though they have been used <lb/>
            to sing before, sing then more than ever, rejoicing that they <lb/>
            are about to depart to that deity whose servants they are. But <lb/>
            men, through their own fear of death, belie the swans too, and <lb/>
            say that, they lamenting their death, sing their last song through <lb/>
            grief, and they do not consider that no bird sings when it is <lb/>
            hungry or cold, or is afflicted with any other pain, not even the <lb/>
            nightingale, or swallow, or the hoopoes, which they say sing <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            lamenting through grief. But neither do these birds appear to <lb/>
            me to sing through sorrow, nor yet do swans; but in my <lb/>
            opinion, belonging to Apollo, they are prophetic, and foreseeing <lb/>
            the blessings of Hades, they sing and rejoice on that day more <lb/>
            excellently than at any preceding time. 78. But I too con­ <lb/>
            sider myself to be a fellow-servant of the swans, and sacred to <lb/>
            the same god, and that I have received the power of divination <lb/>
            from our common master no less than they, and that I do not <lb/>
            depart from this life with less spirits than they. On this ac­ <lb/>
            count, therefore, it is right that you should both speak and ask <lb/>
            whatever you please, as long as the Athenian Eleven permit."</p>
          <p>" You say well," said Simmias, and both I will tell you <lb/>
            what are my doubts, and he In turn how far he does not assent <lb/>
            to what has been said. For it appears to me, Socrates, prob­ <lb/>
            ably as it does to you with respect to these matters, that to <lb/>
            know them clearly in the present life is either impossible, <lb/>
            or very difficult: on the other hand, however, not to test what <lb/>
            has been said of them in every possible way, so as not to desist <lb/>
            until on examining them in every point of view, one has ex­ <lb/>
            hausted every effort, is the part of a very weak man. For we <lb/>
            ought with respect to these things, either to learn from others <lb/>
            how they stand, or to discover them for one's-self, or, if both <lb/>
            these are impossible, then, taking the best of human reasonings <lb/>
            and that which is the most difficult to be confuted, and em­ <lb/>
            barking on this, as one who risks himself on a raft, so to sail <lb/>
            through life, unless one could be carried more safely, and with <lb/>
            less risk, on a surer conveyance or some divine reason. 79. I; <lb/>
            therefore, shall not now be ashamed to question you, since you <lb/>
            bid me do so, nor shall I blame myself hereafter, for not having <lb/>
            now told you what I think; for to me, Socrates, when I con­ <lb/>
            sider the matter, both with myself and with Cebes, what has <lb/>
            been said does not appear to have been sufficiently proved."</p>
          <p>Then said Socrates, "Perhaps, my friend, you have the <lb/>
            truth on your side ; but tell me in what respect it was not <lb/>
            sufficiently proved."</p>
          <p>" In this," he answered, " because any one might use the <lb/>
            same argument with respect to harmony, and a lyre, and its <lb/>
            chords, that harmony is something invisible and incorporeal, <lb/>
            very beautiful and divine, in a well-modulated lyre: but the <lb/>
            lyre and its chords are bodies, and of corporeal form, com­ <lb/>
            pounded and earthly, and akin to that which is mortal. When <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            any one, then, has either broken the lyre, or cut or burst the <lb/>
            chords, he might maintain from the same reasoning as yours, <lb/>
            that it is necessary the harmony should still exist and not be <lb/>
            destroyed; for there could be no possibility that the lyre should <lb/>
            subsist any longer when the chords are burst, and that the <lb/>
            chords which are of a mortal nature should subsist, but that <lb/>
            the harmony, which is of the same nature and akin to that <lb/>
            which is divine and immortal, should become extinct, and <lb/>
            perish before that which is mortal; but he might say that the <lb/>
            harmony must needs subsist somewhere, and that the wood and <lb/>
            chords must decay, before it can undergo any change. 80. For I <lb/>
            think, Socrates, that you yourself have arrived at this conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, that we consider the soul to be pretty much of this kind, <lb/>
            namely, that our body being compacted and held together by <lb/>
            heat and cold, dryness and moisture, and other such qualities, <lb/>
            our soul is the fusion and harmony of these, when they are well <lb/>
            and duly combined with each other. If then, the soul is a <lb/>
            kind of harmony, it is evident that when our body is unduly <lb/>
            relaxed or strained through diseases and other maladies, the <lb/>
            soul must of necessity immediately perish, although it is most <lb/>
            divine, just as other harmonies which subsist in sounds or in the <lb/>
            various works of artizans, but that the remains of the body of <lb/>
            each person last for a long time, till they are either burnt or <lb/>
            decayed. Consider then what we shall say to this reasoning, <lb/>
            if any one should maintain that the soul being a fusion of the <lb/>
            several qualities in the body, perishes first in that which is <lb/>
            called death."</p>
          <p>81. Socrates, therefore, looking stedfastly at us, as he was <lb/>
            generally accustomed to do, and smiling, said, " Simmias in­ <lb/>
            deed speaks justly. If then, any one of you is more prompt <lb/>
            than I am, why does he not answer ? for he seems to have <lb/>
            handled my argument not badly. It appears to me, however, <lb/>
            that before we make our reply we should first hear from Cebes, <lb/>
            what he too objects to our argument, in order that, some time <lb/>
            intervening, we may consider what we shall say, and then when <lb/>
            we have heard them, we may give up to them, if they appear <lb/>
            to speak agreeably to truth, or if not, we may then uphold our <lb/>
            own argument. Come then, Cebes," he continued, " say <lb/>
            what it is that disturbs you, so as to cause your unbelief."</p>
          <p>" I will tell you," said Cebes; " the argument seems to me <lb/>
            to rest where it was, and to be liable to the same objection that <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            we mentioned before. For, that our soul existed even before <lb/>
            it came into this present form, I do not deny has been very <lb/>
            elegantly, and, if it is not too much to say so, very fully <lb/>
            demonstrated: but that it still exists any where when we are <lb/>
            dead, does not appear to me to have been clearly proved ; nor <lb/>
            do I give in to the objection of Simmias, that the soul is not <lb/>
            stronger and more durable than the body, for it appears to me <lb/>
            to excel very far all things of this kind. 82. 'Why then,' <lb/>
            reason might say, ' do you still disbelieve ? for, since you see <lb/>
            that when a man dies his weaker part still exists, does it not <lb/>
            appear to you to be necessary that the more durable part should <lb/>
            still be preserved during this period ?<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> Consider then, whether <lb/>
            I say any thing to the purpose in reply to this. For I too, as <lb/>
            well as Simmias, as it seems, stand in need of an illustration : <lb/>
            for the argument appears to me to have been put thus, as if any <lb/>
            one should advance this argument about an aged weaver who <lb/>
            had died, that the man has not yet perished, but perhaps still <lb/>
            exists somewhere; and as a proof, should exhibit the gar­ <lb/>
            ment which he wore and had woven himself, that it is entire <lb/>
            and has not perished; and if any one should disbelieve <lb/>
            him he would ask, whether of the two is the more durable, <lb/>
            the species of a man or of a garment, that is constantly <lb/>
            in use and being worn ; then should any one answer, that <lb/>
            the species of man is much more durable, he would think <lb/>
            it demonstrated, that beyond all question the man is pre­ <lb/>
            served, since that which is less durable has not perished. <lb/>
            83. But I do not think, Simmias, that this is the case, and <lb/>
            do you consider what I say, for every one must think that he <lb/>
            who argues thus argues foolishly. For this weaver, having <lb/>
            worn and woven many such garments, perished after almost <lb/>
            all of them, but before the last I suppose, and yet it does not <lb/>
            on this account follow any the more that a man is inferior to <lb/>
            or weaker than a garment. And I think the soul might admit <lb/>
            this same illustration with respect to the body, and he who <lb/>
            should say the same things concerning them would appear to <lb/>
            me to speak correctly, that the soul is more durable, but the <lb/>
            body weaker and less durable; for he would say that each <lb/>
            soul wears out many bodies, especially if it lives many years; <lb/>
            for, if the body wastes and is dissolved while the man still <lb/>
            lives, but the soul continually weaves anew what is worn out, <lb/>
            it must necessarily follow that when the soul is dissolved it <lb/>
            must then have on its last garment, and perish before this <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            alone; but when the soul has perished the body would shew <lb/>
            the weakness of its nature, and quickly rot and vanish. 84. <lb/>
            So that it is not by any means right to place implicit reliance <lb/>
            on this argument, and to believe that when we die our soul <lb/>
            still exists somewhere. For, if any one should concede to him <lb/>
            who admits even more than you do, and should grant to him <lb/>
            that not only did our soul exist before we were born, but that <lb/>
            even when we die nothing hinders the souls of some of us <lb/>
            from still existing, and continuing to exist hereafter, and from <lb/>
            being often born, and dying again; for so strong is it by na­ <lb/>
            ture, that it can hold out against repeated births ; if he granted <lb/>
            this, he would not yet concede that it does not exhaust itself in <lb/>
            its many births, and at length perish altogether in some one of <lb/>
            the deaths. But he would say that no one knows this death <lb/>
            and dissolution of the body, which brings destruction to the <lb/>
            soul; for it is impossible for any one of us to perceive it. If <lb/>
            however, this be the case, it follows that every one who is <lb/>
            confident at the approach of death is foolishly confident, unless <lb/>
            he is able to prove that the soul is absolutely immortal and <lb/>
            imperishable : otherwise it necessarily follows that he who <lb/>
            is about to die must be alarmed for his soul, lest in its present <lb/>
            disunion from the body it should entirely perish."</p>
          <p>85. Upon this, all of us whd had heard them speaking were <lb/>
            disagreeably affected, as we afterwards mentioned to each <lb/>
            other; because, after we had been fully persuaded by the for­ <lb/>
            mer arguments, they seemed to disturb us anew, and to cast <lb/>
            us into a distrust, not only of the arguments already adduced, <lb/>
            but of such as might afterwards be urged, for fear lest we <lb/>
            should not be fit judges of any thing, or lest the things them­ <lb/>
            selves should be incredible.</p>
          <p>Echec. By the gods, Phædo, I can readily excuse you: <lb/>
            for, while I am now hearing you, it occurs to me to ask my­ <lb/>
            self some such question as this, What arguments can we any <lb/>
            longer believe ? since the argument which Socrates advanced, <lb/>
            and which was exceedingly credible, has now fallen into dis­ <lb/>
            credit. For this argument, that our soul is a kind of harmony, <lb/>
            produces a wonderful impression on me, both now and always, <lb/>
            and. in being mentioned, it has reminded me, as it were, <lb/>
            that I too was formerly of the same opinion : so that I stand <lb/>
            in need again, as if from the very beginning, of some other <lb/>
            argument which may persuade me that the soul of one who <lb/>
            dies does not die with the body. Tell me therefore, by Jupi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            ter, how Socrates followed up the argument; and whether he <lb/>
            too, as you confess was the case with yourselves, seemed dis­ <lb/>
            concerted at all, or not, but calmly maintained his position; <lb/>
            and maintained it sufficiently, or defectively. Relate every <lb/>
            thing to me as accurately as you can.</p>
          <p>Phœd. Indeed, Echecrates, though I have often admired <lb/>
            Socrates, I was never more delighted than at being with him <lb/>
            on that occasion. That he should be able to say something is <lb/>
            perhaps not at all surprising; but I especially admired this in <lb/>
            him, first of all that he listened to the argument of the young <lb/>
            men so sweetly, affably, and approvingly; in the next place, <lb/>
            that he so quickly perceived how we were affected by their <lb/>
            arguments; and lastly, that he cured us so well and recalled <lb/>
            us, when we were put to flight as it were and vanquished, and <lb/>
            encouraged us to accompany him, and consider the argument <lb/>
            with him.</p>
          <p>Echec. How was that ?</p>
          <p>Phœd. I will tell you : I happened to be sitting at his right <lb/>
            hand, near the bed, upon a low seat, but he himself -at much <lb/>
            higher than I. Stroking my head, then, and laying hold of <lb/>
            the hair that hung on my neck, for he used, often, to play <lb/>
            with my hairs, "To-morrow," he said, perhaps, Phædo, you <lb/>
            will cut off these beautiful locks ?"</p>
          <p>" It seems likely, Socrates," said I.</p>
          <p>87. " Not if you are persuaded by me."</p>
          <p>"Why so ?" I asked.</p>
          <p>" To-day," he replied, "both I ought to cut off mine and <lb/>
            you yours, if our argument must die, and we are unable to <lb/>
            revive it. And I, if I were you, and the arguments were to <lb/>
            escape me, would take an oath, as the Argives do, not to suf­ <lb/>
            fer my hair to grow until I had renewed the contest, and van­ <lb/>
            quished the arguments of Simmias and Cebes."</p>
          <p>" But," I said, " even Hercules himself is said not to have <lb/>
            been a match for two."</p>
          <p>" Call upon me, then," he said, "as your Iolaus, while it is <lb/>
            yet day."</p>
          <p>"I do call on you, then," I said, "not as Hercules upon <lb/>
            Iolaus, but as Iolaus upon Hercules."</p>
          <p>" It will make no difference," he replied. " But first of all <lb/>
            we must beware lest we meet with some mischance."</p>
          <p>"What?" I asked.</p><pb n="94"/>
            
          <p>"That we do not become," he answered, "haters of reason­ <lb/>
            ing as some become haters of men; for no greater evil can <lb/>
            happen to any one than to hate reasoning. 88. But hatred of <lb/>
            reasoning and hatred of mankind both spring from the same <lb/>
            source. For hatred of mankind is produced in us from having <lb/>
            placed too great reliance on some one without sufficient know­ <lb/>
            ledge of him, and from having considered him to be a man <lb/>
            altogether true, sincere, and faithful, and then after a little <lb/>
            while finding him depraved and unfaithful, and after him <lb/>
            another. And when a man has often experienced this, and es­ <lb/>
            pecially from those whom he considered his most intimate and <lb/>
            best friends, at length, having frequently stumbled, he hates all <lb/>
            men, and thinks that there is no soundness at all in any of <lb/>
            them. Have you not perceived that this happens so ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," I replied.</p>
          <p>" Is it not a shame ?" he said, " and is it not evident that <lb/>
            such a one attempts to deal with men, without sufficient <lb/>
            knowledge of human affairs ? For if he had dealt with <lb/>
            them with competent knowledge, as the case really is, so he <lb/>
            would have considered that the good and the bad are each <lb/>
            very few in number, and that those between both are most <lb/>
            numerous."</p>
          <p>89. " How say you ?" I asked.</p>
          <p>" In the same manner," he replied, " as with things very <lb/>
            little and very large. Do you think that any thing is more <lb/>
            rare than to find a very large or a very little man, or do-, or <lb/>
            any thing else ? and again swift or slow, beautiful or ugly, <lb/>
            white or black ? Do you not perceive that of all such things <lb/>
            the extremes are rare and few, but that the intermediate are <lb/>
            abundant and numerous r"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," I replied.</p>
          <p>" Do you not think, then," he continued, " that if a contest <lb/>
            in wickedness were proposed, even here very few would be <lb/>
            found pre-eminent ?"</p>
          <p>" It is probable," I said.</p>
          <p>“ It is so," he said ; " but in this respect reasonings do not <lb/>
            resemble men, for I was just now following you as my leader, <lb/>
            but in this they do resemble them, when any one believes in <lb/>
            any argument as true without being skilled in the art of rea­ <lb/>
            soning, and then shortly afterwards it appears to him to be <lb/>
            false, at one time being so and at another time not, and so on <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            with one after anotherk; and especially they who devote <lb/>
            themselves to controversial arguments, you are aware at length <lb/>
            think they have become very wise, and have alone discovered <lb/>
            that there is nothing sound and stable either in things or rea­ <lb/>
            sonings, but that all things that exist, as is the case with the <lb/>
            Euripus, are in a constant state of flux and reflux, and never <lb/>
            continue in any one condition for any length of time."</p>
          <p>"You speak perfectly true," I said.</p>
          <p>go. " Would it not then, Phædo,” he said, " be a sad thing <lb/>
            if, when there is a true and sound reasoning, and such as one <lb/>
            can understand, one should then, through lighting upon such <lb/>
            arguments as appear to be at one time true, and at another <lb/>
            false, not blame one's-self and one's own want of skill, but at <lb/>
            length through grief should anxiously transfer the blame from <lb/>
            one's-self to the arguments, and thereupon pass the rest of <lb/>
            one's life in hating and reviling arguments, and so be deprived <lb/>
            of the truth and knowledge of things that exist ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," I said, " it would be sad indeed."</p>
          <p>.. In the first place, then," he said, " let us beware of this, <lb/>
            and let us not admit into our souls the notion, that there ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be nothing sound in reasoning, but much rather that <lb/>
            we are not yet in a sound condition, and that we ought vigor­ <lb/>
            ously and strenuously to endeavour to become sound, you and <lb/>
            the others, on account of your whole future life, but I, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of my death, since I am in danger at the present time, <lb/>
            of not behaving as becomes a philosopher, with respect to this <lb/>
            very subject, but as a wrangler like those who are utterly un­ <lb/>
            informed. 91. For they, when they dispute about any thing, <lb/>
            care nothing at all for the subject about which the discussion <lb/>
            is, but are anxious about this, that what they have themselves <lb/>
            advanced shall appear true to the persons present. And I seem <lb/>
            to myself on the present occasion to differ from them only in <lb/>
            this respect; for I shall not be anxious to make what I say <lb/>
            appear true to those who are present, except that may happen <note type="footnote"> k <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ αὖθις ἕτερος καὶ ἕτερος</foreign>, that is,“ with one argument after another.,, <lb/>
            Though Cousin translates it et successivement tout different de lui-mdne, <lb/>
            and Ast, et rursus alia atque alia, which may be taken in either sense, yet <lb/>
            it appears to me to mean that, when a man repeatedly discovers the fat­ <lb/>
            lacy of arguments which he before believed to be true, he distrusts rea­ <lb/>
            soning altogether, just as one who meets with friend after friend who <lb/>
            proves unfaithful, becomes a misanthrope. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            by the way, but that it may appear certainly to be so to myself. <lb/>
            For I thus reason, my dear friend, and observe how inter­ <lb/>
            estedly, if what I say be true, it is well to be persuaded of it ; <lb/>
            but if nothing remains to one that is dead, I shall at least <lb/>
            during the interval before death, be less disagreeable to those <lb/>
            present by my lamentations. But this ignorance of mine will <lb/>
            not continue long, for that would be bad, but will shortly be <lb/>
            put an end to. Thus prepared then, Simmias and Cebes," he <lb/>
            continued, " I now proceed to my argument. Do you how­ <lb/>
            ever, if you will be persuaded by me, pay little attention to So­ <lb/>
            crates, but much more to the truth, and if I appear to you to say <lb/>
            any thing true, assent to it, but if not, oppose me with all your <lb/>
            might, taking good care that in my zeal I do not deceive both <lb/>
            myself and you, and like a bee depart leaving my sting behind."</p>
          <p>92. " But let us proceed," he said; "first of all, remind me <lb/>
            of what you said, if I should appear to have forgotten it. For <lb/>
            Simmias, as I think, is in doubt and fears lest the soul, though <lb/>
            more divine and beautiful than the body, should perish before <lb/>
            it, as being a species of harmony. But Cebes appeared to me <lb/>
            to grant me this, that the soul is more durable than the body, <lb/>
            but he argued that it is uncertain to every one, whether when <lb/>
            the soul has worn out many bodies, and that repeatedly, it does <lb/>
            not, on leaving the last body, itself also perish, so that this very <lb/>
            thing is death, the destruction of the soul, since the body never <lb/>
            ceases decaying. Are not these the things, Simmias and <lb/>
            Cebes, which we have to enquire into ?"</p>
          <p>They both agreed that they were.</p>
          <p>" Whether, then," he continued, " do you reject all our <lb/>
            former arguments, or some of them only, and not others ?"</p>
          <p>" Some we do," they replied, " and others not."</p>
          <p>" What then," he proceeded, " do you say about that argu­ <lb/>
            ment, in which we asserted that knowledge is reminiscence, <lb/>
            and that, this being the case, our soul must necessarily have <lb/>
            existed somewhere before it was enclosed in the body ?"</p>
          <p>93. “ I, indeed," replied Cebes, " was both then wonderfully <lb/>
            persuaded by it, and now persist in it, as in no other argu­ <lb/>
            ment."</p>
          <p>"And I too," said Simmias, "am of the same mind, and <lb/>
            should very much wonder if I should ever think otherwise <lb/>
            on that point."</p>
          <p>"Then," Socrates said, ."you must needs think otherwise, <lb/>

            my Theban friend, if this opinion holds good, that harmony <lb/>
            is something compounded, and that the soul is a kind of har­ <lb/>
            mony that results from the parts compacted together in the <lb/>
            body. For surely you will not allow yourself to say that har­ <lb/>
            mony was composed prior to the things from-which it required <lb/>
            to be composed. Would you allow this ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Do you perceive then," he said, " that this results from <lb/>
            what you say, when you assert that the soul existed before it <lb/>
            came into a human form and body, but that it was composed from <lb/>
            things that did not yet exist ? For harmony is not such as that <lb/>
            to which you compare it; but first the lyre, and the chords, <lb/>
            and the sounds yet unharmonized, exist, and last of all harmony <lb/>
            is produced, and first perishes. How then will this argu­ <lb/>
            ment accord with that ?"</p>
          <p>" Not at all," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>94. " And yet," he said, " if in any argument, there ought <lb/>
            to be an accordance in one respecting harmony."</p>
          <p>" There ought," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>"This of yours however," he said, ., is not in accordance. <lb/>
            Consider then, which of these two statements do you prefer, <lb/>
            that knowledge is reminiscence, or the soul harmony?"</p>
          <p>"The former, by far, Socrates," he replied, "for the latter <lb/>
            occurred to me without demonstration, through a certain pro­ <lb/>
            bability and speciousness whence most men derive their opi­ <lb/>
            nions. But I am well aware that arguments which draw their <lb/>
            demonstrations from probabilities are idle; and unless one is <lb/>
            on one's guard against them, they are very deceptive, both In <lb/>
            geometry and all other subjects. But the argument respecting <lb/>
            reminiscence and knowledge may be said to have been demon­ <lb/>
            strated by a satisfactory hypothesis. For in this way it was <lb/>
            said that our soul existed before it came into the body, because <lb/>
            the essence that bears the appellation of ' that which is,' be­ <lb/>
            longs to it. But of this, as I persuade myself, I am fully and <lb/>
            rightly convinced. It is therefore necessary, as it seems, that <lb/>
            I should neither allow myself nor any one else to maintain <lb/>
            that the soul is harmony."</p>
          <p>95. " But what, Simmias," said he, " if you consider it thus ? <lb/>
            Does it appear to you to appertain to harmony, or to any other <lb/>
            composition, to subsist in any other way than the very things <lb/>
            do of which it is composed ?" <note type="footnote"> H </note></p><pb n="98"/>
            
          <p>" By no means."</p>
          <p>" And indeed, as I think, neither to do any thing, nor suffer <lb/>
            any thing else, besides what they do or suffer."</p>
          <p>He agreed.</p>
          <p>" It does not, therefore, appertain to harmony to take the <lb/>
            lead of the things of which it is composed, but to follow them."</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>" It is then far from being the case that harmony is moved <lb/>
            or sends forth sounds contrariwise, or is in any other respect op­ <lb/>
            posed to its parts ?"</p>
          <p>" Far indeed," he said.</p>
          <p>" What then ? is not every harmony naturally harmony, so <lb/>
            far as it has been made to accord ?"</p>
          <p>" I do not understand you," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ Whether," he said, " if it should be in a greater degree and <lb/>
            more fully made to accord, supposing that were possible, would <lb/>
            the harmony be greater and more full, but if in a less degree <lb/>
            and less fully, then would it be inferior and less full ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Is this then the case with the soul, that, even in the small­ <lb/>
            est extent, one soul is more fully and in a greater degree, or <lb/>
            less fully and in a less degree this very thing, a soul, than <lb/>
            another ?"</p>
          <p>" In no respect whatever," he replied.</p>
          <p>96. " Well then," he said, " by Jupiter, is one soul said to <lb/>
            possess intelligence and virtue, and to be good, and another <lb/>
            folly and vice, and to be bad? and is this said with truth?"</p>
          <p>With truth, certainly."</p>
          <p>“ Of those, then, who maintain that the soul is harmony, <lb/>
            what will any one say that these things are in the soul, virtue <lb/>
            and vice ? Will he call them another kind of harmony and <lb/>
            discord ? and say that the one, the good soul, is harmonized, <lb/>
            and, being harmony, contains within itself another harmony, <lb/>
            but that the other is discordant, and does not contain within <lb/>
            itself another harmony?"</p>
          <p>" I am unable to say," replied Simmias, " but it is clear that <lb/>
            he who maintains that opinion would say something of the <lb/>
            kind."</p>
          <p>" But it has been already granted," said he, " that one soul <lb/>
            is not more or less a soul than another ; and this is an admis­ <lb/>
            sion that one harmony is not to a greater degree or more <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            fully, or to a less degree or less fully, a harmony, than another: <lb/>
            is it not so?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" And that that which is neither more nor less harmony, is <lb/>
            neither more nor less harmonized : is it so ?"</p>
          <p>" It is”</p>
          <p>" But does that which is neither more nor less harmonized <lb/>
            partake of more or less harmony, or an equal amount?"</p>
          <p>" An equal amount."</p>
          <p>97. "A soul, therefore, since it is not more or less this very <lb/>
            thing, a soul, than another, is not more or less harmonized ?"</p>
          <p>" Even so."</p>
          <p>" Such then being its condition, it cannot partake of agreater <lb/>
            degree of discord or harmony</p>
          <p>" Certainly not."</p>
          <p>" And again, such being its condition, can one soul partake <lb/>
            of a greater degree of vice or virtue than another, if vice be <lb/>
            discord, and virtue harmony?"</p>
          <p>" It cannot."</p>
          <p>" Or rather, surely, Simmias, according to right reason, no <lb/>
            soul will partake of vice, if it is harmony: for doubtless har­ <lb/>
            mony, which is perfectly such, can never partake of discord ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly not."</p>
          <p>“ Neither, therefore, can a soul, which is perfectly a soul, <lb/>
            partake of vice."</p>
          <p>“ How can it, from what has been already said ?"</p>
          <p>“ From this reasoning, then, all souls of all animals will be <lb/>
            equally good, if at least they are by nature equally this very <lb/>
            thing, souls ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so to me, Socrates," he said.</p>
          <p>" And does it appear to you," he said, " to have been thus <lb/>
            rightly argued, and that the argument would lead to this re­ <lb/>
            sult, if the hypothesis were correct, that the soul is harmony ?"</p>
          <p>98. " On no account whatever," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But what," said he, "of all the things that are in man, <lb/>
            is there any thing else that you say bears rule except the soul, <lb/>
            especially if it be wise ?"</p>
          <p>" I should say not."</p>
          <p>" Whether by yielding to the passions in the body, or by <lb/>
            opposing them ? My meaning is this, for instance, when heat <lb/>
            and thirst are present, by drawing it the contrary way, so as <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            to hinder it from drinking, and when hunger is present, by <lb/>
            hindering it from eating ; and in ten thousand other instances <lb/>
            we see the soul opposing the desires of the body. Do we not ?”</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" But have we not before allowed that if the soul were <lb/>
            harmony, it would never utter a sound contrary to the ten­ <lb/>
            sion, relaxation, vibration, or any other affection to which its <lb/>
            component parts are subject, but would follow, and never <lb/>
            govern them ?"</p>
          <p>"We did allow it," he replied, for how could we do otherwise ?”</p>
          <p>“What, then, does not the soul now appear to act quite the <lb/>
            contrary, ruling over all the parts, from which any one might <lb/>
            say it subsists, and resisting almost all of them through the <lb/>
            whole of life, and exercising dominion over them in all manner <lb/>
            of ways, punishing some more severely even with pain, both <lb/>
            by gymnastics and medicine, and others more mildly, partly <lb/>
            threatening, and partly admonishing the desires, angers, and <lb/>
            fears, as if, being itself of a different nature, it were convers­ <lb/>
            ing with something quite different? 99. Just as Homer has <lb/>
            done in the Odyssey1, where he speaks of Ulysses: . Having <lb/>
            struck his breast, he chid his heart in the following words, <lb/>
            Bear up, my heart; ere this thou hast borne far worse.' Do <lb/>
            you think that he composed this in the belief that the soul <lb/>
            was harmony, and capable of being led by the passions of the <lb/>
            body, and not rather that it was able to lead and govern <lb/>
            them, as being something much more divine than to be com­ <lb/>
            pared with harmony r"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, Socrates, it appears so to me."</p>
          <p>" Therefore, my excellent friend, it is on no account correct <lb/>
            for us to say that the soul is a kind of harmony; for as it ap­ <lb/>
            pears, we should neither agree with Homer, that divine poet, <lb/>
            nor with ourselves."</p>
          <p>" Such is the case,” he replied.</p>
          <p>" Be it so, then," said Socrates, "we have already, as it seems, <lb/>
            sufficiently appeased this Theban harmony. But how, Cebes, <lb/>
            and by what arguments shall we appease this Cadmus m ?" <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">1 Lib. xx. v. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> m Harmony was the wife of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes; Socrates, <lb/>
            therefore, compares his two Theban friends, Simmias and Cebes, with <lb/>
            them, and says that having overcome Simmias, the advocate of Harmony, <lb/>
            he must now deal with Cebes, who is represented by Cadmus. </note></p><pb n="101"/>
            
          <p>tOO. “ You appear to me," replied Cebes, " to. be likely to <lb/>
            find out; for you have made out this argument against har­ <lb/>
            mony wonderfully beyond my expectation. For when Simmias <lb/>
            was saying what his doubts were, I wondered very much whe­ <lb/>
            ther any one would be able to answer his reasoning. It there­ <lb/>
            fore appeared to me unaccountable that he did not withstand <lb/>
            the very first onset of your argument. I should not, there­ <lb/>
            fore, be surprised if the arguments of Cadmus met with the <lb/>
            same fate."</p>
          <p>" My good friend," said Socrates, " do not speak so boast- <lb/>
            fully, lest some envious power should overthrow the argument <lb/>
            that is about to be urged. These things, however, will be <lb/>
            cared for by the deity, but let us, meeting hand to hand, in the <lb/>
            manner of Homer, try whether you say any thing to the pur­ <lb/>
            pose. This, then, is the sum of what you enquire: you require <lb/>
            it to be proved that our soul is imperishable and immortal; if <lb/>
            a philosopher that is about to die, full of confidence and hope <lb/>
            that after death he shall be far happier than if he had died <lb/>
            after leading a different kind of life, shall not entertain this con­ <lb/>
            fidence foolishly and vainly. 101. But to shew that the soul is <lb/>
            something strong and divine, and that it existed before we men <lb/>
            were born, you say not at all hinders, but that all these things <lb/>
            may evince, not its immortality, but that the soul is durable, <lb/>
            and existed an immense space of time before, and knew and <lb/>
            did many things. But that, for all this, it was not at all the <lb/>
            more immortal, but that its very entrance into the body of a man <lb/>
            was the beginning of its destruction, as if it were a disease, <lb/>
            so that it passes through this life in wretchedness, and at last <lb/>
            perishes in that which is called death. But you say that it is <lb/>
            of no consequence whether it comes into a body once or often, <lb/>
            with respect to our occasion of fear : for it is right he should <lb/>
            be afraid, unless he is foolish, who does not know, and cannot <lb/>
            give a reason to prove, that the soul is immortal. Such, I <lb/>
            think, Cebes, is the sum of what you say; and I purposely <lb/>
            repeat it often, that nothing may escape us, and, if you please, <lb/>
            you may add to or take from it."</p>
          <p>Cebes replied, " I do not wish at present either to take from <lb/>
            or add to it; that is what I mean."</p>
          <p>102. Socrates, then, having paused for some time, and con­ <lb/>
            sidered something within himself, said, " You enquire into no <lb/>
            easy matter, Cebes; for it is absolutely necessary to discuss. <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            the whole question of generation and corruption. If you <lb/>
            please, then, I will relate. to you what happened to me with <lb/>
            reference to them; and afterwards, if any thing that I shall <lb/>
            say shall appear to you useful, towards producing conviction <lb/>
            on the subject you are now treating of, make use of it."</p>
          <p>" I do indeed wish it," replied Cebes.</p>
          <p>" Hear my relation then. When I was a young man, Cebes, <lb/>
            I was wonderfully desirous of that wisdom which they call a <lb/>
            history of nature: for it appeared to me to be a very sublime <lb/>
            thing to know the causes of every thing, why each thing is <lb/>
            generated, why it perishes, and why it exists. And I often <lb/>
            tossed myself upwards and downwards, considering first such <lb/>
            things as these, whether when heat and cold have undergone <lb/>
            a certain corruption, as some say, then animals are formed; <lb/>
            and whether the blood is that by means of which we think, or <lb/>
            air, or fire, or none of these, but that it is the brain that pro­ <lb/>
            duces the perceptions of hearing, seeing, and smelling, and that <lb/>
            from these come memory and opinion, and from memory and <lb/>
            opinion, when in a state of rest, in the same way knowledge <lb/>
            is produced? 103. And again considering the corruptions of <lb/>
            these, and the affections incidental to the heavens and the <lb/>
            earth, I at length appeared to myself so unskilful in these <lb/>
            speculations, that nothing could be more so. But I will give <lb/>
            you a sufficient proof of this: for I then became, by these very <lb/>
            speculations, so very blind with respect to things which I knew <lb/>
            clearly before, as it appeared to myself and others, that I un­ <lb/>
            learnt even the things which I thought I knew before, both on <lb/>
            many other subjects and also this, why a man grows. For <lb/>
            before I thought this was evident to every one, that it pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds from eating and drinking; for that, when, from the food, <lb/>
            flesh is added to flesh, bone to bone, and so on in the same <lb/>
            proportion, what is proper to them is added to the several <lb/>
            other parts, then the bulk which was small becomes after­ <lb/>
            wards large, and thus that a little man becomes a big one. <lb/>
            Such was my opinion at that time: does it appear to you <lb/>
            correct ?"</p>
          <p>" To me it does," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>104. " Consider this further. I thought that I had formed <lb/>
            a right opinion, when on seeing a tall man standing by a short <lb/>
            one, I judged that he was taller by the head, and in like <lb/>
            manner one horse than another: and still more clearly than <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            this, ten appeared to me to be more than eight, by two being <lb/>
            added to them, and that two cubits are greater than one cubit, <lb/>
            by exceeding it a half."</p>
          <p>" But now," said Cebes, " what think you of these matters ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said he, " I am far from thinking that I know <lb/>
            the cause of these, for that I cannot even persuade myself of <lb/>
            this, when a person has added one to one, whether the one <lb/>
            to which the addition has been made has become two, or <lb/>
            whether that which has been added, and that to which the, <lb/>
            addition has been made, have become two by the addition of <lb/>
            the one to the other. For I wonder, if when each of these <lb/>
            was separate from the other, each was one, and they were not yet <lb/>
            two, but when they have approached nearer each other, this <lb/>
            should be the cause of their becoming two, namely, the union <lb/>
            by which they have been placed nearer one another. 105. Nor <lb/>
            yet, if any person should divide one, am I able to persuade <lb/>
            myself that this, their division, is the cause of its becoming <lb/>
            two. For this cause is the contrary to the former one of their <lb/>
            becoming two; for then it was because they were brought <lb/>
            nearer to each other, and the one was added to the other; <lb/>
            but now it is, because one is removed and separated from <lb/>
            the other. Nor do I yet persuade myself, that I know why <lb/>
            one is one, nor, in a word, why any thing else is produced or <lb/>
            perishes, or exists, according to this method of proceeding; <lb/>
            but I mix up another method of my own at random, for this <lb/>
            I can on no account give in to.</p>
          <p>"But having once heard a person reading from a book, <lb/>
            written, as he said, by Anaxagoras, and which said that it <lb/>
            is intelligence that sets in order and is the cause of all things, I <lb/>
            was delighted with this cause, and it appeared to me in a <lb/>
            manner to be well that intelligence should be the cause of <lb/>
            all things, and I considered with myself, if this is so, that <lb/>
            the regulating intelligence orders all things, and disposes each <lb/>
            in such way as will be best for it. 106. If any one, then, <lb/>
            should desire to discover the cause of every thing, in what <lb/>
            way it is produced, or perishes, or exists, he must discover <lb/>
            this respecting it, in what way it is best for it either to exist, <lb/>
            or to suffer, or do any thing else; from this mode of reason­ <lb/>
            ing, then, it is proper that a man should consider nothing else, <lb/>
            both with respect to himself and others, than what is most <lb/>
            excellent and best: and it necessarily follows that this same <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            person must also know that which is worst, for that the <lb/>
            knowledge of both of them is the same. Thus reasoning <lb/>
            with myself, I was delighted to think I had found in Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras a preceptor who would instruct me in the causes of <lb/>
            things, agreeably to my own mind, and that he would inform <lb/>
            me, first, whether the earth is flat or round, and when he <lb/>
            had informed me, would moreover explain the cause and <lb/>
            necessity of its being so, arguing on the principle of the <lb/>
            better, and shewing that it is better for it to be such as it <lb/>
            is, and if he should say that it is in the middle, that he would <lb/>
            moreover explain how it is better for it to be in the middle; <lb/>
            and if he should make all this clear to me, I was prepared <lb/>
            no longer to require any other species of cause. 107. I was <lb/>
            in like manner prepared to enquire respecting the sun, and <lb/>
            moon, and the other stars, with respect to their velocities in <lb/>
            reference to each other and their revolutions, and other con­ <lb/>
            ditions, in what way it is better for both to act and be affected <lb/>
            as it does and is. For I never thought that after he had said <lb/>
            that these things were set in order by intelligence, he would <lb/>
            introduce any other cause for them than that it is best for <lb/>
            them to be as they are: hence, I thought, that in assigning <lb/>
            the cause to each of them, and to all in common, he would <lb/>
            explain that which is best for each, and the common good <lb/>
            of all. And I would not have given up my hopes for a good <lb/>
            deal, but having taken up his books with great eagerness, I <lb/>
            read through them as quickly as I could, that I might as <lb/>
            soon as possible know the best, and the worst.</p>
          <p>108. " From this wonderful hope, however, my friend, I was <lb/>
            speedily thrown down, when, as I advance and read over his <lb/>
            works, I meet with a man who makes no use of intelligence, <lb/>
            nor assigns any causes for the ordering of all things, but <lb/>
            makes the causes. to consist of air, ether, and water, and <lb/>
            many other things equally absurd. And he appeared to me <lb/>
            to be very like one who should say, that whatever Socrates <lb/>
            does he does by intelligence, and then, attempting to describe <lb/>
            the causes of each particular action, should say, first of all, <lb/>
            that for this reason I am now sitting here, because my body <lb/>
            is composed of bones and sinews, and that the bones are hard, <lb/>
            and have joints separate from each other, but that the sinews, <lb/>
            being capable of tension and contraction, cover the bones, <lb/>
            together with the flesh and skin which contains them. The <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            bones, therefore, being suspended in their sockets, the nerves <lb/>
            relaxing and tightening enable me to bend my limbs as I <lb/>
            now do, and from this cause I sit here bent up. 109. And <lb/>
            if again, he should assign other similar causes for my conversing <lb/>
            with you, assigning as causes voice, and air, and hearing, and <lb/>
            ten thousand other things of the kind, omitting to mention <lb/>
            the real causes, that since it appeared better to the Athenians <lb/>
            to condemn me, I therefore thought it better to sit here, and <lb/>
            more just to remain and submit to the punishment which they <lb/>
            have ordered; for, by the dog, I think these sinews and bones <lb/>
            would have been long ago either in Megara or Boeotia, borne <lb/>
            thither by an opinion of that which is best, if I had not <lb/>
            thought it more just and honourable to submit to whatever <lb/>
            sentence the city might order, than to flee and run stealthily <lb/>
            away. But to call such things causes is too absurd. But if <lb/>
            any one should say that without possessing such things as <lb/>
            bones and sinews, and whatever else I have, I could not do <lb/>
            what I pleased, he would speak the truth; but to say that I <lb/>
            do as I do through them, and that I act thus by intelligence, <lb/>
            and not from the choice of what is best, would be a great <lb/>
            and extreme disregard of reason. 110. For this would be <lb/>
            not to be able to distinguish that the real cause is one thing, <lb/>
            and that another without which a cause could not be a cause : <lb/>
            which indeed the generality of men appear to me to do, <lb/>
            fumbling as it were in the dark, and making use of strange <lb/>
            names, so as to denominate them as the very cause. Where­ <lb/>
            fore one encompassing the earth with a vortex from heaven, <lb/>
            makes the earth remain fixed; but another, as if it were a <lb/>
            broad trough, rests it upon the air as its base : but the power <lb/>
            by which these things are now so disposed that they may <lb/>
            be placed in the best manner possible, this they neither en­ <lb/>
            quire into, nor do they think that it requires any superhu­ <lb/>
            man strength; but they think they will some time or other <lb/>
            find out an Atlas stronger and more immortal than this, and <lb/>
            more capable of containing all things, and in reality, the good, <lb/>
            and that which ought to hold them together and contain them, <lb/>
            they take no account of at all. I then should most gladly <lb/>
            have become the disciple of any one who would teach me of <lb/>
            such a cause, in what way it is. But when I was disappointed <lb/>
            of this, and was neither able to discover it myself, nor to learn <lb/>
            it from another, do you wish, Cebes, that I should shew you' in <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            what way I set out upon a second voyage in search of the <lb/>
            cause ?"</p>
          <p>111. "I wish it exceedingly," he replied.</p>
          <p>"It appeared- to me then," said he, "after this, when I was <lb/>
            wearied with considering things that exist, that I ought to be­ <lb/>
            ware lest I should suffer in the same way as they do who look <lb/>
            at and examine an eclipse of the sun, for some lose the sight <lb/>
            of their eyes, unless they behold its image in water, or some <lb/>
            similar medium. And I was affected with a similar feeling, <lb/>
            and was afraid lest I should be utterly blinded in my soul <lb/>
            through beholding things with the eyes, and endeavouring to <lb/>
            grasp them by means of the several senses. It seemed to me, <lb/>
            therefore, that I ought to have recourse to reasons, and to con­ <lb/>
            sider in them the truth of things. Perhaps, however, this simi­ <lb/>
            litude of mine may in some respect be incorrect; for I do not <lb/>
            altogether admit that he who considers things in their reasons <lb/>
            considers them in their images, more than he does who views <lb/>
            them in their effects. However, I proceeded thus, and on each <lb/>
            occasion laying down the reason, which I deem to be the strong­ <lb/>
            est, whatever things appear to me to accord with this I regard <lb/>
            as true, both with respect to the cause and every thing else, <lb/>
            but such as do not accord I regard as not true. 112. But I <lb/>
            wish to explain my meaning to you in a clearer manner; for I <lb/>
            think that you do not yet understand me."</p>
          <p>" No, by Jupiter," said Cebes, " not well."</p>
          <p>“ However," continued he, " I am now saying nothing new, <lb/>
            but what I have always at other times, and in a former part of <lb/>
            this discussion, never ceased to say. I proceed then to at­ <lb/>
            tempt to explain to you that species of cause which I have <lb/>
            busied myself about, and return again to those well-known <lb/>
            subjects, and set out from them, laying down as an hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis, that there is a certain abstract beauty, and goodness, <lb/>
            and magnitude, and so of all other things; which if you grant <lb/>
            me, and allow that they do exist, I hope that I shall be able <lb/>
            from these to explain the cause to you, and to discover that <lb/>
            the soul is immortal."</p>
          <p>" But," said Cebes, " since I grant you this, you may draw <lb/>
            your conclusion at once."</p>
          <p>" But consider," he said, " what follows from thence, and <lb/>
            see if you can agree with me. For it appears to me, that if <lb/>
            there be any thing else beautiful, besides beauty itself, it is <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            not beautiful for any other reason than because it partakes of <lb/>
            that abstract beauty; and I say the same of every thing. Do <lb/>
            you admit such a cause ?"</p>
          <p>" I do admit it," he replied.</p>
          <p>113. "I do not yet understand," he continued, " nor am I <lb/>
            able to conceive, those other wise causes; but if any one <lb/>
            should tell me why any thing is beautiful, either because it has <lb/>
            a blooming florid colour, or figure, or any thing else of the <lb/>
            kind, I dismiss all other reasons, for I am confounded by them <lb/>
            all; but I simply, wholly, and perhaps foolishly, confine my­ <lb/>
            self to this, that nothing else causes it to be beautiful, except <lb/>
            either the presence or communication of that abstract beauty, <lb/>
            by whatever means and in whatever way communicated : for I <lb/>
            cannot yet affirm this with certainty, but only that by means <lb/>
            of beauty all beautiful things become beautiful. For this <lb/>
            appears to me the safest answer to give both to myself and <lb/>
            others, and adhering to this, I think that I shall never fall, but <lb/>
            that it is a safe answer both for me and any one else to give, <lb/>
            that by means of beauty beautiful things become beautiful. <lb/>
            Does it not also seem so to you r"</p>
          <p>" It does."</p>
          <p>"And that by magnitude great things become great, and <lb/>
            greater things, greater; and by littleness less things become <lb/>
            less ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>114. " You would not then approve of it, if any one said <lb/>
            that one person is greater than another by the head, and that <lb/>
            the less 'is less by the very same thing, but you would main­ <lb/>
            tain that you mean nothing else than that every thing that is <lb/>
            greater than another is greater by nothing else than magni­ <lb/>
            tude, and that it is greater on this account, that is on account <lb/>
            of magnitude, and that the less is less by nothing else than <lb/>
            littleness, and on this account less, that is, on account of little­ <lb/>
            ness, being afraid, I think, lest some opposite argument should <lb/>
            meet you if you should say that any one is greater and less by <lb/>
            the head; as first, that the greater is greater, and the less less, <lb/>
            by the very same thing; and next, that the greater is greater <lb/>
            by the head, which is small; and that it is monstrous to sup­ <lb/>
            pose that any one is great through something small. Should <lb/>
            you not be afraid of this ?"</p>
          <p>To which said Cebes, smilingly, " Indeed I should."</p><pb n="108"/>
            
          <p>" Should you not, then," he continued, " be afraid to say <lb/>
            that ten is more than eight by two, and for this cause exceeds <lb/>
            it, and not by number, and on account of number ? and that <lb/>
            two cubits are greater than one cubit by half, and not by mag­ <lb/>
            nitude ? for the fear is surely the same."</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>115. " What then? when one has been added to one, would <lb/>
            you not beware of saying that the "addition is the cause of its <lb/>
            being two, or division when it has been divided; and would <lb/>
            you not loudly assert that you know no other way in which <lb/>
            each thing subsists, than by partaking of the peculiar essence <lb/>
            of each of which it partakes, and that in these cases you can <lb/>
            assign no other cause of its becoming two than its partaking of <lb/>
            duality; and that such things as are to become two must needs <lb/>
            partake of this, and what is to become one, of unity; but these <lb/>
            divisions and additions, and other such subtleties, you would <lb/>
            dismiss, leaving them to be given as answers by persons wiser <lb/>
            than yourself: whereas you, fearing, as it is said, your own <lb/>
            shadow and inexperience, would adhere to this safe hypothesis, <lb/>
            and answer accordingly? But if any one should assail this <lb/>
            hypothesis of yours, would you not dismiss him and refrain <lb/>
            from answering him till you had considered the consequences <lb/>
            resulting from it, whether in your opinion they agree with or <lb/>
            differ from each other? But when it should be necessary for <lb/>
            you to give a reason for it, would you give one in a similar <lb/>
            way, by again laying down another hypothesis, which should <lb/>
            appear the best of higher principles, until you arrived at some­ <lb/>
            thing satisfactory, but at the same time you would avoid <lb/>
            making confusion, as disputants do, in treating of the first <lb/>
            principle and the results arising from it, if you really desire <lb/>
            to arrive at the truth of things. 116. For they, perhaps, <lb/>
            make no account at all of this, nor pay any attention to it, <lb/>
            for they are able, through their wisdom, to mingle all things <lb/>
            together, and at the same time please themselves. But you, <lb/>
            if you are a philosopher, would act, I think, as I now de­ <lb/>
            scribe."</p>
          <p>" You speak most truly," said Simmias and Cebes together.</p>
          <p>Echec. By Jupiter, Phsedo, they said so with good reason: <lb/>
            for he appears to me to have explained these things with won­ <lb/>
            derful clearness, even to one endued with a small degree of <lb/>
            intelligence.</p><pb n="109"/>
            
          <p>Phœd. Certainly, Echecrates, and so it appeared to all who <lb/>
            were present.</p>
          <p>Echec. And so it appears to me, who was absent, and now <lb/>
            hear it related. But what was said after this ?</p>
          <p>As well as I remember, when these things had been granted <lb/>
            him, and it was allowed that each several idea exists of itself", <lb/>
            and that other things partaking of them receive their denomi­ <lb/>
            nation from them, he next asked: " If then," he said, <lb/>
            " you admit that these things are so, whether, when you say <lb/>
            that Simmias is greater than Socrates, but less than Phsedo, <lb/>
            do you not then say that magnitude and littleness are both in <lb/>
            Simmias ?"</p>
          <p>" I do."</p>
          <p>117. " And yet," he said, " you must confess that Simmias's <lb/>
            exceeding Socrates is not actually true in the manner in which <lb/>
            the words express it; for Simmias does not naturally exceed <lb/>
            Socrates, in that he is Simmias, but in consequence of the <lb/>
            magnitude which he happens to have ; nor, again, does he ex­ <lb/>
            ceed Socrates, because Socrates is Socrates, but because Socra­ <lb/>
            tes possesses littleness in comparison with his magnitude ?"</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>“ Nor, again, is Simmias exceeded by Phsedo, because Phædo <lb/>
            is Phædo, but because Phædo possesses magnitude in compari­ <lb/>
            son with Simmias's littleness ?"</p>
          <p>" It is so."</p>
          <p>" Thus, then, Simmias has the appellation of being both <lb/>
            little and great, being between both, by exceeding the littleness <lb/>
            of one through his own magnitude, and to the other yielding a <lb/>
            magnitude that exceeds his own littleness." And at the same <lb/>
            time, smiling, he said, " I seem to speak with the precision of <lb/>
            a short-hand writer; however, it is as I say."</p>
          <p>He allowed it.</p>
          <p>118. " But I say it for this reason, wishing you to be of the <lb/>
            same opinion as myself. For it appears to me, not only that <lb/>
            magnitude itself is never disposed to be at the same time great <lb/>
            and little, but that magnitude in us never admits the little, nor <lb/>
            is disposed to be exceeded, but one of two things, either to flee <lb/>
            and withdraw when its contrary, the little, approaches it, or <lb/>
            when it has actually come, to perish; but that it is not disposed, <lb/>
            by sustaining and receiving littleness, to be different from what <note type="footnote"> n <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναί</foreign> 'I, literally, " is something." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            it was. Just as I, having received and sustained littleness, and <lb/>
            still continuing the same person that I am, am this same little <lb/>
            person : but that, while it is great, never endures to be little. <lb/>
            And in like manner the little that is in us is not disposed at <lb/>
            any time to become or to be great, nor is any thing else among <lb/>
            contraries, while it continues what it was, at the same time <lb/>
            disposed to become and to be its contrary; but in this contin­ <lb/>
            gency it either departs or perishes."</p>
          <p>119. " It appears so to me," said Cebes, " in every respect." <lb/>
            But some one of those present, on hearing this, I do not <lb/>
            clearly remember who he was, said, " By the gods, was not <lb/>
            the very contrary of what is now asserted admitted in the for­ <lb/>
            mer part of our discussion, that the greater is produced from <lb/>
            the less, and the less from the greater, and in a word, that the <lb/>
            very production of contraries is from contraries ? But now it <lb/>
            appears to me to be asserted that this can never be the case."</p>
          <p>Upon this Socrates, having leant his head forward and lis­ <lb/>
            tened, said, " You have reminded me in a manly way; you do <lb/>
            not, however, perceive the difference between what is now and <lb/>
            what was then asserted. For then it was said, that a contrary <lb/>
            thing is produced from a contrary; but now, that a contrary <lb/>
            can never become contrary to itself, neither that which is in <lb/>
            us, nor that which is in nature. For then, my friend, we spoke <lb/>
            of things that have contraries, calling them by the appellation <lb/>
            of those things; but now we are speaking of those very things, <lb/>
            from the presence of which things so called receive their appel­ <lb/>
            lation, and of these very things we say that they are never dis­ <lb/>
            posed to admit of production from each other." 120. And, at <lb/>
            the same time looking at Cebes, " Has any thing that has been <lb/>
            said, Cebes, disturbed you ?"</p>
          <p>" Indeed," said Cebes, " I am not at all so disposed; how­ <lb/>
            ever, I by no means say that there are not many things that <lb/>
            disturb me."</p>
          <p>" Then," he continued, "we have quite agreed to this, that <lb/>
            a contrary can never be contrary to itself."</p>
          <p>“ Most certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ But further," he said, " consider whether you will agree <lb/>
            with me in this also. Do you call heat and cold any thing</p>
          <p>"I do."</p>
          <p>" The same as snow and fire ?<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> </p>
          <p>"By Jupiter, I do not,"</p><pb n="111"/>
            
          <p>" But heat is something different from fire, and cold some­ <lb/>
            thing different from snow ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" But this, I think, is apparent to you, that snow, while it is <lb/>
            snow, can never, when it has admitted heat, as we said before, <lb/>
            continue to be what it was, snow and hot, but, on the approach <lb/>
            of heat, it must either withdraw or perish ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" And again, that fire, when cold approaches it, must <lb/>
            either depart or perish; but that it will never endure, when it <lb/>
            has admitted coldness, to continue what it was, fire and cold ?"</p>
          <p>121. " You speak truly," he said.</p>
          <p>" It happens then," he continued, " with respect to some of <lb/>
            such things, that not only is the idea itself always thought <lb/>
            worthy of the same appellation, but likewise something else <lb/>
            which is not indeed that idea itself but constantly retains its <lb/>
            form so long as it exists. What I mean will perhaps be clearer <lb/>
            in the following examples. The odd in number must always <lb/>
            possess the name by which we now call it; must it not ?</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Must it alone of all things, for this I ask, or is there any <lb/>
            thing else, which is not the same as the odd, but yet which we <lb/>
            must always call odd, together with its own name, because it <lb/>
            is so constituted by nature, that it can never be without the <lb/>
            odd ? But this I say is the case with the number three, and <lb/>
            many others. For consider with respect to the number three ; <lb/>
            does it not appear to you that it must always be called by its <lb/>
            own name, as well as by that of the odd, which is not the same <lb/>
            as the number three ? Yet such is the nature of the number <lb/>
            three, five, and the entire half of number, that though they <lb/>
            are not the same as the odd, yet each of them is always odd. <lb/>
            And again, two and four, and the whole other series of number, <lb/>
            though not the same as the even, are nevertheless each of them <lb/>
            always even: do you admit this or not ?</p>
          <p>122. " How should I not?" he replied.</p>
          <p>" Observe then," said he, "what I wish to prove. It is <lb/>
            this, that it appears, not only that these contraries do not <lb/>
            admit each other, but that even such things as are not contrary <lb/>
            to each other, and yet always possess contraries, do not appear <lb/>
            to admit that idea which is contrary to the idea that exists in <lb/>
            themselves, but, when it approaches, perish or depart. Shall <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            .we not allow that the number three would first perish, and <lb/>
            suffer any thing whatever, rather than endure, while it is still <lb/>
            three, to become even ?"</p>
          <p>" Most certainly," said Cebes.</p>
          <p>" And yet," said he, " the number two is not contrary to <lb/>
            three."</p>
          <p>" Surely not."</p>
          <p>“ Not only, then, do ideas that are contrary never allow the <lb/>
            approach of each other, but some other things also do not <lb/>
            allow the approach of contraries."</p>
          <p>" You say very truly," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ Do you wish, then," he said, " that, if we are able, we <lb/>
            should define what these things are ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Would they not then, Cebes," he said, " be such things <lb/>
            as whatever they occupy, compel that thing not only to retain <lb/>
            its own idea, but also that of something which is always a <lb/>
            contrary ?</p>
          <p>" How do you mean ?"</p>
          <p>123. " As we just now said. For you know surely, that <lb/>
            whatever things the idea of three occupies must of necessity <lb/>
            not only be three, but also odd ?"</p>
          <p>“Certainly." .</p>
          <p>" To such a thing, then, we assert, that the idea contrary to <lb/>
            that form which constitutes this can never come."</p>
          <p>" It cannot."</p>
          <p>" But did the odd make it so ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" And is the contrary to this the idea of the even ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" The idea of the even, then, will never come to the three ?"</p>
          <p>“ No surely."</p>
          <p>" Three, then, has no part in the even?"</p>
          <p>“ None whatever."</p>
          <p>" The number three is uneven ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>“ What therefore I said should be defined, namely, what <lb/>
            things they are which, though not contrary to some particular <lb/>
            thing, yet do not admit of the contrary itself, as In the present <lb/>
            instance, the number three though not contrary to the even, <lb/>
            does not any the more admit it, for it always brings the con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            trary with it, just as the number two does to the odd, fire <lb/>
            to cold, and many other particulars, consider then, whether <lb/>
            you would thus define, not only that a contrary does not <lb/>
            admit a contrary, but also that that which brings with it a <lb/>
            contrary to that to which it approaches, will never admit the <lb/>
            contrary of that which it brings with it. 124. But call it to <lb/>
            mind again, for it will not be useless to hear it often repeated. <lb/>
            Five will not admit the idea of the even, nor ten, its double, <lb/>
            that of the odd. This double then, though it is itself contrary <lb/>
            to something else°, yet will not admit the idea of the odd; nor <lb/>
            will half as much again, nor other things of the kind, such as <lb/>
            the half and the third part admit the idea of the whole, if you <lb/>
            follow me and agree with me that it is so."</p>
          <p>" I entirely agree with you," he said, " and follow you."</p>
          <p>" Tell me again, then," he said, " from the beginning; and <lb/>
            do not answer me in the terms in which I put the question, <lb/>
            but in different ones, imitating my example. For I say this <lb/>
            because, besides that safe mode of answering, which I men­ <lb/>
            tioned at first p, from what has now been said, I see another no <lb/>
            less safe one. For if you should ask me what that is, which if it <lb/>
            be in the body will cause it to be hot, I should not give you <lb/>
            that safe but unlearned answer, that it is heat, but one more <lb/>
            elegant, from what we have just now said, that it is fire : nor, <lb/>
            if you should ask me what that is, which if it be in the body, <lb/>
            will cause it to be diseased, should I say that it is disease, but <lb/>
            fever; nor, if you should ask what that is, which if it be in <lb/>
            number, will cause it to be odd, should I say that it is unevenness, <lb/>
            but unity, and so with other things. But consider whether <lb/>
            you sufficiently understand what I mean."</p>
          <p>125. " Perfectly so," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ Answer me then," he said, " what that is, which when it <lb/>
            is in the body, the body will be alive ?"</p>
          <p>" Soul," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Is not this, then, always the case ?"</p>
          <p>" How should it not be ?" said he.</p>
          <p>" Does the soul, then, always bring life to whatever it occu­ <lb/>
            pies ?” ,</p>
          <p>" It does indeed," he replied.</p>
          <p>Whether, then, is there any thing contrary to life or not ?”</p>
          <p>" There is," he replied. <note type="footnote"> o That is, to single. </note><note type="footnote">? See § 113. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note></p><pb n="114"/>
            
          <p>"What?"</p>
          <p>" Death."</p>
          <p>" The soul, then, will never admit the contrary of that which <lb/>
            it brings with it, as has been already allowed r"</p>
          <p>" Most assuredly," replied Cebes.</p>
          <p>" What then ? how do we denominate that which does not <lb/>
            admit the idea of the even ?”</p>
          <p>" Uneven," he replied.</p>
          <p>,. And that which does not admit the just, nor the musical?"</p>
          <p>“ Unmusical," he said, " and unjust."</p>
          <p>" Be it so. But what do we call that which does not admit <lb/>
            death ?"</p>
          <p>" Immortal," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Therefore does not the soul admit death ?"</p>
          <p>" No."</p>
          <p>" Is the soul, then, immortal ?"</p>
          <p>" Immortal.”</p>
          <p>" Be it so," he said. " Shall we say then, that this has been <lb/>
            now demonstrated ? or how think you ?"</p>
          <p>“ Most completely, Socrates."</p>
          <p>" What then," said he, " Cebes, if it were necessary for the <lb/>
            uneven to be imperishable, would the number three be other­ <lb/>
            wise than imperishable ?"</p>
          <p>" How should it not ?"</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, it were also necessary that what is without <lb/>
            heat should be imperishable, when any one should introduce <lb/>
            heat to snow, would not the snow withdraw itself, safe and <lb/>
            unmelted? For it would not perish; nor yet would it stay <lb/>
            and admit the heat."</p>
          <p>" You say truly," he replied.</p>
          <p>" In like manner, I think, if that which is insusceptible of <lb/>
            cold were imperishable, that when any thing cold approached <lb/>
            the fire, it would neither be extinguished nor perish, but would <lb/>
            depart quite safe."</p>
          <p>" Of necessity," he said.</p>
          <p>“ Must we not then of necessity," he continued, " speak thus <lb/>
            of that which is immortal? if that which is immortal is im­ <lb/>
            perishable, it is impossible for the soul to perish, when death <lb/>
            approaches it. For, from what has been said already, it will <lb/>
            not admit death, nor will ever be dead, just as we said that <lb/>
            three will never be even, nor again will the odd, nor will fire <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            be cold, nor yet the heat that is in fire. 127. But some one may <lb/>
            say, what hinders, though the odd can never become even by <lb/>
            the approach of the even, as we have allowed, yet, when the <lb/>
            odd is destroyed, that the even should succeed in its place ? We <lb/>
            could not contend with him who should make this objection, <lb/>
            -that it is not destroyed; for the uneven is not imperishable; <lb/>
            since, if this were granted us, we might easily have contended, <lb/>
            that on the approach of the even the odd and the three depart; <lb/>
            and we might have contended in the same way with respect to <lb/>
            fire, heat, and the rest; might we not?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>Wherefore, with respect to the immortal, if we have <lb/>
            allowed that it is imperishable, the soul, in addition to its <lb/>
            being immortal, must also be imperishable; if not, there will <lb/>
            be need of other arguments."</p>
          <p>" But there is no need," he said, " as far as that is concerned; <lb/>
            for scarcely could any thing not admit of corruption, if that <lb/>
            which is immortal and eternal is liable to it."</p>
          <p>128. " The deity, indeed, I think," said Socrates, " and the <lb/>
            idea itself of life, and if any thing else is immortal, must be <lb/>
            allowed by all beings to be incapable of dissolution."</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," he replied, by all men indeed, and still more, <lb/>
            as I think, by the gods."</p>
          <p>" Since, then, that which is immortal is also incorruptible, <lb/>
            can the soul, since it is immortal, be any thing else than im­ <lb/>
            perishable ?"</p>
          <p>" It must of necessity be so."</p>
          <p>“ When, therefore, death approaches a man, the mortal part <lb/>
            of him, as it appears, dies, but the immortal part departs safe <lb/>
            and uncorrupted, having withdrawn itself from death ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p>
          <p>“ The soul, therefore," he said, " Cebes, is most certainly <lb/>
            immortal and imperishable, and our souls will really exist in <lb/>
            Hades.”</p>
          <p>" Therefore, Socrates," he said, " I have nothing further to <lb/>
            say against this, nor any reason for doubting your arguments. <lb/>
            But if Simmias here or any one else has any thing to say, it <lb/>
            were well for him not to be silent: for I know not to what <lb/>
            other opportunity beyond the present any one can defer it, who <lb/>
            wishes either to speak or hear about these things."</p>
          <p>129. " But indeed," said Simmias, " neither have I any <lb/>
            reason to doubt what has been urged; yet from the magni­ <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            tude of the subject discussed, and from my low opinion of <lb/>
            human weakness, I am compelled still to retain a doubt within <lb/>
            myself with respect to what has been said."</p>
          <p>" Not only so, Simmias," said Socrates, " but you say this <lb/>
            well, and moreover the first hypotheses, even though they are <lb/>
            credible to you, should nevertheless be examined more care­ <lb/>
            fully; and if you should investigate them sufficiently, I think <lb/>
            you will follow my reasoning as far as it is possible for man <lb/>
            to do so; and if this very point becomes clear, you will enquire <lb/>
            no further."</p>
          <p>" You speak truly," he said.</p>
          <p>" But it Is right, my friends," he said, " that we should con­ <lb/>
            sider this, that if the soul is immortal, it requires our care not <lb/>
            only for the present time, which we call life, but for all time; <lb/>
            and the danger would now appear to be dreadful, if one should <lb/>
            neglect it. '130. For if death were a deliverance from every <lb/>
            thing, it would be a great gain for the wicked, when they die, <lb/>
            to be delivered at the same time from the body, and from their <lb/>
            vices together with the soul: but now, since it appears to be <lb/>
            immortal, it can have no other refuge from evils, nor safety, <lb/>
            except by becoming as good and wise as possible. For the <lb/>
            soul goes to Hades, possessing nothing else but its discipline <lb/>
            and education, which are said to be of the greatest advantage <lb/>
            . or detriment to the dead, on the very beginning of his journey <lb/>
            thither. For thus it is said; that each person's demon who <lb/>
            was assigned to him while living, when he dies conducts him <lb/>
            to some place, where they that are assembled together must <lb/>
            receive sentence and then proceed to Hades with that guide, <lb/>
            .who has been ordered to conduct them from hence thither. <lb/>
            But there having received their deserts, and having remained <lb/>
            the appointed time, another guide brings them back hither <lb/>
            again, after many and long revolutions of time. The journey, <lb/>
            then, is not such as the Telephus of iEschylus describes it. <lb/>
            For he says that a simple path leads to Hades; but it appears <lb/>
            to me to be neither simple'nor one': for there would be no <lb/>
            need of guides, nor could any one ever miss the way, if there <lb/>
            were but one. But now it appears to have many divisions <lb/>
            and windings; and this :I conjecture from our religious and <lb/>
            .funeral rites q. 131. The well-ordered and wise soul, then, <note type="footnote">q It is difficult to express the distinction between <foreign xml:lang="grc">δσια</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιμα</foreign>, the <lb/>

            both follows, and is not ignorant of its present condition; but <lb/>
            that which through passion clings to the body, as I said before, <lb/>
            having longingly fluttered about it for a long time, and about <lb/>
            its visible placer, after vehement resistance and great suffering, <lb/>
            is forcibly and with great difficulty led away by its appointed <lb/>
            demon. And when it arrives at the place where the others <lb/>
            are, impure and having done any such thing as the committal <lb/>
            of unrighteous murders or other similar actions, which are <lb/>
            kindred to these, and are the deeds of kindred souls, every <lb/>
            one shuns it and turns away from it, and will neither be its <lb/>
            fellow-traveller or guide, but it wanders about,' oppressed <lb/>
            with every kind of helplessness until certain periods have <lb/>
            elapsed: and when these are completed, it is carried of <lb/>
            necessity to an abode suitable to it; but the soul which has <lb/>
            passed through life with purity and moderation, having ob­ <lb/>
            tained the gods for its fellow-travellers and guides, settles <lb/>
            each in the place suited to it. 132. There are indeed many <lb/>
            and wonderful places in the earth, and it is itself neither of <lb/>
            such a kind, nor of such a magnitude, as is supposed by those <lb/>
            who are accustomed to speak of the earth, as I have been per­ <lb/>
            suaded by a certain person."</p>
          <p>Whereupon Simmias said, " How mean you, Socrates? For <lb/>
            I too have heard many things about the earth, not however <lb/>
            those things which have obtained your belief: I would there-, <lb/>
            fore gladly hear them."</p>
          <p>"Indeed, Simmias, the art of Glaucuss does not seem to <lb/>
            me to be required to relate what these things are; that they <lb/>
            are true however, appears to me more than the art of Glaucus <lb/>
            can prove, and besides, I should probably not be able to do it, <lb/>
            and even if I did know how, what remains to me of life, <lb/>
            Simmias, seems insufficient for the length of the subject. <lb/>
            However, the form of the earth, such as I am persuaded it <lb/>
            is, and the different places in it, nothing hinders me from <lb/>
            telling."</p>
          <p>" But that will be enough," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>"I am persuaded, then," said he, " in the first place, that, <lb/>
            if the earth is in the middle of the heavens, and is of a spherical <lb/>
            form, it has no need of air, nor of any other similar force, to <lb/>
            prevent it from falling, but that the similarity of the heavens <note type="footnote"> r Its place of interment. </note><note type="footnote"> s A proverb meaning " a matter of great difficulty." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            to themselves on every side, and the equilibrium of the earth <lb/>
            itself, are sufficient to support it; for a thing in a state of <lb/>
            equilibrium when placed in the middle of something that <lb/>
            presses it equally on all sides cannot incline more or less on <lb/>
            any side, but being equally affected all around remains un­ <lb/>
            moved. 133. In the first place then," he said, " I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded of this."</p>
          <p>" And very properly so," said Simmias.</p>
          <p>" Yet further," said he, " that it is very large, and that we <lb/>
            who inhabit some small portion of it, from the river Phasis to <lb/>
            the pillars of Hercules, dwell about the sea, like ants or frogs <lb/>
            about a marsh, and that many others elsewhere dwell in many <lb/>
            similar places, for that there are every where about the earth <lb/>
            many hollows of various forms and sizes into which there is a <lb/>
            confluence of water, mist, and air; but that the earth itself, <lb/>
            being pure, is situated in the pure heavens, in which are the <lb/>
            stars, and which most persons who are accustomed to speak <lb/>
            about such things call ether; of which these things are the <lb/>
            sediment and are continually flowing into the hollow parts of <lb/>
            the earth. 134. That we are ignorant, then, that we are dwell­ <lb/>
            ing in its hollows, and imagine that we inhabit the upper parts <lb/>
            of the earth, just as if any one dwelling in the bottom of the <lb/>
            sea, should think that he dwelt on the sea, and, beholding the <lb/>
            sun and the other stars through the water, should imagine that <lb/>
            the sea was the Heavens, but through sloth and weakness should <lb/>
            never have reached the surface of the sea, nor, having emerged <lb/>
            and risen up from the sea to this region, have seen how much <lb/>
            more pure and more beautiful it is than the place where he is, <lb/>
            nor has heard of it from any one else who has seen it. This <lb/>
            then is the very condition in which we are; for, dwelling in <lb/>
            some hollow of the earth, we think that we dwell on the sur­ <lb/>
            face of it, and call the air heaven, as if the stars moved through <lb/>
            this, being heaven itself. But this is because by reason of our <lb/>
            weakness and sloth, we are unable to reach to the summit of <lb/>
            the air. Since, if any one could arrive at its summit, or, be­ <lb/>
            coming winged, could fly up thither, or emerging from hence, <lb/>
            he would see,-just as with us, fishes emerging from the sea, <lb/>
            behold what is here,-so any one would behold the things there, <lb/>
            and if his nature were able to endure the contemplation, he <lb/>
            would know that that is the true heaven, and the true light, <lb/>
            and the true earth. 135. For this earth and these stones, and <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            the whole region here, are decayed and corroded, as things <lb/>
            in the sea by the saltness; for nothing of any value grows in <lb/>
            the sea, nor, in a word, does it contain any thing perfect, but. <lb/>
            there are caverns and sand, and mud in abundance, and filth, <lb/>
            in whatever parts of the sea there is earth, nor are they at <lb/>
            all worthy to be compared with the beautiful things with us. <lb/>
            But on the other hand, those things in the upper regions of <lb/>
            the earth would appear far more to excel the things with us. <lb/>
            For, if we may tell a beautiful fable, it is well worth hearing, <lb/>
            Simmias, what kind the things are on the earth beneath the <lb/>
            heavens."</p>
          <p>" Indeed, Socrates," said Simmias, " we should be very glad <lb/>
            to hear that fable."</p>
          <p>136. " First of all then, my friend," he continued, " this <lb/>
            earth, if any one should survey it from above, is said to have <lb/>
            the appearance of balls covered with twelve different pieces of <lb/>
            leather, variegated and distinguished with colours, of which <lb/>
            the colours found here, and which painters use, are as it were <lb/>
            copies. But there the whole earth is composed of such, and <lb/>
            far more brilliant and pure than these; for one part of it is <lb/>
            purple, and of wonderful beauty, part of a golden colour, and <lb/>
            part of white, more white than chalk or snow, and in like man­ <lb/>
            ner composed of other colours, and those more in number and <lb/>
            more beautiful than any we have ever beheld. And those very <lb/>
            hollow parts of the earth, though filled with water and air, ex­ <lb/>
            hibit a certain species of colour, shining among the variety of <lb/>
            other colours, so that one continually variegated aspect pre­ <lb/>
            sents itself to the view. In this earth, being such, all things <lb/>
            that grow, grow in a manner proportioned to its nature, trees, <lb/>
            flowers, and fruits; and again, in like manner, its mountains <lb/>
            and stones possess, in the same proportion, smoothness and <lb/>
            transparency, and more beautiful colours; of which the well- <lb/>
            known stones here that are so highly prized are but fragments, <lb/>
            such as sardin-stones, jaspers, and emeralds, and all of that <lb/>
            kind. But there, there is nothing subsists that is not of this <lb/>
            character, and even more beautiful than these. 137. But the <lb/>
            reason of this is, because the stones there are pure, and not <lb/>
            eaten up and decayed, like those here, by rottenness and salt­ <lb/>
            ness, which flow down hither together, and which produce <lb/>
            deformity and disease in the stones and the earth, and in other <lb/>
            things, even animals and plants. But that earth is adorned <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            with all these, and moreover with gold and silver, and other <lb/>
            things of the kind: for they are naturally conspicuous, being <lb/>
            numerous and large, and in all parts of the earth; so that to <lb/>
            behold it is a sight for the blessed. There are also many other <lb/>
            animals and men upon it, some dwelling in mid-earth, others <lb/>
            about the air, as we do about the sea, and others in islands <lb/>
            which the air flows round, and which are near the continent: <lb/>
            and in one word, what water and the sea are to us, for our <lb/>
            necessities, the air is to them; and what air is to us, that ether <lb/>
            is to them. 138. But their seasons are of such a temperament <lb/>
            that they are free from disease, and live for a much longer <lb/>
            time than those here, and surpass us in sight, hearing, and <lb/>
            smelling, and every thing of this kind, as much as air excels <lb/>
            water, and ether air, in purity. Moreover, they have abodes <lb/>
            and temples of the gods, in which gods really dwell, and voices <lb/>
            and oracles, and sensible visions of the gods, and such-like in­ <lb/>
            tercourse with them; the sun too, and moon, and stars, are <lb/>
            seen by them such as they really are, and their felicity in other <lb/>
            respects is correspondent with these things.</p>
          <p>.. And such indeed is the nature of the whole earth, and the <lb/>
            parts about the earth; but there are many places all round <lb/>
            it throughout its cavities, some deeper and more open than <lb/>
            that in which we dwell: but others that are deeper, have a <lb/>
            less chasm than our region, and others are shallower in depth <lb/>
            than it is here and broader. 139. But all these are in many <lb/>
            places perforated one into another under the earth, some with <lb/>
            narrower and some with wider channels, and have passages <lb/>
            through, by which a great quantity of water flows from one <lb/>
            into another, as into basins, and there are immense bulks of <lb/>
            ever-flowing rivers under the earth, both of hot and cold water, <lb/>
            and a great quantity of fire, and mighty rivers of fire, and <lb/>
            many of liquid mire, some purer, and some more miry, as in <lb/>
            Sicily there are rivers of mud that flow before the lava, and <lb/>
            the lava itself, and from these the several places are filled, ac­ <lb/>
            cording as the overflow from time to time happens to come to <lb/>
            each of them. But all these move up and down as it were by <lb/>
            a certain oscillation existing in the earth. And this oscillation <lb/>
            proceeds from such natural cause as this: one of the chasms <lb/>
            of the earth is exceedingly large, and perforated through the <lb/>
            entire earth, and is that which Homer speaks of, ' very far <note type="footnote"> t Iliad, lib. viii. v. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            off, where is the most profound abyss beneath the earth: <lb/>
            which elsewhere both he and many other poets have called <lb/>
            Tartarus. For into this chasm all rivers flow together, and <lb/>
            from it flow out again : but they severally derive their charac. <lb/>
            ter from the earth through which they flow. 140. And the <lb/>
            reason why all streams flow out from thence, and flow into it, is <lb/>
            because this liquid has neither bottom nor base. Therefore it <lb/>
            oscillates and fluctuates up and down, and the air and the wind <lb/>
            around it do the same; for they accompany it both when it <lb/>
            rushes to those parts of the earth, and when to these. And as <lb/>
            in respiration the flowing breath is continually breathed out <lb/>
            and drawn in, so there the wind oscillating with the liquid, <lb/>
            causes certain vehement and irresistible winds both as it en­ <lb/>
            ters and goes out. When, therefore, the water rushing in de­ <lb/>
            scends to the place which we call the lower region, it flows <lb/>
            through the earth into the streams there and fills them, just as <lb/>
            men pump up water. But when again it leaves those regions <lb/>
            and rushes hither, it again fills the rivers here, and these, when <lb/>
            filled, flow through channels and through the earth, and having <lb/>
            severally reached the several places to which they are journey­ <lb/>
            ing, they make seas, lakes, rivers, and fountains. 141. Then <lb/>
            sinking again from thence beneath the earth, some of them <lb/>
            having gone round longer and more numerous places, and <lb/>
            others round fewer and shorter, they again discharge them­ <lb/>
            selves into Tartarus, some much lower than they were drawn <lb/>
            up, others only a little so, but all of them flow in again beneath <lb/>
            the point at which they flowed out. And some issue out di­ <lb/>
            rectly opposite the place by which they flow in, others on the <lb/>
            same side: there are also some which having gone round alto­ <lb/>
            gether in a circle, folding themselves once or several times <lb/>
            round the earth, like serpents, when they had descended as low <lb/>
            as possible, discharge themselves again : and it is possible for <lb/>
            them to descend on either side as far as the middle, but not be­ <lb/>
            yond ; for in each direction there is an acclivity to the streams <lb/>
            both ways.</p>
          <p>" Now there are many other large and various streams, but <lb/>
            among this great number there are four certain streams, of <lb/>
            which the largest, and that which flows most outwardly round <lb/>
            the earth, is called Ocean, but directly opposite this, and flow­ <lb/>
            ing in a contrary direction, is Acheron, which flows through <lb/>
            other desert places, and moreover passing under the earth, <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            reaches the Acherusian lake, where the souls of most who die <lb/>
            arrive, and having remained there for certain destined periods, <lb/>
            some longer and some shorter, are again sent forth into the <lb/>
            generations of animals. 142. A third river issues midway <lb/>
            between these, and near its source falls into a vast region, <lb/>
            burning with abundance of fire, and forms a lake larger than <lb/>
            our sea, boiling with water and mud; from hence it proceeds <lb/>
            in a circle, turbulent and muddy, and folding itself round it <lb/>
            reaches both other places and the extremity of the Acherusian <lb/>
            lake, but does not mingle with its water; but folding itself <lb/>
            oftentimes beneath the earth, it discharges itself into the lower <lb/>
            parts of Tartarus. And this is the river which they call Pyri­ <lb/>
            phlegethon, whose burning streams emit dissevered fragments <lb/>
            in whatever part of the earth they happen to be. Opposite to <lb/>
            this again the fourth river first falls into a place dreadful and <lb/>
            savage, as it is said, having its whole colour like cyanusu: <lb/>
            this they call Stygian, and the lake, which the river forms by <lb/>
            its discharge, Styx. This river having fallen in here, and re­ <lb/>
            ceived awful power in the water, sinking beneath the earth, <lb/>
            proceeds, folding itself round, in an opposite course to Pyri­ <lb/>
            phlegethon, and meets it in the Acherusian lake from a con­ <lb/>
            trary direction. Neither does the water of this river mingle <lb/>
            with any other, but it too, having gone round in a circle, dis­ <lb/>
            charges itself into Tartarus, opposite to Pyriphlegethon. Its <lb/>
            name, as the poets say, is Cocytus.</p>
          <p>143. "These things being thus constituted, when the dead <lb/>
            arrive at the place to which their demon leads them severally, <lb/>
            first of all they are judged, as well those who have lived well <lb/>
            and piously, as those who have not. And those who appear <lb/>
            to have passed a middle kind of life, proceeding to Acheron, <lb/>
            and embarking in the vessels they have, on these arrive at the <lb/>
            lake, and there dwell, and when they are purified, and have <lb/>
            suffered punishment for the iniquities they may have commit­ <lb/>
            ted, they are set free, and each receives the reward of his good <lb/>
            deeds, according to his deserts: but those who appear to be <lb/>
            incurable, through the magnitude of their offences, either from <lb/>
            having committed many and great sacrileges, or many unjust <lb/>
            and lawless murders, or other similar crimes, these a suitable <lb/>
            destiny hurls into Tartarus, whence they never come forth. <note type="footnote">u A metallic substance of a deep blue colour, frequently mentioned by <lb/>
            the earliest Grecian writers, but of which the nature is unknown. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            144. But those who appear to have been guilty of curable, <lb/>
            yet great offences, such as those who through anger have <lb/>
            committed any violence against father'or mother, and have <lb/>
            lived the remainder of their life in a state of penitence, or they <lb/>
            who have become homicides in a similar manner, these must of <lb/>
            necessity fall into Tartarus, but after they have fallen, and <lb/>
            have been there for a year, the wave casts them forth, the <lb/>
            homicides Into Cocytus, but the parricides and matricides into <lb/>
            Pyriphlegethon: but when, being borne along, they arrive at <lb/>
            the Acherusian lake, there they cry out to and invoke, some <lb/>
            those whom they slew, others those whom they injured, and in­ <lb/>
            voking them, they entreat and implore them to suffer them to <lb/>
            go out into the lake, and to receive them, and if they persuade <lb/>
            them, they go out, and are freed from their sufferings, but if <lb/>
            not, they are borne back to Tartarus, and thence again to the <lb/>
            rivers, and they do not cease from suffering this until they <lb/>
            have persuaded those whom they have injured, for this sen­ <lb/>
            tence was imposed on them by the judges. 145. But those <lb/>
            who are found to have lived an eminently holy life, these <lb/>
            are they, who, being freed and set at large from these re­ <lb/>
            gions in the earth, as from a prison, arrive at the pure abode <lb/>
            above, and dwell on the upper parts of the earth. And among <lb/>
            these, they who have sufficiently purified themselves by phi­ <lb/>
            losophy shall live without bodies, throughout all future time, <lb/>
            and shall arrive at habitations yet more beautiful than these, <lb/>
            which it is neither easy to describe, nor at present is there suf­ <lb/>
            ficient time for the purpose.</p>
          <p>" But for the sake of these things which we have described, <lb/>
            we should use every endeavour, Simmias, so as to acquire vir­ <lb/>
            tue and wisdom in this life; for the reward is noble, and the <lb/>
            hope great.</p>
          <p>" To affirm positively, indeed, that these things are exactly <lb/>
            as I have described them, does not become a man of sense; <lb/>
            that however either this, or something of the kind, takes place <lb/>
            with respect to our souls and their habitations-since our soul <lb/>
            is certainly immortal—this appears to me most fitting to be <lb/>
            believed, and worthy the hazard for one who trusts in its <lb/>
            reality; for the hazard is noble, and it is right to allure our­ <lb/>
            selves with such things, as with enchantments; for which rea­ <lb/>
            son I have prolonged my story to such a length. 146. On <lb/>
            account of these things, then, ? man ought to be confident <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            about his soul, who during this life has disregarded all the plea­ <lb/>
            sures and ornaments of the body as foreign from his nature, <lb/>
            and who, having thought that they do more harm than good, <lb/>
            has zealously applied himself to the acquirement of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and who having adorned his soul not with a foreign but <lb/>
            its own proper ornament, temperance, justice, fortitude, free­ <lb/>
            dom, and truth, thus waits for his passage to Hades, as one <lb/>
            who is ready to depart whenever destiny shall summon him. <lb/>
            You then," he continued, " Simmias and Cebes, and the rest, <lb/>
            will each of you depart at some future time; but now destiny <lb/>
            summons me, as a tragic writer would say, and it is nearly <lb/>
            time for me to betake myself to the bath; for it appears to <lb/>
            me to be better to drink the poison after I have bathed my­ <lb/>
            self, and not to trouble the women with washing my dead <lb/>
            body."</p>
          <p>147. When he had thus spoken, Crito said, , So be it, <lb/>
            Socrates, but what commands have you to give to these or to <lb/>
            me, either respecting your children, or any other matter, in <lb/>
            attending to which we can most oblige you ?”</p>
          <p>“ What I always say, Crito," he replied, " nothing new; <lb/>
            that by taking care of yourselves you will oblige both me and <lb/>
            mine, and yourselves, whatever you do, though you should not <lb/>
            now promise it; but if you neglect yourselves, and will not <lb/>
            live as it were in the footsteps of what has been now and for­ <lb/>
            merly said, even though you should promise much at present, <lb/>
            and that earnestly, you will do no good at all."</p>
          <p>" We will endeavour then so to do," he said; " but how <lb/>
            shall we bury you ?"</p>
          <p>" Just as you please," he said, " If only you can catch me, <lb/>
            and I do not escape from you." 148. And at the same time <lb/>
            smiling gently, and looking round on us, he said; " I cannot <lb/>
            persuade Crito, my friends, that I am that Socrates who is <lb/>
            now conversing with you, and who methodizes each part of <lb/>
            the discourse ; but he thinks that I am he whom he will shortly <lb/>
            behold dead, and asks how he should bury me. But that which <lb/>
            I some time since argued at length, that when I have drunk <lb/>
            the poison I shall no longer remain with you, but shall depart <lb/>
            to some happy state of the blessed, this I seem to have urged <lb/>
            to him in vain, though I meant at the same time to console <lb/>
            both you and myself. Be ye then my sureties to Crito," he <lb/>
            said, " in an obligation contrary to that which he made to the <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            judges; for he undertook that I should remain; but do you <lb/>
            be sureties that, when I die, I shall not remain, but shall de­ <lb/>
            part, that Onto may more easily bear it, and when he sees my <lb/>
            body either burnt or buried, may not be afflicted for me, as if <lb/>
            I suffered some dreadful thing, nor say at my interment that <lb/>
            Socrates is laid out, or is carried out, or is buried. 149. For <lb/>
            be well assured," he said, " most excellent Crito, that to speak <lb/>
            improperly is not- only culpable as to the thing itself, but like­ <lb/>
            wise occasions some injury to our souls. You must have a <lb/>
            good courage then, and say that you bury my body, and bury <lb/>
            it in such a manner as is pleasing to you, and as you think is <lb/>
            most agreeable to our laws."</p>
          <p>When he had said thus he rose, and went into a chamber to <lb/>
            bathe, and Crito followed him, but he directed us to wait for <lb/>
            him. We waited, therefore, conversing among ourselves about <lb/>
            what had been said, and considering it again, and sometimes <lb/>
            speaking about our calamity, how severe it would be to us, <lb/>
            sincerely thinking that, like those who are deprived of a father, <lb/>
            we should pass the rest of our life as orphans: When he had <lb/>
            bathed, and his children were brought to him, for he had two <lb/>
            little sons and one grown up, and the women belonging to his <lb/>
            family were come, having conversed with them in the presence <lb/>
            of Crito, and given them such injunctions as he wished, he <lb/>
            directed the women and children to go away, and then returned <lb/>
            to us. And it was now near sun-set; for he spent a consider­ <lb/>
            . able time within. 150. But when he came from bathing he <lb/>
            sat down, and did not speak much afterwards; then the officer <lb/>
            of the Eleven came in, and standing near him, said, " Socrates, <lb/>
            I shall not have to find that fault with you that I do with <lb/>
            others, that they are angry with me, and curse me, when, by <lb/>
            order of the archons, I bid them drink the poison. But you, <lb/>
            on all other occasions during the time you have been here, I <lb/>
            have found to be the most noble, meek, and excellent man of <lb/>
            all that ever came into this place: and, therefore, I am now <lb/>
            well convinced that you will not be angry with me, for you <lb/>
            know who are to blame, but with them. Now, then, for you <lb/>
            know what I came to announce to you, farewell, and endeavour <lb/>
            to bear what is inevitable as easily as possible." And at the <lb/>
            same time, bursting into tears, he turned away and withdrew.</p>
          <p>151. And Socrates, looking after him, said, " And thou, too, <lb/>
            farewell, we will do as you direct." At the same time turning <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            to us, he said, " How courteous the man is; during the whole <lb/>
            time I have been here he has visited me, and conversed with <lb/>
            me sometimes, and proved the worthiest of men; and now how <lb/>
            generously he weeps for me. But come, Crito, let us obey <lb/>
            him, and let some one bring the poison, if it is ready pounded, <lb/>
            but if not, let the man pound it."</p>
          <p>Then Crito said, "But I think, Socrates, that the sun is <lb/>
            still on the mountains, and has not yet set. Besides, I know <lb/>
            that others have drunk the poison very late, after it had been <lb/>
            announced to them, and have supped and drunk freely, and <lb/>
            some even have enjoyed the objects of their love. Do not <lb/>
            hasten then, for there is yet time."</p>
          <p>Upon this Socrates replied, " These men whom you mention, <lb/>
            Crito, do these things with good reason, for they think they <lb/>
            shall gain by so doing, and I too with good reason shall not <lb/>
            do so; for I think I shall gain nothing by drinking a little <lb/>
            later, except to become ridiculous to myself, in being so fond <lb/>
            of life, and sparing of it when none any longer remains. Go <lb/>
            then," he said, " obey, and do not resist."</p>
          <p>152. Crito having heard this, nodded to the boy that stood <lb/>
            near. And the boy having gone out, and staid for some time, <lb/>
            came, bringing with him the man that was to administer the <lb/>
            poison, who brought it ready pounded in a cup. And Socrates, <lb/>
            on seeing the man, said, " Well, my good friend, as you are <lb/>
            . skilled in these matters, what must I do ?"</p>
          <p>" Nothing else," he replied, .. than when you have drunk <lb/>
            it walk about, until there is a heaviness in your legs, then lie <lb/>
            down; thus it will do its purpose." And at the same time <lb/>
            he held out the cup to Socrates. And he having received it <lb/>
            very cheerfully, Echecrates, neither trembling, nor changing <lb/>
            at all in colour or countenance, but, as he was wont, looking <lb/>
            stedfastly at the mail, said, " What say you of this potion, <lb/>
            with respect to making a libation to any one, is it lawful or <lb/>
            not ?"</p>
          <p>" We only pound so much, Socrates," he said, " as we think <lb/>
            sufficient to drink."</p>
          <p>If I understand you," he said, " but it is certainly both law­ <lb/>
            ful and right to pray to the gods, that my departure hence <lb/>
            thither may be happy; which therefore I pray, and so may it <lb/>
            he." And as he said this he drank it off readily and calmly. <lb/>
            Thus far, most of us were with difficulty able to restrain our­ <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            selves from weeping, but when we saw him drinking, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing finished the draught, we could do so no longer; but in <lb/>
            spite of myself the tears came in full torrent, so that, covering <lb/>
            my face, I wept for myself, for I did not weep for him, but for <lb/>
            my own fortune, in being-deprived of such a friend. But Crito, <lb/>
            even before me, when he could not restrain his tears, had risen <lb/>
            up. 154. But Apollodorus even before this had not ceased <lb/>
            weeping, and then bursting into an agony of grief, weeping <lb/>
            and lamenting, he pierced the heart of every one present, ex­ <lb/>
            cept Socrates himself. But he said, " What are you doing, <lb/>
            my admirable friends ? I indeed, for this reason chiefly, sent <lb/>
            away the women, that they might not commit any folly of this <lb/>
            kind. For I have heard that it is right to die with good omens. <lb/>
            Be quiet, therefore, and bear up."</p>
          <p>When we heard this we were ashamed, and restrained our <lb/>
            tears. But he, having walked about, when he said that his <lb/>
            legs were growing heavy, laid down on his back; for the man <lb/>
            so directed him. And at the same time he who gave him the <lb/>
            poison, taking hold of him, after a short interval examined his <lb/>
            feet and legs; and then having pressed his foot hard, he asked <lb/>
            if he felt it: he said that he did not. And after this he pressed <lb/>
            his thighs; and thus going higher, he shewed us that he was <lb/>
            growing cold and stiff. Then Socrates touched himself, and <lb/>
            said, that when the poison reached his heart he should then <lb/>
            depart. 155. But now the parts around the lower belly were <lb/>
            almost cold; when uncovering himself, for he had been covered <lb/>
            over, he said, and they were his last words, " Crito, we owe <lb/>
            a cock to Æsculapius; pay it, therefore, and do not neglect <lb/>
            it."</p>
          <p>" It shall be done," said Crito, " but consider whether you <lb/>
            have any thing else to say."</p>
          <p>To this question he gave no reply; but shortly after he gave <lb/>
            a convulsive movement, and the man covered him, and his eyes <lb/>
            were fixed; and Crito, perceiving it, closed his mouth and <lb/>
            eyes.</p>
          <p>This, Echecrates, was the end of our friend, a man, as we <lb/>
            may say, the best of all of his time that we have known, and <lb/>
            moreover, the most wise and just.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE GORGIAS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>CALLICLES and Polus, two friends of Gorgias, the famous <lb/>
            orator of Leontium in Sicily, happening to meet with Socrates <lb/>
            and Chærephon, tell the former that he has sustained a great <lb/>
            loss in not having been just now present when Gorgias was <lb/>
            exhibiting his art. Chærephon admits that the fault is his, <lb/>
            but adds that as Gorgias is his friend he can easily persuade <lb/>
            him to exhibit to them either then, or at a future time. They <lb/>
            accordingly, all four, adjourn to the house of Callicles, where <lb/>
            Gorgias is staying. When arrived there, Chærephon, at the <lb/>
            suggestion of Socrates, proposes to question Gorgias as to the <lb/>
            art he professes ; but Polus, his pupil, somewhat impertinently <lb/>
            offers to answer for him, on the ground that Gorgias is fatigued. <lb/>
            Chærephon therefore asks, what is the art in which Gorgias <lb/>
            is skilled, and what he ought to be called ? To which Polus <lb/>
            answers, " the finest of the arts." Socrates, not satisfied with <lb/>
            this, as being no answer at all, begs Gorgias himself to answer. <lb/>
            He says, that rhetoric is the art he professes, and that he is a <lb/>
            rhetorician, and able to make others rhetoriciansa.</p>
          <p>Socrates, having got Gorgias to promise that he would answer <lb/>
            briefly, proceeds to ask him about what rhetoric is employed, <lb/>
            and of what it is the science. Gorgias says, " of words," but <lb/>
            Socrates shews, that other arts, in various degrees, make use <lb/>
            of words, and that some, such as arithmetic and geometry, are <lb/>
            altogether conversant with words; he therefore requests him <lb/>
            to distinguish between these arts and rhetoric, and to explain <lb/>
            about what particular thing these words are employed. Gor­ <lb/>
            gias confidently answers, about " the greatest of all human <lb/>
            concerns and the best." But'the physician, the teacher of <lb/>
            gymnastics, the money-getter, in short all men, would say that <lb/>
            the end which their own art aims at is the best; what then is <note type="footnote">a § 1—7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            this good which you say is the greatest good to men ? Gorgias <lb/>
            answers, that it is the power of persuading by words. But <lb/>
            Socrates objects that other arts do the same, for that every one <lb/>
            who teaches any thing persuades what he teaches; you must <lb/>
            therefore say of what kind of persuasion, and on what subject <lb/>
            rhetoric is the art. It is that which is produced in courts of <lb/>
            justice, and other public assemblies, and relates to matters that <lb/>
            are just and unjust. But here again Socrates makes Gorgias <lb/>
            admit, that there are two kinds of persuasion, one that pro­ <lb/>
            duces belief without knowledge, the other that produces know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; which of these two then does rhetoric produce ? doubt­ <lb/>
            less the • former. But supposing the question is about the <lb/>
            choice of physicians or shipwrights, or the building of walls, or <lb/>
            the construction of ports or docks, will a rhetorician be con­ <lb/>
            sulted, or a person skilled in these several matters ? Here <lb/>
            Gorgias answers that on these and all other subjects a rhe­ <lb/>
            torician will speak more persuasively than any other artist <lb/>
            whatever: but it is his duty to use his art justly; though if <lb/>
            he uses it unjustly, he and not his teacher is to blarney</p>
          <p>Socrates, here, perceiving an inconsistency in Gorgias' state­ <lb/>
            ment, after deprecating his being offended at the course the dis­ <lb/>
            cussion might take, asks whether by saying that a rhetorician <lb/>
            can speak more persuasively to the multitude on any art, than <lb/>
            a person skilled in that art, he does not mean the ignorant by <lb/>
            the multitude; and, that being admitted, whether it does not <lb/>
            follow that one who is ignorant will be more capable of per­ <lb/>
            suading the ignorant, than one who possesses knowledge ? Gor­ <lb/>
            gias allows this to be the case. Is the case, then, the same <lb/>
            with respect to what is just and unjust, base and honourable, <lb/>
            good and evil ? Can a rhetorician persuade the multitude on <lb/>
            these, subjects, himself being ignorant of them, or must he <lb/>
            know them before he learns rhetoric, or will the teacher of <lb/>
            rhetoric instruct him in these ? Gorgias professes that if a <lb/>
            pupil does not know these things he would learn them from <note type="footnote"> b § 8—28. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            him. But surely he who has learnt carpentering is a car­ <lb/>
            penter, music a musician, medicine a physician; does it not <lb/>
            follow then, that he who has learnt justice, must be just, and <lb/>
            wish to do just actions ? Gorgias admits this too : and yet he <lb/>
            had just now allowed that a rhetorician might make an unjust <lb/>
            use of his art, and said, that in that case, the teacher ought not <lb/>
            to be blamed, but the person who acts unjustly ought to be <lb/>
            punishedc.</p>
          <p>At this point Polus takes up the discussion, and having <lb/>
            elected to ask questions, instead of answering them, begins by <lb/>
            asking Socrates what kind of art he considers rhetoric to be. <lb/>
            Socrates answers that he does not think it is any art at all, but a <lb/>
            kind of skill, employed for procuring gratification and pleasure : <lb/>
            in other words, a species of flattery, of which there are many <lb/>
            divisions. Polus asks what division it is. " Rhetoric, in my <lb/>
            opinion," says Socrates, " is a semblance of a division of the <lb/>
            political art," and as such is base. This answer, however, is <lb/>
            not intelligible either to Gorgias or Polus ; at the request of the <lb/>
            former, therefore, Socrates explains himself more clearly d.</p>
          <p>As there are two kinds of subject matter, he says, namely, <lb/>
            soul and body, so there are two arts, that which relates to the <lb/>
            soul is political; the other, relating to the body, he is not able <lb/>
            to describe by one name, but there are two divisions of it, <lb/>
            gymnastics and medicine. In the political art legislation cor­ <lb/>
            responds to gymnastics, and the judicial art to medicine. But <lb/>
            flattery, perceiving that these four take the best possible care <lb/>
            of the soul and body respectively, has divided itself fourfold, <lb/>
            and feigns itself to be what it pretends, not really caring for <lb/>
            what is best, but seducing ignorance by means of pleasure. <lb/>
            Thus cookery puts on the garb of medicine, and pretends that <lb/>
            it knows the aliment best for the body; and again, personal <lb/>
            decoration feigns itself to be gymnastics. Then, he adds, what <lb/>
            personal decoration is to gymnastics, that is sophistry to legis­ <lb/>
            lation, and what cookery is to medicine, that is rhetoric to jus­ <note type="footnote"> c § 29—37. </note><note type="footnote">d § 38—43. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            tice; and so being proximate to each other, sophists and rhe­ <lb/>
            toricians are confounded with legislators and judgese.</p>
          <p>Are good rhetoricians, then, asks Polus, to be esteemed as <lb/>
            vile flatterers in cities ? Socrates replies that they appear to <lb/>
            him to be of no estimation at all. But have they not the <lb/>
            -greatest power in cities ? Not, if to have power is a good <lb/>
            to him who possesses it. For what is it to have power ? is it <lb/>
            to do what one wishes, or what appears to one to be best ? <lb/>
            Polus admits that it is not good for a person devoid of under­ <lb/>
            standing to do what appears to him to be best. He must <lb/>
            therefore prove that rhetoricians possess understanding, other­ <lb/>
            wise, since to have power is a good, they cannot do what they <lb/>
            wish. Polus, however, is unable to distinguish between doing <lb/>
            what one wishes and doing what appears to be best, and there­ <lb/>
            fore agrees to change positions with Socrates, and to answer <lb/>
            instead of asking questionsf.</p>
          <p>Socrates, then, asks, do men wish what they do for the sake <lb/>
            of the thing itself, or for some other end ? for instance, do <lb/>
            men take medicine because they wish to take it, or in order to <lb/>
            health ? Again, do men incur the perils of the sea because <lb/>
            they wish to be-in peril, or for the sake of riches ? Clearly the <lb/>
            latter, in both and all similar cases. Now some things, such <lb/>
            as wisdom, health, and riches, are good, but their contraries <lb/>
            evil; but whatever we do, we do for the sake of that which is <lb/>
            good. So that if we kill or banish a person, if it is good to do <lb/>
            so, we wish it, and do what we wish; but if it is really evil, <lb/>
            though it appears to us to be good, we do not what we wish. <lb/>
            Polus sees the force of Socrates' argument, and can only ob­ <lb/>
            ject to it that Socrates himself would like to do what he <lb/>
            pleased, and would envy another whom he saw slaying, or <lb/>
            spoiling, or imprisoning whom he pleased. But Socrates <lb/>
            resolutely denies this, and insists that if he must necessarily <lb/>
            either act unjustly or suffer unjustly, he should choose the <lb/>
            latter; for that it is better to suffer than to commit injusticeg. <note type="footnote"> e § 44—47. </note><note type="footnote">f § 48—50. </note><note type="footnote">g § 51—57. </note></p><pb n="132"/>
            
          <p>Polus imagines that even a child could confute such a posi. <lb/>
            tion as this ; and in order to do so mentions instances of men <lb/>
            whom all have accounted happy, though they were unjust, <lb/>
            especially that of Archelaus, king of Macedonia. But Socrates <lb/>
            denies that any one who acts unjustly can be happy; and fur­ <lb/>
            ther than this, he contends that a person who acts unjustly, <lb/>
            and does not suffer punishment, is more miserable than one <lb/>
            who meets with punishment for his injustice. To prove this <lb/>
            he argues that it is more base to commit injustice than to <lb/>
            suffer it, and if more base it must also be worse ; Polus admits <lb/>
            the premise, but denies the conclusion. Socrates, therefore, <lb/>
            endeavours to make his opponent admit this also by the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing arguments. Beautiful things are esteemed beautiful, <lb/>
            either on account of their usefulness, or the pleasure they oc­ <lb/>
            casion, or both; and in like manner base things are deemed <lb/>
            base on account of the pain or evil they occasion, or both; so <lb/>
            that when of two things one is more beautiful than the other, <lb/>
            it is so because it excels in pleasure or utility, or both; and <lb/>
            when of two things one is more base, it must be because it <lb/>
            exceeds in pain or evil. But Polus has already admitted that <lb/>
            it is more base to commit injustice than to suffer it; it must <lb/>
            therefore be so because it exceeds in pain or evil, or both. <lb/>
            But to commit injustice does not exceed the suffering it, in <lb/>
            pain; it remains, therefore, that it must exceed it in evil: <lb/>
            consequently it must be worse, for whatever exceeds another <lb/>
            thing in evil must necessarily be worseh.</p>
          <p>Having established his point thus far he now goes on to <lb/>
            prove that it is the greatest of evils for one who has com­ <lb/>
            mitted injustice not to be punished. To suffer punishment <lb/>
            and to be justly chastised, are one and the same thing. But <lb/>
            all just things are beautiful. Moreover wherever there is an <lb/>
            agent there must also be a patient; and the patient suffers <lb/>
            what the agent does; so that if the agent punishes justly the <lb/>
            patient also suffers justly. But it has been just admitted that <note type="footnote"> b § 58—69. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            all just things are beautiful; and it was proved before that all <lb/>
            beautiful things are good, either because they are pleasant or <lb/>
            useful; whence it follows that he who is punished suffers that <lb/>
            which is good, and is benefited in being freed from the greatest <lb/>
            evil, which is depravity in the soul. From all this it is evident <lb/>
            that rhetoric can be of no use whatever: for it is generally <lb/>
            employed for the purpose of excusing injustice, and screening <lb/>
            men from the punishment they deserve, which on the contrary <lb/>
            they ought rather to court than to shun i.</p>
          <p>Polus having been thus completely silenced, Callicles takes <lb/>
            up the argument and begins by asking whether Socrates is <lb/>
            really in earnest. Finding that he is so, he blames Polus for <lb/>
            having granted that it is more-base to commit injustice than <lb/>
            to suffer it; for that there is a difference between nature and <lb/>
            law, which Socrates perceiving, confounded that which is more <lb/>
            base by nature with that which is so by law, and so made that <lb/>
            which is more base by law appear to be more so by nature: <lb/>
            whereas by nature it is more base to suffer injustice than to <lb/>
            commit it. For the weak and the many make laws with a <lb/>
            view to their own advantage, but nature herself avows that <lb/>
            it is just that the better should have more than the worse, <lb/>
            and the more powerful than the weaker. Callicles then pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to inveigh against philosophy and philosophers, and <lb/>
            when he has done, Socrates, after having indulged in a vein <lb/>
            of pleasant irony at his expense, returns to the subject, and <lb/>
            asks what he means by the superior, the better, and the <lb/>
            stronger, whether they are the same or different. Callicles <lb/>
            says they are the same. Socrates objects, that if that is the <lb/>
            case the many being stronger are also the better, and so, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as they make the laws, law and nature are not con­ <lb/>
            trary to each other. Callicles therefore is compelled to change <lb/>
            his ground, and next says that by the better and superior he <lb/>
            means the more wise: and at last he says that they are those <lb/>
            who are skilled and courageous in administering the affairs of <note type="footnote"> i § 70—80. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            a city. He adds that it is just that the governors should have <lb/>
            more than the governed. Socrates, hereupon, asks whether <lb/>
            they ought not to govern themselves also and be temperate, <lb/>
            which elicits from Callicles the shameless avowal that a man <lb/>
            should have as large desires as he can, and indulge them with­ <lb/>
            out restraintk.</p>
          <p>Socrates having in vain endeavoured to persuade Callicles to <lb/>
            change his opinion by two similitudes of a perforated cask, and <lb/>
            a full and an empty one, to which he compares the soul, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to combat his assertion that a happy life consists in <lb/>
            having and indulging as large desires as possible. If happiness <lb/>
            consists in being hungry and eating, thirsty and drinking, it <lb/>
            must follow that to be scabby and itch and scratch one's self is <lb/>
            to live happily. Callicles is forced to admit that this is to live <lb/>
            pleasantly, and then if pleasantly, happily; and at length is <lb/>
            driven to assert that the pleasant and the good are the same. <lb/>
            In order to confute this opinion, Socrates leads him to main­ <lb/>
            tain that science and courage differ from each other and from <lb/>
            the good; and then by a series of most subtle questions, too <lb/>
            minute to be abbreviated, forces him to this absurd conclusion, <lb/>
            that if the pleasant and the good are the same, a bad man, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as he oftentimes receives more pleasure than a good <lb/>
            man, must be accounted better than a good one 1.</p>
          <p>Callicles to evade this absurdity is compelled to admit that <lb/>
            some pleasures are better than others. From this concession <lb/>
            Socrates shews that the end of all human actions is the good <lb/>
            and not the pleasant; for that so far. is it from being the case <lb/>
            that we do any thing merely for the sake of pleasure, that we <lb/>
            pursue pleasure itself for the sake of the good m.</p>
          <p>Having established this point, Socrates brings back the dis­ <lb/>
            cussion to the original subject, and proposes to enquire whether <lb/>
            it is better to live in such a manner as Callicles advises, namely <lb/>
            to devote one's self to public business and to study rhetoric, or <lb/>
            in such a manner as philosophy persuades. He recurs there­ <note type="footnote"> k § 81—103. </note><note type="footnote">1 § 104—117. </note><note type="footnote">m § 118—119. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            fore to his own former arguments, in which he stated that as <lb/>
            there are certain skills, not arts, employed for the gratification <lb/>
            of the body, so there are other corresponding ones made use <lb/>
            of to please the soul, such as flute-playing, harp-playing, <lb/>
            dithyrambic and even tragic poetry ; now take from these last <lb/>
            melody, rhythm and measure, and what else remains but <lb/>
            words, that is to say a kind of flattery addressed to the multi­ <lb/>
            tude ? And is not popular rhetoric similar ? Callicles answers <lb/>
            that there is a difference to be observed in this respect, for that <lb/>
            some do, as Socrates has observed, speak only in order to please, <lb/>
            but that others look to the interest of the citizens. " That is <lb/>
            enough," says Socrates. At all events one part of rhetoric is <lb/>
            flattery, and when has an instance of that which is honourable, <lb/>
            which strives to speak what is best, whether it be pleasant or <lb/>
            unpleasant to the hearers, ever been seen ? Callicles instances <lb/>
            Themistocles, Cimon, Miltiades and Pericles, but Socrates will <lb/>
            by no means admit that any of these really endeavoured to <lb/>
            make the people better. But before this, Callicles, being hard <lb/>
            pressed in argument, breaks off the discussion, and Socrates, <lb/>
            at the request of Gorgias, carries it on by himself, and shews <lb/>
            at length and with great force and perspicuity the advantages <lb/>
            of a virtuous and well regulated life ; and in conclusion he de­ <lb/>
            scribes the future judgment when each man will give account <lb/>
            of himself in another world, and be rewarded or punished ac­ <lb/>
            cording as he has lived a good or a bad life.</p>

          <p>Cal. THEY say, Socrates, that we should thus take part in <lb/>
            war and battle a.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have we then, as the saying is, come after the feast, <lb/>
            and are we too late ?</p>
          <p>Cal. And a very elegant feast. For Gorgias has just now <lb/>
            exhibited many fine things to us.</p>
          <p>Socr. Chserephon here, Callicles, is the cause of this, by <lb/>
            having compelled us to waste our time in the forum.</p>
          <p>Chœr. It's of no consequence, Socrates; for I will also find <lb/>
            a remedy; for Gorgias is my friend, so that he will exhibit to <lb/>
            us now, if you please, or, if you prefer it, at some future time.</p>
          <p>2. Cal. What, Chserephon ? is Socrates desirous of hearing <lb/>
            Gorgias ?</p>
          <p>Chœr. We are come for this very purpose.</p>
          <p>Cal. Whenever you please, then, come to my house ; Gorgias <lb/>
            lodges with me, and will exhibit to you.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say wellb, Callicles. But would he be inclined <lb/>
            to converse with us ? For I wish to learn from him what is <lb/>
            the power of his art, and what it is that he professes and <lb/>
            teaches: the rest of the exhibition, as you say, he may make <lb/>
            at some other time.</p>
          <p>Cal. There is nothing like asking him, Socrates : for this is <lb/>
            one part of his exhibition : he just now bade all that were in <lb/>
            the house ask what question they pleased, and promised to <lb/>
            answer every thing. <note type="footnote"> a That is, come too late, and so take no part at all. </note><note type="footnote"> b Or, " you are very obliging." </note></p><pb n="137"/>
            
          <p>3. Socr. You say well in truth. Ask him, Chærephon.</p>
          <p>Chœr. What shall I ask him ?</p>
          <p>Socr. What he is.</p>
          <p>Chœr. How mean you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Just as, if he happened to be a maker of shoes, he <lb/>
            would surely answer you, that he is a shoemaker. Do you not <lb/>
            understand what I mean ?</p>
          <p>Chœr. I understand, and will ask him. Tell me, Gorgias, <lb/>
            does Callicles here say truly that you promised to answer what­ <lb/>
            ever any one should ask you ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Truly, Chærephon: for I just now made that very <lb/>
            promise: and I affirm that for many years no one has asked <lb/>
            me any thing new.</p>
          <p>Chœr. Without doubt, then, you will answer easily, Gorgias.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You may make trial of that, Chserephon.</p>
          <p>Pol. By Jupiter, Chserephon, if you please, make trial of me: <lb/>
            for Gorgias appears to me to be fatigued; as he has just now <lb/>
            been speaking a great deal.</p>
          <p>4. Chœr. What, Polus, do you think you can answer better <lb/>
            than Gorgias?</p>
          <p>Pol. What matters that, if I answer well enough for you ?</p>
          <p>Cheer. Not at all: since you wish it then, answer.</p>
          <p>Pol. Ask.</p>
          <p>Chœr. I ask then, If Gorgias happened to be skilled in the <lb/>
            same art as his brother Herodicus is skilled, what name should <lb/>
            we rightly give him? Would it not be the same as his <lb/>
            brother ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Chœr. In calling him a physician, then, we should speak <lb/>
            correctly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Chœr. But if he were skilled in the same art as Aristophon, <lb/>
            son of Aglaophon, or his brother, what should we properly <lb/>
            call him ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Evidently, a painter.</p>
          <p>Chœr. But now, since he is skilled in a certain art, what <lb/>
            can we properly call him ?</p>
          <p>5. Pol. Chærephon, there are many arts among men by <lb/>
            experience experimentally discovered: for experience causes <lb/>
            our life to proceed according to art, but inexperience accord­ <lb/>
            ing to chance. Of each of these different persons partake of <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            different arts, in different manners; but the best of the best; <lb/>
            in the number of whom is Gorgias here, who possesses the <lb/>
            finest of the arts.</p>
          <p>Socr. Polus appears, Gorgias, to be very well prepared for <lb/>
            speaking: but he does not do what he promised Chæ­ <lb/>
            rephon.</p>
          <p>Gorg. How so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. He does not appear to me to answer the question that <lb/>
            was asked.</p>
          <p>6. Gorg. Do you then, if you please, ask him.</p>
          <p>Socr. No, but if yourself would be willing to answer me, I <lb/>
            would much rather ask you. For it is evident to me that <lb/>
            Polus, from what he has said, has studied more what is called <lb/>
            rhetoric, than conversation.</p>
          <p>Pol. Why so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Because, Polus, when Chærephon asked you in what <lb/>
            art Gorgias was skilled, you praised his art, as if some one <lb/>
            had blamed it, but you did not say what the art itself is.</p>
          <p>Pol. Did I not answer, that it was the finest of all arts ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Certainly. But no one asked you what was the quality <lb/>
            of the art of Gorgias, but what it was, and by what name we <lb/>
            ought to call Gorgias; just as Chærephon proposed the former <lb/>
            questions to you, and you answered him well and in few words. <lb/>
            Now, therefore, tell me in the same manner, what art Gorgias <lb/>
            professes, and what we ought to call him. Or rather, Gorgias, <lb/>
            do you tell us yourself what we ought to call you as skilled in <lb/>
            what art.</p>
          <p>Gorg. In rhetoric, Socrates.</p>
          <p>7. Socr. Ought we, then, to call you a rhetorician?</p>
          <p>Gorg. And a good one, Socrates, if you wish to call me, as <lb/>
            Homer says, what " I boast myself to be."</p>
          <p>Socr. But I do wish.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Call me so, then.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we say too that you are able to make others <lb/>
            rhetoricians ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I profess this not only here but elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are you willing then, Gorgias, to continue, as we are <lb/>
            now doing, partly to ask questions and partly to answer, and <lb/>
            to defer to some other occasion that prolixity of speech, such <lb/>
            as Polus just now began with? But do not belie what you <lb/>
            promised, but be willing to answer each question briefly.</p><pb n="139"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. There are some answers, Socrates, which must neces. <lb/>
            sarily be made at length: however, I will endeavour to make <lb/>
            them as short as possible. For this is one of the things which <lb/>
            I profess, that no one can say the same things in fewer words <lb/>
            than me..</p>
          <p>8. Socr. There is need of this now, Gorgias; give me there­ <lb/>
            fore a specimen of this very thing, conciseness of speech, and <lb/>
            of prolixity at some other time.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I will do so; and you will admit that you never heard <lb/>
            any one speak more concisely.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well then, since you say that you are skilled in the <lb/>
            art of rhetoric, and that you can teach another this art, tell me <lb/>
            about what is rhetoric employed? just as the art of weaving is <lb/>
            employed in the making of garments, is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not music also employed in the composing of <lb/>
            melodies ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Juno, Gorgias, I admire your answers, for you <lb/>
            answer as briefly as possible.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I think, Socrates, that I do this well enough.</p>
          <p>9. Socr. You say well. Come then, answer me thus re­ <lb/>
            specting rhetoric, of what is it the science ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Of words.</p>
          <p>Socr. What kind of words, Gorgias? Are they such as <lb/>
            inform the sick by what kind of diet they may become well ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. No.</p>
          <p>Socr. Rhetoric, then, is not concerned with all kinds of <lb/>
            words ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet it makes men able to speak?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And does it not enable men to think on the same <lb/>
            things on which it enables them to speak ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Without doubt.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not, then, the medicinal art, of which we just <lb/>
            now spoke, make men able to think and speak about the sick ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. The medicinal art, then, as it appears, is conversant <lb/>
            with words ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p><pb n="140"/>
            
          <p>Socr. And those that concern diseases ?</p>
          <p>Gory. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not the gymnastic art also conversant with <lb/>
            words that relate to the good and bad habit of bodies ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>10. Socr. And it is the same with other arts, Gorgias: each <lb/>
            of them is conversant with those words that are employed about <lb/>
            that particular thing of which each is the art.</p>
          <p>Gorg. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Why, then, do you not call other arts rhetorical, as <lb/>
            being conversant with words, since you call that rhetoric which <lb/>
            is employed about words ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Because, Socrates, almost the wholec science of other <lb/>
            arts is conversant with manual operations and such-like ac­ <lb/>
            tions; in rhetoric, however, there is no such manual operation, <lb/>
            but all its activity and efficiency is by means of words. For <lb/>
            this reason, I consider that the art of rhetoric is conversant <lb/>
            with words, herein speaking correctly, as I affirm.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do I understand what kind of art you wish to call it ? <lb/>
            but I shall soon comprehend it more clearly. However, answer <lb/>
            me. We have arts, have we not?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>11. Socr. Of all the arts, some, I think, consist principally <lb/>
            in workmanship, and stand in need of but few words, and <lb/>
            others of none at all, but their work may be accomplished in <lb/>
            silence, as painting, statuary, and many others. With such <lb/>
            arts, you appear to me to say rhetoric has nothing to do ? is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. You apprehend my meaning perfectly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. On the other hand, there are other arts which accom­ <lb/>
            plish all by means of words, and require no work at all, or <lb/>
            very little, such as theoretical d and practical arithmetic, geo­ <lb/>
            metry, the game of dice, and many other arts; some of which <lb/>
            require almost as many words as actions, and most of them <lb/>
            more, so that altogether their whole activity and efficiency is <lb/>
            by means of words. You appear to me to say that rhetoric is <lb/>
            among arts of this kind.</p>
          <p>12. Gorg. You say truly. <note type="footnote"> c The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign> tiros <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰπεῖν</foreign> qualifies the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πᾶσα</foreign>, " almost the <lb/>
            whole," or " the whole, so to speak." </note><note type="footnote"> d <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμητική</foreign> means the theory, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογιστική</foreign> the practice of arithmetic. </note></p><pb n="141"/>
            
          <p>Socr. However, I do not think you mean to call any one of <lb/>
            these rhetoric, although in the expression you used you so <lb/>
            said, that rhetoric has its efficiency by means of words; and <lb/>
            any who wished to catch at your words might reply, Do you <lb/>
            say then, Gorgias, that arithmetic is rhetoric ? But I do not <lb/>
            think that you call either arithmetic or geometry rhetoric.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You think rightly, Socrates, and apprehend my mean­ <lb/>
            ing correctly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, complete the answer to my question. <lb/>
            Since rhetoric is one of those arts which make great use of <lb/>
            words, and there are others of the same kind, endeavour to tell <lb/>
            me in reference to what, rhetoric has its efficiency in words. <lb/>
            13. Just as if any one should ask me respecting any of the <lb/>
            arts which I but now mentioned: Socrates, what is the arith­ <lb/>
            metical art ? I should say to him, as you did just now, That it <lb/>
            is one of the arts that have their efficiency in words. And if <lb/>
            he should further ask me, In reference to what? I should <lb/>
            answer, In reference to the knowledge of even and odd, how <lb/>
            many there may be of each. But if again he should ask <lb/>
            me, What do you mean by the art of computation ? I should <lb/>
            answer, that this also is one of those arts whose whole effici­ <lb/>
            ency consists in words. And if he should further ask me, In <lb/>
            reference to what ? I should answer, as they do who draw up <lb/>
            motions in the assemblies of the people, That in other respects <lb/>
            computation is the same as arithmetic, for it has reference to <lb/>
            the same object, that is to say, the even and the odd; but it <lb/>
            differs in this respect, that computation considers what rela­ <lb/>
            tion even and odd have to themselves and to each other in <lb/>
            regard to quantity. 14. And if any one should ask me about <lb/>
            astronomy, and after I had said that its whole efficiency con­ <lb/>
            sists in words, should say, But Socrates, to what do words <lb/>
            employed about astronomy refer ? I should answer, That they <lb/>
            are employed about the course of the stars, and of the sun and <lb/>
            the moon, how they are related to each other with respect to <lb/>
            velocity.</p>
          <p>Gorg. And you would answer rightly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now then do you answer, Gorgias. For rhetoric is <lb/>
            one of those arts which accomplish and effect every thing by <lb/>
            means of words: is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me then in reference to what? what is the par­ <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            ticular thing about which these words are, which rhetoric <lb/>
            uses?</p>
          <p>Gorg. The greatest of all human concerns, Socrates, and <lb/>
            the best.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, Gorgias, what you say is questionable, and by <lb/>
            no means clear. For I think you must have heard at ban­ <lb/>
            quets men singing that song in which the singers enumerate <lb/>
            that the best thing is health, the second beauty, and the third, <lb/>
            as the author of the song says, riches gained without fraud.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I have heard it; but with what object do you men­ <lb/>
            tion this?</p>
          <p>15. Socr. Because the artificers of those things which the <lb/>
            author of the song has commended, namely, the physician, the <lb/>
            master of gymnastics, and the money-getter, will forthwith <lb/>
            present themselves, and the physician will say: Socrates, Gor­ <lb/>
            gias deceives you. For his art is not employed about the <lb/>
            greatest good to men, but mine is. If, then, I should ask him, <lb/>
            Who are you that say this? lie would probably answer, I am <lb/>
            a physician. What then do you say ? that the object of your <lb/>
            art is the greatest good ? How can it be otherwise, Socrates, <lb/>
            he would probably say, since its object is health? and what <lb/>
            greater good can men have than health? And if after him <lb/>
            again the master of gymnastics should say, I too should won­ <lb/>
            der, Socrates, if Gorgias could shew you any greater good <lb/>
            from his art than I can from mine, I should again say to him, <lb/>
            And who are you, Sir, and what is your employment ? A master <lb/>
            of gymnastics, he would say, and my employment is to make <lb/>
            men beautiful and strong in their bodies. 16. After the mas­ <lb/>
            ter of gymnastics, the money-getter would say, as I imagine, <lb/>
            despising all others, Consider, I beg, Socrates, whether there <lb/>
            is any greater good than riches, either with Gorgias, or any <lb/>
            one else ? I should thereupon say to him, What, then, are you <lb/>
            the artificer of this good ? He would say, I am. Who are you <lb/>
            then? A money-getter. What then? Do you consider riches <lb/>
            to be the greatest good to men? I shall say. Assuredly, he <lb/>
            will answer. However, Gorgias here contends that his art is <lb/>
            the cause of greater good than yours. It is clear then that <lb/>
            after this he would ask, And what is this good ? let Gorgias <lb/>
            answer. Come then, Gorgias, suppose that you are asked by <lb/>
            them and by me, and answer, What is this, which you say is <lb/>
            the greatest good to men, and of which you are the artificer ?</p><pb n="143"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. That which is in reality, Socrates, the greatest <lb/>
            good, and is at the same time the cause of liberty to men, <lb/>
            and of their being able to rule over others in their several <lb/>
            cities.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then do you say it is ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I say it is the power of persuading by words judges <lb/>
            in a court of justice, senators in the senate-house, and the <lb/>
            hearers in a public assembly, and in every other convention of <lb/>
            a political nature. Moreover, by this power you will make the <lb/>
            physician your slave, and the master of gymnastics your slave, <lb/>
            and the money-getter will be found to have gained money, not <lb/>
            for himself, but for another, for you who are able to speak, <lb/>
            and persuade the multitude.</p>
          <p>Socr. At length you appear to me, Gorgias, to have shewn <lb/>
            as nearly as possible what kind of art you consider rhetoric to <lb/>
            be; and if I understand you rightly, you say that rhetoric is <lb/>
            the artificer of persuasion, and that its whole employment and <lb/>
            the sum of it terminates in this. Can you say that rhetoric <lb/>
            has any further power than that of producing persuasion in the <lb/>
            minds of the hearers ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. By no means, Socrates ; but you appear to me to <lb/>
            have defined it sufficiently. For that is the sum of it.</p>
          <p>18. Socr. Listen then, Gorgias. Be assured that I, as I <lb/>
            persuade myself, if there is any one, who in conversing with <lb/>
            another, wishes to know the very thing about which the con­ <lb/>
            versation is, be assured, I say, that I am such a person; and I <lb/>
            think that you are too.</p>
          <p>Gorg. What then, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will now tell you. The persuasion which you speak <lb/>
            of as resulting from rhetoric, what it is, and with what particu­ <lb/>
            lars it is conversant, be assured I do not clearly understand, <lb/>
            not but that I have a suspicion of what I suppose you mean, <lb/>
            and about what it is employed: yet I will not the less ask you <lb/>
            what persuasion you mean results from rhetoric, and with what <lb/>
            particulars it is conversant. Why then do I who have a sus­ <lb/>
            picion ask you, and not rather myself speak? Not on your <lb/>
            account, but on account of the discussion, that it may proceed <lb/>
            in such a manner as to make the subject of the discussion <lb/>
            most clear to us. 19. For consider whether I seem to you <lb/>
            right in putting the question to you: just as if I should ask <lb/>
            you what kind of a painter is Zeuxis ? if you were to tell me <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            that he paints animals, might I not justly enquire of you, what <lb/>
            kind of animals he paints ? is it not soe?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And would it not be for this reason, because there are <lb/>
            also other painters who paint many other animals ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But if no one else but Zeuxis painted them, you would <lb/>
            have answered properly.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, with respect to rhetoric, tell me, whether <lb/>
            it appears to you that rhetoric alone produces persuasion, or do <lb/>
            other arts produce it likewise ? My meaning is this: Does <lb/>
            he who teaches any thing persuade what he teaches, or not ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. He does certainly persuade, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soer. Again, if we speak of the same arts of which we just <lb/>
            now made mention, does not arithmetic teach us such things <lb/>
            as relate to number ? and does not an arithmetician the same ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>20. Socr. Does it not also persuade ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Arithmetic, then, is an artificer of persuasion.</p>
          <p>Gorg. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, then, any one should ask us, What persuasion it <lb/>
            produces, and with respect to what? we should answer, That <lb/>
            which teaches about the quantity of even and odd. In like <lb/>
            manner we may shew, that all the other arts of which we spoke <lb/>
            just now, produce persuasion, and what kind of persuasion, and <lb/>
            with respect to what: is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Rhetoric then, is not alone an artificer of persuasion.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Since then, it does not alone produce this effect, but <lb/>
            other arts do the same, we may justly, as in the case of the <lb/>
            painter, next enquire of the speaker; of what kind of persua­ <lb/>
            sion, and of persuasion on what subject rhetoric is the art? <lb/>
            Does it not appear to you that this question may fairly be <lb/>
            asked ? <note type="footnote"> e I have ventured to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ οὔ</foreign> for Ka2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῦ</foreign>, for which my only excuse <lb/>
            is that the usual reading cannot be rendered intelligibly, and that the <lb/>
            alteration I have ventured to import is an expression very commonly <lb/>
            used by Socrates on similar occasions. </note></p><pb n="145"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. It does.</p>
          <p>Socr. Answer then, Gorgias, since this appears to you to be <lb/>
            the case.</p>
          <p>21. Gorg. I speak then, Socrates, of that persuasion which <lb/>
            is produced in courts of justice, and in other public assemblies, <lb/>
            as I just now mentioned, and with respect to matters that are <lb/>
            just and unjust.</p>
          <p>Socr. I suspected, Gorgias, that you meant that persuasion, <lb/>
            and on such matters. But do not be surprised if I shortly ask <lb/>
            you a question that may appear to be evident, but which I shall <lb/>
            notwithstanding repeat, for, as I before observed, I ask it for the <lb/>
            sake of carrying on the discussion in an orderly manner, and <lb/>
            not on your account, but that we may not be in the habit of <lb/>
            catching up each other's words on suspicion; but do you finish <lb/>
            what you have to say according to your own plan, just as you <lb/>
            please.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You appear to me to act rightly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, let us examine this too. Do you admit <lb/>
            that to learn is any thing ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I do admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Again? to believe?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether, therefore, does it appear to you, that to <lb/>
            learn and to believe, and learning and belief are the same, or <lb/>
            different ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I think, Socrates, that they are different.</p>
          <p>22. Socr. You think rightly; and you may know from this; <lb/>
            if any one should ask you, Is there, Gorgias, a false and true <lb/>
            belief? I think you would say there is.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I should.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well then, is there a false and true science?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is clear, therefore, that they (belief and science) are <lb/>
            not the same.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet both those who learn are persuaded, and those who <lb/>
            believe.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are you willing, therefore, that we lay down two kinds <lb/>
            of persuasion, one that produces belief without knowledge, but <lb/>
            the other science ? <note type="footnote"> L </note></p><pb n="146"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Which kind of persuasion, then, does rhetoric pro­ <lb/>
            duce in courts of justice and other public assemblies, re­ <lb/>
            specting what is just and unjust? is it that from which belief <lb/>
            springs without knowledge, or that from which knowledge <lb/>
            arises ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It is evident, Socrates, that it is that from which <lb/>
            belief springs.</p>
          <p>Socr. Rhetoric then, as it seems, Gorgias, is the artificer of a <lb/>
            persuasion which produces belief, and not of that which teaches <lb/>
            respecting the just and unjust.</p>
          <p>Gorg. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. A rhetorician, therefore, does not profess to teach courts <lb/>
            of justice and other public assemblies, respecting things just <lb/>
            and unjust, but only to produce belief. For surely he could <lb/>
            not teach so great a multitude in a short time things of such <lb/>
            great importance.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>23. Socr. Come then, let us see now what we ought to say <lb/>
            of rhetoric. For I, indeed, am not yet able to understand what <lb/>
            I should say. When an assembly is held in a city, for the <lb/>
            choice of physicians, or shipwrights, or any other kind of arti­ <lb/>
            ficer, is it not the case that the rhetorician will refrain from <lb/>
            giving his advice ? for it is evident that, in each election, the <lb/>
            most skilful artist ought to be chosen. Nor will he be con­ <lb/>
            sulted when the question is respecting the building of walls, <lb/>
            or the construction of ports or docks, but architects only. <lb/>
            Nor, again, when a deliberation occurs respecting the choice <lb/>
            of generals, or the marshalling an army against enemies, or <lb/>
            the occupation of posts,-but on such occasions those who <lb/>
            are skilled in military affairs will give advice, and not rheto­ <lb/>
            ricians. What do you say, Gorgias, on such points? For <lb/>
            since you say that you are a rhetorician, and are able to make <lb/>
            others rhetoricians, it is proper to enquire of you what are <lb/>
            the things about which your art is concerned. And consider <lb/>
            that I am labouring for your benefit. For, perhaps, some one <lb/>
            who is now within the house may wish to become your disciple; <lb/>
            for I perceive some, nay several, who probably are ashamed to <lb/>
            question you. 24. In being questioned, therefore, by me, con­ <lb/>
            sider yourself to be questioned by them, What would be the <lb/>
            consequence to us, Gorgias, if we should put ourselves under <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            your instructions ? On what subjects shall we be able to give <lb/>
            advice to the city? Whether about the just only and the un­ <lb/>
            just; or on those subjects of which Socrates just now made <lb/>
            mention ? Endeavour to answer them.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I will endeavour, Socrates, to develope clearly the <lb/>
            whole power of rhetoric: for you have admirably led the <lb/>
            way. You doubtless know that these docks and walls of the <lb/>
            Athenians, and the structure of the ports, were made partly <lb/>
            on the advice of Themistocles, and partly on that of Pericles, <lb/>
            but not of artificers.</p>
          <p>Socr. This is told of Themistocles, Gorgias: and I myself <lb/>
            heard Pericles when he . gave us his advice respecting the <lb/>
            middle wall f.</p>
          <p>Gorg. And when there is an election of any such persons as <lb/>
            you mentioned, Socrates, you see that the rhetoricians are the <lb/>
            persons who give advice, and whose opinion prevails in such <lb/>
            matters.</p>
          <p>25. Socr. It is because I wonder at this, Gorgias, that I <lb/>
            have been for some time asking you, what is the power of <lb/>
            rhetoric. For when I consider it in this manner, it appears <lb/>
            to me almost divine in its magnitude.</p>
          <p>Gorg. If you knew all, Socrates, that it comprehends under <lb/>
            itself almost all powers! And I will give you a strong proof of <lb/>
            this. For I have often, ere now, gone with my brother and <lb/>
            other physicians to various sick persons, who would neither <lb/>
            drink their medicine, nor suffer themselves to be cut or cau­ <lb/>
            terized by the physician, and when the physician was unable <lb/>
            to persuade them, I have done so by no other art than rhetoric. <lb/>
            I say too, that if a rhetorician and a physician should go to any <lb/>
            city you please, and it were necessary to contend by argument <lb/>
            in a general assembly, or any other convention, which should <lb/>
            be chosen, a rhetorician or a physician, the physician would be <lb/>
            held in no account, but he that has the power of speaking <lb/>
            would be chosen, if he pleased. 26. And if he should con­ <lb/>
            tend with any other artist whatever, the rhetorician would <lb/>
            persuade that he himself should be chosen in preference to <lb/>
            any one else. For there is no subject on which a rhetorician <lb/>
            will not speak to the multitude more persuasively than any <lb/>
            other artist whatever. Such, then, and so great is the power <note type="footnote"> f The wall which connected the southern extremities of the long walls <lb/>
            and the Phaleric wall. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            of this art. It is right however, Socrates, to use rhetoric in <lb/>
            the same way as any other exercise employed in contests: <lb/>
            for it is not right to use other exercises against all men alike ; <lb/>
            nor, because any one has learnt pugilism, and the pancratium, <lb/>
            and to fight with arms, so as to be superior both to friends and <lb/>
            enemies, is it therefore proper to strike, or pierce, or slay <lb/>
            one's friends. 27. Nor, by Jupiter, if some one who, by hav­ <lb/>
            ing frequented the palæstra, has made his body robust, and <lb/>
            become a pugilist, should afterwards strike his father or <lb/>
            mother, or any other of his relatives or friends, would it on <lb/>
            that account be proper to hate, and expel from cities, the <lb/>
            training masters and those who teach how to fight with arms. <lb/>
            For they instructed their pupils in these exercises, in order <lb/>
            that they might make a proper use of them against enemies, <lb/>
            and those that do wrong, for self-defence, and not for attack; <lb/>
            but they contrariwise, use their strength and skill improperly. <lb/>
            The teachers, therefore, are not wicked, nor is their art either <lb/>
            to be blamed, or for this reason wicked, but they, I think, who <lb/>
            do not use it properly. 28. The same may be said of rhetoric. <lb/>
            For a rhetorician is able to speak against all men, and on every <lb/>
            subject; so that he can best persuade the multitude, in a word, <lb/>
            on whatever subject he pleases: but he ought not any the <lb/>
            more on this account to detract from the reputation of phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, because he is able to do it, nor of other artificers; but <lb/>
            he should use rhetoric justly, as well as other exercises. In <lb/>
            my opinion, however, if any one having become a rhetorician <lb/>
            abuses this power and art, it is not proper to hate the teacher <lb/>
            and expel him from cities, for he imparted the knowledge of it <lb/>
            for just purposes, but the other makes a contrary use of it. It <lb/>
            is just, therefore, to hate, banish, and slay him who does not <lb/>
            make a right use of it, but not the teacher.</p>
          <p>29. Boer. I think, Gorgias, that you as well as I, have been <lb/>
            present at many discussions, and that you have observed this <lb/>
            in them, that it is not easy for men, on whatever subject they <lb/>
            I undertake to converse, having propounded their ideas to each <lb/>
            other, both learning themselves and teaching one another, then <lb/>
            I to put an end to the conference; but if they have a contro­ <lb/>
            versy about any thing, and one says that the other does not <lb/>
            speak correctly or clearly, they are indignant, and each thinks <lb/>
            that the other is speaking out of envy, from a love of conten­ <lb/>
            tion, and not seeking what was proposed in the discussion: <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            and some, at length g, depart in a most disgraceful manner, <lb/>
            having h reviled each other, and spoken and heard such <lb/>
            things that even the bystanders are vexed at themselves for <lb/>
            having deigned to listen to such men. 30. But why do I say <lb/>
            this ? Because you now appear to me to say what does not <lb/>
            follow from, or accord with, what you first said respecting <lb/>
            rhetoric. I am afraid, therefore, to proceed with my refuta­ <lb/>
            tion, lest you should suppose that I do not speak with zeal for <lb/>
            the subject, that it may be made clear, but out of opposition <lb/>
            to you. If, then, you are of that class of men to which I be­ <lb/>
            long, I should gladly question you: but if not, I would forbear <lb/>
            to do so. But to what class of men do I belong ? To those who <lb/>
            are willingly refuted, if they say any thing that is not true, and <lb/>
            who willingly refute if any one says any thing that is not true ; <lb/>
            and who are not less pleased to be refuted than to refute. For <lb/>
            I consider the former to be the greater good, inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            a greater good one's-self to be delivered from the greatest evil <lb/>
            than to deliver another. For I think no evil so great to man <lb/>
            as false opinion on the subjects we are now discussing. If, <lb/>
            then, you say that you are such a man, let us continue our <lb/>
            discussion; [31.] but if you think we ought to desist, let us <lb/>
            give it up, and put an end to the argument.</p>
          <p>Gorg. But indeed, Socrates, I profess myself to be such a <lb/>
            man as you describe. Perhaps, however, it is right to attend <lb/>
            to the wishes of the company who are present. For, some time <lb/>
            since, before you came, I explained many things to the present <lb/>
            company: and now, perhaps, we shall protract it too far if we con­ <lb/>
            tinue the discussion. We must, therefore, respect their wishes <lb/>
            lest we detain any of them, who have something else to do.</p>
          <p>Chœr. You yourselves, Gorgias and Socrates, hear the noise <lb/>
            these men make, from their anxiety to hear, if you say any <lb/>
            thing. For my part, may I never have so much business, as <lb/>
            to be obliged to leave such a discussion and so conducted, from <lb/>
            having any thing else more important to do.</p>
          <p>32. Cal. By the gods, Chserephon, and I too, though I have <lb/>
            been present at many conferences, know not whether I have <lb/>
            ever been so delighted as now; so that you will gratify me <lb/>
            much, should you even be willing to continue the discussion <lb/>
            throughout the whole day. <note type="footnote"> g Ficinus, I think, correctly translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελευτῶντες</foreign>, tandem. </note><note type="footnote"> h Literally " being reviled." </note></p><pb n="150"/>
            
          <p>Socr. There is no obstacle on my side, Callicles, if only <lb/>
            Gorgias is willing.</p>
          <p>Gorg. After this, Socrates, it would be shameful in me not to <lb/>
            be willing, especially as I myself announced that any one might <lb/>
            ask what he pleased. But, if it is agreeable to the company, <lb/>
            continue the discussion, and ask any question you please.</p>
          <p>Socr. Hear then, Gorgias, what I wonder at in what you <lb/>
            said. For, perhaps, you spoke correctly, and I did not rightly <lb/>
            apprehend you. You say that you can make any one a rheto­ <lb/>
            rician, who is willing to be instructed by you ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. So that he can speak persuasively on any subject to <lb/>
            the multitude, not teaching, but persuading?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Exactly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. You said too, that a rhetorician is able to speak more <lb/>
            persuasively than a physician, on the subject of health.</p>
          <p>Gorg. I did say so, at least to a multitude.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not, then, this expression " to a multitude " mean <lb/>
            to the ignorant ? for, surely, among the well-informed he will <lb/>
            not be better able to persuade than the physician.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You say truly.</p>
          <p>33. Socr. If then he shall be better able to persuade than <lb/>
            the physician, he is better able to persuade than one who <lb/>
            possesses knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Although he is not a physician ? is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But he who is not a physician must, surely, be un­ <lb/>
            skilled in those things in which a physician is skilled.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Clearly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. He, therefore, who is ignorant will be more capable <lb/>
            than one who possesses knowledge of persuading the ignorant, <lb/>
            since a rhetorician is better able to persuade than a physician. <lb/>
            Is this the result, or something else?</p>
          <p>Gorg. That is the result in this instance.</p>
          <p>Socr. The case therefore is the same as concerns a rhetori­ <lb/>
            cian and rhetoric with respect to all other arts : I mean, there <lb/>
            is no need for it to know the subjects themselves, how they are <lb/>
            circumstanced, but only to discover some means of persuasion, <lb/>
            so as to appear to the ignorant to know more than those who <lb/>
            possess knowledge.</p><pb n="151"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. Is it not a great advantage, Socrates, without having <lb/>
            other arts, but this one only, to be in no respect inferior to <lb/>
            artificers ?</p>
          <p>34. Socr. Whether from this being the case, a rhetorician <lb/>
            is inferior, or not inferior to others, we will presently consider, <lb/>
            if our argument requires it. But first let us consider this: <lb/>
            Whether a rhetorician is in the same condition with reference <lb/>
            to the just and the unjust, the base and the honourable, the <lb/>
            good and the evil, as he is with reference to health, and other <lb/>
            things with which other arts are concerned; I mean, that he <lb/>
            does not know them, what is good, or what is evil, what is <lb/>
            honourable or what is base, what is just, or what is unjust, <lb/>
            but is able to devise some means of persuasion respecting them, <lb/>
            so that, though he is ignorant, he appears to the ignorant to <lb/>
            know more than one who possesses knowledge; or is it neces­ <lb/>
            sary that he should know these, and is it requisite that he who <lb/>
            is about to learn rhetoric should have acquired these things <lb/>
            before he comes to you; if not, will you, who are a teacher <lb/>
            of rhetoric, teach him who conies to you none of these things <lb/>
            (for it is not your province), but make him appear to the <lb/>
            multitude to know these things, though he does not know <lb/>
            them, and to seem to be a good man when he is not so ? or <lb/>
            shall you be unable to teach him rhetoric at all, unless he <lb/>
            knows beforehand the truth respecting these things? What <lb/>
            is the case in this respect, Gorgias? And, by Jupiter, as you <lb/>
            just now promised, unfold the whole power of rhetoric.</p>
          <p>35. Gorg. I think, Socrates, that any one, if he did not know, <lb/>
            would learn these things from me.</p>
          <p>Socr. Stay; for you say well. If then you make any one <lb/>
            a rhetorician, it is necessary that he should know what is just <lb/>
            and unjust, either before, or afterwards from your instructions.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? Is he who has learnt carpentering, a <lb/>
            carpenter, or not?</p>
          <p>Gorg. He is.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not he who has learnt music, a musician ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And he who has learnt medicine, a physician ? And <lb/>
            so, in the same way, with regard to other things, is not he <lb/>
            who has learnt any particular art such a person as each science <lb/>
            respectively makes its proficient ?</p><pb n="152"/>
            
          <p>Gorg. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. By the same reason, then, does it not follow, that he <lb/>
            who has learnt just things is just ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And he who is just surely performs just actions.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, therefore, necessary' that the just man <lb/>
            should wish to do just actions ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. The just man, therefore, will never wish to act un­ <lb/>
            justly.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Necessarily.</p>
          <p>Socr. And it follows from the argument that the rhetori­ <lb/>
            cian should be just ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. A rhetorician, therefore, will never wish to act un­ <lb/>
            justly ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It appears hot.</p>
          <p>36. Socr. Do you remember that you said a little before <lb/>
            that we ought not to accuse the trainers of youth, nor expel <lb/>
            them from cities, if a pugilist does not make a good use of the <lb/>
            pugilistic art, and acts unjustly ? And so, likewise, if a rhe­ <lb/>
            torician make an unjust use of rhetoric, that we should not <lb/>
            accuse the teacher, nor expel him from the city, but the per­ <lb/>
            son who acts unjustly, and does not make a proper use of rhe­ <lb/>
            toric ? Were these things said, or not ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. They were said.</p>
          <p>Socr. But now this very same rhetorician appears incapable <lb/>
            of ever acting unjustly. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And it was said, Gorgias, at the commencement of <lb/>
            our discussion, that rhetoric is conversant with words, not <lb/>
            those respecting the even and the odd, but those respecting <lb/>
            the just and the unjust. Was it not so ?</p>
          <p>37. Gorg. It was.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, you spoke thus, I supposed that rhe­<lb/>
            <figure type="illustration">

              toric could never be an unjust thing, since it always discourses <lb/>
              concerning justice. But when you said shortly afterwards that <lb/>
              a rhetorician might use rhetoric unjustly, then, wondering, <lb/>
              and thinking that the two statements did not accord, I made <lb/>
              that remark, that if you should think it a gain to be confuted, <lb/>
              as I do, it was worth while to continue the discussion, but if <lb/>
              not, to give it up. Afterwards, however, when we were in­ <lb/>
              vestigating the matter, you see yourself that it is again allowed <lb/>
              to be impossible for a rhetorician to make an unjust use of <lb/>
              rhetoric, and to be willing to act unjustly. How the case <lb/>
              really stands, by the do-, Gorgias, requires no little discussion <lb/>
              to examine it thoroughly.</p>
          <p>38. Pol. What then, Socrates ? Have you really such an <lb/>
            opinion of rhetoric as you now say ? or do you not think <lb/>
            that Gorgias was ashamed not to acknowledge that the rheto­ <lb/>
            rician knows what is just, beautiful, and good, and that, if any <lb/>
            one should come to him ignorant of these things, he himself <lb/>
            would teach them ? Then perhaps from this admission some <lb/>
            inconsistency in his arguments followed ; the very thing which <lb/>
            you love, yourself leading the way to such questions. For who <lb/>
            do you think will deny that he knows what is just, and can <lb/>
            teach it to others ? To lead the discussion to such matters is a <lb/>
            piece of great rusticity.</p>
          <p>Boer. Most excellent Polus! we get ourselves friends and <lb/>
            sons, for this express purpose, that when we, through being <lb/>
            advanced in years, fall into error, you that are younger, being <lb/>
            with us, may correct our life both in deeds and words. If, <lb/>
            then, Gorgias and I have fallen into any error in our argu­ <lb/>
            ments, do you who are present correct us: you ought to do <lb/>
            so. And I wish that if any of the things that have been <lb/>
            granted appear to you to have been improperly granted, you <lb/>
            would retract whatever you please, only I beg you beware of <lb/>
            one thing.</p>
          <p>Pol. What is that ?</p>
          <p>39. Socr. That you would restrain that prolixity of speech <lb/>
            which at first you attempted to employ.</p>
          <p>Pol. What ? shall I not be allowed to speak as much as I <lb/>
            please ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You would indeed be very badly treated, my excel­ <lb/>
            lent friend, if, having come to Athens, where of all Greece there <lb/>
            is the greatest liberty of speech, you alone should here be de­ <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            prived of this liberty. But set this against it: if you speak in <lb/>
            a prolix manner, and will not answer a question put to you, <lb/>
            should not I be badly treated, if I am not allowed to go away <lb/>
            and not listen to you ? But if you feel any interest in the dis­ <lb/>
            cussion that has taken place, and wish to correct it, as I just <lb/>
            now said, retract whatever you please, and questioning and <lb/>
            being questioned in turn, as Gorgias and I did, confute and be <lb/>
            confuted. For you profess, surely, to know the same things as <lb/>
            Gorgias; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will not you, then, also bid any one ask you what <lb/>
            question he pleases, as knowing how to answer him.</p>
          <p>Pol. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then do whichever of these you please, ask or answer.</p>
          <p>40. Pol. I will do so; and do you answer me, Socrates. <lb/>
            Since Gorgias appears to you to be in doubt respecting rheto­ <lb/>
            ric, what do you say it is ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you ask me what kind of art I say it is ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. To tell you the truth, Polus, it does not appear to me <lb/>
            to be an art at all.</p>
          <p>Pol. What, then, does rhetoric appear to you to be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. A thing which you say produced art, in the treatise <lb/>
            which I lately read.</p>
          <p>Pol. What do you say this is ?</p>
          <p>Socr. A certain skill.</p>
          <p>Pol. Does rhetoric, then, appear to you to be skill ?</p>
          <p>Socr. To me it does, unless you say otherwise.</p>
          <p>Pol. Of what is it the skill ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Of procuring a certain gratification and pleasure.</p>
          <p>Pol. Does not rhetoric, then, appear to you to be a beauti­ <lb/>
            ful thing, since it is able to gratify mankind ?</p>
          <p>Socr. What, Polus ? Have you already heard from me what <lb/>
            I say it is, that you afterwards ask me, if it does not appear to <lb/>
            me to be beautiful ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Did I not hear you say that it is a certain skill ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Since, then, you prize giving pleasure, are you willing <lb/>
            to give me a little pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I am.</p>
          <p>41. Socr. Ask me, then, what kind of art cookery appears <lb/>
            to me to be.</p><pb n="155"/>
            
          <p>Pol. I do ask you; what kind of an art is cookery ?</p>
          <p>Socr. None at all, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. What is it? say.</p>
          <p>Socr. I say, then, it is a certain skill.</p>
          <p>Pol. Of what? say.</p>
          <p>Socr. I say, of procuring gratification and pleasure, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. Are cookery and rhetoric the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Socr. By no means, but a part of the same study.</p>
          <p>Pol. Of what study are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I fear it would be too rude to speak the truth, for I <lb/>
            hesitate to speak on account of Gorgias, lest he should think <lb/>
            that I ridicule his profession. But I know not whether this is <lb/>
            the rhetoric which Gorgias studies : for it was not at all clear <lb/>
            from our late discussion what his opinion is. But what I call <lb/>
            rhetoric is a part of a certain thing which does not rank among <lb/>
            things beautiful.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Of what thing, Socrates ? say, without fear of offend­ <lb/>
            ing me.</p>
          <p>Socr. It appears to me, then, Gorgias, to be a certain study, <lb/>
            that does not belong to art, but to a soul that is sagacious <lb/>
            and manly, and naturally powerful in its intercourse with men. <lb/>
            The sum of it I call flattery. 42. Of this study there appears <lb/>
            to me to be many other divisions, and one of them is that of <lb/>
            cookery; which, indeed, appears to be an art, but, as I main­ <lb/>
            tain, is not an art, but skill and practice. I also call rhetoric <lb/>
            a division of this, and personal decoration, and sophistry, these <lb/>
            four divisions relating to four particulars. If, therefore, Polus <lb/>
            wishes to enquire, let him enquire, for he has not yet heard <lb/>
            what division of flattery I assert rhetoric to be : but he did not <lb/>
            observe that I had not yet finished my answer, nevertheless he <lb/>
            asks me, if I do not think that it is beautiful. But I shall not <lb/>
            answer him, whether I think rhetoric is beautiful or base, till <lb/>
            I have first answered what it is. For that would not be right, <lb/>
            Polus. If then you wish to enquire, ask me what division of <lb/>
            flattery I assert rhetoric to be. '</p>
          <p>Pol. I ask, then, and do you answer, what division it is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will you understand me when I answer ? For rhetoric, <lb/>
            in my opinion, is a semblance of a division of the political art.</p>
          <p>Pol. What then ? Do you say that it is beautiful, or base ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Base, I say; for I call evil things base : since I must <lb/>
            answer you, as now knowing what I mean.</p><pb n="156"/>
            
          <p>43. Gorg. By Jupiter, Socrates, but I do not myself under­ <lb/>
            stand what you mean.</p>
          <p>Socr. Very likely, Gorgias : for I have not yet spoken <lb/>
            clearly. But Polus here is young and hasty.</p>
          <p>Gorg. But leave him alone; and tell me in what way you <lb/>
            say that rhetoric is a semblance of a division of the political <lb/>
            art.</p>
          <p>Socr. I will endeavour to tell you what rhetoric appears to <lb/>
            me to be. And if it is not such as I describe it, Polus here <lb/>
            will confute me. Do you not call body something, and soul <lb/>
            something ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not, then, think that there is a certain good <lb/>
            habit of each of these ?</p>
          <p>Gorg. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? an apparent good habit, which is not <lb/>
            really so ? for instance, to explain my meaning, many appear <lb/>
            to have a good constitution of body, whom no one but a phy­ <lb/>
            sician, and a teacher in gymnastics, could easily perceive not <lb/>
            to have a good constitution.</p>
          <p>Gorg. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. I say that there is something of this kind both in the <lb/>
            body and in the soul, which causes the body and the soul to <lb/>
            appear to be in a good condition, when they are any thing <lb/>
            but so.</p>
          <p>44. Gorg. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come now, if I can, I will explain to you more clearly <lb/>
            what I mean. As there are two subject matters, I say there <lb/>
            are two arts : and that which relates to the soul I call politi­ <lb/>
            cal, but that which relates to the body I am not able to de­ <lb/>
            scribe to you off-hand by one name ; but of the culture of the <lb/>
            body, which is one, I say there are two divisions, one gymnas­ <lb/>
            tics, the other medicine. But in the political art I lay down <lb/>
            legislation, as corresponding to gymnastics, and the judicial <lb/>
            to medicine. Now these respectively communicate with each <lb/>
            other, as being concerned about the same subject, medicine <lb/>
            with gymnastics, and the judicial art with legislation ; yet they <lb/>
            in some respect differ from each other. These then being four, <lb/>
            and always taking the best possible care, the former of the <lb/>
            body, and the latter of the soul, flattery perceiving this, I <lb/>
            do not say knowing, but sagaciously guessing it, and having <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            divided itself fourfold, and having stealthily put on the garb of <lb/>
            each of these divisions, feigns itself to be that which it has put <lb/>
            on; and it is not in the least concerned for what is best; but <lb/>
            by means of that which is most pleasant, captivates and seduces <lb/>
            ignorance, so as to appear to be of great value. 45. Cookery,' <lb/>
            therefore, puts on the garb of medicine, and pretends that it <lb/>
            knows the aliment best for the -body. So that if a cook and a <lb/>
            physician had to contend before boys, or before men as foolish <lb/>
            as boys, which of the two was acquainted with good and bad: <lb/>
            aliments, the physician or the cook, the physician would die of. <lb/>
            hunger. This, then, I call flattery;, and I say that a thing of <lb/>
            this kind is base, Polus, (for I say this to you,) because it looks <lb/>
            to what is agreeable without regard to what is best; and I <lb/>
            affirm that it is not an art, but skill, because it has no know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the things which it employs, what they severally are <lb/>
            in their nature, so that it is unable to tell the use of each. But <lb/>
            I do not call that an art which is a thing without reason. If <lb/>
            you are doubtful about these things, I am willing to give you <lb/>
            a reason for them. The flattery, then, pertaining to cookery, <lb/>
            as I have said, is concealed under medicine; and in the same <lb/>
            manner, under gymnastics, personal decoration, which is mis­ <lb/>
            chievous, deceitful, ignoble, and illiberal, deceiving by means <lb/>
            of gestures and colours, by smoothness and outward appear­ <lb/>
            ance ; so as to make men put on an adventitious beauty, and <lb/>
            neglect that which is their own, and is acquired by gymnas­ <lb/>
            tics. 46. That I may not, then, be prolix, I wish to tell you, <lb/>
            after the manner of geometricians, (for perhaps you can now <lb/>
            follow me,) that what personal decoration is to gymnastics, that <lb/>
            is cookery to medicine: or rather thus, that what personal <lb/>
            decoration is to gymnastics, that is sophistry to legislation, <lb/>
            and that what cookery is to medicine, that is rhetoric to jus­ <lb/>
            tice. As I have said, they are thus different in their nature : <lb/>
            but as they are proximate to each otherk, sophists and rhetori­ <lb/>
            cians are confounded with legislators and judges, and are em­ <lb/>
            ployed about the same things, and know not what to make <lb/>
            of themselves, nor other men of them. For, if the soul did <lb/>
            not preside over the body, but. the body over itself, and cook­ <lb/>
            ery and medicine were not examined into and distinguished by <note type="footnote"> k Bekker omits the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφισταὶ καὶ ῥήτορες</foreign>, and Ast suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικασ­ <lb/>
            ταὶ</foreign>for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφισταὶ</foreign>, in either of which cases the addition of the words ill <lb/>
            italics would be unnecessary. I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            the soul, but the body itself decided, estimating things by its <lb/>
            own gratifications, that tenet of Anaxagoras would prevail ex­ <lb/>
            tensively, friend Polus, (for you surely are acquainted with it,) <lb/>
            that is, all things would be confounded together, things medi­ <lb/>
            cinal, and healthy, and pertaining to cookery, being undistin­ <lb/>
            guished from each other. 47. You have heard, therefore, <lb/>
            what I consider rhetoric to be, corresponding to cookery in <lb/>
            the soul, as that in the body. Perhaps, however, I have acted <lb/>
            absurdly, in that, though I do not allow you to make a long <lb/>
            speech, I myself have extended mine to a great length. But <lb/>
            I deserve to be pardoned: for when I spoke briefly you did <lb/>
            not understand me, nor were you able to make use of the an­ <lb/>
            swer that I gave you, but required an explanation. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, when you answer, I in my turn shall not know what to <lb/>
            make of it, do you also prolong your discourse : but, if I do <lb/>
            know, suffer me to do so ; for that is fair. And now, if you <lb/>
            can make any use of this answer, do so.</p>
          <p>Pol. What do you say, then ? Does rhetoric appear to you <lb/>
            to be flattery ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I said, indeed, that it was a division of flattery. But <lb/>
            do not you remember, Polus, though so young? What will <lb/>
            you do by and by ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Does it seem to you, then, that good rhetoricians are <lb/>
            to be esteemed as vile flatterers in cities ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you ask this as a question, or are you beginning <lb/>
            an argument?</p>
          <p>Pol. I ask a question.</p>
          <p>48. Socr. They appear to me to be of no estimation at all.</p>
          <p>Pol. How to be of no estimation? Have they not the <lb/>
            greatest power in cities ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Not, if you mean that to have power is a good to <lb/>
            him who possesses it.</p>
          <p>Pol. But I do say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. In that case, rhetoricians appear to me to possess the <lb/>
            least power of all men in cities.</p>
          <p>Pol. But what ? do they not, like tyrants, slay whomever <lb/>
            they please, and deprive of their property, and banish from <lb/>
            cities whomever they think fit ?</p>
          <p>Socr. By the do-, Polus, I am doubtful with respect to each <lb/>
            of the things you say, whether you assert these things your­ <lb/>
            self, and declare your own opinion, or ask me.</p><pb n="159"/>
            
          <p>Pol. I ask you.</p>
          <p>Socr. Be it so, my friend. Then you ask me two questions <lb/>
            at once.</p>
          <p>Pol. How two?</p>
          <p>Socr. Did you not just now say, that rhetoricians, like ty­ <lb/>
            rants, slay whomever they please, and deprive them of their <lb/>
            property, and banish from cities whomever they think fit ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I did.</p>
          <p>49. Socr. I say, then, that these are two questions, and I <lb/>
            will give you an answer to both. For I affirm, Polus, that <lb/>
            rhetoricians and tyrants have very little power in cities, as I <lb/>
            just now said: for they do scarcely any thing that they wish, <lb/>
            though they do what to them appears to be best.</p>
          <p>Pol. Is not this, then, to possess great power ?</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not, at least as Polus says.</p>
          <p>Pol. I say not ? On the contrary, I say it is.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Jupiter, not you. For you said that to have great <lb/>
            power is a good to him who possesses it.</p>
          <p>Pol. And I repeat it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you think, then, it is a good for any one to do <lb/>
            what appears to him to be best, when he is void of understand­ <lb/>
            ing ? And do you call this to possess great power ?</p>
          <p>50. Pol. Not I.</p>
          <p>Socr. Prove, therefore, that rhetoricians are possessed of <lb/>
            understanding, and that rhetoric is an art, and not flattery, if <lb/>
            you mean to confute me. But, if you will leave me uncon­ <lb/>
            futed, rhetoricians and tyrants, who do in cities whatever they <lb/>
            please, will derive no good from thence. Power is, as you say, <lb/>
            good; but to do, without understanding, whatever one pleases, <lb/>
            you yourself admit is an evil. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. How then can rhetoricians or tyrants have great power <lb/>
            in cities, unless Socrates is persuaded by Polus to admit that <lb/>
            they do what they wish ?</p>
          <p>Pol. What a strange man!</p>
          <p>Socr. I deny that they do what they wish : but confute me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Did you not just now admit that they do what appears <lb/>
            to them to be best ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And I now admit it.</p>
          <p>Pol. They do, therefore, what they wish.</p>
          <p>Socr. I deny it.</p><pb n="160"/>
            
          <p>Pol. But they do what appears best to them ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I grant it.</p>
          <p>Pol. You speak absurdly and monstrously, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do not accuse me, most excellent Polus, that I may <lb/>
            address you in your own style; but, if you have any other <lb/>
            question to ask me, shew that I am deceived; if not, do you <lb/>
            answer me.</p>
          <p>Pol. I am willing to answer, in order that I may know what <lb/>
            you mean.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether, then, do men appear to you to wish the <lb/>
            thing that they do from time to time, or that for the sake of <lb/>
            which they do the thing that they do ? As for instance, do those <lb/>
            who drink medicine from physicians appear to you to wish the <lb/>
            thing that they do, viz., to drink the medicine, and suffer pain, <lb/>
            or do they wish to be well, for the sake of which they drink <lb/>
            the medicine ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It is clear they wish to be well, for the sake of which <lb/>
            they drink the medicine.</p>
          <p>Socr. In like manner those who sail on the sea, and those <lb/>
            who carry on any other commercial business, do not wish the <lb/>
            thing that they do from time to time: for who wishes to sail <lb/>
            and to encounter danger, and to be harassed with business; <lb/>
            but the object for which they sail is to acquire riches; for <lb/>
            they sail for the sake of riches.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not so then in all cases ? whosoever does any <lb/>
            thing for the sake of some thing else, does not wish the thing <lb/>
            that he does, but that for the sake of which he does it.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>52. Socr. Is there any thing in the world, then, that is not <lb/>
            either good or evil, or between these, neither good nor evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It must needs be so, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not admit then, that wisdom, and health, and <lb/>
            riches, and other things of the same kind, are good, but their <lb/>
            contraries evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. By the things that are neither good nor evil do you <lb/>
            not mean such as sometimes partake of good,sometimes of <lb/>
            evil, and sometimes of neither, as to sit, to walk, to run, and <lb/>
            to sail, and again, stones, wood, and other things of the same <lb/>
            kind? Are not these the things that you mean? Or do you <lb/>
            call certain other things neither good nor evil ?</p><pb n="161"/>
            
          <p>Pol. No, but these.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether, therefore, do men, when they do these inter­ <lb/>
            mediate things, do them for the sake of the good, or the good <lb/>
            for the sake of the intermediate.</p>
          <p>Pol. The intermediate, surely, for the sake of the good.</p>
          <p>Socr. Pursuing the good, therefore, we both walk when we <lb/>
            walk, thinking it better, and, on the contrary, we stand when <lb/>
            we stand, for the sake of the same thing, viz., the good. Is <lb/>
            it not so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>53. Socr. Do we not, therefore, if we slay any one, slay, <lb/>
            or banish, or deprive him of his possessions, thinking that it <lb/>
            is better for us to do so than not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. They, therefore, who do these things do them all for <lb/>
            the sake of good.</p>
          <p>Pol. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are we not agreed, then, that we do not wish those <lb/>
            things which we do for the sake of something else, but that <lb/>
            for the sake of which we do them ?</p>
          <p>Pol. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr.. We do not, then, wish simply to slay, or banish from <lb/>
            cities, or deprive any one of his possessions ; but if these things <lb/>
            are useful we wish to do them, but if they are hurtful we do <lb/>
            not wish to do them. For we wish, as you admit, things that <lb/>
            are good, but we do not wish such as are neither good nor evil, <lb/>
            nor such as are evil. Is it not so ? Do I seem to you, Polus, <lb/>
            to speak the truth, or not? Why do you not answer?</p>
          <p>Pol. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Socr. Since then we are agreed on these things, if any one <lb/>
            slays, banishes from a city, or deprives another of his posses <lb/>
            sions, whether he is a tyrant or a rhetorician, thinking that <lb/>
            it is better for him so to do, though it is really worse, he <lb/>
            surely does what seems fit to him : is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does he, then, do what he wishes, if these things are <lb/>
            really evil ? Why do you not answer ?</p>
          <p>Pol. He does not appear to me to do what he wishes.</p>
          <p>54. Socr. Is it possible, then, that such a man can have <lb/>
            great power in the supposed city, if, according to your admis­ <lb/>
            sion, to have great power is a good ? <note type="footnote"> M </note></p><pb n="162"/>
            
          <p>Pol. It is not possible.</p>
          <p>Socr. I spoke truly, then, when I said that it is possible for <lb/>
            a man to do what he pleases in a city, and yet not have great <lb/>
            power, nor do what he wishes.</p>
          <p>Pol. As if, Socrates, you yourself would not like to be <lb/>
            allowed to do what you please in a city, rather than not, <lb/>
            and would not be envious when you saw any one either slay­ <lb/>
            ing whom he pleased, or taking away his possessions, or putting <lb/>
            him in bonds.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you mean justly or unjustly?</p>
          <p>Pol. Whichever he should do, is he not in either case to <lb/>
            be envied ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Good words, I pray you, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. -But why ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Because it is not right, either to envy those that are <lb/>
            not to be envied, or the wretched; but to pity them.</p>
          <p>Pol. What say you? Does such appear to you to be the <lb/>
            case with the men of whom I am speaking ?</p>
          <p>55. Socr. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Does he, then, who slays whom he pleases, slaying <lb/>
            hiin justly, appear to you to be wretched, and an object <lb/>
            of pity ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Not at all; nor indeed is he to be envied.</p>
          <p>Pol. Did you not say just now that he was wretched ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I said, my friend, that he is wretched who slays an­ <lb/>
            other unjustly, and more than that, to be pitied; but that he <lb/>
            who slays another justly is not to be envied.</p>
          <p>Pol. He surely who dies unjustly is to be pitied, and is <lb/>
            wretched.</p>
          <p>Socr. Less so, Polus, than he who slays him; and less than <lb/>
            he who dies justly?</p>
          <p>Pol. How so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Thus; because to act unjustly is the greatest of evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. But is this really the greatest of evils? Is it not a <lb/>
            greater evil to suffer unjustly?</p>
          <p>Socr. By no means.</p>
          <p>Pol. Had you, then, rather suffer unjustly than act un­ <lb/>
            justly?</p>
          <p>Socr. I should wish neither of these: but if I must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily either act unjustly or suffer unjustly, I should choose <lb/>
            rather to suffer unjustly than to act unjustly.</p><pb n="163"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Would you not, then, consent to be a tyrant?</p>
          <p>Socr. I would not, if by being a tyrant you mean the same <lb/>
            that I do.</p>
          <p>Pol. I mean by it what I just now said, to have the power <lb/>
            to do in a city whatever one pleases; to slay and banish, and <lb/>
            do every thing according to one's own pleasure.</p>
          <p>56. Socr. My excellent friend, attend to what I say, and <lb/>
            confute me if you can. If, when the forum is full, I should <lb/>
            take a dagger under my arm, and say to you, Polus, a certain <lb/>
            wonderful power and tyranny has just now fallen to my lot: <lb/>
            for, if it seems fit to me that any one of these men whom <lb/>
            you see ought immediately to die, he shall die; and if it <lb/>
            seems fit to me that any one of them ought to have his head <lb/>
            broken, he shall immediately have it broken; or if that his <lb/>
            garment should be torn to pieces, it shall be torn to pieces: so <lb/>
            great is the power I possess in the city. And if, on your dis­ <lb/>
            believing me, I should shew you the dagger, perhaps, on see­ <lb/>
            ing it, you would say: According to this, Socrates, all men <lb/>
            may have great power, since any house that you please might <lb/>
            be burnt in this way, and even the dock-yards of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, and the triremes, and all the shipping, as well public as <lb/>
            private. But surely this is not to possess great power, to do <lb/>
            whatever one pleases: do you think so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly not in this way.</p>
          <p>Socr. Can you tell me, then, why you blame a power of this <lb/>
            kind ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I can.</p>
          <p>Soer. Why then ? tell me.</p>
          <p>Pol. Because it must needs be that one who acts thus should <lb/>
            be punished.</p>
          <p>Socr. But is not the being punished an evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>57. Soer. Therefore, my excellent friend, to have great <lb/>
            power appears to you to be, when advantage attends one's <lb/>
            doing what one pleases, and then it is a good; and this, as it <lb/>
            seems, is to have great power; but if not, it is an evil, and to <lb/>
            have little power. Let us consider this too. Are we not <lb/>
            agreed that it is sometimes better to do the things which we <lb/>
            just now spoke of, to slay, to banish men, and deprive them of <lb/>
            their property, and sometimes not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p><pb n="164"/>
            
          <p>Socr. This, then, as it seems, is agreed on both by you and me?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, then, do you say it is better to do these things ? <lb/>
            Tell me what limit you establish ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Do you, Socrates, answer this question:</p>
          <p>Socr. I say, then, Polus, since it is more agreeable to you to <lb/>
            hear it from me, when any one does these things justly, it is <lb/>
            better, but when unjustly, it is worse.</p>
          <p>Pol. Forsooth, it is difficult to confute you, Socrates! but <lb/>
            could not even a child convince you that you do not speak the <lb/>
            truth ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I should be very much obliged to the child, and equally <lb/>
            so to you, if you can confute me, and free me from my extra­ <lb/>
            vagances. But be not weary in obliging a man who is your <lb/>
            friend, but confute me.</p>
          <p>58. Pol. However, Socrates, there is no need to confute you <lb/>
            by ancient examples. For things that have recently happened <lb/>
            are sufficient to confute you, and to prove that many men who <lb/>
            have acted unjustly are happy.</p>
          <p>Socr. What are these ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Do you not see, for instance, this Archelaus, son of <lb/>
            Perdiccas, ruler of Macedonia ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If not, at all events I hear of him.</p>
          <p>Pol. Does he appear to you to be happy or miserable ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I do not know, Polus: for I have never yet had any <lb/>
            intercourse with him.</p>
          <p>Pol. What then? if you had intercourse with him, should <lb/>
            you know ? And do you not know otherwise, from the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances of the case, that he is happy ?</p>
          <p>Socr. By Jupiter, certainly not.</p>
          <p>Pol. It is evident then, Socrates, you will say, that you do <lb/>
            not even know whether the great king is happy ?</p>
          <p>Soer. And I should say the truth. For I do not know what <lb/>
            his state is with regard to enlightenment and justice.</p>
          <p>Pol. What ? Does all happiness consist in this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. In my opinion, Polus. For I say that an honest and <lb/>
            good man or woman is happy; but an unjust and wicked one <lb/>
            is miserable.</p>
          <p>Pol. This Archelaus, then, is miserable, according to your <lb/>
            account ?</p>
          <p>Socr. At least, my friend, if he is unjust.</p><pb n="165"/>
            
          <p>59. Pol. But how can he be otherwise than unjust, who had <lb/>
            no right to the empire which he now possesses, as he was born <lb/>
            of a woman who was the. slave of Alcetas, brother of Perdiccas, <lb/>
            and according to justice was the slave of Alcetas, and, if he <lb/>
            had wished to do what is just, would have served Alcetas as a <lb/>
            slave, and would have been happy, according to your account ? <lb/>
            whereas now he has become wonderfully miserable, since he <lb/>
            has committed the greatest injustice. For, first of all, having <lb/>
            sent for this his master and uncle, as if he would restore the <lb/>
            government which Perdiccas had taken from him, and having <lb/>
            entertained and intoxicated both him and his son Alexander, <lb/>
            his own cousin, and nearly his equal in age, he forced them <lb/>
            into a carriage, and having carried them off by night, had <lb/>
            their throats cut and made away with them both. And after <lb/>
            he had committed these wrongs, he was not aware that he had <lb/>
            become most miserable, and did not repent, but shortly after­ <lb/>
            wards, he did not wish to become happy by nurturing his legi­ <lb/>
            timate brother, the son of Perdiccas, a child about seven years <lb/>
            of age, to whom the government of right belonged, and by <lb/>
            restoring it to him; but having thrown him into a well, and <lb/>
            suffocated him, he told his mother Cleopatra that he had fallen <lb/>
            in in pursuing a goose, and so met with his death. 60. Where­ <lb/>
            fore since he has committed the greatest wrongs of all in Mace­ <lb/>
            donia, he is the most miserable of all the Macedonians, and <lb/>
            not the most happy. And perhaps there are some among the <lb/>
            Athenians, beginning with you, who would rather be any other <lb/>
            of the Macedonians than Archelaus.</p>
          <p>Socr. At the beginning of our conference, Polus, I praised <lb/>
            you, because you appeared to me to be well instructed in rhe­ <lb/>
            toric, though you had neglected the art of dialectics. And <lb/>
            now, what else is this reasoning, by which even a child could <lb/>
            confute me, and I, as you suppose, am now confuted by this <lb/>
            reasoning of yours, when I said that a man who acts unjustly <lb/>
            is not happy? How so, my friend? For I do not grant you <lb/>
            any one of the things you assert.</p>
          <p>Pol. Because you are not willing to do so; though it ap­ <lb/>
            pears to you as I say.</p>
          <p>Socr. My excellent friend, you attempt to confute me rheto­ <lb/>
            rically, like those who think they confute their adversaries in <lb/>
            courts of justice. For there some fancy they confute others <lb/>
            , when they produce many reputable witnesses in favour of what <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            they say, whereas the adverse party produces some one only, <lb/>
            or none at all. 61. But this mode of confutation is worth <lb/>
            nothing with reference to truth. For sometimes a man may <lb/>
            be borne down by the false testimony of many witnesses who <lb/>
            seem to be somewhat. And now, with respect to what you <lb/>
            say, almost all the Athenians and strangers will agree with <lb/>
            you, and if you wish to produce witnesses against me to prove <lb/>
            that I do not speak the truth, there will testify for you, if you <lb/>
            wish it, Nicias, son of Niceratus, and his brothers with him, <lb/>
            who gave the tripods that stand in a row in the temple of Bac­ <lb/>
            chus ; or again, if you wish it, Aristocrates, son of Scellius, <lb/>
            who gave that beautiful offering in the temple of Pythian <lb/>
            Apollo; or if you wish it, the whole house of Pericles, or any <lb/>
            other family, that you may think proper to choose out of this <lb/>
            city. But I, who am but one, do not agree with you. For <lb/>
            you do not convince me by arguments, but producing many <lb/>
            false witnesses against me, you endeavour to eject me from my <lb/>
            substance and the truth. But I, unless I shall be able to ad­ <lb/>
            duce you, who are one, as a witness agreeing with what I say, <lb/>
            shall think that I have accomplished nothing worthy of men­ <lb/>
            tion with respect to the subject of our discussion; nor shall I <lb/>
            think that you have done so, unless I, being one, alone testify <lb/>
            for you, and you dismiss all those others. 62. This, then, is <lb/>
            one mode of refutation, as you and many others think: but <lb/>
            there is also another mode, which, on the contrary, I adopt. <lb/>
            Let us, therefore, compare them with each other, and consider <lb/>
            whether they differ at all from one another. For the matters <lb/>
            about which we differ are by no means trifling; but they are <lb/>
            indeed such as to know which is most honourable, and not to <lb/>
            know most disgraceful, for the sum of them is to know, or to <lb/>
            be ignorant, who is happy, and who is not. For instance, in <lb/>
            the first place, with respect to the subject of our present dis­ <lb/>
            cussion, you think it possible that a man may be happy who <lb/>
            acts unjustly and is unjust; since you think that Archelaus, <lb/>
            though unjust, is happy. Must we not suppose that such is <lb/>
            your opinion ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But I say it is impossible. On this one point, then, <lb/>
            we differ. Be it so. But will he who acts unjustly be happy <lb/>
            if he meet with justice and is punished ?</p>
          <p>Pol. By no means, for in that case he would be most miserable.</p><pb n="167"/>
            
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, he who acts unjustly does not meet with <lb/>
            the punishment he deserves, according to your account he will <lb/>
            be happy.</p>
          <p>Pol. So I say.</p>
          <p>63. Socr. But, according to my opinion, Polus, he who <lb/>
            acts unjustly, and is unjust, is in every way miserable ; though <lb/>
            more miserable if he does not suffer punishment, and does not <lb/>
            meet with chastisement for his unjust actions; but less miser­ <lb/>
            able if he suffers punishment, and meets with his just deserts <lb/>
            both from gods and men.</p>
          <p>Pol<foreign xml:lang="grc">´</foreign>. You attempt, Socrates, to advance strange para­ <lb/>
            doxes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet I shall endeavour, my friend, to make you say <lb/>
            the same things as I do : for I consider you as a friend. Now, <lb/>
            then, the things about which we differ are these: and do you <lb/>
            also consider. I said in a former part of our discussion, that <lb/>
            to commit an injustice is worse than to suffer one.</p>
          <p>Pol. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But you say it is worse to suffer an injustice.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And I said that they who act unjustly are miserable, <lb/>
            and was confuted by you.</p>
          <p>Pol. You were so, by Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Socr. At least as you think, Polus.</p>
          <p>Pol. And I probably thought the truth.</p>
          <p>Socr. But you, on the contrary, said that they who act un­ <lb/>
            justly are happy, if they do not suffer punishment.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But I say that they are most miserable; and that <lb/>
            they who suffer punishment are less so. Do you wish to re­ <lb/>
            fute this also ?</p>
          <p>64. But this is more difficult to refute than the former, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. By no means, Polus, but it is impossible; for truth <lb/>
            can never be refuted.</p>
          <p>Pol. How say you? If a man should be detected acting <lb/>
            unjustly, as in attempting to compass absolute power, and <lb/>
            being detected should be put to the torture, be mutilated, and <lb/>
            have his eyes burnt out, and after having himself suffered <lb/>
            many other great and various torments, and having moreover <lb/>
            seen his children and wife suffer the same, should at last be <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            crucified, or covered with pitch and burnt, will he be more <lb/>
            happy, than if, having escaped punishment, he should become <lb/>
            a tyrant, and ruling in the city, should pass through life doing <lb/>
            whatever he pleases, being envied, and accounted happy, both <lb/>
            by citizens and strangers ? Do you say that it is impossible to <lb/>
            refute these things ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You are now trying to terrify me, noble Polus, and <lb/>
            do not refute me; but just now you adduced witnesses. How­ <lb/>
            ever, remind me of a trifling circumstance; did you say, if a <lb/>
            person should attempt unjustly to compass absolute power ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I did.</p>
          <p>Socr. In that case, neither of them will ever be happier than <lb/>
            the other, neither he who has unjustly acquired absolute power, <lb/>
            nor he who has been punished. For, of two miserable per­ <lb/>
            sons, one cannot be happier than the other; but he is more <lb/>
            miserable who escapes punishment and acquires absolute <lb/>
            power. 65. What is this, Polus ? do you laugh? Is this <lb/>
            another species of refutation, when any one asserts any thing, <lb/>
            to laugh at him, and not refute him ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Do you not think you are already refuted. Socrates, <lb/>
            when you say such things as no man in the world would <lb/>
            assert ? for ask any one of these.</p>
          <p>Socr. Polus, I am not among the number of politicians: <lb/>
            and last year, happening to be chosen a senator, since my <lb/>
            tribe held the presidency and it was necessary for me to col­ <lb/>
            lect the votes, I occasioned laughter, because I did not know <lb/>
            how to collect them. Do not, then, require me to collect the <lb/>
            votes of those who are present. But if you have no better <lb/>
            mode of refutation than this, as I just now said, give the ques­ <lb/>
            tion up to me in my turn, and make trial of that mode of refu­ <lb/>
            tation which I think ought to be adopted. For I know how <lb/>
            to procure one witness of what I say, that is, the person with <lb/>
            whom I am discoursing, but I let alone the multitude; and I <lb/>
            know how to take the vote of one person, but I do not even <lb/>
            discourse with the multitude. Consider, then, whether you <lb/>
            are willing in your turn to give me an opportunity of refuting <lb/>
            by answering the questions I shall put to you. For I think, <lb/>
            that you and I, and other men, are of opinion, that to commit <lb/>
            injustice is worse than to suffer it; and not to be punished, <lb/>
            than to be punished.</p>
          <p>66. Pol. But I, on the contrary, think that neither myself <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            nor any other man is of this opinion. For would you rather <lb/>
            suffer injustice than commit it ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Yes, and you, and all other men.</p>
          <p>Pol. Far from it; neither would you, nor I, nor any other <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will you not answer, then ?</p>
          <p>Pol. By all means. For I am anxious to know what you <lb/>
            will say.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me then, that you may know, as if I asked you <lb/>
            from the beginning: whether does it appear to you, Polus, <lb/>
            worse to commit an injustice or to suffer one ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To suffer one, in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? whether is it more base to commit an <lb/>
            injustice or to suffer one ? Answer me.</p>
          <p>Pol. To commit an injustice.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, therefore, worse, since it is more base ?</p>
          <p>Pol. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. I understand. You do not think, as it seems, that <lb/>
            the beautiful and the good, and the evil and the base, are the <lb/>
            same ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what do you say to-this? Beautiful things in <lb/>
            general, such as bodies, colours, forms, sounds, and pursuits, <lb/>
            do you call them severally beautiful, without reference to any <lb/>
            thing else ? As, for instance, first of all, with respect to beau­ <lb/>
            tiful bodies, do you not say that they are beautiful, on account <lb/>
            of their usefulness, in reference to the particular thing for <lb/>
            which each is useful, or on account of some pleasure, if in <lb/>
            being seen they give delight to the beholders ? Have you any <lb/>
            thing else besides this to say respecting beauty of body ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I have not.</p>
          <p>67. Socr. Do you not, then, denominate all other things in <lb/>
            the same manner beautiful, such as forms and colours, either <lb/>
            on account of some pleasure, or utility, or both ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not the case the same as to sounds, and every <lb/>
            thing that relates to music ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And moreover, with respect to laws and pursuits, they <lb/>
            surely are beautiful, for no other reason except that they are <lb/>
            either useful, or pleasant, or both ?</p><pb n="170"/>
            
          <p>Pol. So it appears to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is it not the same with the beauty of the sciences ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly. And now, Socrates, you define beautifully, <lb/>
            in defining the beautiful by pleasure and good.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must not, therefore, the base be defined by the con­ <lb/>
            trary, by pain and evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, of two beautiful things, one is more <lb/>
            beautiful than the other, it is more beautiful because it excels <lb/>
            in one or both of these, either in pleasure, or utility, or both.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And when of two things one is more base than the <lb/>
            other, it must be more base because it exceeds in pain or evil: <lb/>
            is not this necessarily so?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>68. Socr. Come then; what did we say just now respecting <lb/>
            committing injustice and suffering it ? Did you not say that <lb/>
            to suffer injustice is more evil, but to commit it, more base ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I did say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, since it is more base to commit injustice <lb/>
            than to suffer it, it must be more base because it is more pain­ <lb/>
            ful and exceeds in pain, or evil, or both. Is not this also <lb/>
            necessary ?</p>
          <p>Pol. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. First, then, let us consider whether to commit injus­ <lb/>
            tice exceeds in pain the suffering it; and whether they who <lb/>
            commit injustice feel greater pain than they who suffer it.</p>
          <p>Pol. This is by no means the case, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. It does not, then, exceed in pain ?</p>
          <p>Pol. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, if it does not exceed in pain, it will no <lb/>
            longer exceed in both.</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears not.</p>
          <p>Socr. It remains, therefore, that it exceeds in the other.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. In the evil.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. Since, therefore, to commit injustice exceeds in evil, <lb/>
            it must be more evil than to suffer injustice.</p>
          <p>Pol. Evidently so.</p>
          <p>69. Socr. Was it not admitted by men in general, and by <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            you to me formerly, that it is more base to commit injustice <lb/>
            than to suffer it?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now, however, it appears to be worse.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. Would you, then, rather choose that which is worse <lb/>
            and more base, than that which is less so ? Do not hesitate <lb/>
            to answer, Polus, (for you will not be injured by so doing,) <lb/>
            but answer, giving yourself up generously to the discussion <lb/>
            as to a physician; and either admit or deny the question I <lb/>
            ask.</p>
          <p>Pol. Then I should not rather choose it, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Would any other man in the world ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To me it appears not, according to what has been said. <lb/>
            Socr. I therefore said truly, that neither you, nor I, nor any <lb/>
            other man in the world, would rather choose to commit in­ <lb/>
            justice than to suffer it; for it is worse to do so.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Socr. You see then, Polus, that my mode of proof when <lb/>
            compared with your mode of proof, does not at all resemble <lb/>
            it; but all others agree with you, except myself. For my <lb/>
            part you alone are sufficient for my purpose, agreeing with me <lb/>
            and testifying for me ; and I, having asked your opinion only, <lb/>
            disregard that of others. Let this then be settled between us. <lb/>
            And next, let us proceed to consider that which we doubted <lb/>
            about in the second place, viz. whether it is the. greatest of <lb/>
            evils for one who has committed injustice to be punished, as <lb/>
            you thought, or whether it is not a greater evil not to be <lb/>
            punished, as I thought. And let us consider it thus: To <lb/>
            suffer punishment and to be justly chastised, when one has <lb/>
            committed injustice, do you not call the same thing?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Can you say, then, that all just things are not beautiful, <lb/>
            so far as they are just? When you have well considered, <lb/>
            answer me.</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears to me that they are, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider this also: When a man does any thing, <lb/>
            must there not necessarily be something which is passive to <lb/>
            him as an agent ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr And does not the patient suffer what the agent does, <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            and just such a thing as the agent does? I mean in this way: <lb/>
            If any one strikes, is it not necessary that something should be <lb/>
            struck ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It is necessary.</p>
          <p>Socr. And if the striker strikes hard or swiftly, must not the <lb/>
            thing struck be stricken accordingly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soer. That which is struck, then, undergoes a passion cor­ <lb/>
            responding to that which the striker does.</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>71. Socr. In like manner, if any one burns, is it not neces­ <lb/>
            sary that something should be burnt?</p>
          <p>Pol. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And if he burns vehemently or painfully, that which <lb/>
            is burnt must be burnt according as the burner burns ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. So, if any one cuts any thing, is not the reasoning the <lb/>
            same ? for something is cut.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And if the cut is large or deep, or painful, that which <lb/>
            is cut is cut with such a cut as the cutter cuts.</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. In a word, then, see if you grant what I just now said <lb/>
            respecting every thing, viz., that according as the agent does, <lb/>
            so the patient suffers.</p>
          <p>Pol. I do grant it.</p>
          <p>Socr. These things, then, being agreed on, whether is the <lb/>
            being punished, to suffer, or to do something ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily, Socrates, it is to suffer.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must it not, therefore, be by some agent ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Undoubtedly : by him who chastises.</p>
          <p>Socr. But does not he who chastises rightly, chastise <lb/>
            justly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Doing what is just, or not?</p>
          <p>Pol. What is just.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then, does not he who is chastised, when he is <lb/>
            deservedly punished, suffer justly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what is just has been acknowledged to be <lb/>
            beautiful.</p><pb n="173"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Of these, then, the one does, and the other, he that is <lb/>
            chastised, suffers that which is beautiful.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr And if beautiful, then good; for that which is beauti­ <lb/>
            ful is either pleasant or useful.</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr He therefore who is punished suffers that which is <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>72. Socr He is therefore benefited.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it with such a benefit as I suppose? Does he be-, <lb/>
            come better as to his soul, since he is chastised justly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. That is probable.</p>
          <p>Socr. He, therefore, who is punished is freed from a vice of <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is he not freed, then, from the greatest evil? Con­ <lb/>
            sider the matter thus: in the condition of a man's property <lb/>
            do you perceive any other evil than poverty ?</p>
          <p>Pol. No other than poverty.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well, in the constitution of the body? would you say <lb/>
            that weakness, disease, deformity, and the like, are evils ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I should.</p>
          <p>Soer. Do you not think, too, that there is a certain depra­ <lb/>
            vity in the soul ?</p>
          <p>Pol. How otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr Do you not then call this injustice, ignorance, coward­ <lb/>
            ice, and the like ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have you not said, then, that of these three, property, <lb/>
            body, and soul, there are three corresponding evils, poverty, <lb/>
            disease, injustice ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr Then which of these evils is the most base ? Is it not <lb/>
            injustice, and, in a word, the depravity of the soul?</p>
          <p>Pol. By far.</p>
          <p>Socr But, if it is most base, then is it not also the <lb/>
            worst ?</p>
          <p>Pol. How mean you, Socrates ?</p><pb n="174"/>
            
          <p>73. Socr. Thus. In every case, that which is most base is <lb/>
            so because, from what has been before admitted, it occasions <lb/>
            the greatest pain, or harm, or both.</p>
          <p>Pol. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. But injustice and the whole depravity of the soul, <lb/>
            have been just now admitted by us to be most base.</p>
          <p>Pol. They have been so admitted.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, therefore, the most troublesome and most <lb/>
            base of these depravities, because it exceeds either in trouble­ <lb/>
            someness or hurtfulness, or both ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is then the being unjust, intemperate, cowardly, and <lb/>
            ignorant, more painful than to be poor and diseased ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It does not appear so to me, Socrates, from what has <lb/>
            been said.</p>
          <p>Socr. The depravity of the soul, then, is the most base of <lb/>
            all, because it exceeds the others by some extraordinarily <lb/>
            great harm and wonderful evil, since, according to your argu­ <lb/>
            ment, it is not exceeded in painfulness.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, surely, that which exceeds in the greatest harm­ <lb/>
            fulness must be the greatest evil of all ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then injustice, intemperance, and the other depravi­ <lb/>
            ties of the soul, are the greatest evils of all.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>74. Socr. What art, then, frees from poverty? Is it not <lb/>
            that of money-making ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. What, from disease ? Is it not the medicinal ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. What, from depravity and injustice ? If in this way <lb/>
            vou cannot readily answer, consider it thus: whither, and to <lb/>
            whom, do we take those that are diseased in body ?</p>
          <p>Pol. To physicians, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether those who act unjustly, and are intemperate ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Do you mean, to the judges ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, then, that they may be punished ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I grant it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do not then those who chastise rightly chastise by <lb/>
            employing a certain justice ?</p><pb n="175"/>
            
          <p>Pol. Clearly.</p>
          <p>Socr. The art of money-making, therefore, frees from poverty, <lb/>
            medicine from disease, and justice from intemperance and in­ <lb/>
            justice.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Socr Which of these, therefore, is the most beautiful ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Of what are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The art of money-making, medicine, and justice.</p>
          <p>Pol. Justice, Socrates, is far superior.</p>
          <p>Socr Does it not, then, produce the greatest pleasure, or <lb/>
            utility, or both, since it is the most beautiful r</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>75. Socr. Is it, then, pleasant to be under the care of a <lb/>
            physician ? and do they who are under such charge rejoice ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It does not appear so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is useful. Is it not ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. For they are freed from a great evil; so that it is <lb/>
            advantageous to endure pain and be restored to health.</p>
          <p>Pol. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Would the man then, thus be most happy with respect <lb/>
            to his body who is under the care of a physician, or who is not <lb/>
            diseased at all ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Clearly he that is not diseased.</p>
          <p>Soer. For this is not happiness, as it seems, the being freed <lb/>
            from evil; but the never possessing it at all.</p>
          <p>Pol. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? Of two men that have evil, either in body <lb/>
            or soul, which is the more miserable, he that is under the care of <lb/>
            a physician, and is freed from the evil, or he that is not under <lb/>
            the care of a physician, and retains the evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears to me, he that is not under the care of a <lb/>
            physician.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not punishment the being freed from the <lb/>
            greatest evil, depravity ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. For justice produces a sound mind, makes men more <lb/>
            just, and becomes the medicine of depravity ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>76. Socr. He, then, is most happy who has no vice in his <lb/>
            soul, since this is proved to be the greatest of evils.</p><pb n="176"/>
            
          <p>Pol. It is evident.</p>
          <p>Socr. The second, surely, is he who is freed from it.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. But this is he who is admonished, reproved, and <lb/>
            punished.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. He, therefore, lives worst, who is afflicted with in­ <lb/>
            justice, and is not freed from it.</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is not, then, he one who, having committed the <lb/>
            greatest injustice, and employing the greatest injustice, con­ <lb/>
            trives that he may be neither admonished, nor chastised, nor <lb/>
            punished, as you said was the case with Archelaus, and other <lb/>
            tyrants, rhetoricians, and powerful men ?</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. For these, my excellent friend, have managed much <lb/>
            the same as one who being afflicted with the worst diseases <lb/>
            should contrive not to have his bodily maladies corrected or <lb/>
            subjected to medical treatment, fearing, as if he were a child, to <lb/>
            be burnt and cut, because these operations are painful. Does <lb/>
            it not appear so to you ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It does.</p>
          <p>Socr. Being ignorant, as it seems, of what health is, and a <lb/>
            good habit of the body. 77. Now from what we have just <lb/>
            agreed on, Polus, those who flee from punishment appear to <lb/>
            do something of this kind; they look to the pain attending it, <lb/>
            but are blind to its utility, and are ignorant how much more <lb/>
            miserable than an unhealthy body it is to dwell with an un­ <lb/>
            healthy soul, that is corrupt, unjust, and impious. Whence <lb/>
            they do every thing that they may not be punished, nor freed <lb/>
            from the greatest evil, procuring for themselves riches and <lb/>
            friends, and the power of speaking as persuasively as possible. <lb/>
            But if we have agreed on what is true, Polus, do you perceive <lb/>
            what consequences result from our discourse r do you wish that <lb/>
            we should draw the conclusions from them ?</p>
          <p>Pol. I do, unless you think otherwise.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does it not follow that injustice and to act unjustly is <lb/>
            the greatest evil ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And to suffer punishment was proved to be a means <lb/>
            of freedom from this evil.</p><pb n="177"/>
            
          <p>Pol. It appears to be so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But not to suffer punishment is a continuance of the <lb/>
            evil.</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. To act unjustly, therefore, is the second of evils in <lb/>
            magnitude; but to act unjustly and not to suffer punishment <lb/>
            is the greatest and chief of all evils.</p>
          <p>Pol. So it seems.</p>
          <p>78. Socr. Was not this the point, my friend, with respect <lb/>
            to which we differed, you considering Archelaus happy, for <lb/>
            that having committed the greatest injustice he suffers no <lb/>
            punishment; but I on the contrary thinking, that whether <lb/>
            Archelaus, or any other man whatever, is not punished when <lb/>
            he commits injustice, he must needs be far more wretched than <lb/>
            all other men, and that he who commits injustice is ever more <lb/>
            wretched than he who suffers it, and he that is not punished <lb/>
            than he that is. Are not these the things that I said ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And has it not been demonstrated that they were said <lb/>
            truly ?</p>
          <p>Pol. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well then, if these things are true, Polus, what is <lb/>
            the great utility of rhetoric? For, from what has been now <lb/>
            agreed on, every one ought especially to beware of acting <lb/>
            unjustly, for that, if he does so act, he will sustain great evil. <lb/>
            Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Pol. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And if a man has committed injustice, either himself, <lb/>
            or any one else for whom he has regard, he ought of his own <lb/>
            accord to betake himself thither, where as soon as possible he <lb/>
            will be punished, to a judge as to a physician, taking every <lb/>
            pains lest the disease of injustice becoming inveterate should <lb/>
            render the soul corrupt and incurable; or what must we say, <lb/>
            Polus, if our former admissions are to stand? Do not these <lb/>
            things necessarily harmonize with the former in this, but in no <lb/>
            other way ?</p>
          <p>79. Pol. For what else can we say, Socrates?</p>
          <p>Socr. For the purpose, then, of excusing injustice, our own, <lb/>
            or that of our parents, or friends, or children, or country, when <lb/>
            it acts unjustly, rhetoric is of no use to us at all, Polus, unless <lb/>
            on the contrary, any one supposes that he ought especially to <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            accuse himself, and afterwards his relatives, and any other of <lb/>
            his friends, who may have acted unjustly, and not conceal the <lb/>
            crime, but bring it to light, in order that he may be punished, <lb/>
            and restored to health; moreover, that he should compel both <lb/>
            himself and the others to lay aside fear, and with his eyes shut, <lb/>
            and in a manly way, deliver himself up, as to a physician, to <lb/>
            be cut and cauterised, pursuing the good and the beautiful, <lb/>
            without paying any regard to what is painful; if he has com­ <lb/>
            mitted a wrong worthy of stripes, delivering himself up to be <lb/>
            beaten, if of bonds, to be bound, if of a fine, to pay it, if of exile, <lb/>
            to be banished, if of death, to die, being himself the first ac­ <lb/>
            cuser of himself, and others his relatives, not sparing either <lb/>
            himself or them, but employing rhetoric for this very purpose, <lb/>
            that, the crimes being exposed, they may be freed from the <lb/>
            greatest of evils, injustice. Shall we say thus, Polus, or not ?</p>
          <p>80. Pol. These things appear tome, Socrates, to be absurd; <lb/>
            but it must be admitted, they accord with what was before said.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must not, therefore, either our former conclusions be <lb/>
            done away with, or these results necessarily follow?</p>
          <p>Pol. Yes; such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Contrariwise, if it is requisite to do ill to any one, <lb/>
            whether to an enemy, or any other person, provided only that <lb/>
            he is not himself injured by his enemy; for this is to be <lb/>
            guarded against; but if an enemy injures another, we should <lb/>
            endeavour by all possible means, both by actions and words, <lb/>
            that he may not be punished, nor brought before a judge: but, <lb/>
            if he is brought before him, we should contrive so that our <lb/>
            enemy may escape, and not suffer punishment: and if he has <lb/>
            robbed us of a great quantity of gold, that he should not re­ <lb/>
            store it, but should retain it and spend it on himself and his <lb/>
            associates unjustly and impiously; and if he has committed <lb/>
            an injustice worthy of death, we should contrive that he may <lb/>
            not die, if possible never, but that he may be immortal in de­ <lb/>
            pravity, or if this cannot be, that he may live in this state for <lb/>
            as long a period as possible. 81. For such purposes, Polus, <lb/>
            rhetoric appears to me to be useful, since to him who does not <lb/>
            intend to act unjustly, its utility does not appear to me to be <lb/>
            great, if indeed it is of any utility at all, as in the former part <lb/>
            of our discussion it appeared in no respect to be.</p>
          <p>Cal. Tell me, Chærephon, does Socrates say these things <lb/>
            seriously, or is he jesting ?</p><pb n="179"/>
            
          <p>Chœr. He appears to me, Callicles, to speak most seriously; <lb/>
            but there is nothing like asking him himself.</p>
          <p>Cal. You are right, by the gods, and I desire to do it. <lb/>
            Tell me, Socrates, whether we must say that you are now <lb/>
            speaking seriously, or jesting? For, if you are speaking se­ <lb/>
            riously, and if what you say is true, is not our human life alto­ <lb/>
            gether subverted, and are not all our actions, as it seems, con­ <lb/>
            trary to what they ought to be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If there were not a certain passion, Callicles, common <lb/>
            to men, to some, one, to others, another, but each of us had a <lb/>
            peculiar passion different from others, it would not be easy for <lb/>
            one to make known one's own affection to another. 82. I <lb/>
            speak thus because I perceive that you and I are now affected <lb/>
            in the same manner; for, being two, we each of us love two <lb/>
            things: I, Alcibiades, son of Clinias, and philosophy, you, the <lb/>
            Demusk of the Athenians, and the son of Pyrilampes. Now I <lb/>
            continually perceive that you, eloquent'as you are, are unable to <lb/>
            contradict the objects of your love, in whatever they may say, <lb/>
            and in whatever manner they may assert a thing takes place, <lb/>
            but you are changed by them upwards and downwards. For, in <lb/>
            the assembly, if, when you say any thing, the Athenian people <lb/>
            say that it is not so, you, changing your opinion, say what they <lb/>
            wish; and you are affected in the same manner towards that beau­ <lb/>
            tiful youth, the son of Pyrilampes; for you cannot bring yourself <lb/>
            to oppose the wishes and discourses of the objects of your love : <lb/>
            so that, if any one, when from time to time you say what you do <lb/>
            to please them, should wonder at its absurdity, perhaps you <lb/>
            would say to him, if you wished to speak the truth, that unless <lb/>
            some one shall cause the objects of your love to desist from <lb/>
            such discourses, neither can you desist from saying what you <lb/>
            do. Think, therefore, that you need to hear the like from <lb/>
            me ; and do not wonder that I speak thus, but cause philoso­ <lb/>
            phy, my favourite, to desist from speaking so. For, my dear <lb/>
            friend, she always says what you now hear from me, and is <lb/>
            much less fickle than my other loves. 83. For the son of <note type="footnote"> k That is, " the people of Athens." It is necessary to retain the origi­ <lb/>
            nal word because of the play on the word Demus, which was the name of <lb/>
            the son of Pyfilampes, a person distinguished for his personal beauty. <lb/>
            Socrates means to insinuate that while he loves the inward beauty of <lb/>
            Alcibiades and philosophy, Callicles loves the external beauty of the <lb/>
            people and Demus son of Pyrilampes. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            Clinias, here, says different things at different times; but phi­ <lb/>
            losophy always the same. And she says the things that you <lb/>
            now wonder at; and you have just heard what she said. <lb/>
            Either, therefore, confute her, as to what I just now said, and <lb/>
            prove that to act unjustly, and when one has acted unjustly <lb/>
            not to suffer punishment, is not the worst of all evils; or, if <lb/>
            you suffer this to remain unconfuted, then, by the do-, the <lb/>
            deity of the Egyptians, Callicles will not agree with you, but <lb/>
            will differ from you, Callicles, through the whole of his life. <lb/>
            However, I think, my excellent friend, that it would be better for <lb/>
            me that my lyre should be out of tune and discordant, and the <lb/>
            choir of which I might be the leader, and that most men should <lb/>
            not agree with me, but oppose what I say, rather than that I, <lb/>
            being one, should be discordant with and contradict myself.</p>
          <p>Cal. You seem to -me, Socrates, to act the boaster in your <lb/>
            discourses, as being in truth a mob-orator: and now you thus <lb/>
            declaim, since Polus has met with the same treatment as he <lb/>
            objected Gorgias met with from you. 84. For he said that <lb/>
            Gorgias, when asked by you, whether if one should come to <lb/>
            him, wishing to learn rhetoric without being acquainted with <lb/>
            justice, Gorgias would teach him, was ashamed, and said that <lb/>
            he would teach him, on account of the custom among men, <lb/>
            because they would be displeased if any one were to refuse: <lb/>
            and that from this admission Gorgias was compelled to contra­ <lb/>
            dict himself, and you were delighted with this very circum­ <lb/>
            stance ; for which he then ridiculed you, as it appeared to me, <lb/>
            very properly. And now he himself has in turn been treated <lb/>
            the very same way; I, however, in this particular, do not com­ <lb/>
            mend Polus, because he has conceded to 'you, that to commit <lb/>
            injustice is more base than to suffer it. For, from this admis­ <lb/>
            sion, he being entangled by you in the discussion, has been <lb/>
            brought to a check, because he was ashamed to say what he <lb/>
            thought. For you in reality, Socrates, while you profess to be <lb/>
            in search of truth, lead to such vulgar and popular things as <lb/>
            these which are not beautiful by nature, but by law. For <lb/>
            these are, for the most part, contrary to each other, nature <lb/>
            and law. 85. If any one, therefore, is ashamed, and dares <lb/>
            not say what he thinks, he is compelled to contradict himself. <lb/>
            And you, having perceived this subtle distinction, deal unfairly <lb/>
            in the discussion ; for, if any one speaks of any thing accord­ <lb/>
            ing to law, you cunningly ask him about it according to na­ <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            ture, and if he speaks of things according to nature, you ask <lb/>
            him about them according to law; as just now in the present <lb/>
            discussion, respecting committing injustice and suffering it, <lb/>
            when Polus spoke of that which is more base according to <lb/>
            nature, you followed up the law as if it were according to na­ <lb/>
            ture. For, by nature, every thing is more base which is also <lb/>
            worse, as to suffer injustice, but by law to commit it. For to <lb/>
            submit to injustice is not the condition of a man, but of a <lb/>
            slave, to whom it is better to die than to live, since, being in­ <lb/>
            jured and disgraced, he is unable to defend himself or any one <lb/>
            else for whom he has regard. But I think, those who make <lb/>
            the laws are the weak and the many: they, therefore, make <lb/>
            laws with a view to themselves and their own advantage, and <lb/>
            with the same view they bestow praise and impute blame ; and <lb/>
            to terrify such men as are stronger, and who are able to ac­ <lb/>
            quire more, that they may not acquire more than themselves, <lb/>
            they say that it is base and unjust to obtain a superiority, and <lb/>
            that to endeavour to acquire more than others is to commit <lb/>
            injustice. 86. For they are content, I think, if they, being <lb/>
            weaker, have an equal portion. For this reason, therefore, by <lb/>
            law it is said to be unjust and base to endeavour to possess <lb/>
            more than the many, and they call this committing an injus­ <lb/>
            tice. But nature herself, I think, evinces, on the contrary, <lb/>
            that it is just that the better should have more than the worse, <lb/>
            and the more powerful than the weaker. And it is evident <lb/>
            in many instances that it is so, both in other animals, and in <lb/>
            whole cities and races of men, that the just is so settled that <lb/>
            the superior should rule over the inferior, and possess more <lb/>
            than they. For, with what justice did Xerxes make war upon <lb/>
            Greece, or his father on the Scythians ? or ten thousand other <lb/>
            instances which one might adduce ? But I think they do these <lb/>
            things according to natural justice, and, by Jupiter, according <lb/>
            to the law of nature; not, perhaps, according to that law which <lb/>
            we have framed, taking the best and strongest amongst us <lb/>
            from their youth, like lions, we tame them by incantations and <lb/>
            juggleries, telling them that it is right to preserve equality, <lb/>
            and that this is the beautiful and the just. 87. But, I think, <lb/>
            if there should be a man found with sufficient natural power, <lb/>
            having shaken off all these trammels, and broken through, and <lb/>
            abandoned, and trampled under foot our written ordinances, <lb/>
            and quackeries, and incantations, and laws contrary to nature, <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            he, from being our slave, would rise up and prove himself our <lb/>
            master; and then natural justice would shine forth. Pindar, too, <lb/>
            appears to me to have declared what I now assert, in the ode <lb/>
            in which he says that " law is the king of all, both mortals and <lb/>
            immortals ; and," he adds, " he with most powerful hand makes <lb/>
            use of might, calling it right; and this I infer from the deeds <lb/>
            of Hercules, since he drove away the oxen of Geryon unbought." <lb/>
            He speaks pretty much in this manner ; for I do not remember <lb/>
            the ode by heart. He says, then, that Hercules drove away <lb/>
            the oxen of Geryon, without having either bought them, or <lb/>
            received them as a gift, as if this were naturally just, that both <lb/>
            oxen, and all other possessions, when the property of the worse <lb/>
            and inferior, belong to the better and superior. Such, then, is <lb/>
            the truth; and you will know that it is so, if, dismissing phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, you betake yourself to greater things. 88. For <lb/>
            philosophy, Socrates, is an elegant thing, if one handles it <lb/>
            moderately in youth; but if one dwells upon it longer than is <lb/>
            becoming, it is the ruin of men. For if a man should have <lb/>
            excellent abilities, and should study philosophy beyond the <lb/>
            period of youth, he must necessarily become unskilled in all <lb/>
            things in which he ought to be skilled, who desires to be a <lb/>
            worthy, good, and distinguished man. For such men are un­ <lb/>
            skilled in the laws of the city, and in those arguments which <lb/>
            any one must use, who is conversant with the business trans­ <lb/>
            actions of men, both privately and publicly: they are likewise <lb/>
            altogether unskilled in human pleasures and desires, and, in <lb/>
            short, in the manners of men. When, therefore, they engage <lb/>
            in any private or public business, they make themselves ridi­ <lb/>
            culous, just as, I think, politicians are ridiculous when they <lb/>
            meddle with your disputations and arguments. For that say­ <lb/>
            ing of Euripides is verified: " Every one shines in this, and <lb/>
            to this applies himself, consuming the greater part of the day <lb/>
            in whatever he most excels." But that wherein a man is weak <lb/>
            he avoids, and abuses it, and praises the other through self­ <lb/>
            love, thinking thereby to praise himself: but I think the most <lb/>
            correct way is to partake of both. 89. Of philosophy, indeed, <lb/>
            so far as is requisite for education, it is well to partake, nor is <lb/>
            it any disgrace for one who is young to study philosophy: but <lb/>
            when a man who has reached an advanced age, still studies <note type="footnote"> 1 From the Antiope of Euripides. See Valckenaer Diatrib. in Eurip. <lb/>
            Reliquias, p. 76. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            philosophy, Socrates, the thing becomes ridiculous: and I <lb/>
            have very much the same feeling towards those who study <lb/>
            philosophy, as to those who stammer and sport. For when I <lb/>
            see a child whom it still becomes to talk thus stammering and <lb/>
            sporting, I am delighted, and his conduct appears to me to be <lb/>
            graceful and liberal, and suited to the age of a child. But <lb/>
            when I hear a little boy talking with precision, it seems a dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable thing to me, and offends my ears, and appears to be <lb/>
            somewhat servile. When, however, one hears a man stam­ <lb/>
            mering, or sees him sporting, it appears to be ridiculous, un­ <lb/>
            manly, and worthy of stripes. Now I have this same feeling <lb/>
            towards those who study philosophy. For, when I see philo­ <lb/>
            sophy in a young man, I am delighted, and it appears to me <lb/>
            becoming, and I consider such a man to be of a liberal mind; <lb/>
            but if he does not study philosophy, I consider him illiberal, <lb/>
            and one who will never think himself worthy of any noble or <lb/>
            generous action. When, however, I see a man advanced in <lb/>
            years still studying philosophy, and not having abandoned it, <lb/>
            such a man, Socrates, appears to me to be deserving of stripes. <lb/>
            90. For, as I just now said, such a man, even though he has <lb/>
            excellent abilities, must needs become unmanly, by avoiding <lb/>
            the public places of the city, and the forum, in which, as the <lb/>
            poetm says, men acquire celebrity, and by concealing himself <lb/>
            from the public view, he passes the remainder of his life with <lb/>
            three or four boys, whispering in a corner, but never utters <lb/>
            any thing liberal, great, and becoming. But I, Socrates, am <lb/>
            very friendly disposed towards you; and I seem to have the <lb/>
            same feeling as Zethus towards Amphion in Euripides, whom <lb/>
            I just now mentioned; for it occurs to me to say to you the <lb/>
            same that he said to his brother: that you neglect, Socrates, <lb/>
            what you ought to attend to, and strive to adorn the nature of <lb/>
            a soul thus generous by a certain juvenile form; nor in deli­ <lb/>
            berations of justice are you able to advance an argument cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, nor lay hold of what is probable and persuasive, nor <lb/>
            can you suggest vigorous advice for others. 91. How­ <lb/>
            ever, my dear Socrates, (and do not be angry with me, for <lb/>
            I speak out of good-will to you,) does it not appear to you <lb/>
            to be base to be in the state in which I think you are, and <lb/>
            others who continually make too great advances in philosophy ? <lb/>
            For now, if any one should arrest you, or any other of the <note type="footnote"> m Homer, Iliad, ix. 441. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            same character, and should take you to prison, asserting that <lb/>
            you had acted unjustly, when you had not, you are aware you <lb/>
            would not know what to do for yourself; but you would lose <lb/>
            your head and gape, and not have any thing to say ; and when <lb/>
            you went into a court of justice, having met with a very vile <lb/>
            and despicable accuser, you would die, if he chose to charge <lb/>
            you capitally. And indeed, Socrates, how can this be wise, if <lb/>
            any art meeting with a man of good natural ability renders <lb/>
            him worse, and neither able to assist himself, nor preserve <lb/>
            either himself or any one else from the greatest dangers, but <lb/>
            suffers him to be plundered of all his substance by enemies, <lb/>
            and to live in the city utterly without honour ? Such a man, <lb/>
            (if I may speak somewhat rudely,) one may slap on the face <lb/>
            with impunity. 92. But, my friend, be persuaded by me, and <lb/>
            give up confuting, cultivate harmony of conduct, and employ <lb/>
            yourself in what will give you a reputation for wisdom, leaving <lb/>
            to others these graceful subtleties, whether it is proper to call <lb/>
            them frivolities, or fooleries, " by which you will come to dwell <lb/>
            in an empty house:" and emulate, not men who are able to <lb/>
            confute these trifling things, but those who have wealth, re­ <lb/>
            nown, and many other goods.</p>
          <p>Socr. If I happened to have a golden soul, Callicles, do <lb/>
            you not think I should gladly find one of the best of those <lb/>
            stones by which they test gold, to which applying it, if it <lb/>
            should allow that my soul was well cultivated, I should then <lb/>
            know for a certainty that I was in a good state, and that I had <lb/>
            no further need of any other test ?</p>
          <p>Cal.. Why do you ask this, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will now tell you. I think that in meeting with you, <lb/>
            I have met with this good fortune.</p>
          <p>Cal. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I well know, that if you agree with me in those things <lb/>
            which my soul entertains, such things are the very truth. For <lb/>
            I perceive that he who intends to examine sufficiently respect­ <lb/>
            ing his soul whether it lives uprightly or not, ought to possess <lb/>
            three qualities, all which you do possess, viz., science, benevo­ <lb/>
            lence, and freedom of speech. 93. For I meet with many who <lb/>
            are not able to test me, through not being wise as you are; <lb/>
            but others are wise, indeed, but are not willing to speak the <lb/>
            truth to me, because they are not concerned about me as you <lb/>
            are. Thus these two strangers, Gorgias and Polus, are indeed <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            wise, and my friends, but they are deficient in freedom of <lb/>
            speech, and are more bashful than is proper. For how should <lb/>
            it be otherwise ? since they have reached such a pitch of bash­ <lb/>
            fulness that through shamefacedness each of them dares to <lb/>
            contradict himself before many persons, and this on the most <lb/>
            important subjects. You however possess all these qualities, <lb/>
            which the others have not. For you are both well instructed, <lb/>
            as many of the Athenians will affirm, and are well-disposed to­ <lb/>
            wards me. What proof do I use ? I know, Callicles, that you <lb/>
            four have studied wisdom together, you, Tisander the Aphid­ <lb/>
            næan, Andron son of Androtion, and Nausicydes the Cholar­ <lb/>
            gean; and I once heard you deliberating how far wisdom <lb/>
            ought to be cultivated, and I know that this opinion prevailed <lb/>
            among you, that you should not endeavour to study philosophy <lb/>
            with great accuracy; but you advised each other to be cautious, <lb/>
            lest, by becoming more wise than is proper, you should destroy <lb/>
            yourselves without perceiving it. 94. Since, then, I hear you <lb/>
            giving me the very same advice that you gave to your most <lb/>
            intimate friends, it is to me a sufficient proof that you are really <lb/>
            well-disposed towards me. Moreover, that you are able to <lb/>
            speak boldly and not be ashamed, both yourself say, and the <lb/>
            speech which you just now made, evinces. The case is evi­ <lb/>
            dently this, with reference to our present discussion; if you <lb/>
            shall agree with me in any thing, in our argument, that point <lb/>
            will have been sufficiently examined by you and me, and it will <lb/>
            be no longer necessary to put it to another test. For you <lb/>
            would never have assented to it, either through deficiency of <lb/>
            wisdom, or excess of bashfulness. Nor, again, would you have <lb/>
            assented in order to deceive me: for you are my friend, as you <lb/>
            have yourself said. In reality, therefore, your and my assent <lb/>
            will have reached the perfect truth. But the most beautiful <lb/>
            consideration of all, Callicles, with respect to the things about <lb/>
            which you have reproved me, is that, viz., what kind of person <lb/>
            a man ought to be, what he ought to study, and how far, both <lb/>
            when he is advanced in life and when he is young. For, with <lb/>
            respect to myself, if I do any thing in my life not rightly, be <lb/>
            assured that I do not err willingly, but through my own igno­ <lb/>
            rance. 95. Do you, therefore, as you have begun to advise <lb/>
            me, not desist, but shew me clearly what it is that I ought to <lb/>
            study, and in what way I may accomplish it. And if you find <lb/>
            me now assenting to you, but in time to come not doing the <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            things to which I have assented, then consider me as utterly <lb/>
            stupid, and thenceforth give me no more advice, as being a <lb/>
            man altogether worthless. But repeat it to me again from <lb/>
            the beginning, how say you and Pindar is the case with natural <lb/>
            justice? is it that the superior should take by force from the <lb/>
            inferior, and that the better should rule over the worse, and <lb/>
            that the more excellent should have more than the depraved ? <lb/>
            Do you say that the just is any thing else than this? or do I <lb/>
            remember rightly ?</p>
          <p>Cal. These things I said then, and I say now.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do you call the same person better and superior ? <lb/>
            For I was not able at the time to understand you, what you <lb/>
            meant: whether do you call the stronger superior, and must <lb/>
            the weaker submit to the stronger; as you seemed to me to <lb/>
            intimate when you said, that great cities attack little ones by <lb/>
            natural justice, because they are superior and stronger; as if <lb/>
            the superior, the stronger, and the better, were the same; or <lb/>
            is it possible to be better, and at the same time inferior and <lb/>
            weaker, and to be superior, but more depraved? or is there <lb/>
            the same definition of the better and the superior ? Define this <lb/>
            clearly for me, are the superior, the better, and the stronger, <lb/>
            the same, or different?</p>
          <p>Cal. Then I tell you clearly, that they are the same.</p>
          <p>96. Soer. Are not, then, the many by nature superior to <lb/>
            one? since they establish laws for the one, as you just now <lb/>
            said?</p>
          <p>Cal. How can it be otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The laws, then, of the many are those of such as are <lb/>
            superior ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, of the better? For, according to your ac­ <lb/>
            count, the superior are far better.</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are not, then, their laws by nature beautiful, since <lb/>
            they are superior ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now do not the many think thus, as you just now <lb/>
            said, that it is just to possess the equal, and that it is more <lb/>
            base to injure than to be injured? Is this so, or not? And <lb/>
            take care that you are not detected here in being shamefaced. <lb/>
            Do the many think or not that to possess the equal, but not <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            more, is just? and that it is more base to injure than to be <lb/>
            injured ? Do not refuse me an answer to this, Callicles, in <lb/>
            order that, if you agree with me, I may be confirmed in my <lb/>
            opinion by you, seeing that a man competent to decide has <lb/>
            agreed with me.</p>
          <p>97. Cal. The many, then, do think thus.</p>
          <p>Socr. Not therefore by law only, but by nature also, it is <lb/>
            more base to injure than to be injured, and just to possess the <lb/>
            equal. So that you appear not to have spoken the truth before, <lb/>
            nor to accuse me rightly, in saying that law and nature are <lb/>
            contrary to each other, and that I, knowing this, deal unfairly <lb/>
            in the discussion, if any one speaks according to nature, by <lb/>
            leading him to law, and if any one speaks according to law, <lb/>
            by leading him to nature.</p>
          <p>Cal. This man -will not cease trifling. Tell me, Socrates, <lb/>
            are you not ashamed, at your age, to catch at words, and, if <lb/>
            any one makes a mistake in an expression to consider it an <lb/>
            unexpected gain ? For, do you think that by the superior I <lb/>
            mean any thing else than the better ? Did I not tell you long <lb/>
            since, that I consider the better and the superior to be the <lb/>
            same ? Do you suppose I mean, that if a crowd of slaves, and <lb/>
            all sorts of men of no worth, except perhaps for bodily strength, <lb/>
            should meet together, that what they should sayn would be legal <lb/>
            institutions ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Be it so, most wise Callicles: is that your meaning ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>98. Socr. But I, Sir, long since suspected that you meant <lb/>
            some such thing by the superior; and therefore I repeat the <lb/>
            question, desiring to understand clearly what you do mean; <lb/>
            for you surely do not think that two are better than one, nor <lb/>
            that your slaves are better than you because they are stronger <lb/>
            than you. Tell me then from the beginning whom you mean <lb/>
            by the better, since you do not mean the stronger. And, my <lb/>
            admirable friend, teach me in the outset in a milder manner, <lb/>
            that I may not leave you.</p>
          <p>Cal. You are bantering, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Zethus, no, Callicles, in whose name you just now • <lb/>
            bantered me a good deal. But come, tell me who do you mean <lb/>
            are the better ? <note type="footnote"> 11 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτοιφἇσι</foreign>*<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, aura raSTa <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναι νόμιμα</foreign>&gt; as if aura <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταἶτα</foreign> preceded &amp; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἇν <lb/>
            φῶσιν</foreign>. See Stallbaum. </note></p><pb n="188"/>
            
          <p>Cal. I mean the more excellent.</p>
          <p>Socr. You see, then, that you yourself speak words, but <lb/>
            explain nothing. Will you not tell me whether by the better <lb/>
            and superior you mean the more wise, or some others ?</p>
          <p>Cal. But, by Jupiter, I mean these, certainly.</p>
          <p>99. Socr. Often, therefore, according to your account, one <lb/>
            wise man is superior to ten thousand that are not wise; and <lb/>
            it is right that he should govern, and they be governed, and <lb/>
            that the governor should have more than the governed. For <lb/>
            you appear to me to wish to say this (and I do not catch at <lb/>
            expressions), if one man is superior to ten thousand.</p>
          <p>Cal. That is what I mean. For I think this is just by <lb/>
            nature, that the better and the more wise should both govern <lb/>
            and have more than the worthless.</p>
          <p>Socr. Stop there. What then do you now say? If we were <lb/>
            in the same place, as we now are, many men together, and had, <lb/>
            in common, abundance of meat and drink, and were men of <lb/>
            various descriptions, some strong, others weak, and one of us <lb/>
            being a physician should happen to be more wise respecting <lb/>
            these things, and should be (as is likely) stronger than some, <lb/>
            and weaker than others, will it not follow that this man who <lb/>
            is wiser than we are, will be better and superior with respect <lb/>
            to these things ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Should he, therefore, have more of these meats than <lb/>
            we, because he is better ? Or, because he is chief, ought he <lb/>
            not to distribute the whole, but, in consuming and using them <lb/>
            for his own body, not take more than others, under pain of <lb/>
            injury to himself, but should have more than some, and less <lb/>
            than others; and if he should happen to be the weakest of all, <lb/>
            though the best, he must have least of all, Callicles ? Is it not <lb/>
            so, my friend ?</p>
          <p>100. Cal. You speak of meats and drinks, and physicians, <lb/>
            and such trifles ; but I do not speak of these.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether, then, do you say that the more wise is <lb/>
            better ? Grant or deny.</p>
          <p>. Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. And do you not say that the better ought to have <lb/>
            more ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Not of meats and drinks.</p>
          <p>Socr. I understand. But perhaps of clothes, and the most <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            skilful weaver should have the largest garment, and go about <lb/>
            most abundantly and beautifully clad.</p>
          <p>Cal. What garments do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And with respect to shoes, it is clear that he who is <lb/>
            more skilled and best,. should have more than others; the <lb/>
            shoemaker, perhaps, ought to walk about with the largest and <lb/>
            greatest number of shoes.</p>
          <p>Cal. What shoes ? Are you still trifling ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But if you do not mean such things, perhaps you do <lb/>
            the following: for instance, that a husbandman, wise and <lb/>
            skilled in the cultivation of laud, should perhaps have more <lb/>
            seeds than others, and use as much as possible on his own <lb/>
            land.</p>
          <p>101. Cal. How constantly you repeat the same things, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr Not only so, Callicles, but on the same subject.</p>
          <p>Cal. By the gods, you never cease talking about shoe­ <lb/>
            makers, fullers, cooks, and physicians, as if our discourse were <lb/>
            about them.</p>
          <p>Socr Will you not tell me, then, with respect to what <lb/>
            things a person should be superior and more wise, who having <lb/>
            more than others, justly has more ? Will you neither permit <lb/>
            me to suggest, nor say yourself?</p>
          <p>Cal. But I have said some time since. First, by the supe­ <lb/>
            rior I do not mean shoemakers, or cooks, but those who are <lb/>
            skilled in the affairs of a city, in what way they can be well <lb/>
            administered, and not only skilled, but also brave, able to ac­ <lb/>
            complish what they have conceived, and who do not fail <lb/>
            through effeminacy of soul.</p>
          <p>Socr Do you see, most excellent Callicles, that you do not <lb/>
            make the same objection to me that I do to you? For you <lb/>
            allege that I always say the same things, and blame me for it; <lb/>
            and I, on the contrary, complain of you, that you never say the <lb/>
            same things on the same subjects; but at one time you defined <lb/>
            the better and the superior to be the stronger, and at another <lb/>
            time the more wise: and now again you come with something <lb/>
            else; and certain persons that are braver are said by you to be <lb/>
            the superior and better. But, my friend, tell me once for all, <lb/>
            whom you call the better and superior, and in reference to <lb/>
            what.</p>
          <p>102. Cal. I have already said that they are such as are</p><pb n="190"/>
            
          <p>wise and brave, with respect to the affairs of a city. For it <lb/>
            belongs to them to govern cities, and it is just that they should <lb/>
            have more than others, the governors than the governed.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? my friend, as governing themselves, or <lb/>
            being governed ?</p>
          <p>Cal. What mean you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I mean that each person governs himself. Is there no <lb/>
            occasion for this, that a mail should govern himself, but only <lb/>
            others ?</p>
          <p>Cal. What do you mean by governing himself?</p>
          <p>Socr. Nothing uncommon; but as men frequently say, that <lb/>
            a man is temperate, and master of himself, controlling the plea­ <lb/>
            sures and desires that are within himself.</p>
          <p>Cal. How ridiculous you are! By the temperate you mean <lb/>
            the foolish.</p>
          <p>Socr. How otherwise ? There is no one but would know <lb/>
            that that is my meaningo.</p>
          <p>Cal. Most assuredly, Socrates; since how can a man be <lb/>
            happy who is a slave to any one? But this it is which is <lb/>
            beautiful, and just according to nature, and which I now freely <lb/>
            tell you, namely, that a man who lives rightly should suffer his <lb/>
            desires to be as great as possible, and should not restrain <lb/>
            them; but should be able, when they are at their height, to <lb/>
            minister to them by his courage and prudence, and satisfy <lb/>
            each desire as it springs up. 103. This, however, I think, is <lb/>
            not possible for the generality of men; wherefore they blame <lb/>
            such persons through shame, to conceal their own impotency, <lb/>
            and say that intemperance is base; as I said before, enslaving <lb/>
            men of a better nature, and themselves not being able to satisfy <lb/>
            their own pleasures, they praise temperance and justice, on <lb/>
            account of their own effeminacy. For to those whom it has <lb/>
            befallen from the first either to be the sons of kings, or who <lb/>
            are able by nature to procure for themselves a government, or <lb/>
            tyranny, or dynasty, what can be more disgraceful and base <lb/>
            than temperance ? who, when it is in their power to enjoy the <lb/>
            good things of this life, and no one hinders them, impose a <lb/>
            master on themselves, the law, discourse, and censure of the <lb/>
            multitude ? Or how should they be otherwise than miserable <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο</foreign> I have followed Stallbaum's reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδείς δστις οὐκ ἂν γνοίη, δτι <lb/>
            οὗτω λέγω</foreign>. Socrates grants his opponent's erroneous inference, that so <lb/>
            he may be led on to a still greater absurdity. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            through the beauty of justice and temperance, while they im­ <lb/>
            part no more to their friends than to their enemies, and this <lb/>
            though they have supreme power in their own city? Thus, <lb/>
            then, it stands with the truth, Socrates, which you say you are <lb/>
            in search of: luxury, intemperance, and liberty, if they have <lb/>
            the proper aids, these are virtue and felicity; but all those other <lb/>
            fine things, those compacts contrary to nature, are extravagan­ <lb/>
            cies of men, and of no value.</p>
          <p>104. Socr. Not at all ignobly, Callicles, have you expressed <lb/>
            your opinions, speaking freely; for you now plainly say what <lb/>
            others think, indeed, but are unwilling to say. I beg of you, <lb/>
            therefore, on no account to relax, in order that it may really <lb/>
            become evident how we ought to live. Come tell me: do you <lb/>
            say that our desires ought not to be checked, if one intends to <lb/>
            be such as one ought; and that, suffering them to be as great <lb/>
            as possible, one ought to provide for their satisfaction from <lb/>
            every possible source, and that this constitutes virtue ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. They, therefore, who need nothing, are not rightly <lb/>
            said to be happy.</p>
          <p>Cal. For thus stones and the dead would be most happy. <lb/>
            Soer. But, indeed, even as you say, life is grievous. For in <lb/>
            truth I should not wonder if Euripides speaks the truth when <lb/>
            he says: " Who knows whether to live is not death, and to <lb/>
            die, life ?" And we, perhaps, are really dead; as I have heard <lb/>
            from one of the wise, that we are now dead, and that the body <lb/>
            is our sepulchre, and that the part of the soul in which the de­ <lb/>
            sires are is of such a nature that it can be persuaded different <lb/>
            ways, and change upwards and downwards; and this, some <lb/>
            skilful man, perhaps a Sicilian, or Italian, turning into a fable, <lb/>
            by a slight change of the word P, called a cask, from its being <lb/>
            credulous and easily persuaded, but the foolish he called unin­ <lb/>
            itiated. He further compared that part of the soul of the un­ <lb/>
            initiated in which the desires are, namely, its intemperate and <lb/>
            unclosed part, to a pierced cask, on account of its insatiable <lb/>
            greediness. 105. This man, too, quite contrary to you, <lb/>
            Callicles, shews that of those in Hades (meaning thereby <lb/>
            the invisible world) the most miserable must be the unin- <note type="footnote"> p The English language does not enable a translator to preserve the <lb/>

            which means "leaky," as well as "uninitiated." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            itiated, and that they carry water to a perforated cask by a simi­ <lb/>
            larly perforated sieve. The sieve, as he who spoke to me said, <lb/>
            is the soul. But he likened the soul of the foolish to a sieve, <lb/>
            as being perforated and not able to retain any thing, through <lb/>
            incredulity and forgetfulness. This probably is somewhat ab­ <lb/>
            surd, nevertheless it shews that by proof of which I wish, if <lb/>
            by any means I can, to persuade you to change your opinion, <lb/>
            and to prefer to an insatiable and intemperate life one that is <lb/>
            well regulated, and that is satisfied and contented with the <lb/>
            things that are from time to time present. But do I per­ <lb/>
            suade you at all, and do you change your opinion, and admit <lb/>
            that the moderate are more happy than the intemperate ? or <lb/>
            have I produced no impression, and though I tell you many <lb/>
            such fables, will you not be any the more disposed to change <lb/>
            your opinion?</p>
          <p>Cal. In this you have spoken more truly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>106. Soar. Come, then, I will mention to you another simi­ <lb/>
            litude from the same school as the preceding. For consider <lb/>
            whether you would speak thus of each kind of life, the tem­ <lb/>
            perate and the intemperate, as if two men had each many <lb/>
            casks; and that those of one were sound and full, one of wine, <lb/>
            another of honey, a third of milk, and many others of other <lb/>
            things ; that the fountains of each were rare and difficult to be <lb/>
            obtained, and could only be procured by many and severe <lb/>
            toils; the one, then, having filled his casks, pours no more <lb/>
            into them, nor is at all concerned about them, but on this <lb/>
            score is at ease; that the fountains of the other, as of the <lb/>
            former one, are possible to be procured, though with difficulty, <lb/>
            that his vessels are perforated and defective, and he com­ <lb/>
            pelled, both night and day, to fill them, or suffer the most ex­ <lb/>
            treme pain. When such is the life of each, do you say that of <lb/>
            the intemperate is more happy than that of the moderate man ? <lb/>
            Do I persuade you at all, by relating these things, to grant <lb/>
            that a moderate life is better than an intemperate one, or do I <lb/>
            not persuade you ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You do not persuade me, Socrates. For he that has <lb/>
            filled his casks has no longer any pleasure: but this is, what I <lb/>
            just now mentioned, to live like a stone, when he has filled <lb/>
            them, neither rejoicing any more nor grieving: but a pleasant <lb/>
            life consists in as much flowing in as possible.</p>
          <p>107. Soar. Is it not, therefore, necessary, if much flows in, <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            that much also should go out, and that there should be certain <lb/>
            large holes for its flowing out ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. You speak now of the life of a sea-larkq, and not of a. <lb/>
            corpse, or a stone. But tell me, do you mean such a thing as <lb/>
            being hungry, and, when hungry, eating ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. And of being thirsty, and, when thirsty, drinking ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do mean that, and that he who has all other desires, <lb/>
            and, having the power to do so, satisfies them, lives a joyful <lb/>
            and happy life.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well done, my excellent friend! Proceed as you have <lb/>
            begun, and take care not to be ashamed. But it is right, too, <lb/>
            as it seems, that neither should I be ashamed. And first of <lb/>
            all, tell me if, when a man, who is scabby and itches, is able to <lb/>
            scratch himself without stint, and passes his life in scratching <lb/>
            himself, this is to live happily ?</p>
          <p>Cal. How absurd you are, Socrates, and a mere babbler.</p>
          <p>Socr. Hence it is, Callicles, that I have astonished Polus <lb/>
            and Gorgias, and made them ashamed. You, however, will <lb/>
            not be astonished nor ashamed, for you are courageous: but <lb/>
            only answer me.</p>
          <p>108. Cal. I say, then, that he who scratches himself lives <lb/>
            pleasantly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, if pleasantly, also happily ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will this be the case if he only itches in his head, or <lb/>
            must I ask you still further ? Consider, Callicles, what answer <lb/>
            you would give, if any one asks you respecting all the parts of <lb/>
            the body in succession. And to take that which is the chief of <lb/>
            all, is not the life of catamites dreadful, base, and wretched? <lb/>
            Will you dare to call them happy, if they have what they <lb/>

          <p>Cal. Are you not ashamed, Socrates, to lead the discussion <lb/>
            to such subjects ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do I lead it hither, noble Sir, or does he who asserts <lb/>
            thus broadly, that such as rejoice, in whatever way they re­ <lb/>
            joice, are happy, and does not distinguish between pleasures, <note type="footnote"> q <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χαραδριὸς</foreign>, a bird which Aristotle tells us (Hist. Anim., L ix. c. 11) <lb/>

            what are good and what are bad ? But tell me further still, <lb/>
            whether do you say that the pleasant and the good are the <lb/>
            same: or that there is something pleasant which is not good ?</p>
          <p>Cal. In order that my argument may not contradict itself, if <lb/>
            I should say they are different, I say that they are the same.</p>
          <p>109. Soer. You subvert your former statements, Callicles, <lb/>
            and no longer search for the truth with me properly, if you <lb/>
            speak contrary to your real opinion.</p>
          <p>Cal. And you do the same, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither, then, do I act rightly, if I do so, nor do you. <lb/>
            But, good Sir, consider whether to rejoice in any way be not <lb/>
            good. For it is clear that many base consequences, which <lb/>
            were just now hinted at, will follow, if this should be the case, <lb/>
            and many others besides.</p>
          <p>Cal. As you think, at least, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you in reality, Callicles, persist in your assertion ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we then enter on the discussion, as if you were <lb/>
            in earnest ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Most certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come, then, since you are of that opinion, explain this <lb/>
            to me. Do you call science any thing?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. And did you not just now say, that there is a certain <lb/>
            courage joined with science ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I did say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Did you speak of these two, as if courage was differ­ <lb/>
            ent from science ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? Are pleasure and science the same, or <lb/>
            different ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Different, surely, most wise friend.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is courage also different from pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>110. Boer. Come, then, let us retain these things in our <lb/>
            memory; that Callicles of Acharne said that the pleasant and <lb/>
            the good are the same; but that science and courage are dif­ <lb/>
            ferent both from each other and the good.</p>
          <p>Cal. But Socrates of Alopecia does not agree to this; does <lb/>
            he agree ?</p>
          <p>Socr. He does not agree: and I think neither will Callicles <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            when he has rightly examined himself. For tell me, do you <lb/>
            not think that those who fare well are affected in a manner <lb/>
            quite contrary to those who fare ill ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. If these, therefore, are contrary to each other, is it not <lb/>
            necessary that the case should be the same with them as it is <lb/>
            with health and disease? For, surely, a man is not at the <lb/>
            same time well and diseased, nor at the same time separated <lb/>
            from health and disease.</p>
          <p>Cal. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. For instance, take any part of the body you please, <lb/>
            and consider. Has not a man sometimes a disease in the eyes, <lb/>
            which is called ophthalmia ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And his eyes, surely, are not at the same time well ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? When he is freed from the ophthalmia, <lb/>
            does he then also lose the health of his eyes, and, in a word, <lb/>
            is he at the same time freed from both ?</p>
          <p>Cal. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. For that, I think, would be wonderful and absurd. <lb/>
            Would it not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>111. Socr. But I think he, alternately, receives one, and <lb/>
            loses the other.</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. And will it not be the same with regard to strength <lb/>
            and weakness ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And swiftness and slowness?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And with respect to things good and happiness, and <lb/>
            their contraries, things evil and wretchedness, does he receive <lb/>
            and part from each of these alternately ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, we should find certain things which <lb/>
            a man at the same time parts from and possesses, it is clear <lb/>
            that these would not be both good and evil. Do we agree to <lb/>
            this ? Consider well and answer me.</p>
          <p>Cal. I agree entirely.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us then recur to what was before agreed on.</p><pb n="196"/>
            
          <p>Did you say that to be hungry is pleasant, or painful ? I mean <lb/>
            the very fact of being hungry.</p>
          <p>Cal. I said it was painful: though to eat when hungry is <lb/>
            pleasant.</p>
          <p>Socr I understand you: but to be hungry of itself is <lb/>
            painful; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. And also to be thirsty ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>112. Socr. Whether, then, shall I ask you any more ques­ <lb/>
            tions ? Or do you allow that all want and desire is painful ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it; so do not ask.</p>
          <p>Socr. Be it so. And do you not say that for a man to <lb/>
            drink when he is thirsty is pleasant ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. In the instance then of which you are speaking, to be <lb/>
            thirsty is, doubtless, painful ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But to drink is the satisfying of a want, and a <lb/>
            pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore as to drinking you say that the man re­ <lb/>
            joices ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But as to being thirsty ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I say-</p>
          <p>Socr. That he suffers pain ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you perceive then what follows ? that you say he <lb/>
            who is in pain at the same time rejoices, when you say that <lb/>
            he who is thirsty drinks. And does not this happen at the <lb/>
            same place and time, with respect either to the soul or body, <lb/>
            whichever you please ? For I think there is no difference. Is <lb/>
            this so, or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. You admitted, however, that it was impossible for one <lb/>
            who fares well at the same time to fare ill.</p>
          <p>Cal. I allow it.</p>
          <p>Socr. But you have granted that it is possible for one who <lb/>
            is in pain to rejoice.</p>
          <p>Cal. It appears so.</p><pb n="197"/>
            
          <p>Socr To rejoice, therefore, is not to fare well, nor to be in <lb/>
            pain, ill: so that the pleasant is different from the good ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I know not what subtleties you are using, Socrates.</p>
          <p>113. Soer. You know, though you pretend not, Callicles.</p>
          <p>Cal. Proceed still further, trifling as you are, that you may <lb/>
            know how wise you are who take upon yourself to admonish <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>Socr Does not each of us at the same time cease to be, <lb/>
            thirsty, and to receive pleasure from drinking ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do not know what you mean.</p>
          <p>Gorg. Say not so, Callicles; but answer for our sakes, that <lb/>
            the discussion may be brought to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>Cal. But this is always the way with Socrates, Gorgias, he <lb/>
            asks trifling questions, and things that are of no consequence, <lb/>
            and then refutes them.</p>
          <p>Gorg. But what difference does that make to you? That <lb/>
            is no concern at all of yours: but suffer Socrates to argue in <lb/>
            whatever way he pleases.</p>
          <p>Cal. Ask, then, these trifling and petty questions, since <lb/>
            Gorgias thinks proper.</p>
          <p>Socr. You are happy, Callicles, in that you have been <lb/>
            initiated in the great mysteries before you were in the small: <lb/>
            but I thought that was not allowed. Answer me, then, from <lb/>
            the point where you left off, does not each of us at the same <lb/>
            time cease to be thirsty, and to receive pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. And does not one cease to be hungry and to feel <lb/>
            other desires and pleasures at the same time ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does one not, then, at the same time cease to feel <lb/>
            both pains and pleasures ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>114. Socr. However one does not at the same time cease to <lb/>
            experience good and evil, as you admitted; but now do you <lb/>
            not admit it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do. But what then ?</p>
          <p>Boer. It follows, my friend, that good things are not the same <lb/>
            with such as are pleasant, nor evil things with such as are <lb/>
            painful. For, from these one ceases at the same time, but not <lb/>
            from those, because they are different. How, therefore, can <lb/>
            pleasant things be the same with such as are good, or painful <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            things with such as are evil ? But, if you please, consider it in <lb/>
            this way: for I think that you are not even thus agreed with <lb/>
            yourself: Consider then. Do you not call the good good, <lb/>
            from the presence of good things, just as you call those <lb/>
            beautiful to whom beauty is present ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? Do you call foolish men and cowards <lb/>
            good men? For you did not just now; but you said the <lb/>
            brave and prudent were so. Do you not call these good ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr But what ? Have you ever seen a boy without under­ <lb/>
            standing, rejoicing?</p>
          <p>Cal. I have.</p>
          <p>Socr And have you not also seen a man without under­ <lb/>
            standing, rejoicing ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I think I have. But to what purpose is this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Nothing: answer however.</p>
          <p>Cal. I have seen it.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? have you seen a man endued with intellect <lb/>
            grieving and rejoicing ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I have.</p>
          <p>115. Socr. But which rejoice and grieve the more; the <lb/>
            wise, or the foolish ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I think there is not much difference.</p>
          <p>Socr. That is enough. In war have you ever seen a <lb/>
            coward ?</p>
          <p>- Cal. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ?On the departure of the enemy which <lb/>
            appeared to you to rejoice the more, the cowards or the <lb/>
            brave ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Both appeared to me to rejoice more: or, if not, in <lb/>
            nearly the same degree.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is of no consequence. Cowards, then, also rejoice ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And the foolish, as it seems ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, when the enemy approaches, do cowards only <lb/>
            grieve ? or do the brave also ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Both.</p>
          <p>Socr. In an equal degree ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Cowards perhaps more.</p><pb n="199"/>
            
          <p>Socr. But, when the enemy departs, do they not rejoice <lb/>
            more ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do not, therefore, as you say, the foolish and the <lb/>
            wise, cowards and the brave, similarly grieve and rejoice, <lb/>
            much in the same degree, but cowards more than the <lb/>
            brave ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. The wise however and the brave are good, but <lb/>
            cowards and the foolish bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. The good and the bad, therefore, rejoice and grieve <lb/>
            equally ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it. <lb/>
            116. Socr. Are, then, the good and the bad, good and bad <lb/>
            in an equal degree ? or are the bad yet more good and bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. By Jupiter, I do not know what you mean.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not know that you said the good are good, <lb/>
            through the presence of good things, and the bad through <lb/>
            the presence of evil things ? And that pleasures are good <lb/>
            things, and pains evil ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I did.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are not, therefore, good things, viz., pleasures, pre­ <lb/>
            sent with those that rejoice, if they do rejoice ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And since good things are present are not they who <lb/>
            rejoice good ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? Are not evil things, viz., pains, present <lb/>
            with those that suffer pain ?</p>
          <p>Cal. They are present.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do you not say that the bad are bad, through the <lb/>
            presence of evil things ? Or do you say so no longer ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Those, therefore, that rejoice, are good; but those <lb/>
            that suffer pain are bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And those that are more so, more, but those that are <lb/>
            less so, less ? and those that are equally so, equally ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not say, then, that the wise and the foolish, <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            cowards and the brave, rejoice and grieve in an equal degree, <lb/>
            or cowards even more ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>117. Socr. Now in common with me, draw the inferences <lb/>
            that result from these admissions. For, they say, it is beautiful <lb/>
            to repeat and consider beautiful things twice, and even thrice. <lb/>
            We say, that the prudent and brave man is good; do we not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But that the foolish man and a coward is bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Again, that he who rejoices is good ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And that he who suffers pain is bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And that the good and the bad suffer pain and rejoice <lb/>
            equally, but perhaps the bad more ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, the bad man becomes equally bad and <lb/>
            good, with the good man, or even more good ? Do not these <lb/>
            results follow, as well as the former ones, if one says that the <lb/>
            pleasant and the good are the same? Are not these con­ <lb/>
            sequences necessary, Callicles ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I have been long listening to you, Socrates, and making <lb/>
            concessions, considering with myself that if any one grants you <lb/>
            any thing, even in jest, you seize it eagerly as boys do. And <lb/>
            can you suppose that I or any other person in the world does <lb/>
            not believe that some pleasures are better, and others worse ?</p>
          <p>118. Socr. Ho, Ho ! Callicles, how cunning you are ! You <lb/>
            treat me as a child, now asserting that these things are in this <lb/>
            manner, and now in another manner; trying to deceive me. <lb/>
            Though, at the outset, I did not think that I should be pur­ <lb/>
            posely deceived by you, because you are my friend. But now <lb/>
            I have been mistaken, and as it seems, must needs, according <lb/>
            to the old proverb, make good use of what I have, and receive <lb/>
            what you give me. What you now say, as it appears, is this, <lb/>
            that some pleasures are good, others bad; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr And are not the profitable good, and the noxious bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr And those which effect a certain good, are profitable, <lb/>
            but those which effect a certain evil, bad ?</p><pb n="201"/>
            
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not speak then of such as the following; as <lb/>
            for instance, with respect to the body, those pleasures whick <lb/>
            we just now mentioned of eating and drinking; and if some <lb/>
            of these produce in the body health or strength, or some other <lb/>
            bodily excellences, are they not good, but those that produce <lb/>
            the contraries of these, evil ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And are not pains, in like manner, some beneficial, <lb/>
            others injurious ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Socr Ought we not, therefore, both to choose and to exer­ <lb/>
            cise ourselves in such pleasures and pains as are beneficial ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr But not such as are injurious ?</p>
          <p>Cal. That is evident.</p>
          <p>119. Boer. For, if you remember, it was agreed between us, <lb/>
            Polus and me, that all things should be done for the sake of <lb/>
            what is good. And do you agree with us in thinking, that <lb/>
            the good is the end of all actions, and that all other things <lb/>
            ought to be done for its sake, but not it for the sake of other <lb/>
            things ? Do you accord with us and make up the third ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. We ought, then, to do both all other things and such <lb/>
            as are pleasant, for the sake of things good, but not good <lb/>
            things for the sake of such as are pleasant ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is every man, therefore, able to choose among plea­ <lb/>
            sant things such as are good, and such as are evil? or is <lb/>
            there need of a person skilled in each case ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Of a person skilled.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us then again call to mind what I said to Polus <lb/>
            and Gorgias. I said, if you remember, that there are cer­ <lb/>
            tain occupations which regard pleasure, and are occupied in <lb/>
            this alone, but are ignorant of the better and the worse; but <lb/>
            that there are others that know both what is good and what is <lb/>
            evil. And I have placed among those which have pleasure for <lb/>
            their object, cookery, as a skill relating to the body, but not an <lb/>
            art; and among those that have the good for their object I <lb/>
            placed the medicinal art. 120. And by the god of friendship, <lb/>
            Callicles, think not that you ought to jest with me, nor give <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            any answer that may occur to you contrary to your opinion, <lb/>
            nor receive what I say as if I were in jest. For you see that <lb/>
            our discourse is on a subject, than which there is none that a <lb/>
            man endued even with the smallest understanding would take <lb/>
            more pains about, namely in what way we ought to live, whe­ <lb/>
            ther in such a way as that to which you exhort me, engaging <lb/>
            in such employments of a man, as speaking among the people, <lb/>
            cultivating rhetoric, and applying oneself to political affairs, in <lb/>
            the manner which you now do; or whether we should devote <lb/>
            ourselves to a philosophic life, and in what the latter differs <lb/>
            from the former. Perhaps, then, it is best, as I just now <lb/>
            attempted, to make a distinction ; and when we have dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished and agreed with each other, that these are two <lb/>
            kinds of life, then to consider in what they differ from each <lb/>
            other, and which of them ought to be pursued. Perhaps, <lb/>
            however, you do not yet understand what I mean.</p>
          <p>121. Cal. I do not, indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. I will explain it to you more clearly. Since we have <lb/>
            agreed, you and I, that there is something good, and some­ <lb/>
            thing pleasant, and that the pleasant is different from the good, <lb/>
            and that there is a certain study and preparation for the <lb/>
            acquirement of each of them, one being a search after the <lb/>
            pleasant, and the other after the good-however, first of all, <lb/>
            grant me this, or not; do you grant it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, concede to me also what I said to these <lb/>
            men, if at the time I appeared to you to speak the truth. I said <lb/>
            that cookery does not appear to me to be an art, but a skill; <lb/>
            and that medicine is an art; for I said that medicine considers <lb/>
            the nature of that which it cures, and the cause of the things <lb/>
            that it does, and is able to give an account of each of these: <lb/>
            but that the other, being concerned about pleasure, to which <lb/>
            its whole attention is directed, proceeds to it without any art <lb/>
            at all, neither considering the nature nor the cause of pleasure, <lb/>
            altogether without reason, and in a word incapable of giving <lb/>
            any account of itself, a mere practice and skill, only preserving <lb/>
            the memory of that which usually takes place, by which also <lb/>
            it supplies pleasures. 122. First of all, then, consider whether <lb/>
            these things appear to you to have been sufficiently established, <lb/>
            and that there are also certain other corresponding studies re­ <lb/>
            lating to the soul, of which some follow rules of art, and re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            gard what is best for the soul; but others that neglect this, <lb/>
            and consider only, as in the former case, the pleasure of the <lb/>
            soul, in what way it may be procured; but paying no atten­ <lb/>
            tion to which pleasure is better or worse, nor caring for any <lb/>
            thing else than gratification only, whether it be better or <lb/>
            worse. For my part, Callicles, there appear to me to be such <lb/>
            studies; and I say that such a thing is flattery, as well in rela­ <lb/>
            tion to the body as the soul, and to any thing else the pleasure <lb/>
            of which one sedulously attends to, without paying any regard <lb/>
            to the better and the worse. But do you entertain the same <lb/>
            opinion as we do respecting these things, or do you gainsay it ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No, but I yield this point in order that our discussion <lb/>
            may be brought to a close, and that I may gratify Gorgias here.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does this take place with respect to one soul, but not <lb/>
            with respect to two and several ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No; but it takes place with respect to two and several.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, then, possible to gratify a number of souls <lb/>
            collected together, without considering at all what is best ?</p>
          <p>123. Cal. I think so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Can you tell me, then, what those studies are which <lb/>
            produce this effect ? Or rather, if you please, on my asking, <lb/>
            whichever appears to you to be one of these, say so, and which <lb/>
            not, deny it. And first of all, let us consider flute-playing. <lb/>
            Does it not appear to you to be such a thing, Callicles, as pur­ <lb/>
            sues only our pleasure, but regards nothing else ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is it not the case with all such studies, as for <lb/>
            instance, harp-playing in the public games ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And what as to the representation of choruses and <lb/>
            dithyrambic poetry? does it not appear to you to be of the <lb/>
            same kind? Do you think that Cinesias son of Meles cares <lb/>
            at all to express himself in such a way that his hearers may <lb/>
            become better ? or rather what will gratify the crowd of spec­ <lb/>
            tators ?</p>
          <p>Cal. The latter is clearly the case, Socrates, with respect to <lb/>
            Cinesias.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what as to his father Meles? Did he appear to <lb/>
            you to play on the harp, looking to that which is best? or <lb/>
            did not he look to what was most pleasant? For in singing <lb/>
            he offended the audience. Consider, however; does not all <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            harp-playing and dithyrambic poetry appear to you to have <lb/>
            been invented for the sake of pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It does.</p>
          <p>124. Socr But what of that venerable and wonderful art, <lb/>
            tragic poetry, at what does it aim ? Do its endeavour and aim <lb/>
            appear to you to be only to gratify the spectators ? or does <lb/>
            it strive, if any thing should be pleasing and grateful to them, <lb/>
            but mischievous, to avoid saying this, but if it happens to be <lb/>
            unpleasant and beneficial, to say and sing this, whether it gra­ <lb/>
            tifies the spectators or not ? In which of these two ways do <lb/>
            you think tragic poetry is framed ?</p>
          <p>Cal. This is clear, Socrates, that it rather aims at pleasure, <lb/>
            and the gratification of the spectators.</p>
          <p>Socr. Did we not just now say, Callicles, that a thing of <lb/>
            this kind is flattery ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, if any one should take from all poetry, <lb/>
            melody, rhythm, and measure, would any thing else than words <lb/>
            remain ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr Are not these words, then, addressed to a great mul­ <lb/>
            titude, and to the people ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Poetry, therefore, is a kind of popular speaking.</p>
          <p>Cal. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr Therefore it must be a rhetorical method of popular <lb/>
            speaking: for do not poets appear to you to employ rhetoric <lb/>
            in the theatres ?</p>
          <p>Cal. They do.</p>
          <p>125. Socr. Now, therefore, we have found a certain rhetoric <lb/>
            among the people, consisting at the same time of boys and <lb/>
            women and men, slaves and free-men, of which we do not alto­ <lb/>
            gether approve ; for we have called it flattery.</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well then. But as to the rhetoric addressed to the <lb/>
            Athenian people, and the people in other cities consisting of <lb/>
            free-men, what shall we say as to that ? Do the rhetoricians <lb/>
            appear to you always to speak with a view to what is best, <lb/>
            aiming at this, that the citizens may be made as good as possi­ <lb/>
            ble by their discourses ? or do they, too, endeavour to gratify <lb/>
            the citizens, and neglecting the public interest for the sake of <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            their own private advantage, do they treat the people as chil­ <lb/>
            dren, trying only to gratify them, without being in the least <lb/>
            concerned whether they shall become better or worse by these <lb/>
            means ?</p>
          <p>Cal. This is not a simple question that you ask me. For <lb/>
            there are some who, looking to the interest of the citizens, say <lb/>
            what they do; but others are such as you describe.</p>
          <p>126. Socr. That is enough. For, if this also is twofold, <lb/>
            one part of it will be flattery, and a base popular speaking, but <lb/>
            the other will be honourable, namely, that which endeavours <lb/>
            to make the souls of the citizens as good as possible, and <lb/>
            strives to speak what is best, whether it be pleasant or unplea­ <lb/>
            sant to the hearers. But you have never yet seen this kind of <lb/>
            rhetoric. Or, if you can mention any one of the rhetoricians <lb/>
            who is of this stamp, why do you not tell me who he is ?</p>
          <p>Cal. But, by Jupiter, I cannot instance to you any of the <lb/>
            rhetoricians of the present day.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? Can you instance any one of the ancients <lb/>
            through whose means the Athenians have become better, after <lb/>
            he had begun to harangue them, when previously they had <lb/>
            been worse ? -For I know not who such a one is.</p>
          <p>Cal. What ? Have you not heard that Themistocles was a <lb/>
            good man, and Cimon and Miltiades, and Pericles, who died <lb/>
            lately, whom you have also heard ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If that is true virtue, Callicles, which you before men­ <lb/>
            tioned as such, namely, for a man to gratify both his own de­ <lb/>
            sires and those of others. But if this is not the case, but, as <lb/>
            we were afterwards compelled to confess, those desires which, <lb/>
            when satisfied, make a man better, ought to be indulged, but <lb/>
            those which make him worse, not so, and if there is a certain <lb/>
            art in this, can you say that any one of these was a man of this <lb/>
            kind ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I know not what to say.</p>
          <p>127.Socr. But if you seek well, you will find out. Let us <lb/>
            however, consider, and see quietly if any one of these was <lb/>
            such. For come, is it not true that a good man, who says <lb/>
            what he says with a view to the best, does not speak at ran­ <lb/>
            dom, but looking to some end ? just as all other artists, look­ <lb/>
            in- each to his own work, does not take at random and em­ <lb/>
            ploy what he employs in his work, but so that the subject he <lb/>
            is at work upon may have a certain form : for instance, if you <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            will look at painters, architects, shipwrights, and any other <lb/>
            artists you please, you will see that each places whatever he em­ <lb/>
            ploys in a certain order, and compels one thing to adapt itself <lb/>
            to and harmonize with another, until the whole workmanship <lb/>
            is compacted together with order and regularity. And more­ <lb/>
            over, those other artificers, whom we just now mentioned, who <lb/>
            are employed about the body, teachers of gymnastics, and phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, adorn the body in a way, and dispose it in an orderly <lb/>
            manner. Do we allow that this is so or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Let it be so.</p>
          <p>128. Socr. A house, then, that has acquired order and re­ <lb/>
            gularity will be a good house, but when disorder, a bad one.</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>Socr. And a ship in like manner ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And do we not say the same with respect to our bodies ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what as to the soul? when in a state of disorder <lb/>
            will it be in a good condition, or when it is in a state of order <lb/>
            and regularity ?</p>
          <p>Cal. From what has been said, it is necessary to grant that <lb/>
            the latter must be the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. What, then, in the body, is the name of that which <lb/>
            results from order and regularity ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You probably mean health and strength.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do. But what, again, is the name of that which <lb/>
            subsists in the soul from order and regularity ? Endeavour to <lb/>
            discover and mention it, as you did the name of the former.</p>
          <p>Cal. Why do not you say what it is yourself, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If it pleases you better, I will. But do you, if I seem <lb/>
            to you to speak well, assent, if not, confute, and do not spare <lb/>
            me. To me, then, it appears that the name belonging to the <lb/>
            orderly disposition of the body is the healthful, from which <lb/>
            health springs, and every other excellence of the body. Is it <lb/>
            so, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. But the name belonging to the orderly and regular <lb/>
            disposition of the soul is the legitimate and law; whence men <lb/>
            become obedient to law and orderly; but these are justice and <lb/>
            temperance. Do you admit this or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so.</p><pb n="207"/>
            
          <p>129. Socr. Will not, then, that good rhetorician who follows <lb/>
            the rules of art, looking to these things, address the arguments <lb/>
            he uses and all his actions to souls, and if he should bestow a <lb/>
            gift, will he not bestow it, and, if he should take any thing <lb/>
            away, will he not take it away with the same end, always di­ <lb/>
            recting his attention to this, that justice may be produced in <lb/>
            the souls of his fellow-citizens, and injustice banished; that <lb/>
            temperance may be produced in them, and intemperance <lb/>
            banished; and, in short, that every virtue may be planted in <lb/>
            them, but vice driven out. Do you grant this, or not?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do grant it.</p>
          <p>Socr. For where is the utility, Callicles, in giving a body <lb/>
            diseased, and ill-disposed, abundance of the most agreeable <lb/>
            food or drink, or any thing else, which will not be more pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to it than the contrary, but, according to right reason, <lb/>
            even less ? Is this so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Socr. For I think it is of no advantage for a man to live <lb/>
            with a miserable state of body; for thus it would be necessary <lb/>
            for him to live miserably: is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And do not physicians generally allow a man in <lb/>
            health to satisfy his desires, as, for instance, when hungry to <lb/>
            eat as much as he pleases, or when thirsty to drink, but when <lb/>
            ill, they scarcely ever allow him to satisfy himself with what <lb/>
            he desires ? Do you grant this too ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>130. Socr. And should not the same method, my excellent <lb/>
            friend, be adopted with respect to the soul ? So long as it is <lb/>
            depraved, as being without understanding, intemperate, unjust <lb/>
            and unholy, one ought to restrain it from the indulgence of its <lb/>
            desires, and not permit it to do any thing except what will <lb/>
            render it better ? Do you admit this or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr For this surely is better for the soul itself.</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr And is not to restrain any one from what he desires <lb/>
            to punish him ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. To be punished, therefore, is better for the soul than <lb/>
            intemperance, as you just now thought.</p><pb n="208"/>
            
          <p>Cal. I don't know what you mean, Socrates: ask some one <lb/>
            else.</p>
          <p>Socr. This man will not submit to be benefited and to suffer <lb/>
            the very thing of which we are speaking, viz., punishment.</p>
          <p>Cal. I don't at all heed what you say; I only answered you <lb/>
            thus far for the sake of Gorgias.</p>
          <p>131. Socr. Be it so. What shall we do then? Shall we <lb/>
            break off the discussion in the midst ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You shall determine.</p>
          <p>Socr. But they say it is not right to leave even fables in the <lb/>
            midst, but a head should be placed on them, that they may not <lb/>
            wander without a head. Answer, therefore, to what remains, <lb/>
            that our discussion may have a head to it.</p>
          <p>Cal. How importunate you are, Socrates! But, if you will <lb/>
            be persuaded by me, you will give up this discussion, or carry <lb/>
            it on with some one else.</p>
          <p>Socr. Who else is willing ? for we must not leave the dis­ <lb/>
            cussion unfinished.</p>
          <p>Cal. Cannot you go through with it yourself, either speak­ <lb/>
            ing by yourself or answering yourself?</p>
          <p>Socr. That the saying of Epicharmus may be verified in me, <lb/>
            "what two men said before, I alone am able to say." But it <lb/>
            appears to be very necessary. If, however, we shall do so, <lb/>
            I think we ought all of us to strive heartily that we may <lb/>
            understand what is true and what false with respect to the <lb/>
            subject we are treating of: for it is for the common interest of <lb/>
            all that this should become clear. 132. I will, therefore, go <lb/>
            through the matter under discussion, as it appears to me to <lb/>
            be : but, if I shall seem to any of you to grant myself what is <lb/>
            not true, he must take me up and confute me. For I do not <lb/>
            say what I say as knowing it, but I am enquiring in common <lb/>
            with you, so that, if he who disputes with me should appear to <lb/>
            say any thing to the purpose, I shall be the first to give in to <lb/>
            him. I say this, however, in case you think the discussion <lb/>
            ought to be finished; but if you do not wish it, let us give it <lb/>
            up and depart.</p>
          <p>Gorg. But it appears to me, Socrates, that we should not <lb/>
            depart yet, but that you should pursue the argument: and it <lb/>
            is evident that the others think so. And I, for my part, wish <lb/>
            to hear you go through the remainder of the subject.</p>
          <p>Socr. But indeed, Gorgias, I would gladly have continued <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            to carry on the discussion with Callicles here, until I had given <lb/>
            him back the saying of Amphion for that of Zethusr: but <lb/>
            since you are not willing, Callicles, to finish the discussion <lb/>
            with me, yet listen to me at least, and take me up if I appear <lb/>
            to you to say any thing incorrectly. And if you shall confute <lb/>
            jne, I shall not be angry with you, as you are with me, but <lb/>
            you shall be recorded by me as my greatest benefactor.</p>
          <p>Cal. Speak then yourself, my good friend, and finish the <lb/>
            argument.</p>
          <p>133. Socr. Hear me then repeating the argument from the <lb/>
            beginning. Are the pleasant and the good the same ? They <lb/>
            are not the same, as I and Callicles have agreed. But whether <lb/>
            is the pleasant to be done for the sake of the good, or the <lb/>
            good for the sake of the pleasant ? The pleasant for the sake <lb/>
            of the good. But is the pleasant that, with which when pre­ <lb/>
            sent we are pleased ? and the good that, by which when pre­ <lb/>
            sent we are good ? Certainly. Now we are good, both our­ <lb/>
            selves and all other things that are good, when a certain <lb/>
            virtue is present? To me this appears to be necessary, Cal­ <lb/>
            tides. But the virtue of each thing, whether instrument, or <lb/>
            body, or soul, and moreover of every animal, does not reach <lb/>
            a high pitch of perfection by chance, but by order, and recti­ <lb/>
            tude, and the art that is attributed to each of them. Is this <lb/>
            so ? I admit it. The virtue, then, of every thing is regulated <lb/>
            and adorned by order? I should say so. A certain order, <lb/>
            then, proper to each, becoming inherent in each, makes each <lb/>
            thing good ? It appears so to me. The soul, therefore, that <lb/>
            has its own order, is better than that which is without order ? <lb/>
            Necessarily so. That, however, which has order is orderly? <lb/>
            How should it not ? And that which is orderly is temperate ? <lb/>
            Most necessarily. 134. A temperate soul, then, is good ? I <lb/>
            am not able to say any thing against this, my dear Callicles; <lb/>
            but do you, if you can do so, inform me.</p>
          <p>Cal. Proceed, my good friend.</p>
          <p>Socr. I say, then, that if a temperate soul is good, that which <lb/>
            is affected contrariwise to the temperate is base: and this <lb/>
            surely is the foolish and intemperate ? Certainly. Moreover, <lb/>
            a temperate man would act becomingly both towards gods and <lb/>
            towards men ? for he would not be temperate if he acted <lb/>
            unbecomingly? It must needs be so. Moreover, by acting <note type="footnote"> r See before, § 90. </note> <note type="footnote"> P </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            becomingly towards men he would act justly, and towards the <lb/>
            gods piously; but it is necessary that he who acts justly and <lb/>
            piously should be just and pious ? It must be so. It is more­ <lb/>
            over necessary that he should be brave ? for it is not the part <lb/>
            of a temperate man either to pursue or avoid what is not <lb/>
            becoming, but to pursue and avoid those things and men, <lb/>
            pleasures and pains, which he ought, and to endure patiently <lb/>
            wherever he ought. 135. So that it is absolutely necessary, <lb/>
            Callicles, that the temperate man, as we have described him, <lb/>
            being just, brave, and pious, should be a perfectly good man, <lb/>
            and that a good man should do whatever he does well and <lb/>
            honourably, and that he who does well should be blessed and <lb/>
            happy, but that the wicked, who does ill, should be wretched: <lb/>
            but this latter would be directly contrary to the temperate <lb/>
            man, namely, the intemperate, whom you praised. I, there­ <lb/>
            fore, thus lay down these things, and affirm that they are true. <lb/>
            But if they are true, as it seems, he who wishes to be happy <lb/>
            must pursue and practise temperance, and must avoid intem­ <lb/>
            perance, every one of us with all his might, and must endea­ <lb/>
            your never to stand in need of punishment, but if he does need <lb/>
            it, either he or any of his family, whether it be the case of a <lb/>
            private person, or a city, justice must be administered, and <lb/>
            punishment inflicted, if he is to be happy. This appears to me <lb/>
            to be the mark to which we ought to look for the guidance of <lb/>
            our life, and referring all private and public actions to this <lb/>
            point, that justice and temperance may be ever present with <lb/>
            him who will be blessed, and to act accordingly, not suffering <lb/>
            his desires to be intemperate, nor endeavouring to satisfy them, <lb/>
            which is an irremediable evil, causing a man to live like a rob­ <lb/>
            ber. For such an one could neither be dear to any other <lb/>
            man, nor to God; for it is impossible there can be any commu­ <lb/>
            nion between them; and where there is no communion there <lb/>
            can be no friendship. 136. The sages8 too, say, Callicles, <lb/>
            that heaven and earth, gods and men, are held together by com­ <lb/>
            munion, friendship, order, temperance, and justice, and for this <lb/>
            reason, my friend, they call this universe, ordert, and not dis­ <lb/>
            order or intemperance. You, however, appear to me not to <lb/>
            attend to these things, and this though you are wise; but it <lb/>
            has escaped your observation that geometrical equality has <note type="footnote"> s The Pythagoreans, especially Empedocles. </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόσμος</foreign>, "order," signifying also the world.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            great power both among gods and among men ; on the con­ <lb/>
            trary you think that every one should strive to get more than <lb/>
            others ; for you neglect geometry. Well then; either this <lb/>
            argument of mine must be confuted, and it must be shewn that <lb/>
            the happy are not happy from the possession of justice and <lb/>
            temperance, and the wretched, wretched from vice; or, if the <lb/>
            argument is true, we must consider what are its results. Now, <lb/>
            Callicles, all those things before mentioned, with respect to <lb/>
            which you asked me if I was speaking in earnest, result from <lb/>
            it, to the effect that a man should accuse himself, his son, and <lb/>
            his friend, if he committed any injustice, and should employ <lb/>
            rhetoric for this purpose. And what you thought Polus granted <lb/>
            through shame was therefore true, that by how much it is <lb/>
            more base to do an injury than to be injured, by so much is it <lb/>
            worse: and that he who would be a good orator ought to be <lb/>
            just and skilled in the knowledge of things just; which, again, <lb/>
            Polus said Gorgias acknowledged through shame.</p>
          <p>137. This then being the case, let us consider what it is <lb/>
            that you find fault with in me, and whether you are right or <lb/>
            not in saying that I can neither assist myself, nor any of my <lb/>
            friends or domestics, nor save myself from the greatest dangers, <lb/>
            but that I am in the power of any one who chooses, like men <lb/>
            marked with infamy, if he pleases, according to that petulant <lb/>
            expression of yours, to strike me on the face, or to take away <lb/>
            my property, or expel me from the city, or, worst of all, to <lb/>
            kill me, and that to be thus circumstanced, is the most dis­ <lb/>
            graceful of all things, according to your opinion. But mine <lb/>
            is this, it has indeed been often mentioned, yet nothing pre­ <lb/>
            vents its being again repeated; I deny, Callicles, that to be <lb/>
            struck in the face unjustly is most disgraceful, or for my body <lb/>
            or purse to be cut, but that to strike unjustly and to cut me <lb/>
            and mine, is both more disgraceful and worse, and that to rob, <lb/>
            enslave, break open a house, and, in short, to injure in any <lb/>
            respect me and mine, is both more disgraceful and. worse for <lb/>
            him who does the injury than for me who am injured. ' 138. <lb/>
            These things, that were proved to be thus in the. former part <lb/>
            of our discussion, as I affirm, are held and bound (though it <lb/>
            is somewhat rude to say so) in reasons of iron and ada­ <lb/>
            mant, as would really appear to be the case, so that unless <lb/>
            you or some one stronger than you can break them, it is <lb/>
            not possible that any one who says otherwise than as I now. <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            say can speak correctly; for my statement is always the same, <lb/>
            that I know not how these things are, but that of all the per­ <lb/>
            sons with whom I have ever conversed, as now with you, no <lb/>
            one, who says otherwise, can avoid being ridiculous. I there­ <lb/>
            fore again assert that these things are so. But if this is the <lb/>
            case, and injustice is the greatest of evils to him that commits <lb/>
            it, and if, great as this evil is, it is still a greater, if possible, <lb/>
            for one who acts unjustly not to be punished, what kind of help <lb/>
            will that be, which, if a man cannot procure for himself, he <lb/>
            would be really ridiculous? will it not be that which would <lb/>
            avert from us the greatest harm? But there is an absolute <lb/>
            necessity that this should be most disgraceful, for a man not <lb/>
            to be able to assist either himself, or his friends and domestics, <lb/>
            next to that, an inability to avoid the second evil, and the third, <lb/>
            an inability to avoid the third evil, and so on with the rest; in <lb/>
            proportion to the magnitude of each evil, so is it beautiful to <lb/>
            be able to avoid each of them, and disgraceful not to be able. <lb/>
            Is the case thus or otherwise, Callicles ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No otherwise.</p>
          <p>139. Socr. Of these two things then, the doing injustice <lb/>
            and receiving an injury, we say that to do injustice is a greater <lb/>
            evil, but to receive an injury a less one. By recourse to what <lb/>
            means, then, could a man so assist himself as to have both <lb/>
            these advantages, that of not doing injustice, and that of not <lb/>
            receiving an injury? Is it by power, or will? I mean thus: <lb/>
            whether, if a man wishes not to be injured, will he not be in­ <lb/>
            jured, or, if he has acquired the power of not being injured, will <lb/>
            he not be injured ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is clear that he will not, if he has acquired the power.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what with respect to doing Injustice ? Whether, <lb/>
            if any one wishes not to do injustice, is this sufficient, (for in <lb/>
            that case he will not do it,) or, besides this, is it requisite to <lb/>
            acquire a certain power and art, so that, unless he has learned <lb/>
            and practised them, he will do injustice ? Come then, answer <lb/>
            me this question, Callicles ; whether do Polus and I appear to <lb/>
            you to have been compelled, rightly or not, to make that ad­ <lb/>
            mission in the former part of our discussion, when we admitted <lb/>
            that no one willingly commits injustice, but that all who do <lb/>
            commit it do so unwillingly ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Let that point be granted, Socrates, in order that you <lb/>
            may bring the argument to a conclusion.</p><pb n="213"/>
            
          <p>Socr. For this purpose, then, as it appears, we must acquire <lb/>
            a certain power and art, in order that we may not commit in­ <lb/>
            justice.</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>140. Socr. What then is the art by means of which a man <lb/>
            will receive no injury at all, or scarcely any ? Consider, if it <lb/>
            appears to you the same as it does to me. For to me it <lb/>
            appears thus; either that he ought to govern in a city or <lb/>
            even have absolute power, or be a friend of the existing <lb/>
            government.</p>
          <p>Cal. Do you observe, Socrates, how ready I am to praise <lb/>
            vou, if you say any thing well ? This you appear to me to <lb/>
            have said remarkably well.</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider also, whether I appear to you to say this <lb/>
            well. Each person seems to me for the most part to be a <lb/>
            friend to each, according as the ancient sages say like to <lb/>
            like:" does it not seem so to you ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It does.</p>
          <p>Socr. Wherever, therefore, a savage and uneducated tyrant <lb/>
            governs, if there should be any one in the city much better <lb/>
            than him, would not the tyrant fear him, and never be able to <lb/>
            be cordially his friend ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Nor yet, if any one should be much worse than the <lb/>
            tyrant, would he become his friend; for the tyrant would <lb/>
            despise him, nor ever feel any affection for him as a friend.</p>
          <p>Cal. This also is true.</p>
          <p>141. Socr. It remains, therefore, that he alone would be a <lb/>
            friend, worthy of notice, to such a man, who, having a similar <lb/>
            disposition, should blame and praise the same things, and be <lb/>
            willing to be governed by and submit to his sway. Such a <lb/>
            person will have great influence in this city, and no one will <lb/>
            injure him with impunity. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, any young man in this city should con­ <lb/>
            sider within himself, " How could I obtain influence, and be <lb/>
            injured by no one ?” this, as it seems, must be his method, he <lb/>
            must from his very youth accustom himself to rejoice and <lb/>
            grieve at the same things as the despot, and contrive to make <lb/>
            himself as like him as possible. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p><pb n="214"/>
            
          <p>Socr. Will not he, then, have managed so as not to be in­ <lb/>
            jured, and to have great power in that city, according to your <lb/>
            argument ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will he also manage not to commit injustice ? or far <lb/>
            from it, since he will be like the governor, who is unjust, and <lb/>
            will have great influence with him ? I think, for my part, that <lb/>
            quite contrariwise he will contrive so as to be able to commit <lb/>
            the greatest injustice and not to be punished for it. Will he <lb/>
            not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will not, then, the greatest evil befal him, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of being depraved in his soul, and tainted through imi­ <lb/>
            tation of the despot and his influence with him ?</p>
          <p>142. Cal. I know not, Socrates, how you always turn the <lb/>
            arguments upside down. Do you not know, that he who <lb/>
            imitates can kill him who does not imitate the despot if he <lb/>
            pleases, and deprive him of his property ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I do know it, good Callicles, unless I am deaf, since I <lb/>
            have just now heard it often both from you and Polus, and <lb/>
            from almost every one else in the city. But do you in your <lb/>
            turn listen to me : he will kill him if he pleases, but a depraved <lb/>
            man, one who is upright and good.</p>
          <p>Cal. And is not this a thing to be indignant at ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Not to a man of sense, as our argument proves. Do <lb/>
            you think that a man should aim at this; to live as long as <lb/>
            possible, and should study those arts which always preserve us <lb/>
            from dangers, as rhetoric which you bid me study, and which <lb/>
            saves us in courts of justice ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do, by Jupiter, and therein I advise you well.</p>
          <p>143. Socr. What then, my excellent friend, does the science <lb/>
            of swimming too appear to you to be very fine ?</p>
          <p>Cal. No, by Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Socr. And yet this too saves men from death, when they fall <lb/>
            into such a danger as requires this science. But if this appears <lb/>
            to you to be mean, I will mention to you one more important <lb/>
            than this, namely that of piloting a ship, which not only saves <lb/>
            lives, but also bodies and property from extreme danger, just <lb/>
            as rhetoric does. And this art is moderate and modest, and <lb/>
            does not brag and strut as if it accomplished something won­ <lb/>
            derful, but when it has accomplished the same thing as the <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            forensic art, if it has brought us safe here from Ægina, it de­ <lb/>
            mands, I think, two oboli, and if from Egypt or the Pontus, <lb/>
            for so great a benefit in having brought safe what I now men­ <lb/>
            tion, ourselves and children, our property and wives, and in <lb/>
            having landed them in port, it usually demands two drachms, <lb/>
            and the man who possesses this art, and accomplishes these <lb/>
            things, when he has disembarked, walks by the sea and his <lb/>
            ship, with a modest gait. 144. For he knows, I think, how <lb/>
            to reason with himself, that it is uncertain whom of his pas­ <lb/>
            sengers he has benefited by not allowing them to be drowned, <lb/>
            and whom he has injured, knowing that he has not put them <lb/>
            ashore in any respect better than they were when they went on <lb/>
            board, either as to their souls or bodies. He therefore reasons <lb/>
            with himself, that if one who is afflicted in his body with severe <lb/>
            and incurable diseases should happen not to be drowned, such <lb/>
            a man is indeed miserable for having escaped death, and has <lb/>
            received no benefit from him; but if any one labours under <lb/>
            many and incurable diseases in that which is more precious <lb/>
            than the body, his soul, such a one ought u not to live, nor <lb/>
            would he benefit him, if he saved him from the sea, or from a <lb/>
            court of justice, or from any other danger, for he knows that it <lb/>
            is not better for a depraved man to live, because he must needs <lb/>
            live badly. For this reason, it is not usual for a pilot to boast, <lb/>
            although he saves our lives ; nor, my admirable friend, is it <lb/>
            usual for an engineer who is sometimes able to save, no less <lb/>
            than a general of an army, not to mention a pilot or any other <lb/>
            person; for sometimes he saves whole cities. Does it not <lb/>
            appear to you that he is fit to be compared with a forensic <lb/>
            orator ? though, if he chose to speak, Callicles, as you do, ex­ <lb/>
            tolling his own art, he would overwhelm you with words, <lb/>
            urging and exhorting you to the fitness of your becoming an <lb/>
            engineer, for that other things are of no consequence ; and he <lb/>
            would have enough to say. 145. You, however, would never­ <lb/>
            theless despise him and his art, and, by way of reproach would <lb/>
            call him an engineer, and would neither give your daughter to <lb/>
            his son, nor accept his daughter for your son. Though, if <lb/>
            from the reasons for which you praise your own art, on what <lb/>
            just pretext do you despise the engineer, and the others whom <lb/>
            I have just now mentioned ? I know that you would say you <note type="footnote">u The negative particle here expressed, is in the original at the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the paragraph, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογίζεται οὗν, ὃτι οὐκ</foreign>. See Stallbaum's lucid note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            are better, and of a better family. But if that which is better <lb/>
            is not what I say it is, but if excellence consists in this, for a <lb/>
            man to save himself and his property, whatever kind of man <lb/>
            he may be, then your contempt for the engineer and the pby­ <lb/>
            sician, and for whatever other arts are pursued for the purpose <lb/>
            of preservation, is ridiculous.</p>
          <p>But, my good friend, consider whether that which is noble <lb/>
            and good is not something else than to save and be saved; <lb/>
            and whether that principle, that one should live as long as one <lb/>
            can, is not to be given up by one who is truly a man, and life <lb/>
            not too fondly loved, but that leaving these things to the care <lb/>
            of the deity, and believing the women, who say that no man <lb/>
            can avoid his fate, one should consider this, by what means one <lb/>
            may pass the remainder of one's life in the best possible <lb/>
            manner, whether by conforming one's-self to the government <lb/>
            under which one dwells. 146. And in that case whether it is <lb/>
            right that you should resemble as much as possible the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian people, if you wish to be dear to them, and to have great <lb/>
            influence in their city? Consider whether this is advantageous <lb/>
            to you and to me, lest, my admirable friend, we should suffer <lb/>
            what they say the Thessalian x witches did, who drew down <lb/>
            the moon, and our choice of this power in the city should be <lb/>
            attended with the loss of what is dearest to us. If, however, <lb/>
            you think that any man in the world can teach you any such <lb/>
            art, as will cause you to have great power in this city, while <lb/>
            you are unlike the character of the people, whether for the <lb/>
            better or the worse, as appears to me, Callicles, you are not <lb/>
            rightly advised. For you must not only be an imitator of, but <lb/>
            like them in your natural disposition, if you mean to do any <lb/>
            thing effectual towards gaining the friendship of the Athenian <lb/>
            people, and, by Jupiter, you must towards that of the son of <lb/>
            Pyrilampes. Whoever, therefore, shall make you most like <lb/>
            them, will make you a politician and an orator, such as you <lb/>
            desire to be. For all men are delighted with arguments suited <lb/>
            to their own dispositions, but are angry with such as are <lb/>
            strange to them; unless you, my dear friend, have any thing <lb/>
            to say to the contrary. 147. Have we any objection to make <lb/>
            to this, Callicles ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do not know how it is, Socrates, you appear to me to <note type="footnote"> x They are said to have lost the use of their eyes and feet. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            speak well. Yet that which happens to most happens to me; <lb/>
            I am not quite persuaded by you.</p>
          <p>Socr. For the love of the people, Callicles, dwelling in your <lb/>
            soul, resists me; but perhaps, if we should often and more <lb/>
            fully examine into these same matters, you would be persuaded. <lb/>
            Remember, then, that we said there were two methods for the <lb/>
            cultivation of each, both the body and the soul, and that one <lb/>
            had reference to pleasure, but the other to that which is best, <lb/>
            not by gratifying, but opposing the inclinations. Is not this <lb/>
            what we before settled ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. The one, then, that looks to pleasure is ignoble, and <lb/>
            nothing else than flattery; is it not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so, if you please.</p>
          <p>Socr. But the other endeavours that that which we cultivate <lb/>
            may be made as excellent as possible, whether it be the body <lb/>
            or the soul ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must we then so endeavour to cultivate the city and the <lb/>
            citizens, that we may make the citizens themselves as good as <lb/>
            possible ? For without this, as we discovered before, it is of no <lb/>
            advantage to confer any other benefit upon them, unless the <lb/>
            mind of those who are about to receive either great riches, <lb/>
            or dominion or any other power, be upright and good. Shall <lb/>
            we lay this down, as being so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly, if it is more agreeable to you.</p>
          <p>148. Socr. If, therefore, Callicles, when setting about some <lb/>
            public works, we were to exhort one another to works of archi­ <lb/>
            tecture, as to very large buildings of walls, or docks or tem­ <lb/>
            ples, would it be necessary that we should consider and ex­ <lb/>
            amine ourselves, first, whether we are skilled or not in the art <lb/>
            of architecture, and from whom we learnt it? Would this be <lb/>
            necessary or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then, secondly, we should consider this, whether we <lb/>
            have ever constructed any private building, either for any one <lb/>
            of our friends, or for ourselves, and whether this building is <lb/>
            beautiful or ugly. And if on examination we found that our <lb/>
            masters had been good and famous, and that we have con­ <lb/>
            structed, in conjunction with our masters, many and beautiful <lb/>
            buildings, and many privately by ourselves, after we had left <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            our masters, in that case it would become men of sense to un­ <lb/>
            dertake public works: but if we were not able to shew that <lb/>
            we had a master, nor any building at all, or many and those of <lb/>
            no account, it would surely in that case be foolish to attempt <lb/>
            public works, and to exhort one another to undertake them. <lb/>
            Shall we admit that this is well said, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>149. Socr. And is not this the case with all other things, <lb/>
            and if, attempting to serve the public in the capacity of phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, we should exhort each other, as if we were skilful phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, should not you and I examine each other thus: By the <lb/>
            gods, in what state is Socrates with respect to bodily health ? <lb/>
            Has any other person, whether slave or freeman, been cured by <lb/>
            Socrates of any disease ? And I too, I think, should make <lb/>
            similar enquiries about you. And if we did not find that any <lb/>
            one, whether stranger or citizen, man or woman, had been im­ <lb/>
            proved in health by our means, by Jupiter, Callicles, would it <lb/>
            not be truly ridiculous, that men should come to such a pitch <lb/>
            of folly, as before they had practised much in private, as best <lb/>
            they could, and had succeeded in many cases, and thoroughly <lb/>
            exercised the art, to attempt to learn the potter's art in making <lb/>
            a pitcher, as the proverb goes, and attempt to serve the public <lb/>
            in the capacity of physician, and exhort others to do the same ? <lb/>
            Does it not appear to you that it would be foolish to act <lb/>
            thus ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It does.</p>
          <p>150. Socr. But now, 0 best of men, since you have your­ <lb/>
            self just now begun to busy yourself in affairs of state, and you <lb/>
            exhort and reprove me because I do not busy myself about <lb/>
            them, should we not examine each other; Come then, whom of <lb/>
            the citizens has Callicles yet made better ? Is there any one <lb/>
            who, being before depraved, unjust, intemperate, and foolish, <lb/>
            has become upright and good through Callicles, whether stranger <lb/>
            or citizen, slave or free-man? Tell me, Callicles, if any one <lb/>
            should ask you these questions, what will you say ? Who will <lb/>
            you say has been made better by associating with you ? Are <lb/>
            you ashamed to answer, whether you have done any such <lb/>
            -work while you were in a private capacity, before you at­ <lb/>
            tempted to interfere in public affairs ?</p>
          <p>Cal. You are cavilling, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do not ask you from a desire to cavil, but really wish­ <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            ing to know in what way you think public affairs ought to be con­ <lb/>
            ducted by us; whether on undertaking the management of <lb/>
            affairs of state we ought to attend to any thing else than how <lb/>
            we may become as good citizens as possible. Have we not <lb/>
            already often admitted that a politician ought to do this ? Have <lb/>
            we admitted it or not? Answer. We have admitted it; I <lb/>
            will answer for you. 151. If, then, a good man ought to en­ <lb/>
            deavour to procure this for his city, now call to mind and say <lb/>
            with respect to those men whom you a little before mentioned, <lb/>
            whether they still appear to you to have been good citizens, <lb/>
            Pericles, Cimon, Miltiades and Themistocles.</p>
          <p>Cal. To me they do.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, they were good citizens, it is evident <lb/>
            that each of them made their fellow-citizens better instead of <lb/>
            worse. Did they so, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. When Pericles, therefore, began to speak in public, <lb/>
            were the Athenians worse than when he addressed them for <lb/>
            the last time ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Socr. There is no 'perhaps' in the case, my good friend, <lb/>
            but this is a necessary consequence from what has been ad­ <lb/>
            mitted, if he really was a good citizen.</p>
          <p>Cal. But what then ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Nothing. But tell me this moreover, whether the <lb/>
            Athenians are supposed to have become better through Pericles, <lb/>
            or quite the contrary, to have been corrupted by him. For so <lb/>
            I hear, that Pericles made the Athenians idle, cowardly, talka­ <lb/>
            tive and avaricious, having been the first to give them pay.</p>
          <p>Cal. You hear this, Socrates, from those whose ears have <lb/>
            been bruised y.</p>
          <p>152. Socr. However, I no longer hear this, but I know well and <lb/>
            so do you, that Pericles at first bore a high character, and that <lb/>
            the Athenians passed no ignominious sentence upon him, when <lb/>
            they were worse, but when by his means they had become <lb/>
            upright and good, towards the close of the life of Pericles, they <lb/>
            condemned him for peculation, and were on the point of sen­ <lb/>
            tencing him to death, clearly as being a bad citizen.</p>
          <p>Cal. What then ? Was Pericles on this account a bad man ? <note type="footnote"> y The Spartans; see the Protagoras, § 80. </note></p><pb n="220"/>
            
          <p>Socr. Such an one, indeed, would be thought a bad manager <lb/>
            of asses, horses, and oxen, if having received them, neither <lb/>
            kicking, nor butting, nor biting, he should make them do all <lb/>
            these things through vice. Does not every trainer of any ani­ <lb/>
            mal whatever appear to you to be a bad one, who, having re­ <lb/>
            ceived it gentle, has made it more vicious than he received it ? <lb/>
            Does he appear so, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly, that I may gratify you.</p>
          <p>Socr. Gratify me, then, by answering this too, whether man <lb/>
            is of the class of animals, or not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. How should he not be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Had not Pericles, then, the care of men ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>153. Socr. What then? Ought they not, as we just now <lb/>
            admitted, to have become more just, instead of more unjust, <lb/>
            under his management, if he who took charge of them was a <lb/>
            good politician ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And are not the just gentle, as Homerz says ? What <lb/>
            say you ? Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. However, he made them more savage than he re­ <lb/>
            ceived them, and this against himself, which he would least of <lb/>
            all have wished.</p>
          <p>Cal. Do you wish that I should agree with you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If I seem to you to speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so, then.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, then, he made them more savage, he must have <lb/>
            made them more unjust, and worse ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Socr. According to this reasoning, then, Pericles was not a <lb/>
            good politician ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Not, as you say.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Jupiter, nor as you say either, from what you <lb/>
            have admitted. But, again, tell me with respect to Cimon. <lb/>
            Did not they whom he took care of pass a sentence of ostra­ <lb/>
            cism upon him, in order that they might not hear his voice for <lb/>
            ten years ? And did they not do the very same to Themisto­ <lb/>
            cles, and beside punish him with exile ? And did they not <lb/>
            sentence Miltiades, the conqueror at Marathon, to be thrown <note type="footnote"> z Odyss. vii. 120. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            into the Barathrum, and but for the Prytanis, would he not <lb/>
            have been thrown into it ? These, however, if they had been <lb/>
            good men, as you say, would never have suffered these things. <lb/>
            154. Good drivers, surely, do not at first keep themselves <lb/>
            from falling from their cars, but, when they have trained their <lb/>
            horses, and have themselves become better drivers, then fall <lb/>
            off. This is never the case, either in driving, or in any. other <lb/>
            employment. Does it appear so to you ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To me it does not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Our former statements, then, as it appears, are true, <lb/>
            that we do not know any man who has been a good politician <lb/>
            in this city. You admit that you know of none at present, <lb/>
            but you say that formerly there were some, and you have <lb/>
            selected these men: but these have appeared to be much the <lb/>
            same as those of the present day, so that, if they were orators, <lb/>
            they did not make use of the true rhetoric, for in that case <lb/>
            they would not have fallen, nor yet did they employ flattery.</p>
          <p>Cal. However, Socrates, it is far from being the case, that <lb/>
            any one of the present day will ever do such deeds as were <lb/>
            done by any one of those.</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither, my excellent friend, do I blame these men, <lb/>
            as servants of the city, but they appear to me to have been <lb/>
            more efficient than those of the present day, and better able to <lb/>
            procure for the city what it desired. But in changing and <lb/>
            repressing their desires, by persuading and compelling them <lb/>
            to such a course as would make the citizens become better, <lb/>
            they scarcely differed at all from those of the present day; yet <lb/>
            that is the only duty of a good citizen. But, with respect to <lb/>
            providing ships, walls, and docks, and many other such things, <lb/>
            I agree with you, that they were more able than the men of <lb/>
            our day. 155. You and I, however, act ridiculously in our <lb/>
            discussion. For during the whole time that we have been <lb/>
            conversing we have not ceased to go round and round the <lb/>
            same subject, and to misunderstand each what the other says. <lb/>
            I think that you have often admitted and acknowledged that <lb/>
            there is a twofold method of treatment, both with respect to <lb/>
            the body and with respect to the soul: and that the one is <lb/>
            ministerial, by which we are enabled to procure food, if our <lb/>
            bodies are hungry, drink, if they are thirsty, and if they are <lb/>
            cold, garments, coverlids, shoes, and all other things which <lb/>
            the body stands in need of. And I purposely speak to you <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            through these images, in order that you may understand <lb/>
            me more easily. For when any one supplies these things, <lb/>
            being either a retail tradesman or a merchant, or a manufac­ <lb/>
            turer of any of them, a baker, a cook, a weaver, a shoemaker, <lb/>
            or tanner, it is not at all surprising that such a person should <lb/>
            appear, both to himself and others, to be concerned in the care <lb/>
            of the body, that is, to all who are ignorant that, besides all <lb/>
            these, there is a gymnastic and medicinal art, to which the <lb/>
            care of the body really belongs, and whose duty it is to rule <lb/>
            over all these arts, and to use their respective productions, <lb/>
            through knowing what meats or drinks are good and bad <lb/>
            for the health of the body, whereas all those others are igno­ <lb/>
            rant of this ; for which reason all those other arts are servile, <lb/>
            ministerial, and base, as regards the management of the body, <lb/>
            but the gymnastic art and medicine are justly the mistresses of <lb/>
            these. 156. That the case is the same with respect to the soul, <lb/>
            you, at one time, appeared to me to have understood, and ad­ <lb/>
            mitted it as if you knew what I meant; but shortly afterwards <lb/>
            you went on to say that there have been good and upright men <lb/>
            in this city, and when I asked you who they were, you appeared <lb/>
            to me to adduce men very similar with respect to politics, as <lb/>
            if, on my asking with respect to gymnastics, who have been or <lb/>
            are good managers of the body, you had very seriously said <lb/>
            to me, Thearion the baker, Mithæcus, who wrote on Sicilian <lb/>
            cookery,, and Sarambus the tavern-keeper, and that they take <lb/>
            wonderful care of the body, the first making admirable bread, <lb/>
            the second, made-dishes, and the third, wine. Perhaps, then, <lb/>
            you would be angry if I said to you, My friend, you know <lb/>
            nothing about gymnastics ; you tell me of men who are minis­ <lb/>
            ters and purveyors to desires, but who do not understand any <lb/>
            thing great and good respecting them, and who, it may so hap­ <lb/>
            pen, having filled men's bodies, and made them gross, and having <lb/>
            been praised by them, end by ruining their old flesh. These <lb/>
            men, on the other hand, through their ignorance, will not <lb/>
            blame those who have pampered their appetites, as being the <lb/>
            causes of their diseases, and of the loss of their old flesh, but <lb/>
            they who may happen to have been with them, and to have <lb/>
            given them some advice, when, after a long time, repletion, <lb/>
            having been indulged in without any regard to health, comes <lb/>
            bringing disease with it, these they will accuse and blame, and <lb/>
            do them some mischief if they can, but those others, who are <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            the causes of their maladies, they will extol. 157. And now <lb/>
            you, Callicles, act in very much the same way; you extol men <lb/>
            who have pampered the Athenians by satiating their desires, <lb/>
            and who they say have made the city great; and they do not <lb/>
            perceive that it is swollen, and unsound through means of <lb/>
            those ancient politicians : for, without considering temperance <lb/>
            and justice, they have filled the city with harbours and docks, <lb/>
            and walls and tributes, and such trifles. When, therefore, the <lb/>
            crisis of their weakness comes, they will blame the advisers <lb/>
            who are then present, but will extol Themistocles, Cimon, and <lb/>
            Pericles, who were the causes of the mischief: and you perhaps, <lb/>
            unless you are on your guard, and my friend Alcibiades, they <lb/>
            will seize, when they have lost what they had before in ad­ <lb/>
            dition to what they have acquired, although you are not the <lb/>
            causes of the mischief, but perhaps accomplices. 158. More­ <lb/>
            over, I both now see a very foolish thing happening, and I hear <lb/>
            of it with respect to men of former times. For I perceive that <lb/>
            when a city punishes any of its politicians as guilty of wrong, <lb/>
            they are angry, and complain bitterly that they are treated <lb/>
            shamefully; and having done the city many good services, <lb/>
            they are then unjustly ruined by it, as they allege. But the <lb/>
            whole is a falsehood. For no president of a city can ever be <lb/>
            unjustly ruined by the very city over which he presides. For <lb/>
            the case seems to be the same with such as profess themselves <lb/>
            to be politicians, as it is with the sophists. For the sophists, <lb/>
            though wise in other things, commit this absurdity; whereas <lb/>
            they affirm that they are teachers of virtue, they often accuse <lb/>
            their disciples of acting unjustly towards them, by defrauding <lb/>
            them of their wages, and not making other requitals for the <lb/>
            benefits they have received from them. But what can be more <lb/>
            unreasonable than such language as this, that men who have <lb/>
            become good and just, who have been freed from injustice by <lb/>
            their teacher, and have acquired justice, should yet act unjustly <lb/>
            from that very quality which they have not ? Does not this, <lb/>
            my friend, appear to you to be absurd ? Of a truth, Callicles, <lb/>
            you have compelled me to make a speech by your unwillingness <lb/>
            to answer me.</p>
          <p>159. Cal. But should you not be able to speak unless some <lb/>
            one answered you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. It seems as if I could: for now I have carried my dis­ <lb/>
            course to a great length, seeing that you will not answer me. <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            But my good friend, tell me, by Jupiter, the guardian of <lb/>
            friendship, does it not appear to you unreasonable, that a man <lb/>
            who says he has made another person good, should blame that <lb/>
            person, because having been made good through his means, <lb/>
            and being so, he has afterwards become bad ?</p>
          <p>Cal. To me it appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you not, then, hear those speak in this manner <unclear>w</unclear>*ho <lb/>
            profess to instruct men in virtue ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I do. But what can you say of men of no worth ? <lb/>
            Socr. What then can you say of those, who, while they pro­ <lb/>
            fess to preside over the city, and to take care that it shall be <lb/>
            as good as possible, then accuse it, when it so happens, as <lb/>
            being very bad? Do you think that these differ at all from <lb/>
            the former ? My good man, a sophist and an orator are the <lb/>
            same thing, or nearly so, and very like, as I said to Polusa. <lb/>
            But you, through ignorance, think that rhetoric is something <lb/>
            exceedingly beautiful, and despise the other. But, in truth, <lb/>
            the sophist's art is as much more beautiful than rhetoric, as <lb/>
            the legislative is than the judicial, and the gymnastic art than <lb/>
            medicine. 160. But I for my part think that public speakers <lb/>
            and sophists alone ought not to complain of the very thing <lb/>
            that they teach, as being mischievous to themselves, or that <lb/>
            in the very same charge they should at the same time accuse <lb/>
            themselves for not having at all benefited those whom they <lb/>
            profess to have benefited. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And surely to impart a benefit without a stipulated <lb/>
            reward, as is probable, is proper for these men only. if they <lb/>
            assert what is true. For one who has received any other <lb/>
            kind of benefit, as, for instance, who has acquired swiftness <lb/>
            of foot through the instructions of a teacher of gymnastics, <lb/>
            perhaps might deprive him of his gratuity, if the teacher of <lb/>
            gymnastics had left it to him, without having made an agree­ <lb/>
            ment for a fixed price, that he should be paid the money as <lb/>
            nearly as possible at the same time that he imparted his skill <lb/>
            to him. For men, I think, do not act unjustly through slow­ <lb/>
            ness, but through injustice. Do they not ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, any one should take away this, I mean <lb/>
            injustice, there would be no danger of his ever being treated <note type="footnote"> a See § 46. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            unjustly, but he alone might safely impart this benefit, if in <lb/>
            truth he is able to make men good. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. I admit it.</p>
          <p>161. Socr. For this reason then, as it appears, it is not at <lb/>
            all disgraceful to take money for giving advice about other <lb/>
            things, as, for instance, about architecture, or other arts.</p>
          <p>Cal. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Socr. But with respect to this study, by what means a man <lb/>
            may become as good as possible, and may best govern his own <lb/>
            family or a city, it is reckoned disgraceful to withhold advice, <lb/>
            except one should give him money. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. For it is evident that this is the reason that this alone <lb/>
            of all benefits makes the person who has received it desirous <lb/>
            of requiting it; so that it appears to be a good sign, if he who <lb/>
            has imparted this benefit shall be recompensed in return; but <lb/>
            otherwise not. Is this so ?</p>
          <p>Cal. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. To which method, then, of taking care of the city do you <lb/>
            advise me ? explain to me; whether to that of thwarting the <lb/>
            Athenians, in order that they may become as good as possible, <lb/>
            as if I were a physician, or to that by which I should serve <lb/>
            them, and curry favour with them. Tell me the truth, Cal­ <lb/>
            licles. For, as you begun to speak freely to me, it is right <lb/>
            you should continue to say what you think. And now speak <lb/>
            well and nobly.</p>
          <p>Cal. I say, then, that I advise you to serve them. <lb/>
            162. Socr. You advise me, therefore, most noble Sir, to <lb/>
            employ flattery.</p>
          <p>Cal. Unless you prefer calling him a Mysianb, Socrates; for <lb/>
            if you will do so-</p>
          <p>Socr. Do not repeat what you have often said, that any <lb/>
            one who pleases will kill me, lest I too should say again, that <lb/>
            a bad man would slay a good one; nor that he will take away <lb/>
            my property, if I have any, lest I too should say again, that <lb/>
            after he has taken it away he will not be able to make any <lb/>
            use of it, but as he has unjustly taken it from me, so having <lb/>
            got it, he will make an unjust use of it; and if unjustly, basely; <lb/>
            and if basely, wickedly.</p>
          <p>Cal. How confident you seem to me to be, Socrates, that you <note type="footnote"> b A name of the utmost contempt. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            will never suffer any of these things, as being one who lives <lb/>
            out of harm's way, and who can never be brought before a <lb/>
            court of justice by a man, perhaps, utterly depraved and vile !</p>
          <p>Socr. I should indeed be foolish, Callicles, if I did not <lb/>
            think that any one in this city might suffer any thing that <lb/>
            might happen. This however I well know, that if I should <lb/>
            go before a court of justice, and be exposed to any of the <lb/>
            dangers you mention, he who takes me thither will be a bad <lb/>
            man. For no good man would accuse one who has not com­ <lb/>
            mitted injustice. And it would not be at all wonderful, if I <lb/>
            should be condemned to death. Do you wish I should tell <lb/>
            you why I expect this ?</p>
          <p>Cal. By all means.</p>
          <p>163. Socr. I think that I, in conjunction with a few Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, (that I may not say alone,) apply myself to the true <lb/>
            political art, and alone of those of the present day perform the <lb/>
            duties of a citizen. Since, then, in the conversations which I <lb/>
            enter into from time to time, I do not speak for the purpose <lb/>
            of conciliating popular favour, but with a view to that which <lb/>
            is best, and not to that which is most agreeable, and as I am <lb/>
            not willing to do those fine things that you advise, I shall not <lb/>
            have any thing to say in a court of justice. And the same <lb/>
            illustration occurs to me that I mentioned to Polus. For I <lb/>
            should be judged as a physician would be judged by children, <lb/>
            with a cook for his accuser. For consider what defence such <lb/>
            a man would make when taken before them, if one should <lb/>
            accuse him as follows : ' 0 boys, this man has done you a great <lb/>
            deal of mischief, and destroys both you and even the youngest <lb/>
            of you, for, by cutting, cauterizing, weakening and choking <lb/>
            you, he reduces you to great straits, giving you the bitterest <lb/>
            draughts, and compelling you to hunger and thirst; not as I <lb/>
            do who feed you with many sweet and various dainties.' What <lb/>
            do you think a physician when brought to such an extremity <lb/>
            would have to say ? If he should say the truth, ‘ I did all these <lb/>
            things, boys, for your health,' what a clamour do you think <lb/>
            such judges would raise against him ? Would it not be loud ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Probably; one must think so, at least.</p>
          <p>164. Socr. Do you not think, then, that he would be alto­ <lb/>
            ,-ether at a loss what to say ?</p>
          <p>Cal. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And I know that I should be treated just in the same <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            way, if I came before a court of justice. For I should not be <lb/>
            able to mention any pleasures which I had procured for them, <lb/>
            which they consider as benefits and advantages; but I neither <lb/>
            envy those who procure them, nor those for whom they are <lb/>
            procured. And if any one should- say that I corrupt younger <lb/>
            men, by causing them to doubt, or that I revile the elder men, <lb/>
            by speaking bitter words, either privately or publicly, I should <lb/>
            not be able to say the truth, that " I say and do all these things <lb/>
            justly, and for your advantage, judges, and nothing else." So <lb/>
            that I should probably suffer whatever might happen.</p>
          <p>Cal. Does a man, then, appear to you, Socrates, to be well <lb/>
            off in a city who is thus circumstanced, and is unable to help <lb/>
            himself?</p>
          <p>165. Soer. If there is that in him, Callicles, which you have <lb/>
            often allowed, namely, if he can assist himself, by neither hav­ <lb/>
            ing said or done any thing unjust towards men or towards <lb/>
            gods. For this aid has often been acknowledged by us to be <lb/>
            the best that a man can have for himself. If, therefore, any <lb/>
            one could convict me of being unable to afford this assistance <lb/>
            either to myself or another, I should be ashamed, whether con­ <lb/>
            victed before many or few, or alone by myself, and if I should <lb/>
            be put to death for this inability I should be deeply grieved: <lb/>
            but if I should die through want of flattering rhetoric, I well <lb/>
            know that you would behold me meeting death cheerfully. <lb/>
            For death itself no one fears, who is not altogether irrational <lb/>
            and cowardly, but he does fear to commit injustice; for to go <lb/>
            to Hades with a soul full of crimes is the worst of all evils. <lb/>
            But, if you please, I will tell you a story to shew that such is <lb/>
            the case.</p>
          <p>Cal. Since you have brought the rest to a conclusion, bring <lb/>
            this to a conclusion also.</p>
          <p>166. Socr. Hear then, as they say, a very beautiful tale, <lb/>
            which you will consider a fable, as I think, but I a tale; for <lb/>
            what I am about to tell you, I tell you as being true. As <lb/>
            Homer says c, then, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, divided the <lb/>
            government among themselves, after they had received it from <lb/>
            their father. This law, then, respecting men was in existence <lb/>
            in the time of Saturn, and always was, and still is, established <lb/>
            among the gods, that a man who has passed through life justly <lb/>
            and piously when he dies should go to the isles of the blessed, <note type="footnote"> c Iliad, xv. 187. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            and dwell in all perfect happiness free from evil, but that he <lb/>
            who has lived unjustly and impiously should go to a prison of <lb/>
            punishment and justice, which they call Tartarus. During the <lb/>
            reign of Saturn, and even recently when Jupiter held the <lb/>
            government, there were living judges of the living, who passed <lb/>
            sentence on the very day on which any one was about to die. <lb/>
            In consequence of this sentences were awarded badly. Pluto, <lb/>
            therefore, and the guardians of the blessed isles, went to Ju­ <lb/>
            piter, and informed him that men came to them who did not <lb/>
            deserve either sentence. 167. Jupiter, therefore, said, I will <lb/>
            prevent this in future. For now sentences are badly awarded, <lb/>
            because those that are judged are judged clothed, for they are <lb/>
            judged while living. Many, therefore, he continued, whose <lb/>
            souls are depraved are invested with beautiful bodies, nobi­ <lb/>
            lity of birth, and riches, and when the judgment takes place, <lb/>
            many witnesses come in their behalf, to testify that they have <lb/>
            lived justly. Hence the judges are awed by these things, and <lb/>
            moreover, they too pass sentence when clothed, for their minds <lb/>
            are veiled with eyes and ears, and the whole body. All these <lb/>
            things, then, are obstacles to them, as well their own clothing <lb/>
            as that of those that are judged. First of all, then, they must <lb/>
            no longer be allowed to know beforehand the time of their <lb/>
            death: for'at present they do know it beforehand. Prome­ <lb/>
            theus, therefore, has orders to deprive them of this power: <lb/>
            next they must be judged divested of all these things; for <lb/>
            they must be judged after they are dead : the judge too must <lb/>
            be naked and dead, and examine with his soul the soul of each <lb/>
            immediately after death, destitute of all his kindred, and leav­ <lb/>
            ing all that ornament on the earth, in order that the judgment <lb/>
            may be just. 168. Now I had observed these things before <lb/>
            you, and accordingly have appointed my sons as judges, two <lb/>
            from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and one from Europe, <lb/>
            Æacus. These, then, when they are dead, shall judge in the <lb/>
            meadow, at the three roads, of which two lead one to the isles <lb/>
            of the blessed, the other to Tartarus. And Rhadamanthus <lb/>
            shall judge those from Asia, and JEacus those from Europe. <lb/>
            But to Minos I will give the prerogative of deciding in case <lb/>
            any doubt occurs to the two others, in order that the judg­ <lb/>
            ment respecting the path men are to take may be as just as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>These are the things, Callicles, which I have heard, and be­ <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            lieve to be true : and from these statements I infer the follow­ <lb/>
            ing results. Death, as it appears to me, is nothing else than the <lb/>
            separation of two things, the soul and the body, from each other. <lb/>
            But when they are separated from each other, each of them <lb/>
            possesses pretty much the same habit that the man had when <lb/>
            alive, the body its own nature, culture and affections, all <lb/>
            distinct. 169. So that if any one's body, while living, was <lb/>
            large by nature, or food, or both, his corpse when he is dead <lb/>
            is also large ; and if corpulent, his corpse is corpulent when he <lb/>
            is dead; and so with respect to other things. And if again he <lb/>
            took pains to make his hair grow long, his corpse also has long <lb/>
            hair. Again, if any one has been well whipped, and while <lb/>
            living had scars in his body, the vestiges of blows, either from <lb/>
            scourges or other wounds, his dead body also is seen to retain <lb/>
            the same marks. And if the limbs of any one were broken or <lb/>
            distorted while he lived, these same defects are distinct when <lb/>
            he is dead. In a word, of whatever character any one has made <lb/>
            his body to be while living, such will it distinctly be, entirely <lb/>
            or for the most part, for a certain time after he is dead. The <lb/>
            same thing too, Callicles, appears to me to happen with re­ <lb/>
            spect to the soul; all things are distinctly manifest in the soul <lb/>
            after it is divested of body, as well its natural disposition, as <lb/>
            the affections which the man has acquired in his soul, from his <lb/>
            various pursuits. 170. When, therefore, they come to the <lb/>
            judge, those from Asia to Rhadamanthus, Rhadamanthus, <lb/>
            having made them stand before him, examines the soul of <lb/>
            each, not knowing whose it is, but often meeting with the <lb/>
            soul of the great king, or of some other king or potentate, he <lb/>
            sees nothing sound in the soul, but finds it thoroughly marked <lb/>
            with scourges and full of scars, through perjuries and injustice, <lb/>
            which the actions of each has imprinted on his soul, and he <lb/>
            finds all things distorted through falsehood and arrogance, and <lb/>
            nothing upright, in consequence of its having been nurtured <lb/>
            without truth ; he also sees the soul full of disproportion and <lb/>
            baseness through power, luxury, wantonness and intemperate <lb/>
            conduct. On seeing it he forthwith sends it ignominiously to <lb/>
            prison, where on its arrival it will undergo the punishment it <lb/>
            deserves. But it is proper that every one who is punished, if <lb/>
            he is rightly punished by another, should either become better, <lb/>
            and be benefited by it, or should be an example to others, that <lb/>
            they, beholding his sufferings, may be made better through <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            fear. 171. But those that are benefited, at the same time that <lb/>
            they suffer punishment both from gods and men, are such as <lb/>
            have been guilty of curable offences; their benefit however, <lb/>
            both here and in Hades, accrues to them through means of pain <lb/>
            and torments ; for it is not possible to be freed from injustice <lb/>
            in any other way. But those who have committed the most <lb/>
            extreme injustice, and have become incurable through such <lb/>
            crimes, serve as examples to others, and these are not bene­ <lb/>
            fited at all, as being incurable, but others are benefited by be­ <lb/>
            holding them suffering for ever the greatest, most bitter, and <lb/>
            most dreadful punishments for their sins, being suspended in <lb/>
            the prison of Hades altogether as examples, a spectacle and <lb/>
            warning to the unjust men who are constantly arriving. Of <lb/>
            these, I say, Archelaus will be one, if Polus says true, and <lb/>
            every other tyrant that resembles him. I think too, that the <lb/>
            most of these examples will consist of tyrants, kings, and <lb/>
            potentates, and such as have governed the affairs of cities; for <lb/>
            these through their power commit the greatest and most im­ <lb/>
            pious crimes. 172. Homerd also bears witness to this; for he <lb/>
            makes those to be kings and potentates, who are punished for <lb/>
            ever in Hades, Tantalus, Sisyphus and Tityus; but Thersites, or <lb/>
            any other private man who was depraved, no one has repre. <lb/>
            sented as suffering great punishments as if incurable; for I think <lb/>
            it was not in his power to commit them; on which account he <lb/>
            was more happy than those who had the power. But, Calli­ <lb/>
            cles, the most wicked men are amongst the powerful; nothing <lb/>
            however hinders but that good men may be found amongst <lb/>
            them ; and when they are found they deserve the highest admi­ <lb/>
            ration : for it is a difficult thing, Callicles, and deserves high <lb/>
            praise, when one who has great power of acting unjustly, passes <lb/>
            through life justly. There are however a few men of this kind; <lb/>
            for they have existed both here and elsewhere, and I think <lb/>
            there will be hereafter good and upright men, endued with the <lb/>
            virtue of administering justly whatever is committed to their <lb/>
            charge. There has been one who is very celebrated among all <lb/>
            the Greeks, Aristides, son of Lysimachus. But, my excellent <lb/>
            friend, the generality of potentates prove wicked. 173. As I <lb/>
            said, then, when Rhadamanthus has got any such person in his <lb/>
            power, he knows nothing else about him, neither who he is, <lb/>
            nor who are his parents, but only that he is wicked; and on <note type="footnote"> d Odyss. xi. 575, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            discerning this, he sends him away to Tartarus, signifying at <lb/>
            the same time whether he appears to be curable or incurable; <lb/>
            but he arriving thither suffers according to his deserts. Some­ <lb/>
            times, Rhadamanthus beholding another soul that has passed <lb/>
            through life piously and with truth, whether it be of some <lb/>
            private man, or any other, but I say, Callicles, especially of a <lb/>
            philosopher, who has attended to his own affairs, and has not <lb/>
            made himself very busy during life, he is delighted, and sends <lb/>
            it to the isles of the blessed. Æacus too, does the very same <lb/>
            things. And each of them passes sentence, holding a rod in <lb/>
            his hand. But Minos sits apart looking on, and is the only <lb/>
            one that has a golden sceptre, as the Ulysses of Homer e says <lb/>
            he saw him; “ bearing a golden sceptre, and administering <lb/>
            justice to the dead." I therefore, Callicles, am persuaded by <lb/>
            these accounts, and consider how I may exhibit my soul before <lb/>
            the judge in the most healthy condition. Wherefore, disre­ <lb/>
            garding the honours that most men value, and looking to the <lb/>
            truth, I shall endeavour in reality to live as virtuously as I <lb/>
            can, and when I die, to die so. 174. And I invite all other <lb/>
            men, to the utmost of my power, and you too I in turn <lb/>
            invite to this life and this contest, which I affirm surpasses <lb/>
            all contests here, and I upbraid you because you will not be <lb/>
            able to assist yourself, when you will have to undergo the <lb/>
            sentence and judgment which I have just now mentioned ; <lb/>
            but when you shall come before the judge, the son of Ægina, <lb/>
            and when he shall seize you and bring you before his tribunal, <lb/>
            you will there gape and become dizzy, no less than I should <lb/>
            here, and perhaps some one will strike you ignominiously on <lb/>
            the face, and. treat you with every species of contumely.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, these things appear to you to be like an <lb/>
            old woman's fable, and you accordingly despise them. And it <lb/>
            would not be at all wonderful that we should despise them, if <lb/>
            on investigation we could find any thing better and more true <lb/>
            than them. But now you see that you three, who are the <lb/>
            wisest of the Greeks of this day, you, Polus, and Gorgias, are <lb/>
            unable to prove that we ought to live any other life than such <lb/>
            as appears to be advantageous hereafter, but among so many <lb/>
            arguments, while others have been refuted, this alone remains <lb/>
            unshaken, that we ought to beware of committing injustice <lb/>
            rather than of being injured, and that above all a man ought to <note type="footnote"> e Odyss. xi. 568. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            study not to appear good, but to be so, both -privately and <lb/>
            publicly : and that if any one is in any respect wicked, he <lb/>
            should be punished, and that this is the next good to the being <lb/>
            just, to become so f, and to submit to the punishment one <lb/>
            deserves; and that all flattery, whether of one's-self or others, <lb/>
            whether of few or many, must be avoided; and that rhetoric, <lb/>
            and every other action, is always to be employed with a view <lb/>
            to what is just.</p>
          <p>175. Be persuaded by me then, and follow me to that place, <lb/>
            by going to which you will be happy, both living and after you <lb/>
            are dead, as your own argument proves. And suffer any one <lb/>
            to despise you as senseless, and to treat you with contumely, <lb/>
            if he pleases, and by Jupiter, do you cheerfully let him strike <lb/>
            that ignominious blow ; for you will suffer nothing dreadful, if <lb/>
            you are in reality upright and good, and devoted to the practice <lb/>
            of virtue. And when we have thus exercised ourselves in <lb/>
            common, we will then, if it should appear desirable, apply our­ <lb/>
            selves to politics, or we will deliberate on whatever we shall <lb/>
            think desirable, being better qualified to deliberate than we now <lb/>
            are. For it is disgraceful, being in the condition in which we <lb/>
            appear to be at present, to pride ourselves, like youths, as if <lb/>
            we were something, who yet never retain the same opinion on <lb/>
            the same subjects, and these of the greatest moment; to such a <lb/>
            pitch of ignorance have we reached ! Let us use as our guide, <lb/>
            then, the reasoning that has now been made clear to us, which <lb/>
            teaches us, that this is the best mode of life, to live and <lb/>
            to die in the exercise of justice and the other virtues. This, <lb/>
            then, let us follow, and invite others to do the same, not that, <lb/>
            to which you confidently invited me : for it is of no value, <lb/>
            Callicles. <note type="footnote"> f <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸ γίγνεσθαι</foreign> ical <foreign xml:lang="grc">κολαζόμενον διδόναι δίκην</foreign>, Stallbaum translates " to <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE PROTAGORAS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IN this dialogue Socrates relates to a friend, whose name <lb/>
            is not given, a discussion which he had just had with Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras the sophist, of Abdera.</p>
          <p>Hippocrates, a young Athenian, had roused Socrates very <lb/>
            early in the morning and entreated him to accompany him <lb/>
            on a visit to Protagoras, who was then at Athens staying at <lb/>
            the house of Callias, and whose pupil he was anxious to be­ <lb/>
            come. On arriving there, they find the sophist attended by <lb/>
            a crowd of admirers, and moreover Hippias of Elis and Pro­ <lb/>
            dicus of Ceos, surrounded by their respective followers a.</p>
          <p>After Socrates had made known the object of his visit to <lb/>
            Protagoras, Callias proposes that the whole party should sit <lb/>
            down and listen to the conversation. When all are seated, <lb/>
            Socrates repeats to Protagoras, that Hippocrates is desirous <lb/>
            of becoming his pupil, and wishes to know what advantage <lb/>
            he may expect to derive from associating with him. Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras tells him that from the very first day of their inter­ <lb/>
            course he will become a better man than he was before, and <lb/>
            will daily make further progress. But, asks Socrates, in what <lb/>
            will he become better, and in what make further progress? <lb/>
            In the management of his domestic and public affairs, that is <lb/>
            to say, in the political art. To this Socrates objects that the <lb/>
            general opinion is that political virtue cannot be taught, and <lb/>
            that, whereas with respect to arts and sciences it was usual <lb/>
            only to consult persons who had made them their study and <lb/>
            were skilled in them, in affairs of state every one, of what­ <lb/>
            ever condition, was at liberty to give his opinion; he there­ <lb/>
            fore begs Protagoras to prove that virtue can be taught b. To <lb/>
            this end Protagoras relates a fable in which he explains how <lb/>
            the capacity of becoming virtuous was imparted by Jupiter to <note type="footnote"> a § 1—18. </note><note type="footnote">b § 19—29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            mankind; and then argues that as men are punished for in­ <lb/>
            justice, impiety, and the like, it follows that they must think <lb/>
            that these virtues ought to be possessed and may be acquired <lb/>
            by all men, for that they would not punish them for a mere <lb/>
            defect of mind any more than of body, if it were natural and <lb/>
            not attributable to the fault of the individualc.</p>
          <p>Socrates having complimented him on his eloquence, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to his usual method, begs that he will answer his <lb/>
            questions briefly; and then expresses his surprise at having <lb/>
            heard Protagoras speak of justice, temperance, holiness, and <lb/>
            the like, as if they were collectively virtue. He therefore <lb/>
            wishes to know whether virtue is one thing, and justice, tem­ <lb/>
            perance and holiness, parts of it, or whether they are all names <lb/>
            of one and the same thing. Protagoras answers that virtue <lb/>
            is one thing, and these several qualities parts of it. Are they <lb/>
            then parts like the parts of a face, the mouth, nose, eyes, and <lb/>
            ears, or like the parts of gold, which do not differ from each <lb/>
            other? Like the former. In that case holiness and justice <lb/>
            must be different from each other, which, as Protagoras is at <lb/>
            length compelled, though unwillingly, to admit, is absurd d.</p>
          <p>Again, each several thing has only one contrary; for in­ <lb/>
            stance, strength is contrary to weakness, swiftness to slowness, <lb/>
            ugliness to beauty, evil to good; in the same way each virtue <lb/>
            must have its contrary. This being granted, Protagoras is <lb/>
            led to admit that folly is contrary to temperance, and also to <lb/>
            wisdom ; but in that case wisdom and temperance cannot be dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from each other, as was before stated, but must be one and <lb/>
            the same thing. A similar course of enquiry is instituted by <lb/>
            Socrates, in order to shew that justice and prudence likewise <lb/>
            are one and the same, but the impatience of Protagoras at <lb/>
            finding himself driven to repeated admissions which contradict <lb/>
            the theory with which he set out, interrupts the discussion; at <lb/>
            length, however, the breach is repaired by the interference of <lb/>
            the company, and it is agreed that each shall question the <note type="footnote"> c § 30—39. </note><note type="footnote">d 40—56. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            other in turn. Protagoras begins by getting Socrates to allow <lb/>
            that an ode of Simonides is beautiful, but that it cannot be <lb/>
            beautiful if the poet contradicts himself. He then shews that <lb/>
            in one part of the ode it is said that to become a good man is <lb/>
            difficult," and in another part, " that he is not pleased with the <lb/>
            saying of Pittacus, where he says that it is difficult to continue <lb/>
            to be good." Socrates, however, justifies the opinion he had <lb/>
            expressed by a minute and subtle examination of the object <lb/>
            the poet had in view in composing the ode e.</p>
          <p>Having concluded his criticism of the ode, Socrates is anx­ <lb/>
            ious to bring back the discussion to the original subject, and <lb/>
            having with difficulty prevailed on Protagoras to consent to <lb/>
            this, repeats the question with which they set out, which was <lb/>
            to this effect: whether wisdom, temperance, courage, justice, <lb/>
            and holiness are five parts of virtue, differing from each other <lb/>
            as the parts of the face do ? Protagoras answers that they all <lb/>
            are parts of virtue, four of them very like each other, but the <lb/>
            fifth, courage, very different from all the rest. But this dis­ <lb/>
            tinction Socrates overthrows as follows: you admit that the <lb/>
            courageous are daring; but they who, like divers, are bold in <lb/>
            a matter in which they are skilled are commended as coura­ <lb/>
            geous, whereas they who are unskilled and yet bold are not <lb/>
            courageous but mad; so that according to this reasoning wis­ <lb/>
            dom and courage are the same. Protagoras, however, tries to <lb/>
            avoid this conclusion by saying that Socrates has mis-stated his <lb/>
            former admission, for that he allowed only that the courageous <lb/>
            are bold, not that the bold are courageous. But Socrates, <lb/>
            with a view more certainly to convict his opponent of error, <lb/>
            changes his ground, and asks whether all pleasant things are <lb/>
            good, and all painful things evil ? Protagoras is in doubt what <lb/>
            answer to give; Socrates, therefore, shews that pleasure is in <lb/>
            itself a good, but that men mistake as to what things are plea­ <lb/>
            sant ; for knowledge alone ought to govern man, and if a man <lb/>
            knows good and evil he will never be overcome by any thing <note type="footnote"> c § 57—90. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            so as to do any thing else but what knowledge bids him. Yet <lb/>
            there are some who say that they are overcome by pleasure or <lb/>
            pain; but what is it to be overcome by pleasure ? nothing else <lb/>
            than to choose present pleasure which will result in greater <lb/>
            evil; in other words, to embrace a greater evil rather than a <lb/>
            greater good; they, therefore, who are overcome by pleasure <lb/>
            are so from ignorance f.</p>
          <p>Having established this, Socrates recurs to the statement of <lb/>
            Protagoras, that courage differs from the other parts of virtue, <lb/>
            because the most unholy, most unjust, most intemperate, and <lb/>
            most ignorant men, are sometimes most courageous. It is <lb/>
            admitted that no one willingly exposes himself to things that <lb/>
            he believes to be evil; a brave man, therefore, incurs dangers <lb/>
            which he knows to be honourable and good, and therefore <lb/>
            pleasant, and is influenced by no base fear, nor inspired with <lb/>
            base confidence; but the coward, on the contrary, is influenced <lb/>
            by base fear and inspired by base confidence; he errs, there­ <lb/>
            fore, through ignorance and want of knowledge, whence it fol­ <lb/>
            lows that courage is contained in knowledge. The result of <lb/>
            the whole is that virtue, since it consists in knowledge, can be <lb/>
            taught, and so it turns out that Socrates, who began by main­ <lb/>
            taining that it could not be taught, has been arguing all along <lb/>
            that it can, and Protagoras, who asserted that it could be <lb/>
            taught, has been arguing that it cannot. <note type="footnote"> f § 91—118. </note></p>

          <p>Fr. WHENCE come you, Socrates? can there be any doubt <lb/>
            but that it is from a chase after the beauty of Alcibiades ? and <lb/>
            to me, indeed, when I saw him lately, the man appeared still <lb/>
            beautiful, though between ourselves, Socrates, he is a man and <lb/>
            is now getting a pretty thick beard.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what of that ? Do you not approve of Homer a, <lb/>
            then, who says, that the most graceful age is that of a youth <lb/>
            with his first beard, which is now the age of Alcibiades ?</p>
          <p>Fr. What have we to do with that now? Do you come <lb/>
            from him ? And how is the youth disposed towards you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Very well, I think, and not least so to-day; for he has <lb/>
            said many things in my favour, assisting me, and indeed I have <lb/>
            just now come from him. However, I have something strange <lb/>
            to tell you : for though he was present I paid no attention to <lb/>
            him, and even frequently forgot him.</p>
          <p>2. Fr. But what great affair can have happened between <lb/>
            you and him ? for surely you have not met with any one else <lb/>
            more beautiful, in this city at least ?</p>
          <p>Socr By far.</p>
          <p>Fr. What say you ? A citizen, or a stranger ?</p>
          <p>Socr. A stranger.</p>
          <p>Fr. From whence ?</p>
          <p>Socr. From Abdera.</p>
          <p>Fr. And did this stranger appear to you so beautiful that <lb/>
            you thought him more beautiful than the son of Clinias ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But how, my dear friend, can the wisest be thought <lb/>
            otherwise than more beautiful ? <note type="footnote"> a Odyss. x. 279. </note></p><pb n="238"/>
            
          <p>Fr. Have you come then, Socrates. from meeting one of our <lb/>
            wise men?</p>
          <p>Socr. Yes, and from the wisest of the present day, if you <lb/>
            think Protagoras is the wisest.</p>
          <p>Fr. Ha ! What say you ? Is Protagoras here ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And has been, these three days.</p>
          <p>Fr. And are you just now come from his company ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I have, and from a very long conversation with him.</p>
          <p>3. Fr. Why then should you not relate this conversation <lb/>
            to us, unless something hinders you, having made this boy <lb/>
            rise up, and seating yourself in his place ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Certainly; and I shall be obliged to you if you will <lb/>
            listen to me.</p>
          <p>Fr. And we to you, if you will tell us.</p>
          <p>Socr. The obligation will be mutual. Listen then. This <lb/>
            morning, while it was yet dark, Hippocrates, son of Apollodo­ <lb/>
            rus and brother of Phason, knocked very hard at my gate with <lb/>
            his stick, and as soon as it was opened to him he came in, in <lb/>
            great haste, and calling out with a loud voice, said, " Socrates, <lb/>
            are you awake or asleep?” And I, knowing his voice, said, <lb/>
            “ Hippocrates is here : do you bring any news?"</p>
          <p>“ None," he replied, " but what is good."</p>
          <p>" You say well," said I, " but what is it ? and why have you <lb/>
            come so early?”</p>
          <p>" Protagoras is come," said he, standing by my side.</p>
          <p>4. " He came the day before yesterday," said I, " and have <lb/>
            you only just heard of it?"</p>
          <p>" By the gods," he replied, " only yesterday evening," and <lb/>
            at the same time feeling about my bed, he sat down at my feet, <lb/>
            and said, " Yesterday evening, very late, on my return from <lb/>
            the village of Œnoe, for my slave Satyrus ran away, and I was <lb/>
            purposing to tell you that I was going in pursuit of him, but <lb/>
            something else put it out of my head; but when I had re­ <lb/>
            turned, and we had supped, and were going to bed, then my <lb/>
            brother told me that Protagoras was arrived, and my first <lb/>
            thought was to come immediately to you, but afterwards it <lb/>
            appeared to me too late at night. As soon, however, as sleep <lb/>
            had refreshed me after my fatigue, I immediately arose and <lb/>
            came here."</p>
          <p>5. And I, knowing his earnestness and excitability, said, <lb/>
            " What is this to you ? Does Protagoras do you any harm ?” <pb n="239"/>
            </p>
          <p>And he, laughing, said, " By the gods, Socrates, he does, <lb/>
            because he alone is wise, and does not make me so."</p>
          <p>" But, by Jupiter," said I, " if you give him money and per­ <lb/>
            suade him, he will make you wise too."</p>
          <p>" Would that, 0 Jupiter and ye gods," he said, " it de­ <lb/>
            pended on that, for I would spare nothing of my own or of my <lb/>
            friend's property either, and I have now come to you for this <lb/>
            very purpose, that you may speak to him in my behalf. For <lb/>
            besides that I am too young, I have never yet seen Protagoras <lb/>
            or heard him speak, for I was but a boy when he came here <lb/>
            before. However, Socrates, all men praise him, and say that he is <lb/>
            the wisest man to speak. But why do we not go to him that we <lb/>
            may find him within ? He is staying, as I have heard, with <lb/>
            Callias son of Hipponicus. Let us go then."</p>
          <p>6. I said to him : " We will not go there yet my friend, it is <lb/>
            too early; but let us rise up and go into our court, and spend <lb/>
            the time there walking about, until it is light; then we will go. <lb/>
            For Protagoras stays mostly within; therefore cheer up, we <lb/>
            shall probably find him at home."</p>
          <p>After this we rose and walked about the court, and I in order <lb/>
            to try the strength of Hippocrates, examined and questioned <lb/>
            him; " Tell me," said I, " Hippocrates, you are now purposing <lb/>
            to go to Protagoras, and to pay him money as a fee for teach­ <lb/>
            ing you something ; to what kind of person do you think you <lb/>
            are going, and what do you expect to become ? Just as if you <lb/>
            thought of going to your own namesake, Hippocrates of Cos, <lb/>
            one of the Asclepiads, and were to pay him money as a fee for <lb/>
            teaching you, if any one asked you,' Tell me, Hippocrates, you <lb/>
            are about to pay a fee to Hippocrates, in what capacity ?' what <lb/>
            should you answer ?”</p>
          <p>" I should say," he replied, " in that of a physician."</p>
          <p>" And what do you expect to become ? ” " A physician," <lb/>
            said he.</p>
          <p>" But if you thought of going to Polycletus the Argive, or <lb/>
            Phidias the Athenian, and were to pay them a fee for teaching <lb/>
            you, if any one asked you, ' In what capacity do you intend to <lb/>
            pay this money to Polycletus and Phidias ?' what should you <lb/>
            answer ?"</p>
          <p>" I should say, in that of statuaries."</p>
          <p>" And what do you expect to become yourself?"</p>
          <p>" Clearly, a statuary."</p><pb n="240"/>
            
          <p>" Be it so," said I. " But we are now going, you and I, to <lb/>
            Protagoras, and we are prepared to pay him money as a fee for <lb/>
            teaching you, if our money is sufficient for the purpose, and <lb/>
            we can persuade him by it; but if not, we mean to borrow <lb/>
            from our friends. If, then, some one seeing us thus earnestly <lb/>
            bent on this, should ask; ' Tell me, Socrates and Hippocrates, <lb/>
            in what capacity do you intend to pay money to Protagoras ?’ <lb/>
            what answer should we give him ? What other name do we <lb/>
            hear given to Protagoras, as that of statuary is given to Phi­ <lb/>
            dias, and that of poet to Homer ? What name of this kind do <lb/>
            we hear given to Protagoras ?"</p>
          <p>" They call him a sophist, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" As to a sophist, then, we are going to pay him money ?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly."</p>
          <p>8. " If, then, any one should ask you this further question, <lb/>
            ' What do you expect to become yourself by going to Prota­ <lb/>
            goras ?'"</p>
          <p>Upon which he said, blushing, (for the day was now begin­ <lb/>
            ning to dawn, so that I could see him,) " If this case is at all <lb/>
            like the former, it is evident that I expect to become a sophist."</p>
          <p>" But, by the gods," said I, " should you not be ashamed to <lb/>
            shew yourself as a sophist before the Greeks r"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, I should, Socrates, if I must say what I think."</p>
          <p>" Do you suppose, then, Hippocrates, that the instruction of <lb/>
            Protagoras will not be of this kind, but such as you received <lb/>
            from a grammarian, a musician, or a teacher of gymnastics ? <lb/>
            for you were not instructed in each of these for the sake of the <lb/>
            art, meaning to become a professor yourself, but by way of <lb/>
            accomplishment, as is proper for a private person and a free­ <lb/>
            man."</p>
          <p>" Just so," he said, " such rather appears to me to be the <lb/>
            instruction given by Protagoras ?”</p>
          <p>" Do you know, then," said I, " what you are about to do, <lb/>
            or does it escape you ?"</p>
          <p>" About what ?"</p>
          <p>"That you are about to entrust your soul to the care of a <lb/>
            man, who, as you admit, is a sophist; and yet I should wonder <lb/>
            if you know what a sophist is. Though, if you are ignorant <lb/>
            of this, neither do you know to what you are confiding your <lb/>
            soul, whether to a good or a bad thing."</p>
          <p>“ But I think I know," he said.</p><pb n="241"/>
            
          <p>" Tell me, then, what you think a sophist is."</p>
          <p>"I think," said he, "as the name imports, that he is one <lb/>
            learned in wisdom."</p>
          <p>" This, however," I replied, " may be said of painters and <lb/>
            architects, that they too are learned in wisdom. And if any <lb/>
            one should ask us in what wisdom painters are learned, we <lb/>
            should surely say to him, in that which relates to the produc­ <lb/>
            tion of pictures, and so on with respect to the rest. But if <lb/>
            any one should ask this question, ‘In what wisdom is a sophist <lb/>
            learned ?' what answer should we give him ? of what produc­ <lb/>
            tion is he a master ?"</p>
          <p>" What else should we say he is, Socrates, but a master of <lb/>
            the art that makes men able speakers ?"</p>
          <p>10. " Perhaps," said I, " we should say truly, yet not sum­ <lb/>
            ciently. For this answer requires from us another question, <lb/>
            about what a sophist makes men able speakers; just as <lb/>
            the musician, surely, makes a man speak ably on the subject <lb/>
            in which he is learned, on music. Is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Well; on what subject, then, does a sophist make a man <lb/>
            an able speaker? clearly on that in which he is learned?"</p>
          <p>" Apparently."</p>
          <p>" What then is that in which the sophist is both learned <lb/>
            himself and makes his pupil learned ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," he replied, " I am unable to tell you."</p>
          <p>11. After this I said, " What then? are you aware , to what <lb/>
            danger you are going to expose your soul? if you had occa­ <lb/>
            sion to entrust your body to some one, on the risk of its be­ <lb/>
            coming healthy or diseased, should you not consider very care­ <lb/>
            fully whether you ought to entrust it or not, and would you <lb/>
            not summon your friends and relations to a consultation, and <lb/>
            deliberate many days ? But that which you esteem far more <lb/>
            than the body, your soul, and on which your all depends, <lb/>
            either to fare well or ill, according as it becomes healthy or <lb/>
            diseased, concerning this do you neither communicate with <lb/>
            your father nor your brother, nor with any of us your <lb/>
            friends, whether or not you should commit your soul to this <lb/>
            stranger who has arrived here, but having heard of his arri­ <lb/>
            val yesterday evening, as you say, do you come before day- <lb/>
            break, and take no thought or advice on the matter, whether <lb/>
            it is proper or not to entrust yourself to him, but are ready to <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>

            spend both your own and your friends' property, as having <lb/>
            already resolved that you must in any event associate with <lb/>
            Protagoras, whom you neither know, as you admit, nor have <lb/>
            ever spoken to; but you call him a sophist, though what a <lb/>
            sophist is, to whom you are about to entrust yourself, you are <lb/>
            evidently Ignorant ?"</p>
          <p>12. And he having heard me, replied, " It seems so, Socrates, <lb/>
            from what you say."</p>
          <p>" Is not a sophist, then, Hippocrates, a kind of merchant or <lb/>
            retailer of commodities by which the soul is nourished? To <lb/>
            me, at least, he appears to be so."</p>
          <p>" But by what is the soul nourished, Socrates r"</p>
          <p>"By learning," I replied. "But we must take care, my <lb/>
            friend, that the sophist does not deceive us by praising what <lb/>
            he sells, as those others do with respect to nutriment for the <lb/>
            body, the merchant and the retailer. For neither do they <lb/>
            themselves know which of the commodities in which they <lb/>
            traffic are good or bad for the body, though they praise all <lb/>
            that they sell, nor do those who buy from them, unless one <lb/>
            happens to be a professor of gymnastics or a physician. In <lb/>
            like manner, those who hawk about learning through cities, <lb/>
            and who sell and retail it to every one that desires it, praise <lb/>
            all that they sell, though perhaps some of these too, my ex­ <lb/>
            cellent friend, may be ignorant which of the things they sell <lb/>
            is good or bad for the soul; and this also may be the case <lb/>
            with those that buy from them, unless some one happen to be <lb/>
            skilled in the medicine of the soul. 13. If then you happen <lb/>
            to know which of these is good or bad, you may safely buy <lb/>
            learning from Protagoras or any one else ; but if not, beware <lb/>
            my good friend, that you do not hazard and imperil that which <lb/>
            is most precious. For there is much greater danger in the <lb/>
            purchase of learning than in that of food. For when one has <lb/>
            purchased meat and drink from a retailer or merchant one may <lb/>
            take them away in different vessels, and, before receiving them <lb/>
            into one's body by eating or drinking, one may set them down <lb/>
            at home, and calling in some person who understands the mat­ <lb/>
            ter, consult him as to what may be eaten and drunk, and what <lb/>
            not, and how much and when; so that in this purchase there <lb/>
            is no great danger. But it is not possible to carry away <lb/>
            learning in a different vessel; but it is necessary, when one <lb/>
            has paid the price, having received instruction in the soul itself <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            and learnt it, to depart either injured or benefited. 14. Let <lb/>
            us therefore consider these things with persons older than we <lb/>
            are: for we are too young to decide on a matter of such im­ <lb/>
            portance. Now however, since we have made up our minds, <lb/>
            let us go and hear the man, and after we have heard him, let <lb/>
            us communicate with others. For not only is Protagoras there, <lb/>
            but Hippias of Elis, and I think also Prodicus of Ceos, and <lb/>
            many other wise men."</p>
          <p>This resolution taken, we set out. When we arrived at the <lb/>
            front door, we stopped and discussed a question that had fallen <lb/>
            out between us on the way; in order therefore that it might <lb/>
            not be left unfinished, but that we might bring it to a conclu­ <lb/>
            sion and then enter the house, we stood at the front door talk­ <lb/>
            ing together until we had agreed with each other. 15. Now <lb/>
            it appears to me that the porter, who was a eunuch, overheard <lb/>
            us, and he seems from the number of sophists to be out of <lb/>
            humour with all who come to the house. For when'we had <lb/>
            knocked at the door, he having opened it and seeing us, said, <lb/>
            " Ha, more sophists: he is not at leisure." And at the same <lb/>
            time with both his hands, he slammed to the door with all his <lb/>
            might. Thereupon we knocked again, and he answering with <lb/>
            the door shut, said, " Sirs, did not you hear me say that he is <lb/>
            not at leisure ?" " But, my good friend," said I, " we are not <lb/>
            come to Callias, nor are we sophists; cheer up then: for we <lb/>
            are come wanting to see Protagoras: so announce us." At <lb/>
            length, with difficulty the fellow opened, the door to us. <lb/>
            16. When we entered, we found Protagoras walking up and <lb/>
            down in the portico, and in a line with him, there walked <lb/>
            on one side Callias son of Hipponicus, and his brother by <lb/>
            the mother's side, Paralus son of Pericles, and Charmi­ <lb/>
            des son of Glaucon, and on the other side Xanthippus, the <lb/>
            other son of Pericles, and Philippides son of Philomelus, and <lb/>
            Antimœrus of Mende, who is the most famous of all the <lb/>
            pupils of Protagoras, and who is learning professionally, mean­ <lb/>
            ing to become a sophist himself. Behind these there followed <lb/>
            others who listened to what was said, the greater part appeared <lb/>
            to be strangers, whom Protagoras brings with him from the <lb/>
            several cities through which he passes, bewitching them by his <lb/>
            voice like Orpheus, and they follow his voice, bewitched. Some <lb/>
            of our countrymen also were in the band. 17. I was particularly <lb/>
            pleased in observing this band, how well they took care never <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            to be in the way of Protagoras by getting before him, but when­ <lb/>
            ever he and those with him turned round, these listeners, in a <lb/>
            good and regular manner, opened to the right and left, and <lb/>
            wheeling round, always ranged themselves behind him in <lb/>
            admirable order.</p>
          <p>" After him I perceived," as Homerb says, Hippias of Elis <lb/>
            sitting on a high seat in the opposite side of the portico, and <lb/>
            round him on benches sat Eryximachus, son of Acumenus, <lb/>
            Phsedrus of Myrrhine, Andron son of Androtion, and some <lb/>
            strangers partly his fellow citizens and others. They appeared <lb/>
            to be asking Hippias questions on physics and astronomy; <lb/>
            but he, sitting on a high seat, gave answers to each of <lb/>
            them and resolved their questions. IS. “Moreover I saw <lb/>
            Tantalus c;" for Prodicus of Ceos had lately arrived, but he was <lb/>
            in a building which Hipponicus had before used as a store­ <lb/>
            room, but now, owing to the multitude of guests, Callias had <lb/>
            emptied it and turned it into a lodging for strangers. Now <lb/>
            Prodicus was still in bed wrapt up in a great number of skins <lb/>
            and bed-clothes, as it appeared; and there were seated near <lb/>
            him on sofas Pausanias of Ceramis, and with Pausanias a youth, <lb/>
            quite a lad, as I thought of an excellent disposition, and of a <lb/>
            very beautiful form. I thought I heard them call him Agathon, <lb/>
            and I should not wonder if he was Pausanias's favourite. This <lb/>
            lad then was there, and the two Adimantuses, the one the son <lb/>
            of Cepis, and the other of Leucolophides, and some others. <lb/>
            But I was not able to learn from the outside what they were <lb/>
            talking about, although I was exceedingly anxious to hear Pro­ <lb/>
            dicus ; for he appears to me to be a very wise, nay a divine <lb/>
            man, but owing to the harshness of his voice a kind of humming <lb/>
            in the room made what he said indistinct.</p>
          <p>19. We had just entered, and immediately after us there <lb/>
            came in Alcibiades, the beautiful as you say, and as I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded he is, and Critias, son of Callæschrus.</p>
          <p>After we had entered, then, and waited a little while and <lb/>
            observed what was going on, we went up to Protagoras, and I <lb/>
            said, " Protagoras, I and Hippocrates here have come to see <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>" Do you wish to speak with me alone," he said, " or in the <lb/>
            presence of the rest ?"</p>
          <p>" To us," I replied, " it makes no difference, but when you <note type="footnote"> b Odyss. xi. 601. </note><note type="footnote">c Homer Odyss. xi. 582. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            have heard on what account we have come, you can determine <lb/>
            yourself."</p>
          <p>" What is it then," said he, " that you are come for ?"</p>
          <p>" Hippocrates here is a native of this country, son of Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus, of a great and wealthy family; in natural ability he seems <lb/>
            to be a match for the youth of his age ; and he appears to me <lb/>
            to be desirous of becoming a person of note in the city; and he <lb/>
            thinks that he shall most readily become so, if he associates <lb/>
            with you. Do you then determine, whether we ought to con­ <lb/>
            verse apart with you on this subject, or in the presence of <lb/>
            others."</p>
          <p>20. " You very properly take precautions on my behalf, <lb/>
            Socrates," he replied. " For a stranger who visits powerful <lb/>
            cities, and persuades the most distinguished of the youth in <lb/>
            them to quit the society of others, both kindred and not kin­ <lb/>
            dred, both old and young, and associate with him, in the ex­ <lb/>
            pectation of being improved by his society, ought in doing this <lb/>
            to be very cautious, for things of this kind are attended with <lb/>
            no slight jealousies and enmities, and even plots. For my <lb/>
            part, I say that the art of a sophist is ancient, but the men <lb/>
            who professed it in ancient times, fearing the odium attached <lb/>
            to it, sought to conceal it, and veiled it over, some under the <lb/>
            garb of poetry, as Homer, Hesiod, and Simonides, and others <lb/>
            under that of the mysteries and prophecies, such as Orpheus <lb/>
            and Musseus, and their followers, and some I perceive have <lb/>
            veiled it under the gymnastic art, as Iccus of Tarentum, and <lb/>
            one of the present day who is a sophist, inferior to none, He­ <lb/>
            rodicus of Selymbria, who was originally of Megara. But <lb/>
            your own Agathocles, who was a great sophist, concealed it <lb/>
            under the garb of music, as did Pythoclides of Ceos, and many <lb/>
            others. 21. All these, as I say, through fear of jealousies, <lb/>
            employed these arts as veils. I, however, in this respect, do <lb/>
            not agree with any of them; for I think that they did not by <lb/>
            any means effect the object they wished; for they did not es­ <lb/>
            cape the observation of men of authority in the cities, on whose <lb/>
            account they had recourse to these disguises, for the multitude <lb/>
            perceive scarcely any thing at. all, but whatever the former <lb/>
            give out, that they sing. Now to try to escape and not to be <lb/>
            able to do so, but to be detected, both shews great folly in the <lb/>
            attempt, and necessarily makes men much more hostile: for <lb/>
            they think that such a man is moreover an impostor. 22. I <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            therefore have taken a path quite contrary to them, and I ac­ <lb/>
            knowledge that I am a sophist and teach men, and I think <lb/>
            that this precaution is better than the other, to confess rather <lb/>
            than to deny: I have also planned other precautions besides <lb/>
            this ; so that by God's help I have suffered no harm through con­ <lb/>
            fessing that I am a sophist; though I have exercised this art <lb/>
            now many years; for my age is very great, and there is not <lb/>
            one amongst you all whose father I am not old enough to be. <lb/>
            So that it will be by far the most agreeable to me, if you are <lb/>
            willing, to discuss this matter in the presence of all who are in <lb/>
            the house."</p>
          <p>I then, for I suspected that he wished to shew and make a <lb/>
            display of himself before Prodicus and Hippias, that we had <lb/>
            come as his admirers—23. " Why then," said I, " do we not <lb/>
            summon Prodicus and Hippias, and their party, to listen to <lb/>
            us ?"</p>
          <p>" By all means," said Protagoras.</p>
          <p>Callias therefore said, " Would you wish us to prepare seats, <lb/>
            that you may sit down and converse ?" It was agreed, that <lb/>
            this should be done. And we all of us, in great delight, as <lb/>
            being about to listen to wise men, laid hold of the stools, and <lb/>
            benches, and couches, and placed them in order near Hippias; <lb/>
            for the stools were there already; meanwhile Callias and Alci­ <lb/>
            blades brought Prodicus and his party with them, having made <lb/>
            him get out of bed.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, we were all seated, " Now Socrates," said <lb/>
            Protagoras, " since they are all here, you may repeat what you <lb/>
            just now mentioned to me respecting this youth."</p>
          <p>24. And I said, "My commencement, Protagoras, is the <lb/>
            same as it was just now, namely, with what design we came to <lb/>
            you. Hippocrates here is very desirous of your society, and <lb/>
            says he shall be glad to hear what advantage he may expect to <lb/>
            derive from associating with you. Such is our errand."</p>
          <p>Thereupon Protagoras said in reply, " Young man, the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage which you will derive from associating with me is this, <lb/>
            that on the very day of your being with me you will go home <lb/>
            a better man than you were before, and the same on the second <lb/>
            day, and on each succeeding day you will make some further <lb/>
            progress."</p>
          <p>25. And I, on hearing this, said, " Protagoras, this is nothing <lb/>
            wonderful that you say, but very natural, since you too, old <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            and wise as you are, would become better, if any one should <lb/>
            teach you what you do not happen to know. But that is not <lb/>
            what we require, but just as if Hippocrates here should on the <lb/>
            instant change his mind, and desire to associate with the youth <lb/>
            who has lately arrived, Zeuxippus of Heraclea, and coming to <lb/>
            him as he now does to you, should be told by him the very <lb/>
            same things that he has been by you, that by associating with <lb/>
            him he would every day become better, and make further pro­ <lb/>
            gress ; if he should further ask him, ' In what do you mean I <lb/>
            shall become better, and in what make further progress ?' <lb/>
            Zeuxippus would answer him, ' In the art of painting.' And <lb/>
            if he were to attach himself to Orthagoras of Thebes, and <lb/>
            being told by him the very same things that he has been by <lb/>
            you, should further ask him in what he would daily become <lb/>
            better by associating with him, he would reply, ' In flute-play­ <lb/>
            ing.' In like manner do you also reply to the youth, and to <lb/>
            me who ask for him: Hippocrates here, by associating with <lb/>
            Protagoras, on the very day in which he associates will go <lb/>
            home a better man, and on each succeeding day will in like <lb/>
            manner make further progress; in what Protagoras, and with <lb/>
            respect to what ?”</p>
          <p>26. Protagoras, on hearing me thus speak, said," You put the <lb/>
            question fairly, Socrates, and I delight in answering those who <lb/>
            put their questions well. For Hippocrates, if he comes to me, <lb/>
            will not be treated as he would be treated if he were to attach <lb/>
            himself to any other of the sophists. For others injure youth; <lb/>
            for when they have shewn an aversion to the arts they drag them <lb/>
            back again and force them to study the arts by teaching them <lb/>
            arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, and music ; and at the same <lb/>
            time he looked aside at Hippias: but if he comes to me, he <lb/>
            will not learn anything else than that for which he came. The <lb/>
            instruction that he will receive is this, the method of consult­ <lb/>
            ing well about his domestic affairs, in what way he may best <lb/>
            govern his own house, and with respect to public affairs, how <lb/>
            he may be best able to act and speak on affairs of state."</p>
          <p>27. " Do I follow your meaning ?” I replied, “ for you appear <lb/>
            to me to mean the political art, and to promise to make men <lb/>
            good citizens."</p>
          <p>" That," said he, " Socrates, is the very profession that I do <lb/>
            make."</p>
          <p>" What an admirable skill you possess," said I, " if you really <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            do possess it; for I will say nothing else to you but what I <lb/>
            think. For I imagined, Protagoras, that this could not be <lb/>
            taught, yet since you say so, I know not how to disbelieve you. <lb/>
            It is right, however, that I should tell you why I think it can­ <lb/>
            not be taught, nor acquired by men from men. For I, as well <lb/>
            as the other Greeks, say that the Athenians are wise. I see, <lb/>
            then, when we are met in the assembly, and when it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary for the city to settle any thing respecting architecture, <lb/>
            that the architects are sent for and consulted about the build­ <lb/>
            ings, and when respecting ship-building, ship-builders ; and so <lb/>
            with all other things which they think can be taught and <lb/>
            learnt. But should any one else, whom they think is not an <lb/>
            artist, attempt to give them advice, even though he may be <lb/>
            very honourable, and rich and noble, they pay no more atten­ <lb/>
            tion to him on this account, but laugh at him and make an <lb/>
            uproar, until either he of his own accord desists from speaking, <lb/>
            through being hooted down, or the archers drag him away or <lb/>
            remove him by order of the prytanes. 28. Thus they proceed <lb/>
            with respect to matters which they think pertain to art. But <lb/>
            when it is necessary to consult on any matter which relates to <lb/>
            the government of the city, any one rises up and gives his <lb/>
            advice on such subjects, whether he be a builder, a brazier, a <lb/>
            shoemaker, a merchant, a ship's captain, rich, poor, noble or <lb/>
            ignoble, and no one objects to them, as to the others, that with­ <lb/>
            out having received any instruction, or had any preceptor, they <lb/>
            yet attempt to give advice ; for it is clear that they think this <lb/>
            cannot be taught. And not only are the public in general of <lb/>
            this opinion, but privately, the wisest and best of our citizens <lb/>
            are unable to impart to others the excellence which they <lb/>
            possess : for Pericles, the father of these youths, as far as de­ <lb/>
            pended on masters, had them educated liberally and well; but <lb/>
            in those things in which he is wise, he neither instructs them <lb/>
            himself, nor entrusts them to any one else to be instructed; <lb/>
            but they, roaming about, feed as it were without restraint, if <lb/>
            by chance they may of themselves light on virtue. 29. If you <lb/>
            will too, this very same Pericles, being guardian to Clinias the <lb/>
            younger brother of this Alcibiades, and fearing lest he might <lb/>
            be corrupted by Alcibiades, separated him from him and sent <lb/>
            him to be educated by Ariphron; however, before six months <lb/>
            had elapsed, Ariphron, being unable to do any thing with him, <lb/>
            returned him to Pericles. I could also mention very many <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            others to you, who being good themselves, have never made <lb/>
            any one else better, either of their own kindred or others. I <lb/>
            therefore, Protagoras, looking to these things, think that virtue <lb/>
            cannot be taught. When, however, I hear you saying what <lb/>
            you do, I waver, and am of opinion that there is something in <lb/>
            what you say, because I think that you are a man of great ex­ <lb/>
            perience, and that you have learnt many things and discovered <lb/>
            some yourself. If, therefore, you can prove to us, more <lb/>
            clearly, that virtue can be taught, do not grudge doing so, but <lb/>
            prove it."</p>
          <p>" Indeed, Socrates," he said, " I shall not grudge it. But <lb/>
            whether shall I prove it by relating a fable to you, as an older <lb/>
            to younger men, or shall I discuss it by way of argument ?"</p>
          <p>Thereupon many of those who sat with him, answered, <lb/>
            that he might explain it in any way he pleased. " It appears <lb/>
            to me, then," said he, " more agreeable to relate a fable to <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>30. " There was once a time, when gods were, but mortal <lb/>
            races were not. But when also their destined time of creation <lb/>
            came, the gods fashioned them within the earth, composing <lb/>
            them of earth and fire, and such things as are mingled with <lb/>
            fire and earth. And when they were about to bring them into <lb/>
            light, they commanded Prometheus and Epimetheus to adorn <lb/>
            them and to distribute to each such faculties. as were proper <lb/>
            for them. But Epimetheus besought Prometheus that he <lb/>
            might make this distribution. ' And,' he said, ' when I have <lb/>
            made it, do you examine it.' Having thus persuaded him, he <lb/>
            made the distribution. But in his distribution, to some he <lb/>
            assigned strength without swiftness, and the weaker he adorned <lb/>
            with swiftness; some he armed, but giving to others an un­ <lb/>
            armed nature, he devised some other faculty for their security: <lb/>
            for to such of them as he clad with littleness, he assigned wings <lb/>
            to fly with, or a subterranean abode; but such as he increased <lb/>
            in magnitude he preserved by this very means; and thus he <lb/>
            made the distribution, equalizing all things ; he adapted these <lb/>
            contrivances taking care that no race should be destroyed.</p>
          <p>31. " When he had supplied them with the means of avoiding <lb/>
            mutual destruction, he contrived means to defend them against <lb/>
            the seasons, by clothing them with thick hairs and solid skins, <lb/>
            sufficient to keep off cold and capable of averting heat, and <lb/>
            so that, when they went to rest, these very things might serve <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            each of them as his proper and natural bed; and under their <lb/>
            feet he furnished some with hoofs, and some with hairs and <lb/>
            solid and bloodless skins. After that he provided different food <lb/>
            for different animals, for some, herbs from the earth, for others, <lb/>
            the fruit of trees, for others, roots; and to some Tie gave the <lb/>
            flesh of other animals as food: and to these he attached the <lb/>
            property of producing few offspring, but to those that are con­ <lb/>
            sumed by them, fecundity, providing for the preservation of the <lb/>
            race. However, as Epimetheus was not very wise, he igno­ <lb/>
            rantly exhausted all the faculties at his disposal on irrational <lb/>
            animals. , 32. The human race, therefore, still remained to him <lb/>
            unadorned, and he was in doubt what to do. While he is <lb/>
            doubting, Prometheus comes to examine the distribution, and <lb/>
            sees other animals provided with every thing suitable for them, <lb/>
            but man naked and unshod, imbedded and unarmed. But <lb/>
            now the destined day was at hand, on which it was necessary <lb/>
            that man should go forth from earth to light. Prometheus, <lb/>
            therefore, being in doubt what safety he can find for man, <lb/>
            steals the artificial wisdom of Vulcan and Minerva, together <lb/>
            with fire, for it was impossible that it could be acquired or <lb/>
            used by any one without fire, and accordingly he presents it <lb/>
            to man. 33. Thus, then, man became possessed of the wisdom <lb/>
            pertaining to life, he had not, however, political wisdom; for <lb/>
            that was with Jupiter; and Prometheus was no longer per­ <lb/>
            mitted to enter the citadel, the habitation of Jupiter ; moreover <lb/>
            the guards of Jupiter were terrible ; but he secretly enters the <lb/>
            common abode of Minerva and Vulcan, in which they practised <lb/>
            their arts, and having stolen the fiery art of Vulcan, and the <lb/>
            other that belonged to Minerva, he gives them to man, and <lb/>
            from this man derives the means of sustenance, but afterwards, <lb/>
            as it is said, through Epimetheus, punishment for the theft <lb/>
            overtook Prometheus.</p>
          <p>34. " When, therefore, man had become partaker of a divine <lb/>
            condition, first of all through this relationship to deity, he alone <lb/>
            of all animals acknowledged gods, and set about building altars <lb/>
            and statues of gods : next, by art, he soon articulated sounds <lb/>
            and words, and devised houses and garments, and shoes and <lb/>
            beds, and food from the earth. Thus provided however, at <lb/>
            first men lived dispersed; for cities were not: wherefore they <lb/>
            were destroyed by wild beasts, through being every where <lb/>
            weaker than them; and the mechanical art was indeed sufli­ <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            dent aid for their support, but was inadequate to the war with <lb/>
            wild beasts; for they did not yet possess the political art, of <lb/>
            which the military is a part. They sought therefore to collect <lb/>
            themselves together, and to preserve themselves by building <lb/>
            cities. When, however, they were thus collected, they injured <lb/>
            one another, from not possessing the political art; so that, <lb/>
            being again dispersed, they were destroyed. 35. Jupiter, <lb/>
            therefore, fearing for our race, lest it should entirely perish, <lb/>
            sends Hermes to carry shame and justice to men, that they <lb/>
            might be ornaments of cities, and bonds to cement friendship. <lb/>
            Hermes, therefore, asked Jupiter in what manner he was to <lb/>
            give shame and justice to men. ' Whether, as the arts have <lb/>
            been distributed, so shall I distribute these also ? for they have <lb/>
            been distributed thus: one man who possesses the medicinal <lb/>
            art is sufficient for many not skilled in it, and so with other <lb/>
            craftsmen. Shall I thus dispense shame and justice among <lb/>
            men, or distribute them to all?' 'To all,' said Jupiter, 'and <lb/>
            let all partake of them: for there would be no cities, if a few only <lb/>
            were to partake of them, as of other arts. Moreover enact a <lb/>
            law in my name, that whosoever is unable to partake of shame <lb/>
            and justice shall be put to death as a pest of a city.'</p>
          <p>36. "Thus, then, Socrates, and for these reasons, as well <lb/>
            others as the Athenians, when a question arises about excel­ <lb/>
            lence in building, or any other mechanical art, think that few <lb/>
            only should give their advice; and if any one, who is not of <lb/>
            the number of the few, should offer to give advice, they do <lb/>
            not allow him, as you say; and properly, as I say : but when <lb/>
            they proceed to a consultation respecting political excellence, <lb/>
            which ought to depend entirely on justice and temperance, <lb/>
            they very properly allow every man to speak, because it is the <lb/>
            duty of every one to partake of this excellence, otherwise there <lb/>
            can be no cities. This, Socrates, is the cause of this fact.</p>
          <p>37. "And that you may not think that you are deceived, <lb/>
            when you are told that in reality all men are of opinion that <lb/>
            every one partakes of justice, and of the other political excel­ <lb/>
            lences, take this additional proof. For in other kinds of ex­ <lb/>
            cellence, as you say, if any one asserts that he is a good flute- <lb/>
            player, or skilled in any other art, of which he is ignorant, <lb/>
            they either ridicule him, or are indignant, and his friends go <lb/>
            to him and admonish him as a madman; but in justice and <lb/>
            other political virtues, even though they know of any man that <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            he is unjust, yet if he himself tells the truth of himself in the <lb/>
            presence of many persons, what in the other case they con­ <lb/>
            sidered prudence, to speak the truth, in this case they consider <lb/>
            madness; and they say that all men ought to say they are <lb/>
            just, whether they are so or not, or that he is mad who does <lb/>
            not lay claim to justice, because it is necessary that every one <lb/>
            should, in some respect, partake of it, or no longer be a <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>38. "I say these things to shew that they very properly per­ <lb/>
            mit every man to give advice concerning this virtue, because <lb/>
            they think that every one partakes of it. But that men think <lb/>
            that it exists not naturally or spontaneously, but that it is <lb/>
            taught and acquired by study, by whomsoever it is acquired, <lb/>
            this I will in the next place endeavour to shew. For whatever <lb/>
            evils men think others respectively have by nature or fortune <lb/>
            no one is angry with, nor admonishes, or teaches, or punishes <lb/>
            the possessors of them, in order to make them otherwise than <lb/>
            they are, but pity them. For instance, who would be so fool­ <lb/>
            ish as to attempt to do any of these things to the deformed, or <lb/>
            the little, or the weak ? For they know, I think, that these <lb/>
            things, such as are beautiful and the contraries, happen to men <lb/>
            by nature and fortune : but such advantages as they think re­ <lb/>
            sult to men from study, practice, and instruction, if any one <lb/>
            does not possess them but their contrary evils, for these things <lb/>
            anger, and punishment, and admonition, are had recourse to : <lb/>
            of these one is injustice, and so is impiety, and in short, every <lb/>
            thing that is contrary to political virtue. Here, then, every <lb/>
            man is angry with and admonishes every other, clearly because <lb/>
            he thinks it may be acquired by study and instruction. 39. <lb/>
            For if you will consider, Socrates, of what avail it is to punish <lb/>
            those who act unjustly, this very thing will teach you that men <lb/>
            think virtue is to be acquired. For no one punishes those who <lb/>
            act unjustly, merely attending to this and for this reason, that <lb/>
            any one has so acted, unless it be one who like a brute avenges <lb/>
            himself irrationally; but he who endeavours to punish with <lb/>
            reason, does not exact vengeance for the sake of past offence, <lb/>
            (for what has been done he cannot make undone,) but for the <lb/>
            sake of the future, that neither this man himself, nor any other <lb/>
            who sees him punished, may again act unjustly. And he who <lb/>
            entertains such a thought must think that virtue may be taught; <lb/>
            he punishes certainly for the sake of deterring from wicked­ <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            ness. 40 All, therefore, have this opinion who inflict punish­ <lb/>
            ment, either privately or publicly. Now all other men, and <lb/>
            especially the Athenians, your fellow-citizens, inflict punishment <lb/>
            on and correct those who they think act unjustly; so that, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to this reasoning, the Athenians also are among the <lb/>
            number of those who think that virtue may be acquired and <lb/>
            taught. That your fellow-citizens, therefore, very properly <lb/>
            allow a brazier and a shoemaker to give advice in political <lb/>
            affairs, and that they think that virtue may be taught and ac­ <lb/>
            quired, has been sufficiently demonstrated to you, Socrates, at <lb/>
            least as it appears to me.</p>
          <p>41. " There still, however, remains a doubt which you enter­ <lb/>
            tain respecting those good men, why. in the world they have <lb/>
            their sons instructed in such things as depend on masters, and <lb/>
            make them wise, but in the virtue which they themselves pos­ <lb/>
            sess do not make them better than others. With respect to <lb/>
            this, then, Socrates, I shall no longer speak to you in fable, but <lb/>
            argument. For consider the matter thus. Whether is there <lb/>
            some one thing or not, of which it is necessary all the citizens <lb/>
            should partake, if a city is to be ? for in this or in no other way, <lb/>
            the doubt which you entertain is solved. For if there is, and <lb/>
            if this one thing is neither the art of a builder, nor of a brazier, <lb/>
            nor of a potter, but is justice, and temperance, and holiness, <lb/>
            and in a word I call it by one name, the virtue of a man; if <lb/>
            this be the thing, of which all must partake, and with which <lb/>
            every man if he wishes to learn or do any thing else, must learn <lb/>
            or do it, but not without this, or if one who does not partake <lb/>
            of it must be taught and punished, whether boy, or man, or <lb/>
            woman, till through being punished he becomes better, and he <lb/>
            who is not obedient, when punished or taught, is to be banished <lb/>
            from cities, or put to death as incurable; if this is the case, <lb/>
            and if, notwithstanding this, good men teach their children <lb/>
            other things, but not this, consider what strange people those <lb/>
            good men are : 42. for we have shewn that they think it may <lb/>
            be taught, both privately and publicly. But since it may be <lb/>
            taught, and acquired by study, do they teach their children <lb/>
            other things, for which death is not imposed as a penalty, if <lb/>
            they do not know them ; but where the penalty of death or <lb/>
            exile is imposed on their children, if they are not instructed <lb/>
            or exercised in virtue, and besides death, the confiscation of <lb/>
            their property, and in short the ruin of their families, do you <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            think that they do not teach them these things nor bestow their <lb/>
            whole care upon them ? We must think they do, Socrates.</p>
          <p>" Beginning from childhood they both teach and admonish <lb/>
            them as long as they live. For as soon as any one understands <lb/>
            what is said, nurse, mother, pedagogue, and the father himself, <lb/>
            vie with each other in this, how the boy may become as good <lb/>
            as possible; in every word and deed teaching and pointing out <lb/>
            to him that this is just, and that unjust, this is honourable and <lb/>
            that base, this is holy and that unholy, and this you must do <lb/>
            and that you must not do. And if the boy obeys willingly, it <lb/>
            is well; but if not, like a tree twisted and bent they make him <lb/>
            straight by threats and blows. 43. After this they send him <lb/>
            to masters,, and give them much more strict injunctions to <lb/>
            attend to the children's morals than to their reading and <lb/>
            music: and the masters do attend to this, and when the <lb/>
            boys have learnt their letters, and are able to understand <lb/>
            what is written, as before words spoken, they place before <lb/>
            them on their benches to read, and compel them to learn by <lb/>
            heart the compositions of good poets, in which there are <lb/>
            many admonitions, and many details, and praises, and enco­ <lb/>
            miums, of good men of former times, in order that the boy <lb/>
            may imitate them through emulation, and strive to become <lb/>
            such himself. Again, the music-masters, in the same way, <lb/>
            pay attention to sobriety of behaviour, and take care that the <lb/>
            boys commit no evil: besides this, when they have learnt to <lb/>
            play on the harp, they teach them the compositions of other <lb/>
            good poets, and those lyric, setting them to music, and they <lb/>
            compel rhythm and harmony to become familiar to the boys' <lb/>
            souls, in order that they may become more gentle, and being <lb/>
            themselves more rhythmical and harmonious, they may be able <lb/>
            both to speak and act; for the whole life of man requires <lb/>
            rhythm and harmony. 44. Moreover, besides this, they send <lb/>
            them to a teacher of gymnastics, that having their bodies in a <lb/>
            better state, they may be subservient to their well-regulated <lb/>
            mind, and not be compelled to cowardice, through bodily in­ <lb/>
            firmity, either in war or other actions. And these things they <lb/>
            do who are most able; but the richest are the most able, and <lb/>
            their sons beginning to frequent masters at the earliest time of <lb/>
            life leave them the latest. And when they are set free from mas­ <lb/>
            ters, the state still further compels them to learn the laws, and <lb/>
            to live by them as a pattern, that they may not act at random <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            after their own inclinations, but exactly as writing masters <lb/>
            having ruled lines with a pen for those boys who have not yet <lb/>
            learnt to write well, so give them the copy-book, and compel <lb/>
            them to write according to the direction of the lines, so the <lb/>
            state having prescribed laws which were the inventions of good <lb/>
            and ancient legislators, compels them both to govern and be <lb/>
            governed according to these, but whoso transgresses them, it <lb/>
            punishes; and the name given to this chastisement, both among <lb/>
            you, and in many other places, is correction, since punishment <lb/>
            corrects. 45. So great therefore being the attention paid to <lb/>
            virtue, privately and publicly, do you wonder and doubt, Socrates, <lb/>
            whether virtue may be taught ? There is no need, however, to <lb/>
            wonder, but much more if it could not be taught.</p>
          <p>" Why then are there many bad sons of good fathers ? Learn <lb/>
            again the reason of this; for it is not at all wonderful, if what <lb/>
            I have before said is true, that, if a state is to subsist, no one <lb/>
            must be unskilled in this thing, virtue. For if what I say is <lb/>
            the case, (and it assuredly is), consider the matter by selecting <lb/>
            any other study and subject of instruction whatever. 46. For <lb/>
            instance, suppose that a city could not subsist unless we were <lb/>
            all of us flute-players, each according to his capacity, and sup-, <lb/>
            pose every one should teach his neighbour, both privately and <lb/>
            publicly, and should chide any one who did not play well, and <lb/>
            should not grudge doing this, as now no one grudges a knowledge <lb/>
            of what is just and legal, or conceals it, as is the case in other <lb/>
            arts, for mutual justice and virtue are, I think, advantageous to <lb/>
            us; and for this reason every one most willingly tells and <lb/>
            teaches others what is just and legal. If then in the same <lb/>
            way, in flute-playing, we had a perfectly willing and ungrudging <lb/>
            disposition to teach each other, do you think, Socrates," said <lb/>
            lie, " that the sons of good flute-players would become good <lb/>
            players, rather than the sons of bad ones ? I indeed think not; <lb/>
            but the man's son who happened to have the best natural <lb/>
            talent for flute-playing, would rise to distinction; and the <lb/>
            man's son who had no such natural talent, would be undis­ <lb/>
            tinguished; and the son of a good flute-player would often <lb/>
            turn out a bad one, and the son of a bad one would often turn <lb/>
            out a good one. However, all would be sufficiently good flute- <lb/>
            players, compared with those who are untaught, and who know <lb/>
            nothing of flute-playing. 47. In like manner think that the <lb/>
            man who appears to you to be the most unjust of those who <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            are trained in the laws, and among civilized men, is just and <lb/>
            a proficient in justice, when compared with men, who have <lb/>
            neither instruction nor courts of justice, nor laws, nor any <lb/>
            necessity that constantly compels them to attend to virtue, <lb/>
            but may be considered as savages, such as those whom the <lb/>
            poet Pherecrates represented last year, at the Lensean festival. <lb/>
            Assuredly, if you should chance to be thrown among such <lb/>
            men as the misanthropes in that play, you would rejoice if <lb/>
            you met with a Eurybates and a Phrynondasd, and you would <lb/>
            deplore with regret the depravity of the men here. But now <lb/>
            you are fastidious, Socrates, because all are teachers of virtue <lb/>
            as far as they are severally able, though no one appears to you <lb/>
            to be so. Again, if you were to enquire for a teacher of the <lb/>
            Greek language, not one would be found: nor, I think, if you <lb/>
            were to enquire for one who could instruct the sons of our arti­ <lb/>
            ficers in the very art which they have learnt from their father, <lb/>
            so far as the father and the father's friends who follow the <lb/>
            same art are able to teach it, if, I say, you were to enquire for <lb/>
            one who could instruct them, I think, Socrates, that a teacher <lb/>
            would not easily be found for them, but for those who are <lb/>
            utterly unskilled, a teacher would easily be found, and so with <lb/>
            respect to virtue and every thing else. 48. But if there is <lb/>
            any one who excels us even but a little in advancing others in <lb/>
            the road to virtue, we ought to be content. Of these, then, <lb/>
            I think I am one, and that far above other men I know certain <lb/>
            things by which a man will be made upright and good, and <lb/>
            that worth the remuneration which I demand, and even more, <lb/>
            as also my pupils think. Therefore I adopt the following <lb/>
            method in my demand for remuneration; when any one has <lb/>
            learnt from me, if he is willing, he pays the sum that I de­ <lb/>
            mand ; but if not, having gone to a temple and sworn how <lb/>
            much my instructions are worth, he pays that sum.</p>
          <p>" Thus much, Socrates," he continued, " I have said by way <lb/>
            of fable and argument, to prove that virtue may be taught, and <lb/>
            that the Athenians are of that opinion, and that it is not at all <lb/>
            wonderful that the sons of good fathers should turn out bad, or <lb/>
            of bad fathers, good, since even the sons of Polycletus, who are <lb/>
            of the same age with Paralus and Xanthippus here, are nothing <lb/>
            compared with their father, and so with respect to the sons of <lb/>
            other artists; these youths, however, do not yet deserve to be <note type="footnote"> d Two men whose profligacy made their names proverbial </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            blamed in this respect; for we have still hopes in them, as <lb/>
            they are young."</p>
          <p>49. Protagoras having made such and so long a display, <lb/>
            ceased speaking; and I, having continued for a long time en­ <lb/>
            chanted, still looked at him, expecting that he would say some­ <lb/>
            thing more, and desiring to hear him. But when I perceived <lb/>
            that he had in reality ceased, I with difficulty collected myself, <lb/>
            and looking towards Hippocrates, said," 0 son of Apollodorus, <lb/>
            how thankful I am to you for having urged me to come hither; <lb/>
            for I esteem it a great privilege to have heard what I have <lb/>
            heard from Protagoras; for before this, I thought it was no <lb/>
            human care by which good men become good, but now I am <lb/>
            persuaded that it is. However, I feel a slight difficulty, which, <lb/>
            doubtless, Protagoras will easily explain, since he has explained <lb/>
            so much. For if any one should converse with any one of the <lb/>
            popular orators on these subjects, he would perhaps hear simi­ <lb/>
            lar arguments, as from Pericles, for instance, or some other <lb/>
            able speaker; but if he should ask them any further questions, <lb/>
            like books they are unable either to give an answer or to ask <lb/>
            any question themselves. And if one should put any trifling <lb/>
            question to them respecting what has been said, as brass when <lb/>
            struck sounds for a long time, and prolongs its sound, unless <lb/>
            some one lays hold of it, so these orators, when asked some <lb/>
            trifling question, answer in a speech drawn out to a great <lb/>
            length. 50. But Protagoras here is able to make long and <lb/>
            beautiful speeches, as the fact proves, and is also able, when <lb/>
            asked a question, to answer briefly, and when questioning, to <lb/>
            wait and receive the answer, which are qualities possessed but <lb/>
            by a few. Now then, Protagoras, I need a trifle only, so that <lb/>
            I shall have all I want if you will answer me this. You say <lb/>
            that virtue may be taught; and I, if I could be persuaded by <lb/>
            any man, should be persuaded by you. But, what I wondered <lb/>
            at your saying, satisfy my mind as to that. For you said that <lb/>
            Jupiter sent justice and shame to men; and afterwards, in <lb/>
            many parts of your discourse, justice, temperance, holiness, <lb/>
            and all qualities of that kind, were spoken of by you, as if they <lb/>
            were collectively one thing, virtue. Therefore explain this <lb/>
            accurately to me, whether virtue is one thing, and justice, tem­ <lb/>
            perance, and holiness, parts of it; or whether these that I have <lb/>
            now mentioned are all names of one and the same thing. This <lb/>
            is what I still want to know." <note type="footnote">s </note></p><pb n="258"/>
            
          <p>51. "But it is easy," said he, "Socrates, to answer this <lb/>
            question, that the qualities about which you ask are parts of <lb/>
            virtue, which is one thing."</p>
          <p>" Whether," said I, " are they parts like the parts of a face, <lb/>
            the mouth, nose, eyes, and ears; or like the parts of gold, <lb/>
            which in no respect differ from each other and from th3 whole, <lb/>
            except in magnitude and littleness ?"</p>
          <p>" Like the former, it appears to me Socrates, as the parts of <lb/>
            the face are to the whole face."</p>
          <p>" Whether, then," said I, " do men possess these parts of <lb/>
            virtue, some one and others another part? or is it necessary <lb/>
            that he who has received one should have all?"</p>
          <p>" By no means," he replied, " since many men are brave, <lb/>
            but unjust, and again just, but not wise."</p>
          <p>" Are these, then, parts of virtue," said I, " wisdom and <lb/>
            courage ?"</p>
          <p>" Most assuredly," he replied, " and wisdom is chief of all <lb/>
            the parts."</p>
          <p>" And is every one of them," said I, " different from every <lb/>
            other ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>" And has each of them its proper function, like the parts of <lb/>
            the face? For instance, an eye is not like the ears, nor is its <lb/>
            function the same; nor is any one of the others like any other, <lb/>
            either as to its function, or in any other respect. Thus, then, <lb/>
            with the parts of virtue, is not any one like any other, either <lb/>
            in itself, or in its function ? Is it not clear that such is the <lb/>
            case, since it resembles our example ?"</p>
          <p>" Such is the case, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>52. Then I said, " Therefore none of the other parts of vir­ <lb/>
            tue are like science, or like justice, or like courage, or like <lb/>
            temperance, or like holiness."</p>
          <p>" No," he said.</p>
          <p>" Come then," said I, " let us examine together what the <lb/>
            character of each of them is. And first of all, thus; is justice <lb/>
            a thing, or not a thing ? to me it appears to be a thing; but <lb/>
            what does it appear to you to be ?"</p>
          <p>“ To me also it appears to be a thing," he replied.</p>
          <p>“ What then ? If some one were to ask you and ine, ' Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras and Socrates, tell me with respect to this very thing <lb/>
            which you have just now named, justice, whether is it in itself <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            just or unjust?' I should answer him that it is just: but what <lb/>
            decision would you give ? the same as mine, or different ?"</p>
          <p>" The same," he replied.</p>
          <p>“‘Justice, then, is precisely similar to being just,' I should <lb/>
            say in answer to one who asked the question. And would not <lb/>
            you, too?”</p>
          <p>" Yes," he said.</p>
          <p>" If, then, after this, he should ask us,' Do you not also say that <lb/>
            holiness is something ?' we should reply, I think that we do ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes," he said.</p>
          <p>"' Do you not say that this too is a thing ?' should we say <lb/>
            it is, or not?"</p>
          <p>He allowed that we should say it is.</p>
          <p>" ' But whether do you say that this very thing is of such a <lb/>
            nature as to be unholy, or holy ?' I for my part," I said, " should <lb/>
            be indignant at the question, and should say, ' Speak properly, <lb/>
            my good sir, for scarcely could any thing else be holy, if holi­ <lb/>
            ness itself be not holy.' But what should you say ? should not <lb/>
            you give the same answer ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he said.</p>
          <p>" If, then, after this, he should ask us, and say, ' What then <lb/>
            did you mean a little while ago ? Or did I not hear you aright ? <lb/>
            For you appeared to me to say that the parts of virtue are so <lb/>
            disposed to each other, that no one of them resembles any other;' <lb/>
            I, for my part should reply, ' In other respects you heard aright, <lb/>
            but in thinking that I too said this, you were mistaken; for <lb/>
            Protagoras gave this answer, and I put the question.' If then <lb/>
            he should say, ' Does he speak the truth, Protagoras; do you <lb/>
            say that no one part of virtue is like any other of its parts ? Is <lb/>
            this your assertion ?' what answer would you give him ?"</p>
          <p>" I must needs admit it, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" After admitting this, Protagoras, what answer should we <lb/>
            give him, if he further asked us, ' Is not holiness then of such <lb/>
            a nature as to be a just thing, nor justice such as to be a holy <lb/>
            thing, but such as to be not holy ; and holiness such as to be <lb/>
            not just, but unjust, and the former unholy ?' What answer <lb/>
            should we give him? I, for myself, should say both that justice <lb/>
            is holy, and holiness just. And for you, if you would permit <lb/>
            me, I should make the very same answer, that justice is the <lb/>
            same with holiness, or very like it, and that justice bears the <lb/>
            nearest possible resemblance to holiness, and holiness to justice. <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            But consider whether you would forbid me to give this answer, <lb/>
            or does it seem so to you also ?"</p>
          <p>" It does not altogether appear to me, Socrates," he said, <lb/>
            "to be so absolutely true, that I can grant that justice is holy, <lb/>
            and holiness just; but there appears to me to be a difference <lb/>
            between them. However what matters that ?" he continued : <lb/>
            "if you wish it, let it be admitted between us that justice is <lb/>
            holy, and holiness just."</p>
          <p>55. “ Not so," I replied, " for I do not require to examine <lb/>
            into an ‘If you wish it,' and ' If you think so,' but into what <lb/>
            I think and what you think ; but in saying ' what I think and <lb/>
            what you think,' I mean this, I am of opinion that our argument <lb/>
            will be best discussed if we put it out of the question alto­ <lb/>
            gether."</p>
          <p>" Well then," he said, " justice has some resemblance to holi­ <lb/>
            ness, for every thing resembles every other thing in some re­ <lb/>
            spect, for white in some sort resembles black, and hard, soft, <lb/>
            and so with respect to other things which appear to be most <lb/>
            contrary to each other; and the things which we just now said <lb/>
            have different functions, and are not the one like the other, as <lb/>
            the parts of the face do in a certain respect resemble each <lb/>
            other; so that in this way you could prove this, if you pleased, <lb/>
            that all things are similar to each other; yet it is not right to <lb/>
            call things that have a certain similarity, similar, nor things <lb/>
            that have a certain dissimilarity, dissimilar, though the simila­ <lb/>
            rity is very trifling."</p>
          <p>56. And I, wondering, said to him, " Do you think then that <lb/>
            the just and the holy are so related to each other, that they <lb/>
            have but a trifling similarity to one another?"</p>
          <p>" Not quite so," he said, " nor on the other hand do I con­ <lb/>
            sider them in the same way as you appear to me to do."</p>
          <p>" However," said I, " since you appear to me to be vexed at <lb/>
            this, we will dismiss it, and consider this of the other things <lb/>
            that you said. Do you call folly any thing ?”</p>
          <p>He admitted he did.</p>
          <p>" And is not wisdom the direct contrary to this thing ?”</p>
          <p>" It appears so to me," he replied.</p>

          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Through contraries therefore ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p>
          <p>“Folly therefore is contrary to temperance ?"</p>
          <p>“So it appears."</p>
          <p>" Do you remember, however, that we before admitted that <lb/>
            folly is contrary to wisdom ?"</p>
          <p>He allowed it.</p>
          <p>" And that one thing only is contrary to one ?"</p>
          <p>" I grant it."</p>
          <p>58. " Which, then, of these positions must we retract, Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras ? That which says, that one thing only is contrary to <lb/>
            one, or that in which it was asserted, that wisdom is different <lb/>
            from temperance, but that each is a part of virtue, and that <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            besides being different, both they and their functions are <lb/>
            dissimilar, in the same manner as the parts of the face ? <lb/>
            Which of these, then, must we retract ? for these two posi­ <lb/>
            tions taken together are not set down in a very musical <lb/>
            manner; for they neither accord, nor harmonize with each <lb/>
            other. For how can they accord, since it is necessary that one <lb/>
            thing only should be contrary to one, but not to more, but wis­ <lb/>
            dom and temperance are found to be contrary to folly, which is <lb/>
            one. Is it so, Protagoras," I asked, " or otherwise ?"</p>
          <p>He admitted that it was so, though very unwillingly.</p>
          <p>" Must not, then, temperance and wisdom be one and the <lb/>
            same thing ? Before, moreover, justice and holiness were <lb/>
            found to be nearly the same. 59. Come, however," said I, <lb/>
            "Protagoras, let us not be disheartened, but examine the rest. <lb/>
            Does a man who acts unjustly, appear to you to be prudent g, <lb/>
            because he acts unjustly ?"</p>
          <p>" I should be ashamed, Socrates," he said, " to acknowledge <lb/>
            this, though many men do say so."</p>
          <p>" Whether, then, shall I address my argument to them," I <lb/>
            asked, " or to you ?”</p>
          <p>" If you please," said he, " discuss this statement first, the <lb/>
            statement of the manv."</p>
          <p>" But it makes no difference to me, if only you will answer, <lb/>
            whether these things appear so to you or not : for I am most <lb/>
            anxious to sift the statement itself, though it may possibly <lb/>
            happen, that both I who question, and you who answer, may <lb/>
            ourselves be sifted."</p>
          <p>At first, then, Protagoras began to give himself airs, for he <lb/>
            objected that the subject was difficult; afterwards however, he <lb/>
            agreed to answer.</p>
          <p>60. " Come then," said I, " answer me from the beginning. <lb/>
            Do persons who act unjustly, appear to you to be prudent ?"</p>
          <p>" Be it so," he replied.</p>
          <p>"And by being prudent, do you mean thinking rightly ?" <lb/>
            He assented.</p>
          <p>" And by thinking rightly that they are well advised when <lb/>
            they act unjustly ?" <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> As was before observed, it is now necessary for the thread of the argu­ <lb/>
            ment to use the word prudent instead of temperate, but the reader must <lb/>
            bear in mind that in the original the two ideas are expressed by one <lb/>
            word. </note></p><pb n="264"/>
            
          <p>“ Be it so," said he.</p>
          <p>" Is this the case," I asked, " if they fare well in acting un­ <lb/>
            justly, or if they fare ill ?"</p>
          <p>" If they fare well."</p>
          <p>" Do you say then that certain things are good ?"</p>
          <p>"I do."</p>
          <p>“Are those things good, then," I asked, " which are advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to men ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said he, " and some things though they are <lb/>
            not advantageous to men I call good."</p>
          <p>61. Protagoras now appeared to me to be ruffled and an­ <lb/>
            noyed, and to be set against answering any more: when, there­ <lb/>
            fore, I saw him in this state, I was cautious, and asked him <lb/>
            gently : " Whether," said I, " Protagoras, do you mean things <lb/>
            that are advantageous to no man, or things that are advan­ <lb/>
            tageous in no respect whatever ? and do you call such things <lb/>
            good ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means," said he; " but I know many things which <lb/>
            are useless to men, meats and drinks, and drugs, and ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand other things, and some things that are advantageous ; and <lb/>
            some things that are neither the one nor the other to men, but <lb/>
            are to horses, and some to oxen only, and others to dogs, <lb/>
            others again to neither of these, but to trees, and others that <lb/>
            are good for the roots of trees, but pernicious to their buds, <lb/>
            for instance, dung is good when applied to the roots of all <lb/>
            plants, but if you were to put it on their branches and young <lb/>
            shoots, it destroys the whole. Oil too is very injurious to all <lb/>
            plants, and is most destructive to the hairs of all animals <lb/>
            except man, but it is of service to the hairs of man, and to the <lb/>
            rest of his body. 62. So various and diversified a thing is <lb/>
            good, that this very thing is good for the external parts of the <lb/>
            human body, but most pernicious to the inward parts. And on <lb/>
            this account all physicians forbid the sick to use oil, except only <lb/>
            a very small quantity in what they are going to eat, just suf­ <lb/>
            ficient to overcome the disagreeable smell of the food and <lb/>
            seasoning."</p>
          <p>Protagoras having said this, those that were present loudly <lb/>
            applauded him, for that he spoke well. And I said, " Prota­ <lb/>
            goras, I happen to be a forgetful sort of man, and if any one <lb/>
            makes me a long speech, I forget what the discussion is about. <lb/>
            As, therefore, if I happened to be deaf, you would have thought <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            it necessary, if you were about to converse with me, to speak <lb/>
            louder than you do to others, so now, since you have met with <lb/>
            a forgetful person, curtail your answers for me, and make <lb/>
            them briefer, if I am to follow you."</p>
          <p>" How do you bid me answer briefly ? Must I answer you," <lb/>
            said he, "more briefly than is requisite ?”</p>
          <p>" By no means," I replied.</p>
          <p>"But at such length as is requisite?" he asked.</p>
          <p>“Yes," said I.</p>
          <p>“Whether, then, must I answer at such length as I think <lb/>
            requisite, or as you ?"</p>
          <p>63. " I have heard," I replied, " that you are both yourself <lb/>
            able, and can teach others to make a long speech on the same <lb/>
            subject if you please, so as never to be in want of words, and <lb/>
            again to speak so briefly, that no one can express himself in <lb/>
            fewer words than you. If, therefore, you mean to converse <lb/>
            with me, use the other method with me, that of brevity."</p>
          <p>" Socrates," said he, " I have ere this entered into discussion <lb/>
            with many men, and if I had done what you bid me, that is, <lb/>
            had conversed as my antagonist bade me converse, I should <lb/>
            not have appeared to excel any one, nor would the name of <lb/>
            Protagoras have been celebrated in Greece."</p>
          <p>64. Then I (for I perceived that he was not pleased with <lb/>
            his former answers, and that he would not willingly carry on <lb/>
            the conversation by answering my questions) thinking that I <lb/>
            had no longer any business to be present at the conference, <lb/>
            said, " Protagoras, I am not anxious to continue our confer­ <lb/>
            ence contrary to your wish; but whenever you are willing to <lb/>
            converse in such a manner that I can follow you, I will then <lb/>
            converse with you. For you, as is reported of you, and as you <lb/>
            admit yourself, are able to carry on a conference both with <lb/>
            prolixity and brevity; for you are wise; but I am unable to <lb/>
            follow these long speeches; though I wish that I could. But <lb/>
            it was fitting, that you, who are capable of doing both, should <lb/>
            yield to me, in order that the conference might continue : now <lb/>
            however, since you are not willing and I have business to <lb/>
            attend to, and am unable to stay while you are extending your <lb/>
            speeches to a great length (for I have somewhere to go to), I <lb/>
            will take my departure; though otherwise perhaps I might <lb/>
            have listened to these things with pleasure."</p>
          <p>65. And as I spoke thus, I rose to depart. And as I was <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            rising, Callias takes hold of me with his right hand, and with <lb/>
            his left seized my cloak, and said, " We shall not let you go, <lb/>
            Socrates ; for if you go away, our conversation will no longer <lb/>
            be the same. I beseech you, therefore, stay with us; for there <lb/>
            is no one I would more gladly hear than you and Protagoras <lb/>
            conversing together; therefore oblige us all."</p>
          <p>To this I said—I already stood up ready to go-,, Son of <lb/>
            Hipponicus, I always admire your love of wisdom ; but I now <lb/>
            both praise and love it; so that I should wish to gratify you, <lb/>
            if you asked me what was possible. But now it is as if you <lb/>
            should ask me to keep up with Crison of Himera, a runner in <lb/>
            his prime, or to run a race and keep up with one of the long­ <lb/>
            distance runners or day-couriers; I should say to you, that I <lb/>
            wish much more than you do that I could keep pace with these <lb/>
            runners, but I cannot, but if you wish to see me and Crison <lb/>
            running together, you must request him to slacken his pace ; <lb/>
            for I am not able to run swiftly, but he is able to run slowly. <lb/>
            So if you desire to hear me and Protagoras, you must request <lb/>
            him to continue to answer as he did at first, briefly and to the <lb/>
            question. But if not, what kind of conversation will arise ? I <lb/>
            for my part thought that it is one thing to converse together, <lb/>
            and another to harangue."</p>
          <p>66. " But you see, Socrates," said he, If Protagoras appears <lb/>
            to ask what is just, in requiring that he may be allowed to <lb/>
            converse as he pleases, and you as you please."</p>
          <p>Alcibiades, thereupon, taking up the discourse, said, " You <lb/>
            do not speak fairly, Callias; for Socrates here admits that he <lb/>
            has not the faculty of making long speeches, and yields to <lb/>
            Protagoras, but in the power of conversing, and knowing how <lb/>
            to give and receive a reason, I should wonder if he yielded to <lb/>
            any man. If then, Protagoras confesses that he is inferior to <lb/>
            Socrates in conversing, that is enough for Socrates ; but if he <lb/>
            pretends to rival him, let him carry on the conversation by <lb/>
            question and answer, not making a long speech in answer to <lb/>
            each question, evading the argument and not choosing to give a <lb/>
            reason, but prolonging his speech until most of the hearers for­ <lb/>
            get what the question was about. For as for Socrates, I will <lb/>
            be his surety that he will not forget, notwithstanding he jests <lb/>
            and says he is forgetful. To me, therefore, Socrates appears <lb/>
            to make the fairer proposition; for it is right that every one <lb/>
            should declare his own opinion."</p><pb n="267"/>
            
          <p>67. After Alcibiades, it was Critias, I think, who said, <lb/>
            " Prodicus and Hippias, Callias appears to me to be very much <lb/>
            on the side of Protagoras; but Alcibiades is always fond of <lb/>
            contention, to whatever he applies himself. We, however, <lb/>
            ought not to contend with each other, either for Socrates or <lb/>
            Protagoras, but we should join in requesting them both not to <lb/>
            break up the conference in the middle."</p>
          <p>When he had spoken thus, Prodicus h said, " You seem to me <lb/>
            to say well, Critias : for it is right that those who are present <lb/>
            at discussions of this kind should be common, but not equal <lb/>
            hearers of both speakers. For it is not the same thing: for it is <lb/>
            requisite to hear both in common, but not to give equal atten­ <lb/>
            tion to each of them, but to the wiser more, and to the less <lb/>
            learned less. 68. I too, Protagoras and Socrates, beg of you <lb/>
            to make concessions to each other, and to argue with one <lb/>
            another, but not to wrangle ; for friends argue with friends out <lb/>
            of good will, but adversaries and enemies wrangle with one <lb/>
            another. And thus the conference will be most admirably <lb/>
            conducted. For you, the speakers, will thus be highly ap­ <lb/>
            proved, not praised, by us the hearers; for approbation is felt <lb/>
            in the mind of the hearers, and is without deception; but <lb/>
            praise is bestowed in words, by persons often who speak un­ <lb/>
            truly, contrary to their real opinion; again, we, the hearers, <lb/>
            shall thus be highly delighted, not pleased, for delight takes <lb/>
            place when one learns something and acquires wisdom in one's <lb/>
            mind, but pleasure when one eats something, or experiences <lb/>
            some other agreeable sensation in one's body."</p>
          <p>69. When Prodicus had thus spoken, many of those that <lb/>
            were present approved of what he said. But after Prodicus, <lb/>
            Hippias the wise spoke: " My friends who are here present," <lb/>
            said he, " I regard you all as kinsmen, relatives, and fellow-citi­ <lb/>
            zens by nature, though not by law; for like is by nature akin to <lb/>
            like, but law being a tyrant over men, compels many things to <lb/>
            be done contrary to nature. It were disgraceful, then, for us <lb/>
            to know the nature of things, to be the wisest of the Greeks, <lb/>
            and in this very character to have met together in the city of <lb/>
            Greece, which is the very prytaneum of wisdom, and in the <lb/>
            noblest and wealthiest house in this city, and then to exhibit <note type="footnote"> h It will be observed that Prodicus's method, of drawing nice distinc­ <lb/>
            tions between words nearly resembling each other in meaning, is here <lb/>
            ridiculed. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            nothing worthy of this high rank, but like the lowest of men to <lb/>
            disagree with each other. 70. I therefore both entreat and ad­ <lb/>
            vise you, Protagoras and Socrates, to come to terms under our <lb/>
            authority, who as arbitrators will bring you to an agreement; <lb/>
            and neither do you, Socrates, require that exact form of dia­ <lb/>
            logue, which is so very concise, unless it is agreeable to Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras, but relax somewhat and give the reins to your dis­ <lb/>
            course, that it may appear to us with more majesty and grace; <lb/>
            nor on the other hand, do you, Protagoras, stretching every <lb/>
            rope, and carrying all sail, scud to an ocean of words out of <lb/>
            sight of land, but both of you keep a middle course. Do thus <lb/>
            then, and be persuaded by me to choose a moderator, president, <lb/>
            and prytanis, who will oblige you to keep within moderate <lb/>
            bounds on either side."</p>
          <p>This pleased those that were present, and all approved, and <lb/>
            Callias said that he would not let me go, and they urged me <lb/>
            to choose a president. 71. I said therefore, "that it would be <lb/>
            a shame to choose an umpire for our arguments; for if the <lb/>
            person chosen should be our inferior, it would not be right that <lb/>
            the inferior should preside over his superiors, nor if he should <lb/>
            be equal, would this be right; for one that is equal will act <lb/>
            the same as we do, so that the choice will be superfluous. <lb/>
            But you will choose some one better than we are; in reality I <lb/>
            think it impossible for you to choose any one wiser than Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras here: but if you should choose one in no respect <lb/>
            superior, though you shall affirm that he is, this also will be a <lb/>
            disgrace to him, to have a president chosen for him, as if he <lb/>
            were a common person: for as to myself it makes no difference. <lb/>
            I am willing, then, to act as follows, that our conference and <lb/>
            conversation may continue, which you so earnestly desire: if <lb/>
            Protagoras is not willing to answer, let him ask questions, and <lb/>
            I will answer; and at the same time I will endeavour to shew <lb/>
            him, how I say one who answers ought to answer. But when <lb/>
            I have answered all the questions that he chooses to ask, let <lb/>
            him in his turn, in like manner, reply to me. If, however, he <lb/>
            should not appear disposed to answer the exact question put <lb/>
            to him, both you and I will join in intreating of him, as you <lb/>
            now do of me, not to destroy the conversation. And for this <lb/>
            purpose there is no occasion for one president to be appointed, <lb/>
            but you will all be presidents in common."</p>
          <p>72. It appeared to all that this was what ought to be done. <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            And though Protagoras was not very willing to comply, yet he <lb/>
            was compelled to consent to ask questions, and when he had <lb/>
            asked enough in his turn to reply to my questions with brevity. <lb/>
            He began therefore pretty nearly as follows:</p>
          <p>" I think," said he, " Socrates, that the most important part <lb/>
            of a man's education consists in being skilled in poetical com­ <lb/>
            position ; that is, to be able to understand what has been said by <lb/>
            the poets, both what has been correctly composed and what <lb/>
            incorrectly, and to know how to distinguish and to give a <lb/>
            reason when asked about them. And now the question shall <lb/>
            be on the very subject about which you and I have been con­ <lb/>
            versing, virtue, but it shall be transferred to poetry. For <lb/>
            Simonides somewhere says to 'Scopas, son of Creon the Thes­ <lb/>
            salian, ' That to become a good man is truly difficult, square as <lb/>
            to his hands and feet and mind, fashioned without fault.' Do <lb/>
            you know the ode, or shall I repeat the whole to you ?"</p>
          <p>73. I said, "There is no necessity, for I know it, and have <lb/>
            studied the ode with great attention."</p>
          <p>" You say well," he then observed, " Whether, does it ap­ <lb/>
            pear to you to have been composed beautifully and correctly <lb/>
            or not ? "</p>
          <p>"Certainly," said I, " both beautifully and correctly."</p>
          <p>" But does it appear to you to have been composed beauti­ <lb/>
            fully if the poet contradicts himself ?"</p>
          <p>" Not beautifully," I replied.</p>
          <p>" Consider it, then, more attentively," said he.</p>
          <p>“But my good friend, I have examined it sufficiently."</p>
          <p>" You know, then," said he, “that in the course of the ode <lb/>
            he says somewhere, ' That saying of Pittacus does not please <lb/>
            me, though uttered by a wise man, wherein he says, it is <lb/>
            difficult to continue to be good.' Do you observe, that the <lb/>
            same person makes both this and the former remark ?"</p>
          <p>"I know it," I replied.</p>
          <p>" Does it appear to you then," said he, " that the one agrees <lb/>
            with the other ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so to me." And at the same time I was afraid <lb/>
            lest there should be something in what he said. " But," said I, <lb/>
            “does not it appear so to you ?"</p>
          <p>" How can he who made both these assertions agree with <lb/>
            himself, who first of all laid it down in his own person, that it <lb/>
            is truly difficult to become a good man, and a little further <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            on this person forgets himself and blames Pittacus for saying <lb/>
            the same thing that he had said himself, ' that it is difficult to <lb/>
            be good,' and asserts that he cannot approve of his saying the <lb/>
            very same thing as himself. Surely in blaming a man who <lb/>
            says the same things as himself, it is clear that he blames him­ <lb/>
            self, so that in the former or the latter place he does not speak <lb/>
            correctly."</p>
          <p>74. In saying this he elicited applause and praise from many <lb/>
            of the hearers. And I, at first, as if I had been hit by a skilful <lb/>
            boxer, was blinded, and made giddy, by his saying this, and by <lb/>
            the applause of the others; but afterwards, to tell you the truth, <lb/>
            that I might have time to consider what the poet meant, I <lb/>
            turned to Prodicus, and calling out to him, said, " Prodicus, <lb/>
            Simonides was your fellow-citizen; you are bound to assist the <lb/>
            man. I seem then, to call upon you, in the same manner as <lb/>
            Homer says Scamander, when assailed by Achilles, called <lb/>
            upon Simois, saying, ' Dear brother, let us unite to repel the <lb/>
            prowess of this man.' So I call upon you, let not Protagoras <lb/>
            overthrow Simonides. For the defence of Simonides requires <lb/>
            that exquisite skill of yours, by which you distinguish between <lb/>
            to will and to desire, as not being the same, and by which you <lb/>
            just now established many and beautiful distinctions. And now <lb/>
            consider, whether your opinion agrees with mine: for Si­ <lb/>
            monides does not appear to me to contradict himself. But do <lb/>
            you, Prodicus, first declare your opinion. Does it appear to <lb/>
            you that to become and to be are the same or different ?"</p>
          <p>" Different by Jupiter," said Prodicus.</p>
          <p>75. " Has not Simonides himself then," said I, " in the first <lb/>
            passage, declared his own opinion, that it is in truth difficult to <lb/>
            become a good man ?"</p>
          <p>" You say truly," replied Prodicus.</p>
          <p>“But he blames Pittacus," I continued, " not as Protagoras <lb/>
            thinks, for saying the same thing that he had said, but some­ <lb/>
            thing different. For Pittacus does not say that this is the <lb/>
            difficulty, to become a good man, as Simonides does, but this, <lb/>
            to be so; but Protagoras, as Prodicus here says, to be and to <lb/>
            become are not the same; and if to be and to become are not <lb/>
            the same, Simonides does not contradict himself. And perhaps <lb/>
            Prodicus here, and many others, may say with Hesiodk, ' that <lb/>
            it is difficult to become good; for that the gods have placed <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad xxi. 308. </note><note type="footnote">k Opp. et Dier. v. 287 &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            sweat before virtue; but when any one has reached its summit, <lb/>
            it is then easy to acquire, though before it was difficult.’’’</p>
          <p>76. Prodicus, on hearing this, commended me; but Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras said, " Your defence, Socrates, is more erroneous than <lb/>
            the passage which you defend."</p>
          <p>And I said, " Then I have done ill, as it seems, Protagoras, <lb/>
            and I am an absurd physician; in attempting to cure, I make <lb/>
            the disease worse."</p>
          <p>" So it is however," he said.</p>
          <p>“But how?" I asked.</p>
          <p>“Great must have been the poet's ignorance," he replied, <lb/>
            "if he asserts that virtue is so easy a thing to be acquired, <lb/>
            whereas it is the most difficult of all, as all men think."</p>
          <p>77. And I said, " By Jupiter, Prodicus here is very op­ <lb/>
            portunely present at our discussion. For the wisdom of Pro­ <lb/>
            dicus appears, 0 Protagoras, to have been of old divine, whether <lb/>
            it began with Simonides, or is even still more ancient. But you, <lb/>
            who are skilled in many other things, appear to be unskilled in <lb/>
            this, and not skilled in it as I am, from being the disciple of <lb/>
            this Prodicus. And now you appear to me not to be aware <lb/>
            that Simonides probably did not understand this word ' diffi­ <lb/>
            cult: in the same sense as you understand it; but as with the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὸς</foreign>, (terrible and clever,) Prodicus here is continually <lb/>
            taking me to task, when in praising you, or any one else, I say, <lb/>
            that Protagoras is a wise and terrible man, he asks if I am <lb/>
            not ashamed of calling good things terrible, for what is terrible, <lb/>
            he says, is evil; hence no one ever speaks of terrible riches, <lb/>
            or terrible peace, or terrible health, but every one says terrible <lb/>
            disease, and terrible war, and terrible poverty, since whatever <lb/>
            is terrible is evil. Perhaps, therefore, the Ceans and Simonides <lb/>
            understand by the word difficult either that which is bad, or <lb/>
            something else that you are not aware of. 78. Let us then <lb/>
            ask Prodicus; for it is right to enquire of him the mean­ <lb/>
            ing of words used by Simonides; what, Prodicus, does Simo­ <lb/>
            nides mean by the word difficult?"</p>
          <p>" Evil," he replied.</p>
          <p>" For this reason, then," I continued, " Prodicus, he blames <lb/>
            Pittacus for saying that it is difficult to be good, as if he had <lb/>
            beard him say that it is evil to be good."</p>
          <p>.. But what else but this, Socrates," he asked, " do you think <lb/>
            Simonides meant and found fault with in Pittacus, that he did <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            not know how to distinguish terms rightly, as being a Lesbian, <lb/>
            and educated in a barbarous dialect ?"</p>
          <p>“Do you hear Prodicus," said I, " Protagoras ? And have <lb/>
            you any objection to make to this ?"</p>
          <p>Thereupon Protagoras said, 79. " This is far from being the <lb/>
            case, Prodicus; for I am very sure that Simonides meant by <lb/>
            the word difficult the same that we all do, not what is evil, <lb/>
            but that which is not easy, but is accomplished by much toil."</p>
          <p>"And I too think, Protagoras," I said, "that Simonides <lb/>
            meant this, and that Prodicus here knows he did, but he is <lb/>
            jesting, and is willing to try whether you are able to maintain <lb/>
            your own assertion. For that Simonides does not by the <lb/>
            word difficult mean evil, is strongly confirmed by the expres­ <lb/>
            sion immediately after this; for he says, that' God alone pos­ <lb/>
            sesses this privilege,' not surely meaning that it is evil to be <lb/>
            good; then he adds that God alone possesses this, and he at­ <lb/>
            tributes this privilege to God alone; for in that case Prodicus <lb/>
            would call Simonides a profligate, and by no means a Cean. <lb/>
            But I am willing to tell you what appears to me to have been <lb/>
            the design of Simonides in this ode, if you think proper to <lb/>
            make trial of my poetical skill, as you call it; or if you prefer <lb/>
            it, I will listen to you."</p>
          <p>80. Protagoras, therefore, hearing me speak thus, said, " If <lb/>
            you please, Socrates;" but Prodicus, Hippias, and the rest, <lb/>
            urged me very much.</p>
          <p>" I will endeavour, then," said I, " to explain to you what I <lb/>
            think of this ode. Philosophy is most ancient and most pre­ <lb/>
            valent in Crete and Lacedsemon of all Greece, and sophists <lb/>
            are more numerous there than any where else. They deny it, <lb/>
            however, and pretend to be ignorant, in order that they may <lb/>
            not be discovered to surpass the rest of the Greeks in wisdom, <lb/>
            like those sophists whom Protagoras mentioned, but that they <lb/>
            may appear to excel in fighting and courage, thinking that, if <lb/>
            it were known in what they excel, all men would engage in the <lb/>
            same pursuit. But now, concealing this, they deceive those who <lb/>
            affect Spartan manners in other cities, for some, in imitation <lb/>
            of them, have their ears bruised, and bind their arms with <lb/>
            the thongs of the cestus, and devote themselves to gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises, and wear short garments, as if in these things the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians excelled the other Greeks. But the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, now that they wish to converse without restraint with <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            the sophists among them, and are wearied with conversing <lb/>
            with them in secret, expelling these imitators of Spartan man­ <lb/>
            ners, and any other stranger that is living in their country, <lb/>
            converse with the sophists unknown to all strangers; and <lb/>
            they do not suffer any of their young men to go out to other <lb/>
            cities, as neither do the Cretans, lest they should unlearn what <lb/>
            they have taught them. 81. And in these cities there are not <lb/>
            only men that pride themselves on their learning, but women <lb/>
            also. And you may know, that in this I speak truly, and that <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians are admirably instructed in philosophy <lb/>
            and the art of speaking, from the following circumstance: <lb/>
            for if any one wishes to converse with the meanest of the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, he will find him, for the most part, apparently <lb/>
            an ordinary person in conversation, but afterwards, when a pro­ <lb/>
            per opportunity presents itself, he sends forth, like a skilful <lb/>
            lancer, a notable saying, brief and pointed, so that he who con­ <lb/>
            verses with him will appear to be nothing better than a boy. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly some persons, both of the present day and of former <lb/>
            times, have observed this very thing, that to imitate Spartan <lb/>
            manners consists much more in studying philosophy, than de­ <lb/>
            voting one's-self to gymnastic exercises, since they know that to <lb/>
            be able to utter such sayings is a proof of a highly educated <lb/>
            man. 82. Among these were Thales of Miletus, Pittacus of <lb/>
            Mitylene, Bias of Priene, our own Solon, Cleobulus of Lindus, <lb/>
            Myson of Chene, and the seventh among them was reckoned <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian Chilo. These all were emulators, lovers, <lb/>
            and disciples of the Lacedaemonian education, and any one may <lb/>
            discover that their wisdom was of this kind, brief and memor­ <lb/>
            able sayings uttered by each of them. These men also, having <lb/>
            met together, consecrated the first-fruits of their wisdom to <lb/>
            Apollo in the temple at Delphi, inscribing those sentences which <lb/>
            all men. have in their mouths : ' Know thyself,' and ' Nothing <lb/>
            in extremes.'</p>
          <p>. " But why do I mention these things ? To shew that this was <lb/>
            the mode of philosophy among the ancients, a certain laconic <lb/>
            brevity of diction. Amongst the rest this particular saying of <lb/>
            Pittacus was noised abroad, being extolled by the wise men: <lb/>
            ‘It is difficult to be good.' Simonides, therefore, as being am­ <lb/>
            bitious of a reputation for wisdom, knew that if he could over­ <lb/>
            throw this saying, as if it were a famous wrestler, and could, <lb/>
            master it, he himself would become famous amongst the men of <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            his own time. In opposition to this sentence, therefore, and <lb/>
            with this object. designing to put it down, he composed the whole <lb/>
            of this ode, as it appears to me.</p>
          <p>83. " Let all of us, however, examine it together, to see <lb/>
            whether what I say is true. For the very commencement of <lb/>
            the ode would appear to be insane, if, wishing to say that it is <lb/>
            difficult to become a good man, he had afterwards inserted the <lb/>
            particle 'indeed.' For this appears to have been inserted for <lb/>
            no purpose whatever, unless we suppose that Simonides is speak­ <lb/>
            ing as if he were quarrelling with the saying of Pittacus ; and <lb/>
            that when Pittacus says, that' it is difficult to be good,' he, <lb/>
            disputing this, says, ' Not so,' but it is indeed difficult, Pittacus, <lb/>
            to become good in very truth; not truly good.' For he does <lb/>
            not use the word truly in this way, as if some men were truly <lb/>
            good, and others good indeed, but not truly so, for this would <lb/>
            have been silly, and not worthy of Simonides ; but it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to transpose the word ' truly' in the ode, understanding <lb/>
            the saying of Pittacus somewhat as follows, as if we were to <lb/>
            make Pittacus himself speak, and Simonides answer, saying, <lb/>
            ‘0 men, it is difficult to be good,' but the latter answers, ‘Pit­ <lb/>
            tacus, your assertion is not true : for not to be, but to become <lb/>
            indeed a good man, square as to one's hands and feet, and <lb/>
            mind. fashioned without blame, is truly difficult.' Thus it ap­ <lb/>
            pears that the particle ' indeed' is inserted with good reason, <lb/>
            and that the word ' truly' is rightly placed at the end. And all <lb/>
            that follows bears witness to this, that such is the meaning. <lb/>
            84. Many things might be said to. prove with respect to each <lb/>
            several passage in this ode, that it is well composed ; for it is <lb/>
            Aery elegant and elaborate; but it would be too long to go <lb/>
            through the whole of it in this way. Let us then consider its <lb/>
            whole outline and design, which is nothing else than a refuta­ <lb/>
            tion of the saying of Pittacus throughout the ode. For <lb/>
            he says shortly after this, proceeding as if he would say, to be­ <lb/>
            come a good man is truly difficult, it is possible however for a <lb/>
            certain time : but having become to continue in this condition, <lb/>
            and to be a good man, as you say, Pittacus, is impossible and <lb/>
            more than human, but God alone possesses this privilege; <lb/>
            ‘but it cannot be that a man should be otherwise than evil, <lb/>
            whomsoever irresistible calamity prostrates.' 85. Whom, then, <lb/>
            does irresistible calamity prostrate in the command of a ship ? <lb/>
            Clearly not a private person, for the private person is always <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            prostrate ; as therefore no one can throw down a man who is <lb/>
            lying on the ground, but sometimes one may throw down one <lb/>
            who is standing upright, so as to make him lie on the ground, <lb/>
            but not one already lying there, so an irresistible calamity may <lb/>
            sometimes prostrate a skilful man, but never one who is always <lb/>
            unskilful; and a violent storm bursting on a pilot may make <lb/>
            his skill of no avail, and a bad season befalling a farmer may <lb/>
            make his skill of no avail, and the same with a physician: for it <lb/>
            befals a good man to become evil, as is also testified by an­ <lb/>
            other poet, who says, ‘A good man is sometimes evil, and some­ <lb/>
            times good:' but it does not befal the evil to become so, but <lb/>
            he must needs always be so. So that when an irresistible <lb/>
            calamity prostrates a skilful, wise, and good man, it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible for him not to be evil; but you say, Pittacus, that it is <lb/>
            difficult to be good; but the difficulty is to become good, <lb/>
            though it is possible, but impossible to be so. 86. ' For every <lb/>
            man who fares well is good, but evil if he fares ill.' What then <lb/>
            is faring well with respect to literature ? and what makes a <lb/>
            man good in literature ? Clearly the being instructed in it. <lb/>
            What faring well makes a good physician ? Clearly the being <lb/>
            instructed in the art of curing the sick. ' And evil if he fares <lb/>
            ill.' Who then would become an evil physician? Clearly he <lb/>
            to whom it happens first to be a physician, and then a good <lb/>
            physician; for he may become an evil physician. But we who <lb/>
            are ignorant of the medical art, can never by faring ill become <lb/>
            either physicians, or builders, or any thing else of the kind ; <lb/>
            but whoever cannot become a physician by faring ill, clearly <lb/>
            cannot become an evil physician. Thus also a good man may <lb/>
            sometime or other become evil, either from length of time, or <lb/>
            labour, or disease, or some other accident, for this alone is a <lb/>
            faring ill, to be deprived of knowledge, but the evil man can <lb/>
            never become evil, for he is always so; but if he is to become <lb/>
            evil, it is necessary for him first to become good. So that this <lb/>
            part of the ode tends to this, that it is not possible to be a good <lb/>
            man, so as to continue good ; but that it is possible to become <lb/>
            good, and for the same person to become evil: ' and they are <lb/>
            for the longest time best whom the gods love.'</p>
          <p>87. " All these things therefore are said against Pittacus, <lb/>
            and the following parts of the ode shew this still more clearly: <lb/>
            For he says, ' Wherefore I shall never, searching for that which <lb/>
            cannot be, throw away a portion of my life on an empty im­ <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            practicable hope, searching for an all-blameless man among <lb/>
            us who feed on the fruits of the wide earth. When I have <lb/>
            found one, I will inform you;' he adds. So vehemently, and <lb/>
            through the whole of the ode, does he attack the saying of Pit­ <lb/>
            tacus. I But I praise and willingly love all who do nothing <lb/>
            base ; but with necessity not even gods contend.' And this is <lb/>
            spoken against that same saying. For Simonides was not so <lb/>
            ill informed as to say that he praised those who did no evil <lb/>
            willingly, as if there were some who did evil willingly. For I <lb/>
            am pretty much of this opinion, that no wise man thinks that <lb/>
            any man errs willingly, nor willingly commits base and evil <lb/>
            actions, but they well know that all those who do base and evil <lb/>
            things, do them unwillingly. 88. Moreover Simonides does <lb/>
            not say, that he praises those who do not willingly do evil, but <lb/>
            lie uses this word ' willingly' of - himself. For he thought that <lb/>
            a good and upright man is frequently compelled to love and <lb/>
            praise a certain person; for instance, it often happens to a man <lb/>
            to have a perverse mother or father, or country, or something <lb/>
            else of the kind. Now depraved men, when any such thing <lb/>
            happens to them, are as it were glad to see it, and blaming make <lb/>
            known and divulge the depravity of their parents or country, <lb/>
            that when they neglect them, men may not accuse or reproach <lb/>
            them for their neglect, so that they blame them still more than <lb/>
            they deserve, and add voluntary to necessary enmity. But the <lb/>
            good conceal the faults and compel themselves to praise, and <lb/>
            if they are angry with their parents or country from having been <lb/>
            injured by them, they pacify themselves and become reconciled, <lb/>
            compelling themselves to love and praise their own connections. <lb/>
            And I think Simonides also himself frequently considered it <lb/>
            right to praise and extol a tyrant, or some one else of the kind, <lb/>
            not willingly, but by compulsion. 89. This, too, he says to <lb/>
            Pittacus; I, Pittacus, do not blame you on this account, because <lb/>
            I am fond of blaming; for ' it is enough for me if a man is not <lb/>
            evil or too helpless, a sane man, acquainted with justice that <lb/>
            benefits the state; I will not censure him, for I am not a lover <lb/>
            of censure;, for the race of fools is infinite ;’ so that he who <lb/>
            delights in blaming may satiate himself in censuring them. <lb/>
            All things'are beautiful with which base things are not <lb/>
            mingled.' His meaning in this, is not as if he had said, all <lb/>
            things are white with which black is not mingled, for this <lb/>
            -would be in many ways ridiculous, but that he himself admits <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            of a mean, so as not to blame it. ' And I do not seek,' he <lb/>
            adds, ' an all-blameless man, among us who feed on the fruits <lb/>
            of the wide earth ; when I have found him, I will inform you.' <lb/>
            For this reason, therefore, I shall praise no one, but it is enough <lb/>
            for me if a man be moderate, and does no evil, for I ' love and <lb/>
            praise all.' Here too he uses the language of the Mitylenæans, <lb/>
            as speaking to Pittacus, ' I praise and love all willingly,' (here <lb/>
            it is necessary after ' willingly' to distinguish in the pronunci­ <lb/>
            ation,) ' who do nothing base,' but there are some whom I <lb/>
            praise and love unwillingly. Thee therefore, Pittacus, if thou <lb/>
            hadst spoken with moderate reason and truth, I should never <lb/>
            have blamed, but now, since you lie excessively and in matters <lb/>
            of the greatest moment, while you think you are speaking the <lb/>
            truth, for this reason I blame you. 90. Such appears to me. <lb/>
            Prodicus and Protagoras," said I, " to have been the design of <lb/>
            Simonides in the composition of this ode."</p>
          <p>Upon this Hippias said, " You seem to me, Socrates, to <lb/>
            have given a good explanation of this ode, and I too," he <lb/>
            added, " have some pretty good remarks to make on it, which <lb/>
            I will communicate to you, if you please."</p>
          <p>. “Do so, Hippias," said Alcibiades, " but at another time; <lb/>
            but now it is right to carry out the agreement which Prota­ <lb/>
            goras and Socrates made with each other, and, if Protagoras <lb/>
            wishes to ask any more questions, for Socrates to answer, but <lb/>
            if he wishes to answer Socrates, then for the latter to ask <lb/>
            questions."</p>
          <p>91. Then I said, " I leave it to Protagoras to choose which­ <lb/>
            ever is more agreeable to him ; but if he is willing, let us have <lb/>
            done with odes and poems, but I would gladly, Protagoras, <lb/>
            examine with you and come to a conclusion on the subject <lb/>
            about which I first questioned you. For a discussion about <lb/>
            poetry appears to me very like the festivities of mean and un­ <lb/>
            educated men; for they, through not being able to converse <lb/>
            with one another over their cups, with their own voices and <lb/>
            their own words, in consequence of deficiency of education, <lb/>
            enhance the pay of female flute-players, and hiring at a.great <lb/>
            price the foreign voices of flutes, converse with each other <lb/>
            through their voices. But when worthy, good, and well- <lb/>
            educated men meet together at a banquet you will see neither <lb/>
            flute-playing women, nor dancing-girls, nor harpists, but you <lb/>
            will find that they are able to converse with themselves, with­ <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            out these trifles and pastimes, by means of their own voices, <lb/>
            both speaking and listening to each other in turn, in good <lb/>
            order, even though they have drunk a great deal of wine. 92. <lb/>
            In like manner, such meetings as the present, when they are <lb/>
            composed of such men as most of us profess ourselves to be, <lb/>
            have no need of foreign voices, or of poets, of whom it is not <lb/>
            possible to ask the meaning of what they say, and most of <lb/>
            those who introduce them in their arguments say that the <lb/>
            poet means some one thing and some another, disputing about <lb/>
            a matter which they can never determine. But they dismiss <lb/>
            such topics of conversation as these, and converse with each <lb/>
            other through their own resources, and in their discussions <lb/>
            receive and give proof of each other's capacity. It appears to <lb/>
            me, that you and I ought rather to imitate such persons as <lb/>
            these, and setting aside the poets should discourse with each <lb/>
            other, from our own resources, and receive proof of the truth <lb/>
            and of ourselves. And if you still wish to question me, I am <lb/>
            ready to offer myself to answer you; but if you do not wish it, <lb/>
            do you offer yourself to me, so that we may bring to a conclu­ <lb/>
            sion the subject that we broke off in the middle."</p>
          <p>93. On my saying these and other things of the same kind, <lb/>
            Protagoras did not distinctly declare which of the two he <lb/>
            would do. Alcibiades, therefore, looking to Callias, said, <lb/>
            " Callias, does Protagoras appear to you to act rightly now, in <lb/>
            not being willing to declare whether he will answer or not ? <lb/>
            For to me he does not. But let him either continue the con­ <lb/>
            versation, or say that he is not willing to continue it, that we <lb/>
            may know this from him, and that Socrates may converse with <lb/>
            some one else, or whoever else wishes to do so with some <lb/>
            other."</p>
          <p>And Protagoras, being ashamed, as it seemed to me, when <lb/>
            Alcibiades spoke thus and Callias and nearly all who were <lb/>
            present entreated him, was with great difficulty prevailed on <lb/>
            to renew the conversation and bade me question him, for that <lb/>
            he would answer.</p>
          <p>94. I then said to him, "Protagoras, think not that I <lb/>
            converse with you with any other design, than to examine <lb/>
            thoroughly into things about which I am continually in doubt. <lb/>
            For I think that Homer1 speaks very much to the purpose, <lb/>
            when he says, 'When two come together, one apprehends <note type="footnote"> 1 Iliad x. 224. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            before the other.' For all of us men are thus more prompt in <lb/>
            every deed, and word, and thought, but when any one ap­ <lb/>
            prehends alone m, he immediately goes about and searches for <lb/>
            some one to whom he may communicate it, and with whom he <lb/>
            may establish it, until he finds him. So I too, for this reason, <lb/>
            am better pleased to converse with you than with any one else, <lb/>
            thinking that you are best able to investigate both other sub­ <lb/>
            jects which a good man is likely to examine into, and especially <lb/>
            virtue. For who else can do it but you ? Since you not only <lb/>
            think yourself to be a good and worthy man, as some others <lb/>
            also are virtuous, but are not able to make others so; you <lb/>
            however are both good yourself, and are able to make others <lb/>
            good, and you have such confidence in yourself, that while <lb/>
            others conceal this art, you openly proclaim yourself to all the <lb/>
            Greeks designating yourself a sophist, publishing yourself as a <lb/>
            professor of erudition and virtue, and you are the first that has <lb/>
            thought fit to receive pay for this. 95. How then, is it not <lb/>
            right to call upon you to the examination of these matters, <lb/>
            and to question and communicate, with you respecting them ? <lb/>
            It cannot be otherwise. Now therefore I am desirous that <lb/>
            the questions which I first asked you on these subjects, should, <lb/>
            from the commencement, be partly called to mind by you, and <lb/>
            partly to consider them with you. The question, I think, was <lb/>
            this; whether these, wisdom, temperance, courage, justice, and <lb/>
            holiness, which are five names, belong to one thing, or whether <lb/>
            a certain peculiar essence is attached to each of these names, <lb/>
            and each thing has its own function, and no one of them is the <lb/>
            same as any other ? You said, then, that these were not names <lb/>
            belonging to one thing, but that each of these names was <lb/>
            applied to a distinct thing, and that all these are parts of virtue, <lb/>
            not in the same manner as the parts of gold are similar to each <lb/>
            other, and to the whole of which they are parts, but just as <lb/>
            the parts of the face are dissimilar to the whole of which they <lb/>
            are parts, and to each other, each possessing its peculiar <lb/>
            function. If these things still appear to you as they did then, <lb/>
            say so; if otherwise, explain the difference, since I shall not <lb/>
            think you in any way accountable, if you happen to speak <lb/>
            differently; for I should not wonder if you said these things <lb/>
            before for the purpose of trying me."</p>
          <p>96. " But I," he said, " tell you, Socrates, that all these are <note type="footnote"> m Iliad x. 225. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            parts of virtue, and'four of them arevery like each other, but <lb/>
            courage is very different from all these. And thus you will <lb/>
            know that I speak the truth; for you will. find many men <lb/>
            who are most unjust, most unholy, most intemperate, and most <lb/>
            ignorant, yet eminently courageous."</p>
          <p>" Hold," said I, " for what you say is worth examining. <lb/>
            Do you mean that courageous men are daring, or some thing <lb/>
            else ?"</p>
          <p>" I do,", he replied, " and bold to rush headlong on dangers <lb/>
            which most men are afraid to encounter."</p>
          <p>" Come then ; do you say, that virtue is something beautiful ? <lb/>
            and as being a beautiful thing do you offer to teach it?"</p>
          <p>“Most beautiful," he replied, " unless I am out of my <lb/>
            senses."</p>
          <p>97. " Whether then," said I, " is one part of it base, and <lb/>
            another beautiful, or, is. it all beautiful ?"</p>
          <p>" All beautiful, surely, in the highest degree."</p>
          <p>" Do you know, then, who boldly dive into wells ?"</p>
          <p>" I do, divers." '</p>
          <p>“Whether because they know how to do it, or for some <lb/>
            other reason ?"</p>
          <p>“Because they know how to do it.”</p>
          <p>" But who are they that fight boldly on horseback ? whether <lb/>
            good riders or bad ?"</p>
          <p>" Good riders."</p>
          <p>., And who with targets? those that are targeteers, or those <lb/>
            that are not ?"</p>
          <p>" Those that are targeteers. And in every thing else," said <lb/>
            he, " if this is what you are enquiring about, you will find that <lb/>
            those who are skilled, are bolder than the unskilled, and the <lb/>
            same men, after they have learnt are bolder than they were <lb/>
            before they learnt."</p>
          <p>98. " But did you ever see any," said I, " who, though un­ <lb/>
            skilled in all these things, were yet bold with respect to each <lb/>
            of them ?"</p>
          <p>" I haye," he replied, " and very bold."</p>
          <p>" Are those bold persons, then, courageous also ?”</p>
          <p>" If they were," he replied, " courage would be a base thing; <lb/>
            for these men are mad."</p>
          <p>" How then," I asked, " do you describe the courageous? <lb/>
            did you not say that they are the bold ?*'</p><pb n="281"/>
            
          <p>. “And I say so now," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Do not those then," I said, " who are thus bold appear to <lb/>
            be not courageous, but mad? And again, in the former in­ <lb/>
            stances, the wise are the boldest, and being the boldest, are <lb/>
            most courageous? And according to this reasoning, will not <lb/>
            wisdom be courage ?"</p>
          <p>99. " You do not rightly remember, Socrates," said he," what <lb/>
            I said, and what answer I gave you? For when asked by you <lb/>
            if the courageous were bold, I admitted that they were; but <lb/>
            I was not asked, whether the bold also were courageous; for <lb/>
            if you had asked me this, I should have said not all. But <lb/>
            that the courageous are bold, which was my admission, you <lb/>
            have no where shewn that I made that admission improperly. <lb/>
            In the next place, you shew that men, who have skill, surpass <lb/>
            themselves in boldness, and others who are unskilled, and from <lb/>
            this, you conclude that courage and wisdom are the same. By. <lb/>
            proceeding in this way, you might also come to the conclusion <lb/>
            that strength is wisdom. For, first of all, if proceeding thus <lb/>
            you should ask me, whether the strong are powerful, I should <lb/>
            say they are; and in the next place, whether those who are <lb/>
            skilled in wrestling are more powerful than those who are un­ <lb/>
            skilled, and they than themselves, after they have learnt, than <lb/>
            before they learnt, I should say they are; 100. and on my <lb/>
            admitting this, by using the same argument, you might allege, <lb/>
            that according to my own admission, wisdom is strength; I <lb/>
            however, do not here or any where admit that the powerful <lb/>
            are strong, but I do that the strong are powerful, for power <lb/>
            and strength are not the same; but the one arises from skill, <lb/>
            and from madness too, and passion, but strength from nature, <lb/>
            and good nurture of the body. In like manner, boldness and <lb/>
            courage are not the same; so that it happens that the coura­ <lb/>
            geous are bold, but the bold are not all courageous. For <lb/>
            boldness, like power, arises in men from skill, and from <lb/>
            passion too and madness, but courage arises from nature, and <lb/>
            the good culture of the soul."</p>
          <p>101. " Do you allow, Protagoras," said I, that some men <lb/>
            live well, and others ill ?"</p>
          <p>He said he did.</p>
          <p>" Does a man, then, appear to you to live well, if he lives in <lb/>
            grief and pain ?"</p>
          <p>He said not.</p><pb n="282"/>
            
          <p>" But what, if he should die after having passed his life <lb/>
            pleasantly, would he not in that case appear to you to have <lb/>
            lived well ?"</p>
          <p>" To me he would," said he.</p>
          <p>" To live pleasantly, then, is a good, but unpleasantly an <lb/>
            evil thing."</p>
          <p>" Yes," he said, " if he has lived taking pleasure in honest <lb/>
            things."</p>
          <p>" What then, Protagoras, do you, like the multitude, call <lb/>
            some pleasant things evil, and some painful things good? I <lb/>
            mean, as far as they are pleasant are they not so far good, un­ <lb/>
            less something else results from them? And again, in the <lb/>
            same way with regard to things painful; are they not evil so <lb/>
            far as they are painful ?"</p>
          <p>“I know not, Socrates," he replied, " whether I should <lb/>
            answer you as absolutely as you ask me, that pleasant things <lb/>
            are all good, and painful things all evil; but it appears to me, <lb/>
            not only with reference to the present answer, but also with <lb/>
            reference to all the rest of my life, to be more safe to answer, <lb/>
            that there are some pleasant things which are not good, and <lb/>
            again, that there are some painful things which are not evil, <lb/>
            and there are some which are a third sort, and which are <lb/>
            neither the one nor the other, neither good or evil."</p>
          <p>102. But do you not call those things pleasant," I said, <lb/>
            “which partake of pleasure, or occasion pleasure ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," said he.</p>
          <p>" I ask this, then, whether they are not good, so far as they <lb/>
            are pleasant, meaning to ask whether pleasure itself is not a <lb/>
            good thing."</p>
          <p>“As you frequently say, Socrates," he replied, " we must <lb/>
            examine this, and if the examination shall appear to be con­ <lb/>
            nected with our subject, and the same thing shall appear to be <lb/>
            both pleasant and good, we must grant it; but if not, we must <lb/>
            controvert it."</p>
          <p>" Whether, then," said I, " do you wish to take the lead in <lb/>
            the examination, or shall I ?"</p>
          <p>" You ought to take the lead," he replied, " for you began <lb/>
            the discussion."</p>
          <p>103. " Do you think, then," said I, " that it will become clear <lb/>
            to us in the following manner? just as if any one, examining a <lb/>
            man from his form either with reference to his health, or any other <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            operations of his body, on beholding his face and hands, should <lb/>
            say, Come, strip, and shew me your breast and back, that I may <lb/>
            examine you more closely; so I require something of the kind <lb/>
            in reference to the present enquiry; perceiving that you are so <lb/>
            affected as you say you are, with reference to the good and the <lb/>
            pleasant, I have need to say some such thing as this, Come, <lb/>
            Protagoras, lay your mind open to me on this point, how are <lb/>
            you affected with respect to knowledge? Does it appear to <lb/>
            you as it does to most men, or otherwise ? Most men think of <lb/>
            knowledge in some such way as this; that it is not a strong, <lb/>
            nor a guiding, nor a governing thing; nor do they conceive of <lb/>
            it as being any thing of the kind; but though knowledge is <lb/>
            often found in a man, they do not think that knowledge go­ <lb/>
            verns him, but something else, at one time passion, at another <lb/>
            pleasure, at another pain, sometimes love, and frequently fear, <lb/>
            absolutely forming their conceptions of knowledge, as of a <lb/>
            slave dragged about by all the rest. Is such your opinion of it, <lb/>
            or do you think that knowledge is a noble thing, and able to <lb/>
            govern man, and that if a man knows good and evil he can <lb/>
            never be overcome by any thing, so as to do any thing else <lb/>
            than what knowledge bids him, and that wisdom is sufficient <lb/>
            to protect mankind ?"</p>
          <p>104. "It appears to me," he replied, " as you say, Socrates: <lb/>
            and moreover, if for any man, it would be disgraceful for me <lb/>
            not to assert that wisdom and knowledge are the most power­ <lb/>
            ful of all human things."</p>
          <p>" You say well and with truth," I replied. " You are <lb/>
            aware, however, that most men do not believe you and me, <lb/>
            but say that many who know what is best are unwilling to do <lb/>
            it, when it is in their power, but do other things. And all of <lb/>
            whom I have asked what is the cause of this, have replied, that <lb/>
            being overcome by pleasure, or mastered by pain, or some one <lb/>
            of the things which I have just now mentioned, those who do <lb/>
            these things are led to do them."</p>
          <p>"I think, Socrates," he remarked, " that men say many <lb/>
            other things incorrectly."</p>
          <p>" Come then, join me in endeavouring to persuade men, and <lb/>
            to teach them what that affection of theirs is which they call <lb/>
            being overcome by pleasures, and on that account not doing <lb/>
            what is best, though they know it. For, perhaps, on our say­ <lb/>
            ing, ' You do not speak correctly, my friends, but are deceived,' <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            they would ask us, ‘Protagoras and Socrates, if this affection <lb/>
            is not the being overcome by pleasure, what is it then, and <lb/>
            what do you say it is, tell us ?'"</p>
          <p>&lt; " But why, Socrates, need we consider the opinion of the <lb/>
            generality of men, who say any thing that occurs to them ?"</p>
          <p>105. "I think," said I, " that this will be of some service to <lb/>
            us towards discovering with respect to courage how it is re­ <lb/>
            lated to the other parts of virtue. If, therefore, you are will­ <lb/>
            ing to abide by what we just now agreed on, that I should <lb/>
            take the lead, follow me where I think the matter will become <lb/>
            exceedingly clear; but if you had rather not, I will dismiss it, <lb/>
            if you please."</p>
          <p>" You say rightly,” he replied; " finish then, as you have <lb/>
            begun."</p>
          <p>" Again, then," said I, " if they were to ask us, ' What do <lb/>
            you say this is, which we call being overcome by pleasures ?’ <lb/>
            I, for my part, should answer them as follows: ' Hear then, <lb/>
            for Protagoras and I will endeavour to tell you. Do you not say, <lb/>
            friends, that this happens to you under the following circum­ <lb/>
            stances ? for instance, being often mastered by meats and <lb/>
            drinks, and the delights of love, which are pleasant things, <lb/>
            though you know that they are baneful, yet do you not indulge <lb/>
            in them?' They would say that such is the case. 106. You <lb/>
            and I should then ask them again, ' In what respect do you <lb/>
            say that they are baneful ? Is it because they afford pleasure, <lb/>
            and each of them is pleasant, for the moment ? or because they <lb/>
            occasion diseases for the future, and make way for poverty, <lb/>
            and many other things of the kind ? or if they make way for <lb/>
            none of these things for the future, but only occasion a man to <lb/>
            rejoice, are they nevertheless evil, because they make a man <lb/>
            rejoice in any way whatever?' Can we suppose, Protagoras, <lb/>
            that they will give any other answer than that they are not <lb/>
            evil from the momentary pleasure which they produce, but on <lb/>
            account of the after results, diseases and other things ?”</p>
          <p>"I think," said Protagoras, “thatthe many would answer thus."</p>
          <p>" ' Do they not, then, by occasioning diseases, occasion pain, <lb/>
            and by occasioning poverty, occasion pain ?' They would ad­ <lb/>
            mit this, I think."</p>
          <p>Protagoras assented.</p>
          <p>107. ‘‘‘Does it not appear to you then, my friends, as Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras and I say, that these things are evil, for no other rea­ <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            son than because they end in pain, and deprive you of other <lb/>
            pleasures ?' Would they admit this ?"</p>
          <p>We both assented.</p>
          <p>" If, again, we should reverse the question, ' In saying, <lb/>
            friends, that good things are painful, do you not mean such <lb/>
            things as gymnastic exercises, military service, and treatment <lb/>
            of diseases by physicians, by cautery, the knife, physic, and <lb/>
            starving, that these things are good, but painful ?' They would <lb/>
            say they did."</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>"' Whether, then, do you call them good, because, at the <lb/>
            moment, they give extreme pain and torture ; or because after­ <lb/>
            wards health results from them, and a good habit of body, and <lb/>
            the safety of cities, and dominion over others, and wealth?' <lb/>
            They would say, I think, because of the latter."</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>108. "' But are these things good for any other reason than <lb/>
            because they end in pleasures, and deliverance from and pre­ <lb/>
            vention of pains ? or can you mention any other end, to which <lb/>
            you look when you call them good, except pleasures and pains ?' <lb/>
            They would say not, I think."</p>
          <p>" I think so too," said Protagoras.</p>
          <p>"' Do you not, then, pursue pleasure as being good, and <lb/>
            avoid pain as evil ?'"</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>"' This, then, you esteem to be evil, pain, and pleasure, <lb/>
            good, since you say that enjoyment, itself is then evil when it <lb/>
            deprives of greater pleasures than those it brings with it, or <lb/>
            when it makes way for pains greater than the pleasures con­ <lb/>
            tained in it: for if you call enjoyment itself evil on any other <lb/>
            account, and looking to any other end, you would be able to <lb/>
            tell us; but you cannot.' "</p>
          <p>" Nor do I think they can," said Protagoras.</p>
          <p>109. " Again, is not the case precisely the same with re­ <lb/>
            spect to pain itself? do, you not then call pain itself a good <lb/>
            when it delivers from greater pains than those contained In it, <lb/>
            or makes way for pleasures greater than the pains ? for if you <lb/>
            look to any other end than to that which I mention, when you <lb/>
            call pain itself a good, you can tell us; but you cannot."</p>
          <p>" You speak truly," said Protagoras.</p>
          <p>" Again, therefore," said I, "if you should, ask me, my <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            friends, ' Why in the world do you speak so much and so fre­ <lb/>
            quently about this,' 'Pardon me,' I should say. For, in the <lb/>
            first place, it is not easy to prove what this is which you call <lb/>
            being overcome by pleasures; and, in the next place, the <lb/>
            whole proof depends on this. But even now you are at liberty <lb/>
            to retract, if you are able to say that good is any thing else <lb/>
            than pleasure, or evil any thing else than pain; or is it enough <lb/>
            for you to pass your life pleasantly without pain? If it is <lb/>
            enough, and you cannot mention any thing else that is good or <lb/>
            evil, which does not end in these, hear what follows : 110. for <lb/>
            I say to you, that if this be the case, the assertion is ridiculous, <lb/>
            when you say that frequently, a man who knows that evil <lb/>
            things are evil, nevertheless does them, when it is in his power <lb/>
            not to do them, in consequence of being led away and over­ <lb/>
            powered by pleasures; and again, when you say that a man <lb/>
            who knows what is good, is not willing to do it in consequence <lb/>
            of immediate pleasures, by which he is overcome. For it <lb/>
            will be manifest that these things are ridiculous, if we do not <lb/>
            make use of many names, such as pleasant and painful, good <lb/>
            and evil, but, since these things appear to be two, call them <lb/>
            also by two names, first, good and evil, next, pleasant and <lb/>
            painful. Having settled this, let us say, that a man knowing <lb/>
            evil to. be evil, nevertheless does it. If, then, any one should <lb/>
            ask us, ' why ?' we shall answer, ' because he is overcome.' <lb/>
            , By what ?' he will ask us. But we are no longer at liberty <lb/>
            to say, ' by pleasure ;' for it has assumed another name instead <lb/>
            of pleasure, namely, good. We must, however, answer him, <lb/>
            and say, ' because he is overcome.' ' By what ?' he will ask. <lb/>
            ' By good,' we shall answer, by Jupiter. 111. Now if he who <lb/>
            questions should happen to be somewhat insolent, he will <lb/>
            laugh at us and say, ' A ridiculous thing is this you mention, <lb/>
            if a man does evil, knowing that it is evil, when he ought not <lb/>
            to do it, because he is overcome by good.' ' Is it,' he will ask, <lb/>
            ' because the good is not worthy to overcome the evil in you, <lb/>
            or because it is worthy ?' We shall clearly say in answer, that <lb/>
            it is because it is not worthy; for otherwise he would not err <lb/>
            whom we say is overcome by pleasures. But perhaps he will <lb/>
            ask, ' in what respect are good things unworthy to overcome <lb/>
            the evil, or evil to overcome the good ? Is it in any other <lb/>
            respect than that the one is greater and the other less ? or that <lb/>
            the one is more, and the other fewer in number ?' We shall <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            not be able to say any thing else than this. I It is clear then,' he <lb/>
            will say, ' that by being overcome you mean to receive greater <lb/>
            evil instead of less good.' And thus much for this part of the <lb/>
            question.</p>
          <p>" Let us now change the names, and again apply the words <lb/>
            pleasant and painful to these same things, and let us say, that a <lb/>
            man does things, we before called them evil, but let us now <lb/>
            call them painful, knowing that they are painful, being over­ <lb/>
            come by pleasant things, clearly such as are unworthy to pre­ <lb/>
            vail. And what other value is there of pleasure in comparison <lb/>
            with pain, except that of excess or defect in one or the other ? <lb/>
            that is, of their being greater or less, more or fewer in number, <lb/>
            stronger or weaker than one another. 112. For if any one <lb/>
            should say, ' But Socrates, immediate pleasure is very different <lb/>
            from future pleasure or pain,' ' Is it,' I should ask, ' in any. <lb/>
            thing else than in pleasure and pain ?' for it cannot differ in <lb/>
            any thing else. But like a man expert at weighing, having <lb/>
            put together the pleasant things, and having put together the <lb/>
            painful, and having placed those which are near, and those <lb/>
            which are remote, in the scales, say which are the more numer­ <lb/>
            ous. For if you weigh pleasures with pleasures, the greater <lb/>
            and more numerous are always to be chosen, and if pains with <lb/>
            pains, the less and the fewer in number. But if you weigh <lb/>
            pleasures with pains, if the pains are exceeded by the pleasures, <lb/>
            whether those that are near by those that are remote, or those <lb/>
            that are remote by those that are near, the same course must <lb/>
            ,-be pursued, in whichever the excess is; but if the pleasures <lb/>
            are exceeded by the pains, it must not be pursued. ' Can these <lb/>
            things be settled in any other way, my friends,' I should ask ? <lb/>
            113. I know that they could not mention any other."</p>
          <p>It seemed so to him likewise.</p>
          <p>" Since then, this is the case, I shall say I Answer me this, do <lb/>
            the same magnitudes appear to your sight greater when near, <lb/>
            and less when at a distance, or not ?' They will say they do. <lb/>
            ' And things bulky, and things numerous, In like manner ? and <lb/>
            are not equal sounds greater when near, but less when at <lb/>
            a distance?' They would say they are. If then, our well­ <lb/>
            being consisted in this, in making and choosing great masses, <lb/>
            but in avoiding and not making little ones, what means of <lb/>
            safety should we seem to have in life ? Would it be the art of <lb/>
            mensuration, or the faculty of judging by appearances ? or <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            would the latter lead us into error, and often cause us to vary <lb/>
            in our choice of the same thing, now choosing one and now <lb/>
            another, and to repent both in our actions and our selections <lb/>
            of things great and little, but would the art of mensuration do <lb/>
            away with this outward show, and making manifest the truth, <lb/>
            cause the soul to be at ease, abiding in the truth, and preserve <lb/>
            our life ?' Would the men upon this admit that the art of men­ <lb/>
            suration preserves us, or some other art ?"</p>
          <p>114. " The art of mensuration," he admitted.</p>
          <p>"1 But what, if the safety of our life consisted in the choice of <lb/>
            even and odd, when more ought properly to be chosen, and <lb/>
            when less, each with reference to itself, or one with reference <lb/>
            to the other, whether they might be near or distant, what, in <lb/>
            this case, would preserve our life ? Would it not be a science ? <lb/>
            and would it not be one of mensuration, since it is an art of ex­ <lb/>
            cess and defect? But since it has relation to even and odd, <lb/>
            can it be any other than arithmetic ?' Would the men grant <lb/>
            us this, or not ?"</p>
          <p>It appeared also to Protagoras that they would.</p>
          <p>"' Be it so, my friends; but since the safety of our life has <lb/>
            appeared to consist in the right choice of pleasure and pain, <lb/>
            and of more and fewer, greater and smaller, more distant and <lb/>
            nearer; does it not first of all appear to be an art of mensura­ <lb/>
            tion, since it is a consideration of excess and defect and equality <lb/>
            of these with respect to each other ?' ' Necessarily so.' ' But <lb/>
            since it has to do with mensuration, it must of necessity be an <lb/>
            art and a science.' 115. They will assent to this. What then <lb/>
            this art and science may be, we will consider hereafter; but <lb/>
            that it is a science is sufficient for the proof of that which Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras and I had to make good in answer to the question you <lb/>
            asked is. You asked, if you remember, when we agreed with <lb/>
            each other that nothing is more powerful than knowledge, but <lb/>
            that it always gets the mastery, wherever it may be, both of <lb/>
            pleasure and every thing else ; but you said that pleasure often <lb/>
            gets the mastery, even of a man possessed of knowledge, and <lb/>
            when we did not agree with you, you thereupon asked us, <lb/>
            Protagoras and Socrates, if this affection is not the being over­ <lb/>
            come by pleasure, what is it. then, and what do you say it is ? <lb/>
            tell us.' 116. If, then, we had immediately said to you, that <lb/>
            it is ignorance, you would- have laughed at us. But now if you <lb/>
            laugh at us, you will also laugh at yourselves. For you have ad­ <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            mitted that they err through want of knowledge, who err in <lb/>
            the choice of pleasures and pains; but these are things good <lb/>
            and evil; and not only through want of knowledge, but as you <lb/>
            afterwards further admitted, a knowledge of mensuration. Now <lb/>
            an erroneous action done without knowledge, as you must your­ <lb/>
            selves know, is done through ignorance: so that to be over­ <lb/>
            come by pleasure is the greatest ignorance; of which Protago­ <lb/>
            ras here says he is a physician, and so do Prodicus and Hippias. <lb/>
            But you, because you think it is something else than ignorance, <lb/>
            neither go yourselves, nor send your children to the teachers <lb/>
            of these things, the sophists, as if this knowledge could not <lb/>
            be taught, but by saving your money, and not giving it to these <lb/>
            men, you fare badly, both in private and public. 117. Such <lb/>
            is the answer we should give to the many. But I ask you, <lb/>
            Hippias and Prodicus, as well as Protagoras, for let the conver­ <lb/>
            sation be common to you all, whether I appear to you to speak <lb/>
            the truth, or to speak falsely ?"</p>
          <p>What had been said appeared to all to be eminently true.</p>
          <p>" You admit, then," said I, " that the pleasant is good, but the <lb/>
            painful evil. But I deprecate Prodicus's verbal distinctions : <lb/>
            for whether you call it pleasant, or delightful, or enjoyable, or <lb/>
            from whatever derivation or in whatever way you please to <lb/>
            denominate such things, most excellent Prodicus, use your <lb/>
            own word and answer what I wish."</p>
          <p>118. Prodicus, therefore, laughing, agreed with me, as did the <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>" But what, my friends," I continued, " do you say to this ? <lb/>
            All actions that tend to this, that we may live without pain and <lb/>
            pleasantly, are they not beautiful ? and is not a beautiful action <lb/>
            good and profitable ?"</p>
          <p>They agreed.</p>
          <p>" If then," I said, " the pleasant is good, no one who either <lb/>
            knows or thinks that other things are better than what he is <lb/>
            doing, and that they are possible, still continues to do the same, <lb/>
            when it is in his power to do the better; nor is to be over­ <lb/>
            come by one's-self any thing else than ignorance, nor to be <lb/>
            master of one's-self any thing else than wisdom."</p>
          <p>All agreed to this.</p>
          <p>" What then ? Do you say that ignorance is a thing of this <lb/>
            kind, to have a false opinion, and to be deceived about matters <lb/>
            of great importance ?" <note type="footnote"> U </note></p><pb n="290"/>
            
          <p>To this, likewise, all agreed.</p>
          <p>" Is it not the case then," I said, " that no one willingly <lb/>
            sets about things evil, or things which he thinks are evil, nor <lb/>
            is this, as it seems, in the nature of man willingly to engage in <lb/>
            things which he thinks are evil, instead of such as are good; <lb/>
            and when of two evils he is compelled to choose one, no one will <lb/>
            choose the greater, when it is in his power to choose the less."</p>
          <p>119. All these things were assented to by us all.</p>
          <p>" What then," said I, " do you call dread and fear some­ <lb/>
            thing ? and the same that I do, (I address myself to you, Pro­ <lb/>
            dicus,) I mean by it a certain expectation of evil, whether you <lb/>
            call it fear or dread."</p>
          <p>It appeared to Protagoras and Hippias that dread and fear <lb/>
            were of this nature, but to Prodicus that dread was, but fear not.</p>
          <p>" But," said I, " it is of no consequence, Prodicus ; but this <lb/>
            is; if what we before said is true, will any man deliberately <lb/>
            engage in things which he dreads, when it is in his power to <lb/>
            engage in things which he does not dread ? or is not this im­ <lb/>
            possible from our former admissions ? for it has been admitted <lb/>
            that what he dreads he considers to be evil; and what he con­ <lb/>
            siders to be evil, no one either engages in or willingly receives."</p>
          <p>These things, likewise, were agreed to by all.</p>
          <p>120. " These points, then, being established," I said, " Pro­ <lb/>
            dicus and Hippias, let Protagoras here defend himself and <lb/>
            shew us how his first answer is correct, no, not quite the first, <lb/>
            for he then said, that there being five parts of virtue, no one <lb/>
            of them was like any other, but that each had a peculiar func­ <lb/>
            tion of its own. I do not however mean this, but what he <lb/>
            said afterwards. For afterwards he said, that four of them <lb/>
            very much resembled each other, but that one was altogether <lb/>
            different from the rest, namely courage. And he said I should <lb/>
            know it by the following proof. ' You will find men, Socrates, <lb/>
            who are most unholy, most unjust, most intemperate, and most <lb/>
            ignorant, who are yet most courageous; by which you will <lb/>
            know that courage differs much from the other parts of virtue.' <lb/>
            And I indeed, at the moment, was very much astonished at the <lb/>
            answer, and I have been still more so since I have discussed <lb/>
            these things with you. I therefore asked him if he meant <lb/>
            that courageous men are bold ? He said he did, and ready to <lb/>
            rush headlong. 121. Do you remember, Protagoras," said I, <lb/>
            "that you gave this answer?"</p><pb n="291"/>
            
          <p>He admitted it.</p>
          <p>" Come then," said I, " tell us on what you say the coura­ <lb/>
            geous are ready to rush headlong ? Is it on the same things as <lb/>
            cowards ?"</p>
          <p>He said not.</p>
          <p>" On different things, therefore."</p>
          <p>" Yes," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But whether do cowards attempt things which they can <lb/>
            venture on with confidence, but the courageous on such as are <lb/>
            dreadful ?"</p>
          <p>" It is said so, Socrates, by the generality of men."</p>
          <p>" You say truly," I replied. " I do not, however, ask this : <lb/>
            but on what do you say courageous men are ready to rush <lb/>
            headlong, on dreadful things, thinking that they are dreadful, <lb/>
            or on such as are not dreadful ?"</p>
          <p>" But this," he said, " in the arguments which you just now <lb/>
            used, was shewn to be impossible."</p>
          <p>" And in this," I replied, " you say truly. So that if this <lb/>
            point was proved correctly, no one attempts things which he <lb/>
            considers to be dreadful, since to be overcome by one's-self was <lb/>
            found to be ignorance."</p>
          <p>He admitted it.</p>
          <p>" All men, however, attempt things in which they have con­ <lb/>
            fidence, both the cowardly and the courageous, and thus both <lb/>
            the cowardly and the courageous attempt the same things."</p>
          <p>122. " But indeed, Socrates," said he, " the things which <lb/>
            the cowardly and the courageous attempt are quite contrary to <lb/>
            each other; for instance, the latter are willing to engage in <lb/>
            war, but the former are unwilling."</p>
          <p>"Whether," said I, "is it honourable to engage in it, or base?"</p>
          <p>" Honourable," he replied.</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, it is honourable, have we not already ad­ <lb/>
            mitted that it is good, for we have admitted that all honourable <lb/>
            actions are good."</p>
          <p>" You say truly, and I am always of this opinion."</p>
          <p>" Right," said I. " But which of the two do you say are <lb/>
            unwilling to engage in war, though it is honourable and <lb/>
            good?"</p>
          <p>" Cowards," he replied.</p>
          <p>" If therefore," said I, " it be honourable and good, is it not <lb/>
            also pleasant ?''</p><pb n="292"/>
            
          <p>" That has been granted," he said.</p>
          <p>"Are the cowardly, then, unwilling to attempt what they <lb/>
            know to be more honourable and better, and more plea­ <lb/>
            sant ?"</p>
          <p>" But," said he, " if we admitted this, we should destroy our <lb/>
            former admissions."</p>
          <p>123. "But what with respect to the brave man? Does he <lb/>
            not engage in what is more honourable, better, and more <lb/>
            pleasant ?"</p>
          <p>" It is necessary," said he, " to admit that he does."</p>
          <p>" On the whole, then, is it not the case, that the courageous, <lb/>
            when they are afraid, have no base fear, nor are they inspired <lb/>
            with base confidence."</p>
          <p>" True," said he.</p>
          <p>" But if not base, are they not honourable ?"</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>" And if honourable, also good?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>" And are not the cowardly, and the bold, and the mad, on <lb/>
            the contrary, influenced by base fears, and inspired with base <lb/>
            confidence ?"</p>
          <p>He admitted that they are.</p>
          <p>" And are they bold in what is base and evil, through any <lb/>
            thing else than ignorance and want of knowledge ?"</p>
          <p>" So it is," he replied.</p>
          <p>" What then ? Do you call this, through which cowards are <lb/>
            cowardly, cowardice or courage ?"</p>
          <p>" Cowardice," said he.</p>
          <p>" But have not cowards appeared to be what they are, <lb/>
            through not knowing what is dreadful ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," said he.</p>
          <p>" They are cowardly then, through this want of knowledge?"</p>
          <p>He admitted it.</p>
          <p>"But that through-which they are cowardly, you have ad­ <lb/>
            mitted is cowardice ?"</p>
          <p>He assented.</p>
          <p>" Must not, then, the not knowing what is dreadful, and not <lb/>
            dreadful, be cowardice ?"</p>
          <p>He nodded assent.</p>
          <p>" However," said I, " courage is contrary to cowardice."</p>
          <p>He said it was.</p><pb n="293"/>
            
          <p>"Is not then the knowledge of what is dreadful, and no <lb/>
            dreadful, contrary to a want of knowledge of these things ?"</p>
          <p>And here he still nodded assent.</p>
          <p>" But is not the want of knowing these things cowardice ?"</p>
          <p>He, here, with great difficulty, nodded assent.</p>
          <p>" Is not the knowledge therefore, of what is dreadful, and <lb/>
            not dreadful, courage, being contrary to a want of knowledge <lb/>
            of these things ?"</p>
          <p>124. Here he would no longer nod assent, but was silent.</p>
          <p>So I said, " Why, Protagoras, do you neither admit nor deny <lb/>
            what I ask ?"</p>
          <p>" Do you conclude the subject," he said.</p>
          <p>" I have only one more question to ask you," said I, " whe­ <lb/>
            ther some men still appear to you as at first, to be most igno­ <lb/>
            rant, and yet most courageous."</p>
          <p>" You seem to be very anxious, Socrates, that I should be <lb/>
            the person to answer. I will therefore indulge you, and I say, <lb/>
            that from what has been granted, it appears to me to be im­ <lb/>
            possible."</p>
          <p>" I ask all these questions," said I, " on no other account, <lb/>
            than because I wish to examine how the case stands with re­ <lb/>
            spect to things pertaining to virtue, and what virtue itself is. <lb/>
            For I know that when this is discovered, that other will be <lb/>
            clearly ascertained, about which you and I have both of us held <lb/>
            so long a discussion, I maintaining that virtue cannot be taught, <lb/>
            but you that it can. 125. And the present issue of our dis­ <lb/>
            cussion appears to me, as if it were a man, to accuse and laugh <lb/>
            at us, and if it had a voice, it would say, Absurd men ye are, <lb/>
            Socrates and Protagoras; you, who at the outset maintained <lb/>
            that virtue cannot be taught, are now contending in opposition <lb/>
            to yourself, and endeavouring to shew that all things are know­ <lb/>
            ledge, as justice, temperance, and courage, according to which <lb/>
            method of proceeding it will certainly appear that virtue may <lb/>
            be taught. For if virtue were any thing else than knowledge, <lb/>
            as Protagoras endeavours to maintain, it clearly could not be <lb/>
            taught; but now, if it shall appear to be altogether knowledge, <lb/>
            as you contend, Socrates, it will be wonderful if it cannot be <lb/>
            taught. Protagoras on the other hand, who at first insisted <lb/>
            that it could be taught, now seems to contend for the con­ <lb/>
            trary, that it may appear to be almost any thing else rather <lb/>
            than knowledge; and so can on no account be taught. 126. I <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            therefore, Protagoras, seeing all these things terribly confused, <lb/>
            this way and that, am exceedingly anxious that they should <lb/>
            be made clear, and should wish, now we have discussed these <lb/>
            things, to proceed to enquire what virtue is, and to examine <lb/>
            again respecting it, whether it can be taught, or not, lest by <lb/>
            chance that Epimetheus of yours should treacherously deceive <lb/>
            us in our enquiry, just as he neglected us in the distribution <lb/>
            which he made, as you say. Now in the fable, Prometheus <lb/>
            pleased me more than Epimetheus, and making use of him, <lb/>
            and looking forward with forethought to my whole life, I <lb/>
            diligently attend to all these matters; and if you are willing, <lb/>
            as I said at the beginning, I would most gladly join with you <lb/>
            in examining them thoroughly."</p>
          <p>To this Protagoras said, " I, Socrates, praise your zeal, and <lb/>
            your method of unfolding arguments. For I am not in other <lb/>
            respects, I think, a bad man, and least of all men envious: <lb/>
            indeed I have often said of you to many, that I admire you <lb/>
            more than all whom I am in the habit of meeting, and far <lb/>
            above those of your own age: and I add, that I should not <lb/>
            wonder if you were to rank among men renowned for wisdom. <lb/>
            And these matters we will further discuss hereafter, when you <lb/>
            please ; but it is now time for me to attend to other business."</p>
          <p>" It is right so to do," I replied, " if you think fit. For I <lb/>
            too ought long since to have gone where I had to go, but I <lb/>
            staid to oblige the beautiful Callias."</p>
          <p>Having said and heard these things, we departed.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE PHÆDRUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>PHÆDRUS, whom we have already3 met with among the fol­ <lb/>
            lowers of the sophist Hippias, happening to meet with Socrates, <lb/>
            tells him that he has just left the orator Lysias, who had writ­ <lb/>
            ten and recited a speech on the subject of love, in which he <lb/>
            argued that a youth ought rather to shew favour to one who <lb/>
            is not in love than to one who is. Socrates, who pretends to <lb/>
            be very anxious to hear the speech, begs Phaedrus to repeat it <lb/>
            from memory as well as he is able, for he cannot doubt but <lb/>
            that he has learnt it by heart, so great is his admiration for its <lb/>
            author. Phaedrus affects shyness, though in reality desirous of <lb/>
            practising himself on Socrates: at length, however, Socrates <lb/>
            discovers that he has a copy of it under his cloak, so they pro­ <lb/>
            ceed on their walk, talking by the way, till they reach a plane- <lb/>
            tree on the banks of the Ilissus, outside the walls of Athens, <lb/>
            under whose ample shade they lie downb.</p>
          <p>Phædrus reads the speech, which in addition to the faults of <lb/>
            obscurity, inconclusiveness, and tautology, takes a very low <lb/>
            and sensual view of the passion of love c. When it is ended, <lb/>
            Phædrus asks Socrates what he thinks of it, and whether it is <lb/>
            not a wonderful composition, especially as to the language. <lb/>
            Socrates at first praises it ironically, but on being pressed by <lb/>
            Phædrus points out some of its faults, and says that even <lb/>
            Lysias himself could not be satisfied with it, and that many <lb/>
            others have both spoken and written finer things on the same <lb/>
            subject, with which at that very instant his breast is full. Phæ­ <lb/>
            drus catches at this, and insists on Socrates repeating these fine <lb/>
            things, promising that if he says any thing that excels the speech <lb/>
            of Lysias he will erect his statue in gold in Olympiad.</p>
          <p>As it is the present design of Socrates to take the same low <lb/>
            view of love that Lysias had done, he determines to speak with <note type="footnote"> a See the Protagoras, § It. </note><note type="footnote">b § 1—10. </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> c § 11—21. </note><note type="footnote">d § 22—27. </note> <lb/>

            his face covered, that he may not falter through shame. He <lb/>
            begins by a definition of love, which he represents to be desire <lb/>
            hurried on to the pleasure derived from personal beauty; and <lb/>
            then he goes on to shew, with great perspicuity, how a person <lb/>
            under the influence of such a passion must needs be anxious <lb/>
            that the beloved object should not excel himself or be admired <lb/>
            by others. Then with regard to the body, he will wish to <lb/>
            make it effeminate, and be anxious that his beloved should be <lb/>
            as much as possible dependent on him; and at length he will <lb/>
            become unfaithful, forget all his former vows and promises, <lb/>
            and leave his favourite despised and destitute, who will suffer <lb/>
            most of all in this, that he has been debarred from cultivating <lb/>
            his soul, than which, he adds, there neither is nor ever will be <lb/>
            any thing more precious in the sight of gods and men e.</p>
          <p>Phædrus expects that Socrates will not only shew the dis­ <lb/>
            advantages of granting favours to a lover, but also go on to <lb/>
            point out the advantages of granting them to one who is not in <lb/>
            love. This, however, he refuses to do; and then, conscience- <lb/>
            stricken for that he has been guilty of an offence against the <lb/>
            deity of Love in speaking of him in so impious a manner, he <lb/>
            determines on making his recantation, by uttering a speech <lb/>
            which shall describe that deity in his true character. He be­ <lb/>
            gins by condemning his former assertion that favour ought <lb/>
            rather to be shewn to one who is not in love than to a lover, be­ <lb/>
            cause the latter is mad and the former in his sober senses. For, <lb/>
            he argues, it is not universally true that madness is an evil, so <lb/>
            far from it, that the greatest blessings spring from madness, <lb/>
            for even prophetic inspiration is a species of madness and de­ <lb/>
            rives its very name from it. And love is one of many kinds of <lb/>
            madness, and as such the source of the greatest happiness to <lb/>
            man. To prove this, he says, it is necessary to examine into <lb/>
            the nature of the soul, both human and divine. The soul, <lb/>
            then, is immortal, because it contains the principle of motion <lb/>
            within itself (a subtle argument which it may be observed was <note type="footnote"> e § 28-40. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            not adduced in the Phædo, where the soul's immortality was <lb/>
            the immediate point under discussion.) Still, to explain what <lb/>
            the soul is would require a divine and lengthened exposition ; <lb/>
            he must therefore content himself with saying what it is like. <lb/>
            He therefore compares the soul to a pair of winged steeds and <lb/>
            a charioteer. The horses and charioteers of the gods are all <lb/>
            good, but all others are mixed. While the soul is perfect and <lb/>
            winged it soars aloft, but when it loses its wings it is borne <lb/>
            downward and becomes united with a body in which it takes <lb/>
            up its abode, and the two united are called mortal. He then <lb/>
            describes how Jupiter goes first, driving a winged chariot, and <lb/>
            is followed by a host of gods and demons distributed into <lb/>
            eleven divisions : in their flight they reach the external regions <lb/>
            of heaven, and behold truth, justice, temperance, science, in <lb/>
            their essences. Other inferior souls endeavour to follow and <lb/>
            imitate them; few, however, can do so: those that get a <lb/>
            glimpse of any of the true essences are free from harm till the <lb/>
            next revolution, but those that are unable to do so are weighed <lb/>
            down and lose their wings, and become implanted in earthly <lb/>
            natures of various orders, and then, according to their conduct <lb/>
            in this condition, are either restored to their former state or <lb/>
            still further degraded. The mind of the philosopher, however, <lb/>
            is alone furnished with wings, because his memory dwells on <lb/>
            that which is divined</p>
          <p>This then is the madness above spoken of, when one, behold­ <lb/>
            ing beauty in this lower world, is reminded of the true, and <lb/>
            looking upwards to it despises things below and is deemed to <lb/>
            be affected with madness. But he who has become corrupted <lb/>
            is not easily carried hence to beauty itself, nor does he reve­ <lb/>
            rence it when he beholds it, but looks upon it with carnal <lb/>
            sensuality; whereas he, who has not been so far corrupted, <lb/>
            when he beholds the imitation of beauty here, reverences it <lb/>
            as a god, and, but for the imputation of madness, would <lb/>
            sacrifice to it. Then his wings begin to swell again and en­ <note type="footnote"> § 40-62. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            deavour to burst forth anew; but when separated from the <lb/>
            beautiful object the soul becomes parched and the passages <lb/>
            through which the wings shoot forth become closed. Thus <lb/>
            alternately tormented with agony and joy, it becomes frantic <lb/>
            and runs about trying to see the possessor of the beauty. This <lb/>
            affection men call love. Now when a follower of Jupiter is <lb/>
            thus seized, he is better able to bear the burden of the winged <lb/>
            god: for such a one seeks one who resembles Jupiter to be <lb/>
            the object of his love; and when he has found him, he en­ <lb/>
            deavours to make him like his own gods.</p>
          <p>As each soul was before divided into three parts, two having <lb/>
            the form of horses, and the third that of a charioteer, so that <lb/>
            division must still be maintained. When therefore the cha­ <lb/>
            rioteer beholds the love-inspiring sight, the obedient horse is <lb/>
            easily restrained, but the other compels them to hurry to the <lb/>
            favourite, and longs to indulge in the delights of love. But <lb/>
            the charioteer, on approaching him, is carried back to absolute <lb/>
            beauty, and being awe-struck falls backward and throws the <lb/>
            horses on their haunches. When by being repeatedly checked <lb/>
            in this way the vicious horse has laid aside his insolence, he <lb/>
            becomes humbled and the soul of the lover follows his favourite <lb/>
            with reverence and awe. And the beloved being worshipped <lb/>
            by one who does not feign the passion but who really feels it, re­ <lb/>
            quites the affection of his worshipper, and in turn longs for the <lb/>
            lover in the same manner that he is longed for, possessing <lb/>
            love's image; love returned. If then the better parts of their <lb/>
            mind prevail so as to lead to a well-regulated life and philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, they pass their life in bliss and concord, and when they <lb/>
            depart this life, they become winged and win one of the three <lb/>
            truly Olympic contests, a greater good than which neither <lb/>
            human prudence nor divine madness can bestow on man. If <lb/>
            however, they have adopted a coarser and less philosophic <lb/>
            mode of life, but still honourable, in the end they find the <lb/>
            body without wings indeed, yet making an effort to become <note type="footnote"> g § 63—73. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            winged and so carry off no trifling prize of impassioned <lb/>
            madness h.</p>
          <p>When Socrates had ended his recantation to Love, Phsedrus <lb/>
            expresses great admiration of his speech ; and adds that he <lb/>
            doubts whether Lysias will ever venture to write speeches <lb/>
            again. But Socrates shews him that such an expectation is <lb/>
            altogether groundless; and after a charming little episode on <lb/>
            the origin of grasshoppers, proposes to consider in what a <lb/>
            correct mode of speaking and writing consists</p>
          <p>The first essential is that the speaker should know the truth <lb/>
            of the subject on which he is about to speak. And though it <lb/>
            is commonly said that an orator need not know what is really <lb/>
            just, but only what will appear so to the multitude, yet Socrates <lb/>
            with great force destroys this fallacy, and shews that such <lb/>
            rhetoric is not an art but an inartistic trick; for a genuine <lb/>
            art of speaking neither does nor can exist without laying hold <lb/>
            of truth. Rhetoric must be an art that leads the soul by <lb/>
            means of argument. Now in courts of justice and popular <lb/>
            assemblies men succeed by making things appear similar to <lb/>
            each other so far as they are capable of being made appear <lb/>
            so; and deception will more frequently occur in things that <lb/>
            nearly resemble each other, so that a person who means to <lb/>
            persuade or deceive another must be able to distinguish ac­ <lb/>
            curately the similarity and dissimilarity of things, and so lead <lb/>
            his hearer by means of resemblances. Taking this as his <lb/>
            principle, Socrates proceeds to shew that the speech of Lysias <lb/>
            is altogether inartistic, for that he ought first of all to have <lb/>
            defined Love and divided it into its different species and shewn <lb/>
            of which class he was going to speak, whereas he begins where <lb/>
            he should have ended, and throughout speaks at random with­ <lb/>
            out any definite design. He then proceeds to comment on his <lb/>
            own two speeches. In one he argued that favour ought to <lb/>
            be shewn to one that is in love, in the other to a person that <lb/>
            is not in love. In one he said that love was a kind of divine <note type="footnote"> h § 73-84. </note><note type="footnote">i § 85—91. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            madness, and then dividing this madness into four parts he <lb/>
            shewed that the madness of Love is the best. In these speeches, <lb/>
            then, are seen the two methods of arguing correctly, definition <lb/>
            and division, the former of which contemplates many things <lb/>
            under one aspect and brings them together under one general <lb/>
            idea, the latter separates that general idea into speciesk.</p>
          <p>Socrates then ridicules the rules of rhetoric laid down by <lb/>
            many of the sophists, and having passed a high eulogium on <lb/>
            Pericles, shews that a perfect orator must know the real nature <lb/>
            of the things to which he will have to apply his speeches, and <lb/>
            that is the soul; for as the power of speech consists in leading <lb/>
            the soul, he must know how many kinds of soul there are, and <lb/>
            by what arguments each kind is most easily persuaded1.</p>
          <p>From speaking he proceeds to writing, and tells a pleasant <lb/>
            story of the invention of letters, and remarks that the evil of <lb/>
            writing is, that, like painting, if you ask it a question it cannot <lb/>
            answer; and when once written it is tossed from hand to hand, <lb/>
            as well among those who understand it as those who do not. <lb/>
            But there is another kind of discourse far more excellent, which <lb/>
            is written in the learner's mind, and knows when to speak and <lb/>
            when to be silent. The conclusion of the whole is that a speaker <lb/>
            should be acquainted with the true nature of each subject on <lb/>
            which he speaks or writes, be able to define, and divide things <lb/>
            into their species until he reaches the indivisible, and to inves­ <lb/>
            tigate the nature of the soul and apply his discourses to each <lb/>
            soul according to its capacity.</p>
          <p>Then, with a message, in accordance with these principles, to <lb/>
            Lysias, and a high encomium on Isocrates, who promised to be <lb/>
            led by a diviner impulse to holier and higher things, he con­ <lb/>
            cludes by praying that Pan would grant him to be beautiful in <lb/>
            the inner man, and that all outward things might be at peace <lb/>
            with those within. That he may deem the wise man rich: and <lb/>
            may have such a portion of gold as none but a prudent man <lb/>
            can bear or employ. <note type="footnote"> k § 92—111. ' </note><note type="footnote">l § 112—132. </note></p>

          </ab>
          <p>Socr. My dear Phsedrus, whither are you going, and from <lb/>
            whence come you ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. From Lysias, son of Cephalus, Socrates; but I am <lb/>
            going for a walk outside the walls; for I have spent a long <lb/>
            time there, sitting from very early in the morning; but in <lb/>
            obedience to your and my friend Acumenus, I take my walks <lb/>
            in the open roads; for he says that they are more refreshing <lb/>
            than those in the course.</p>
          <p>Socr. He says rightly, my friend: Lysias then, as it seems, <lb/>
            was in the city ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Yes, with Epicrates in the Morychian house here, <lb/>
            near the Olympium.</p>
          <p>Socr. What was your employment there? Without doubt <lb/>
            Lysias feasted you with speeches ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. You shall hear, if you have leisure to go on with me <lb/>
            and listen.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? do you not think that, according to <lb/>
            Pindar a, I should consider it a matter above all want and <lb/>
            leisure, to listen to the conversation between you and Lysias ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Proceed then.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you begin your story.</p>
          <p>2. Phæ. And indeed, Socrates, the subject is suited to you. <lb/>
            For the question, in which we spent our time, I know not <lb/>
            how, was amatory. For Lysias had written a speech in which <lb/>
            he described a beautiful youth as being courted, but not by a <lb/>
            lover; and on this very point he argued with great subtilty ; <lb/>
            for he maintains that favour ought to be shewn to one who is <lb/>
            not in love, rather than to one who is in love.</p>
          <p>Socr. Generous man ! I wish he had written that favour should <lb/>
            be shewn to a poor man rather than a rich one, and to an old than <note type="footnote"> a Isthm. i. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            a young, and so on with respect to such things as happen to me <lb/>
            and the most of us; for then his discourses would be charming <lb/>
            and of general usefulness. I, for my part, am so very desirous <lb/>
            to hear his speech, that even if you prolong your walk to <lb/>
            Megara, and, after Herodicus, when you have reached the <lb/>
            wall, turn back again, I shall on no account lag behind <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>3. Phæ. How say you, most excellent Socrates ? Do you <lb/>
            think, that what Lysias, the most able writer of the day, com­ <lb/>
            posed at his leisure in a long space of time, I who am but a <lb/>
            novice could repeat from memory in a manner worthy of him ? <lb/>
            Far from it; though I would rather be able to do so than be <lb/>
            the possessor of a large sum of gold.</p>
          <p>Socr. Phædrus, if I know not Phædrus, I have also forgotten <lb/>
            myself; but neither of these is the case; for I know well that <lb/>
            on hearing Lysias's speech he not only heard it once, but urged <lb/>
            him to read it repeatedly, and he readily complied; neither <lb/>
            was this sufficient for Phædrus, but at length having got hold <lb/>
            of the book, he examined the parts he liked best; and having <lb/>
            done this, sitting from very early in the morning, he was <lb/>
            fatigued and went out for a walk, as I believe, by the dog, having <lb/>
            learnt the whole speech by heart, if it is not a very long one. <lb/>
            And he was going outside the walls, that he might con it over, <lb/>
            and, meeting with one who has a desire for hearing speeches, <lb/>
            was delighted at seeing him approach, because he would have <lb/>
            one to share his enthusiasm, and bade him accompany him <lb/>
            in his walk. But when that lover of speeches begged him to <lb/>
            recite it, he affected shyness, as if he did not wish to repeat it, <lb/>
            though at length he would have compelled one to listen to it <lb/>
            even though one was not willing to do so. Do you then, <lb/>
            Phædrus, entreat him to do now what he will soon do at all <lb/>
            events.</p>
          <p>Phæ. It is, in truth, far best for me to repeat it as well as I <lb/>
            can; for I see you are determined not to let me go, until I <lb/>
            have delivered it some how or another.</p>
          <p>Socr. You think perfectly right.</p>
          <p>Phæ. I will do it then; but in truth, Socrates, I have by no <lb/>
            means learnt the words of this oration by heart, though the <lb/>
            general outline of all the several parts, in which he said the <lb/>
            claims of one who is in love and one who is not differ from each <lb/>
            other, I can go through summarily and in order, beginning <lb/>
            from the first.</p><pb n="303"/>
            
          <p>5. Soer. But shew me first, my dear friend, what you have <lb/>
            got there in your left hand, under your cloak; for I suspect <lb/>
            that you have got the speech itself: and if this is the case, <lb/>
            think thus of me, that I love you very much, but that, when <lb/>
            Lysias is present, I have by no means made up my mind to <lb/>
            lend myself to you to practise upon. Come then, shew it me.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Stop, you have dashed down the hope I had, Socrates, <lb/>
            of practising upon you. But where do you wish we should <lb/>
            sit down and read ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us turn down here, and go near the Ilissus, then <lb/>
            we will sit down quietly, wherever you please.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Very seasonably, as it appears, I happen to be without <lb/>
            shoes, for you are always so. It will be easiest for us then to <lb/>
            walk by the shallow stream, wetting our feet, and it will not <lb/>
            be unpleasant, especially at this season of the year, and this <lb/>
            time of the day.</p>
          <p>Socr. Lead on then, and at the same time look out for a <lb/>
            place where we may sit down.</p>
          <p>6. Phæ. Do you see that lofty plane-tree ?</p>
          <p>Socr. How should I not.</p>
          <p>Phas. There, there is both shade and a gentle breeze, and <lb/>
            grass to sit down upon, or, if we prefer it, to lie down on.</p>
          <p>Socr. Lead on, then.</p>
          <p>Phæ. But tell me, Socrates, is not Boreas reported to have <lb/>
            carried off Orithya from somewhere about this part of the <lb/>
            Ilissus ?</p>
          <p>Socr. So it is said.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Must it not have been from this spot ? for the water <lb/>
            hereabouts appears beautiful, clear and transparent, and well <lb/>
            suited for damsels to sport about.</p>
          <p>Socr. No, but lower down, as much as two or three stadia, <lb/>
            where we cross over to the temple of the Huntress, and where <lb/>
            there is, on the very spot, a kind of altar sacred to Boreas.</p>
          <p>Phæ. I never noticed it. But tell me, by Jupiter, Socrates, <lb/>
            do you believe that this fabulous account is true ?</p>
          <p>7. Socr If I disbelieved it, as the wise do, I should not be <lb/>
            guilty of any absurdity: then having recourse to subtleties, I <lb/>
            should say that a blast of Boreas threw her down from the <lb/>
            neighbouring cliffs, as she was sporting with Pharmacea, and <lb/>
            that having thus met her death she was said to have been <lb/>
            carried off by Boreas, or from Mars' hill; for there is also another <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            report that she was carried off from thence and not from this <lb/>
            spot. But I, for my part, Phædrus, consider such things as <lb/>
            pretty enough, but as the province of a very curious, pains- <lb/>
            taking, and not very happy man, and for no other reason than <lb/>
            this, that after this he must set us right as to the form of the <lb/>
            Hippocentaurs, and then as to that of the Chimæra; besides <lb/>
            there pours in upon him a crowd of similar monsters, Gorgons <lb/>
            and Pegasuses, and other monstrous creatures, incredible in <lb/>
            number and absurdity, which if any one were to disbelieve and <lb/>
            endeavour to reconcile each with probability, employing for <lb/>
            this purpose a kind of vulgar cleverness, he will stand in need <lb/>
            of abundant leisure. 8. But I have not leisure at all for such <lb/>
            matters; and the cause of it, my friend, is this; I am not yet <lb/>
            able, according to the Delphic precept, to know myself. But <lb/>
            it appears to me to be ridiculous, while I am still ignorant of <lb/>
            this to busy myself about matters that do not concern me. <lb/>
            Wherefore dismissing these matters, and receiving the popular <lb/>
            opinion respecting them, as I just now said, I do not enquire <lb/>
            about them, but about myself, whether I happen to be a beast, <lb/>
            with more folds and more furious than Typhon, or whether I <lb/>
            am a more mild and simple animal, naturally partaking of a <lb/>
            certain divine and modest condition. But, my friend, to in­ <lb/>
            terrupt our conversation, is not this the tree to which you were <lb/>
            leading me ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. This is the very one.</p>
          <p>9. Socr. By Juno, a beautiful retreat. For this plane-tree <lb/>
            is very wide-spreading and lofty, and the height and shadiness <lb/>
            of this agnus castus are very beautiful, and as it is now at the <lb/>
            perfection of its flowering, it makes the spot as fragrant as <lb/>
            possible. Moreover, a most agreeable fountain flows under the <lb/>
            plane-tree, of very cold water, to judge from its effect on the <lb/>
            foot. It appears from these images and statues to be sacred <lb/>
            to certain nymphs, and to Achelous. Observe again the <lb/>
            freshness of the spot how charming and very delightful it is. <lb/>
            and how summer-like and shrill it sounds from the choir of <lb/>
            grasshoppers. But the most delightful of all is the grass, <lb/>
            which with its gentle slope is naturally adapted to give an <lb/>
            easy support to the head, as one reclines. So that, my dear <lb/>
            Phædrus, you make an admirable stranger's guide.</p>
          <p>10. Phæ. And you, my wonderful friend, appear to be a most <lb/>
            surprising being: for as you say, you are just like a stranger <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            who is being shewn the sights, and not a native of the place. <lb/>
            This comes from your never quitting the city, or going beyond <lb/>
            the boundaries, nor do you seem to me ever to go outside the <lb/>
            walls.</p>
          <p>Socr. Pardon me, my excellent friend; for I am a lover of <lb/>
            learning: now the fields and trees will not teach me any <lb/>
            thing, but men in the city do. You, however, appear to me <lb/>
            to have discovered a charm to entice me out. For as those, <lb/>
            who, by shaking leaves or some fruit before them, lead their <lb/>
            hungry flocks, so do you, by holding out written speeches <lb/>
            before me, seem as if you could lead me about all Attica, and <lb/>
            wherever else you please. But now, for the present, since I <lb/>
            am come here, I am resolved to lay me down, and do you in <lb/>
            whatever posture you think you can read most conveniently, <lb/>
            take this and read.</p>
          <p>Phœ. Listen then. 11. " You are well acquainted with the <lb/>
            state of my affairs, and I think you have heard that it would <lb/>
            be for our advantage if this took place. And I claim, not for <lb/>
            this reason to fail in my request, because I do not happen to <lb/>
            be one of your lovers: for they repent of the benefits they <lb/>
            have conferred, as soon as their desires cease; but the others <lb/>
            have no time at which it is convenient for them to repent•, <lb/>
            since not from necessity, but voluntarily, they confer benefits <lb/>
            according to their ability, so as but to consult their own in­ <lb/>
            terests. Besides, lovers consider what of their affairs they <lb/>
            have managed badly by reason of their love, and what benefits <lb/>
            they have conferred, and adding thereto what labour they have <lb/>
            undergone, they think that they have long since conferred suf­ <lb/>
            ficient favours on the objects of their love. But those who do <lb/>
            not love have no pretence to make of the neglect of their own <lb/>
            affairs on this score, nor can they take into account the labours <lb/>
            they have undergone, nor make differences with their friends a <lb/>
            pretext: so that, all such evils being removed, nothing remains <lb/>
            for them but to do cheerfully whatever they think they will <lb/>
            gratify them by doing. 12. Besides, if for this reason it is <lb/>
            right to make much of those who love, because they say they <lb/>
            are most devotedly attached to those whom they love, and are <lb/>
            always ready, both in words and deeds, to incur the enmity of <lb/>
            others, so that they can but gratify the objects of their love, it <lb/>
            is easy to discover whether they speak the truth, because those <lb/>
            whom they afterwards fall in love with they will prize more <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            highly than the former, and it is evident that if the latter require <lb/>
            it, they will behave ill to the former. And how is it reasonable <lb/>
            to lavish such a treasureb on one afflicted with such a calamity, <lb/>
            as no experienced person would ever attempt to avert ? for they <lb/>
            themselves confess that they are rather diseased than in their <lb/>
            right minds, and that they know that they are out of their senses, <lb/>
            but are unable to control themselves. How therefore, when <lb/>
            they recover their senses, can they think that those things were <lb/>
            right about which they were so anxious when in that state of <lb/>
            mind? 13. Moreover, if you should choose the best from <lb/>
            among your lovers, your choice must be made from a few; but <lb/>
            if from among all others the one most suited to you, from <lb/>
            many: so that there is much more hope that among the many <lb/>
            there is one worthy of your affection. If, therefore, you re­ <lb/>
            spect the established usages of mankind, and are afraid lest, <lb/>
            when men discover it, it should be a disgrace to you, it is pro­ <lb/>
            bable that lovers, thinking that they are envied by others in <lb/>
            the same way that they envy each other, should be so elated <lb/>
            as to talk, and, out of ambition, publish to the world that <lb/>
            they have not bestowed their labour in vain ; but that such as <lb/>
            are not in love, having a control over themselves, should pre­ <lb/>
            fer what is best to celebrity amongst men. 14. Besides, it <lb/>
            must needs happen that many should hear of and see lovers <lb/>
            following the objects of their affection, and doing this sedu­ <lb/>
            lously, so that when they are seen conversing with one another <lb/>
            men think that they are together on account of desire already <lb/>
            indulged or about to be so : but they do not attempt to blame <lb/>
            those who do not love, on account of their familiarity, being <lb/>
            aware that it is necessary to converse with some one, either on <lb/>
            account of friendship or some other pleasure. 15. Moreover, <lb/>
            if you have experienced uneasiness from the consideration that <lb/>
            it is difficult for friendship to last, but that when a difference <lb/>
            takes place under other circumstances a common calamity <lb/>
            happens to both; but that when you have lavished what you <lb/>
            prize most highly great injury would befal you, you would <lb/>
            with good reason be more afraid of those who love. For <lb/>
            there are many things that grieve them, and they think that <lb/>
            every thing is done to their detriment. Wherefore they pro­ <lb/>
            hibit the objects of their love from associating with others, <lb/>
            fearing those who possess wealth, lest they should get the <note type="footnote"> b Youth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            better of them by means of their riches, and the well-educated, <lb/>
            lest they should surpass them in intelligence; and they are <lb/>
            apprehensive of the influence of every one who possesses any <lb/>
            other advantage. By persuading you, then, to keep aloof from <lb/>
            such as these, they cause you to be destitute of friends. If, <lb/>
            therefore, regarding your own interest, you pursue a wiser <lb/>
            course than they recommend, you are sure to quarrel with <lb/>
            them. 16. But such as are not in love, but have obtained the <lb/>
            accomplishment of their wishes through merit, will not envy <lb/>
            your associating with others, but will rather hate those who <lb/>
            will not associate with you, thinking that you are despised by <lb/>
            them, and are benefited by those who associate with you So <lb/>
            that there is much more reason to hope that friendship will be <lb/>
            produced between these by this means, than enmity. More­ <lb/>
            over, most lovers conceive a desire for the person before they <lb/>
            know their habits or are acquainted with their own qualities, so <lb/>
            that it is uncertain whether they will still wish to be their <lb/>
            friends when their desire has ceased; but with those who are <lb/>
            not in love, and who have done this, having been friends with <lb/>
            each other before, it is not probable that acts of kindness will <lb/>
            make their friendship less, but that they will be left as monu­ <lb/>
            ments of future services. 17. Besides, it will tend to your <lb/>
            improvement if you are persuaded by me rather than by a <lb/>
            lover. For they, contrary to your best interests, praise all <lb/>
            that you say and do, partly fearing lest they should offend you, <lb/>
            partly being themselves depraved in their judgment, through <lb/>
            desire, for love shews itself in such things: it makes the un­ <lb/>
            successful consider as distressing things which occasion no <lb/>
            pain to others, and compels the successful to praise things <lb/>
            which are not worthy the name of pleasures; so that it is <lb/>
            much more proper to pity than envy those that are loved. <lb/>
            18. But if you will be persuaded by me, first of all I will asso­ <lb/>
            ciate with you, not attending to present pleasure, but future <lb/>
            advantage, not overcome by love, but controlling myself, not <lb/>
            conceiving violent enmities for trifling offences, but slowly in­ <lb/>
            dulging slight anger for great offences, pardoning involuntary <lb/>
            faults, and endeavouring to divert you from such as are volun­ <lb/>
            tary ; for these are the marks of a friendship that will endure <lb/>
            for a long time, If, however, it has occurred to you that it is <lb/>
            not possible for affection to be strong unless one is in love, <lb/>
            you should consider that in that case we should not be very <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            fond of our children or our fathers and mothers, nor acquire <lb/>
            faithful friends, who have become such not from desire of this <lb/>
            kind, but from other useful qualities. 19. Moreover, if it is <lb/>
            right to gratify those most who most need it, it is right also <lb/>
            with respect to others to benefit, not the best men, but the <lb/>
            most needy; for; being delivered from the greatest evils, they <lb/>
            will feel the deepest gratitude towards us. And besides this, <lb/>
            in private entertainments it will not be proper to invite our <lb/>
            friends, but mendicants and those who are in need of a hearty <lb/>
            meal; for these will greet and follow us, and will come to our <lb/>
            doors, and be highly delighted, and feel the utmost gratitude, <lb/>
            and pray for many blessings upon us. 20. But surely it is <lb/>
            right to gratify those not who are exceedingly needy, but who <lb/>
            are best able to repay a kindness, nor those who love only, <lb/>
            but those who deserve this favour; nor such as will enjoy the <lb/>
            bloom of. your youth, but who, when you are old, will share <lb/>
            their own fortune with you; nor those who, when they have <lb/>
            effected their object, will boast of it to others, but who, out of <lb/>
            modesty, will be silent towards all men; nor those who are <lb/>
            devoted to you for a short time, but who will be greatly at­ <lb/>
            tached to you throughout life; nor who, when their desire has <lb/>
            ceased, will seek a pretext for quarrelling, but who, when your <lb/>
            bloom is gone, will then exhibit their own excellence. 21. Do <lb/>
            you, then, remember what I have said, and consider this, that <lb/>
            friends admonish lovers that their course of life is a bad one, <lb/>
            but no one ever yet found fault with those who are not in love, <lb/>
            as if, on that account, they consulted ill for their own interests. <lb/>
            Perhaps, however, you may ask me whether I advise you to <lb/>
            gratify all who are not in love. But I think that not even a <lb/>
            lover would exhort you to be thus affected towards all your <lb/>
            lovers: for neither if one considers the matter reasonably is <lb/>
            such a course deserving of equal gratitude, nor if you wished <lb/>
            it, is it equally possible to keep it secret from others; but it is <lb/>
            requisite that no harm should result from the business; on the <lb/>
            contrary, advantage to both. I, for my part, think that enough <lb/>
            has been said, but if you require any thing more, under the <lb/>
            impression that it has been omitted, question me."</p>
          <p>22. What do you think of the speech, Socrates ? Does it <lb/>
            not appear to you to be wonderfully composed in other re­ <lb/>
            spects, and especially as to the language ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Divinely indeed, my friend, so much so that I am <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            amazed. And I had this feeling through you, Phsedrus, by <lb/>
            looking at you, for you appeared to me to be enraptured with <lb/>
            the speech while you were reading it. For supposing you to <lb/>
            understand such matters better than I do, I followed you, and, <lb/>
            in following you, I felt the same enthusiasm with you, my in­ <lb/>
            spired friend.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Well; do you think proper to jest in this manner ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do I appear to you to jest, and not to be in earnest ?</p>
          <p>Pllæ. Don't, Socrates ! But tell me truly, by Jupiter the god <lb/>
            of friendship, do you think that any other man in Greece could <lb/>
            speak more ably and fully than this on the same subject ?</p>
          <p>23. Socr. But what ? ought the speech to be praised by you <lb/>
            and me for this reason, that its composer has said what he ought, <lb/>
            and not only because every word is clear, and rounded, and <lb/>
            accurately polished off? For, if it ought, it may be granted <lb/>
            for your sake, since it escaped me by reason of my nothing­ <lb/>
            ness : for I attended only to its rhetoric, but this I did not <lb/>
            think that even Lysias himself would think sufficient. And to <lb/>
            me. indeed, it seemed, Phædrus, unless you say otherwise, that <lb/>
            he has repeated the same things twice and thrice, as if he had <lb/>
            not the faculty of saying much on the same subject, or perhaps <lb/>
            he did not care about this. Moreover he appeared to me to <lb/>
            make a wanton display of his ability to express these things in <lb/>
            different ways, and both ways most elegantly.</p>
          <p>24. Phæ. You say nothing to the purpose, Socrates : for the <lb/>
            speech has this very merit in the highest degree. For he has <lb/>
            omitted nothing belonging to his subject, which was worthy to <lb/>
            be mentioned : so that, beyond what has been said by him, no <lb/>
            one could ever say more things or of greater weight.</p>
          <p>Socr. On this point I am no longer able to agree with you ; <lb/>
            for the ancient and wise, both men and women, who have <lb/>
            spoken and written on this subject, would confute me, if I were <lb/>
            to admit this out of compliment to you.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Who are they ? and where have you heard better <lb/>
            things than these ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I am unable to say on the moment; but I am sure <lb/>
            that I have heard them from some one or other, either from the <lb/>
            beautiful Sappho, or the wise Anacreon, or some other writer. <lb/>
            Whence do I form this conjecture ? some how or other, my <lb/>
            divine friend, my breast is full, and I feel that I could say other <lb/>
            things in addition to those and not inferior to them. That I <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            understand none of them of myself, I am well aware, being <lb/>
            conscious of my ignorance. It remains then, I think, that I <lb/>
            must have filled myself, like a vessel, by means of hearing, from <lb/>
            some foreign source; but owing to my stupidity I have for­ <lb/>
            gotten even this, both how and from whom I heard it.</p>
          <p>25. Phæ. You have told me excellent news, my noble friend. <lb/>
            For though you cannot tell me from whom and how you heard <lb/>
            it, even if I bid you, yet do the very thing that you say; promise <lb/>
            that you will say other things better and not less in quality <lb/>
            than those contained in the book, without making use of any <lb/>
            thing in it. And I promise you, after the manner of the nine <lb/>
            Archons, that I will dedicate at Delphi, a golden statue as large <lb/>
            as life, not only of myself, but also of you.</p>
          <p>Socr. You are very kind, Phædrus, and really worth your <lb/>
            weight in gold, if you suppose I mean that Lysias was en­ <lb/>
            tirely wrong, and that it is possible to say something alto­ <lb/>
            gether different from what he has said; for I do not think <lb/>
            that this could happen even to the poorest writer. 26. For <lb/>
            instance with respect to the subject in hand; do you think <lb/>
            that any one who was maintaining that favours ought to be <lb/>
            shewn to one who is not in love rather than to one who is, if <lb/>
            he neglected to extol the prudence of the former and to blame <lb/>
            the folly of the latter, these being obvious points, could have <lb/>
            any thing else to say ? But I think that such points are to be <lb/>
            allowed and granted to a speaker, and that of such things not <lb/>
            the invention but the method of handling is to be praised, but <lb/>
            of things which are obvious, and which are not difficult to dis­ <lb/>
            cover, the invention as well as the method of handling.</p>
          <p>Phæ. I grant what you say; for you appear to me to have <lb/>
            spoken fairly. I will therefore do thus; I will allow you to sup­ <lb/>
            pose that one who is in love is more diseased than one who is <lb/>
            not, but for the rest if you say other things more fully and of <lb/>
            greater weight than Lysias, you shall stand in Olympia, of <lb/>
            solid gold, near the offering of the Cypselidæ.</p>
          <p>27. Socr. You are quite serious, Phædrus, because in teas­ <lb/>
            ing you I have attacked your favourite, and you think that I <lb/>
            shall really attempt to say something more skilfully wrought <lb/>
            than his wisdom has produced.</p>
          <p>Phæ. For that matter, my friend, you have given me as <lb/>
            good a hold on you; for you must speak, at all events, as well <lb/>
            as you are able. And take care that we are not compelled to <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            have recourse to that troublesome method of comedians, of <lb/>
            retorting upon one another, and do not compel me to sayc, <lb/>
            " If I, Socrates! know not Socrates, I have also forgotten <lb/>
            myself," and, " he longed to speak, but affected shyness." But <lb/>
            make up your mind that we shall not leave this spot before you <lb/>
            have given utterance to what you said you have in your breast. <lb/>
            For we two are by ourselves, in a lonely place, and I am both <lb/>
            stronger and younger; from all this understand what I mean, <lb/>
            and on no account prefer speaking by compulsion rather than <lb/>
            willingly.</p>
          <p>28. Socr. But, my excellent Phædrus, it would be ridiculous <lb/>
            in me, who am but a novice in comparison with an experienced <lb/>
            author, to attempt to speak extempore on the same subject.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Do you know how the case stands ? Let me have no <lb/>
            more of your airs; for I have that to say which will force you <lb/>
            to speak.</p>
          <p>Socr. On no account say it then.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Nay, but I will say it. And what I have to say is an <lb/>
            oath. For I swear to you, by whom, by what god? shall it be <lb/>
            by this plane-tree ? that unless you make a speech to me before <lb/>
            this very tree, I will never again either shew or repeat to you <lb/>
            another speech by any one whomsoever.</p>
          <p>Socr. Ah, wicked one! how well have you found out how <lb/>
            to compel a lover of speeches to do whatever you bid him.</p>
          <p>Phas. Why then do you hesitate ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I shall not any longer, since you have sworn this oath. <lb/>
            For how should I ever be able to debar myself of such a feast?</p>
          <p>Phas. Begin then.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you know then, what I mean to do ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. About what?</p>
          <p>Socr. I shall speak with my face covered, that I may run <lb/>
            through my speech as quickly as possible, and that I may not, <lb/>
            by looking at you, be put out through shame.</p>
          <p>Phas. Do but speak; and as to the rest, do as you please.</p>
          <p>29. Socr. Come then, ye Muses, whether from the charac­ <lb/>
            ter of your song, ye are called tuneful d, or whether ye derive <lb/>
            this appellation from the musical race of the Ligyans, assist <lb/>

            that so his friend, who heretofore appeared to him to be wise, <lb/>
            may now appear still more so.</p>
          <p>There was onee a boy; or rather a youth, of exceeding <lb/>
            beauty; and he had very many lovers. One of them was a <lb/>
            cunning fellow; who though he was no less in love than the <lb/>
            rest, persuaded the boy that he was not in love. And once, <lb/>
            as he was courting him, he endeavoured to persuade him that <lb/>
            favour ought to be shewn to one who was not in love, in pre­ <lb/>
            ferenee to one who was. And he spoke as follows.</p>
          <p>On every subject, my boy, there is one method of beginning, <lb/>
            for those who mean to deliberate well; they must know what <lb/>
            the thing is about winch the deliberation is to be, or else of <lb/>
            necessity go altogether astray. But it has escaped the notice <lb/>
            of most men that they do not know the essence of each several <lb/>
            thing. As if they did know, then, they do not agree with <lb/>
            each other at the outset of the enquiry, and as they proceed <lb/>
            they pay the probable penalty, for they agree neither with <lb/>
            themselves nor with each other. Let not you and I, then, fall <lb/>
            into the error which we condemn in others, but since the ques­ <lb/>
            tion proposed to us is, whether we ought rather to enter into <lb/>
            a friendship with one who is in love or not, having by mutual <lb/>
            agreement settled on a definition of love, what it is, and what <lb/>
            power it has, and looking back and referring to this, let us <lb/>
            prosecute our enquiry whether it occasions advantage or detri­ <lb/>
            ment. 30. That love, then, is a kind of desire, is clear to <lb/>
            every one; and we know that they who are not in love, desire <lb/>
            beautiful things. How then shall we distinguish a lover from <lb/>
            one who is not in love ? Here it is necessary to observe, that <lb/>
            in each of us there are two ruling and leading principles, which <lb/>
            we follow wherever they lead, one being an innate desire of <lb/>
            . pleasures, the other an acquired opinion, which aims at what <lb/>
            is most excellent. These sometimes agree in us, and some­ <lb/>
            times are at variance ; and sometimes one gets the upper hand, <lb/>
            at other times the other. When opinion therefore with the <lb/>
            aid of reason leads to that which is best, and gets the upper <lb/>
            hand, we give the name of temperance to this power; but <lb/>
            when desire drags us irrationally to pleasures and rules within <lb/>
            us, this ruling power takes the name of excess. But excess <lb/>
            has many names; for it has many limbs and many forms. <lb/>
            31. And of these principles whichever happens to get the <lb/>
            predominance gives its own designation to the person who <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            possesses it, and that neither honourable nor worth acquir­ <lb/>
            ing. For instance with respect to food, desire that gets the <lb/>
            better of the highest reason, and of the other desires, will be <lb/>
            called gluttony, and will cause the person who possesses it to <lb/>
            be called by the same name; again with respect to drinking, <lb/>
            when it has usurped dominion, by leading its possessor in this <lb/>
            direction, it is clear what designation it will acquire : and with <lb/>
            respect to other things akin to these, and the names of kindred <lb/>
            desires, it is manifest how they ought to be called, according <lb/>
            v as each for the time being happens to be dominant. Why all <lb/>
            this has been said is already pretty evident, but every thing <lb/>
            becomes in a manner more clear by being mentioned than if <lb/>
            not mentioned. 32. For desire without reason having got <lb/>
            the upper hand of opinion that tends to what is right, and <lb/>
            being driven towards the pleasure derived from beauty, and <lb/>
            being strongly impelled by its kindred desires to corporeal <lb/>
            beauty, receives its name from this very strength and is called <lb/>
            lovee. But, my dear Phsedrus, do I appear to you, as I do <lb/>
            to myself, to be moved by some divine influence ?</p>
          <p>PIlæ. Assuredly, Socrates, an unusual fluency has got posses­ <lb/>
            sion of you.</p>
          <p>Socr. Listen to me then in silence. For in truth tile place <lb/>
            appears to be divine. If, therefore, in the progress of my <lb/>
            speech I should be frequently entranced by the genius of the <lb/>
            spot, you must not be surprized. For what I utter now is <lb/>
            not very far removed from dithyrambics.</p>
          <p>Phæ. You say most truly.</p>
          <p>33. Socr. Of this, however, you are the cause. But hear <lb/>
            the rest; for perhaps the attack of the trance may be averted: <lb/>
            though this will be the care of the deity, but let us again direct <lb/>
            our discourse to the boy.</p>
          <p>Well then, my excellent boy, what that is, about which we <lb/>
            are to deliberate, has been declared and defined. Keeping <lb/>
            this in view, then, let us proceed to consider what advantage <lb/>
            or detriment will probably accrue from one who is in love and <lb/>
            one who is not, to him that shews favour to them.</p>
          <p>He that is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure, must <lb/>
            necessarily, I think, endeavour to make the object of his love <note type="footnote"> e I have followed Stallbaum in omitting the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐῤῥωμένως</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νική­ <lb/>
            σασα</foreign>, but still fear that I have failed to convey the full meaning of this <lb/>
            difficult and corrupt passage. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            as agreeable to himself as possible. But to one diseased every <lb/>
            thing is pleasant that does not oppose his wishes; but that <lb/>
            which is superior and equal is hateful to him. A lover there­ <lb/>
            fore will never willingly allow his favourite to be either superior <lb/>
            to or on an equality with himself, but is always endeavouring <lb/>
            to make him inferior and more deficient. An ignorant person <lb/>
            is inferior to a wise one, a coward to a brave one, one who is <lb/>
            unable to speak to a rhetorician, a dull to a clever one. 34. <lb/>
            Since so many evils, and even more than these, are engendered <lb/>
            or naturally exist in the mind of the beloved object, the lover <lb/>
            must of necessity rejoice at the existence of the one sort and <lb/>
            endeavour to introduce the others, or be deprived of immediate <lb/>
            pleasure. He must therefore needs be envious, and by debar­ <lb/>
            ring his favourite from much other and that profitable society, <lb/>
            whence he might become most manly, he is the occasion of <lb/>
            great harm, and of the greatest by debarring him of that <lb/>
            by means of which he would become most wise; and this is <lb/>
            divine philosophy, from which a lover must needs keep his <lb/>
            favourite at a distance, through the fear of being despised; <lb/>
            and must so manage every thing else, that he may be ignorant <lb/>
            of every thing, and look to the lover for every thing, thus being <lb/>
            most agreeable to him, but most detrimental to himself. As <lb/>
            concerns the mind, then, a man that is in love is in no respect <lb/>
            a profitable guardian and companion.</p>
          <p>But as to the habit and care of the body, what it will be and <lb/>
            how he will attend to it, of which a man has become the lord, <lb/>
            who is compelled to pursue the pleasant in preference to the <lb/>
            good, is next to be considered. 35. He will be seen pursuing <lb/>
            some delicate and not hardy youth, not reared in the open air <lb/>
            but under the shade of mingled trees, a stranger to manly toil, <lb/>
            and dry sweats, but no stranger to a delicate and effeminate <lb/>
            mode of life, adorned with foreign colours and ornaments, <lb/>
            through want of such as are natural, and studious of all such <lb/>
            other things as accompany these : what they are, is clear, and <lb/>
            it is not worth while to enter into further detail; but having <lb/>
            summed them up under one head, we will proceed to another <lb/>
            part of our subject. Such a body both in battle and other <lb/>
            great emergencies, enemies will look upon with confidence, but <lb/>
            friends and lovers themselves will fear for. This, however, as <lb/>
            sufficiently evident, may be dismissed. 36. In the next place <lb/>
            we must declare what advantage or what detriment, with <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            respect to our possessions, the society and guardianship of one <lb/>
            in love will occasion. But this indeed is manifest to every <lb/>
            one, and especially to a lover, that he would desire above all <lb/>
            things that the object of his love should be bereft of his <lb/>
            dearest, fondest, and holiest treasures: for he would have him <lb/>
            gladly deprived of father and mother, kindred and friends, <lb/>
            thinking that they are an hindrance to, and blamers of the <lb/>
            sweetest intercourse with him. Moreover if he has abundance <lb/>
            of gold, or any other property, he will think that he cannot be <lb/>
            so easily caught, nor when caught easily managed. Where­ <lb/>
            fore it must of necessity happen that a lover should grudge his <lb/>
            favourite possession of abundance, and should rejoice at its <lb/>
            loss. Further still, a lover will wish his favourite to continue <lb/>
            as long as possible without a wife, without child, and without <lb/>
            home, from a desire to enjoy his own delights for as long a <lb/>
            time as possible. 37. There are, indeed, other evils besides <lb/>
            these, but some deity has mingled present pleasure with most <lb/>
            of them : with a flatterer, for instance, a dreadful beast and <lb/>
            great bane, nature has nevertheless mingled a kind of pleasure <lb/>
            that is by no means inelegant. And some one perhaps may <lb/>
            blame a mistress as detrimental, and many other similar crea­ <lb/>
            tures and pursuits, which for the day, however, afford the <lb/>
            greatest enjoyment; but to a favourite, a lover besides being <lb/>
            detrimental, is the most disagreeable of all for daily intercourse. <lb/>
            For the ancient proverb says, that equal delights in equal; I <lb/>
            suppose, because an equality of age leading to equal pleasures <lb/>
            produces friendship by similarity of tastes. But still the in­ <lb/>
            tercourse even of these brings satiety: and moreover, neces­ <lb/>
            sity is said to be irksome to every one in every thing ; and this <lb/>
            in addition to their dissimilarity is especially the case with a <lb/>
            lover towards his favourite. 38. For an old man who associ­ <lb/>
            ates with a young one, does not willingly leave him, either by <lb/>
            day or night, but is driven on by necessity and frenzy, which <lb/>
            leads him on by constantly giving him pleasure, through seeing, <lb/>
            hearing, touching, and by every sense feeling the presence of <lb/>
            the beloved object, so that he would with pleasure cling con­ <lb/>
            stantly to him : but by giving what solace or what pleasures to <lb/>
            the object of his love, can he prevent him during an intercourse <lb/>
            of equal duration, from feeling the utmost disgust, while he <lb/>
            sees a face old and no longer in its bloom, with the other things <lb/>
            that accompany it, which are unpleasant even to hear spoken <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            of, much more so to have actually to do with from an ever­ <lb/>
            pressing necessity ; when he has too to keep a suspicious watch <lb/>
            over himself at all times and in all company, and has to listen <lb/>
            to unreasonable and extravagant praises, and reproaches as <lb/>
            well, which when the lover is sober are intolerable, and when he <lb/>
            is drunk, are not only intolerable but disgraceful from the <lb/>
            loathsome and undisguised freedom of his language. 39. Thus <lb/>
            he that is in love is detrimental and disgusting, but when he <lb/>
            ceases to love, he is thenceforth unfaithful towards him who by <lb/>
            many promises and with many oaths and entreaties he could <lb/>
            hardly prevail on at that time to endure his troublesome fami­ <lb/>
            liarity in the hope of advantage. But now, when payment <lb/>
            ought to be made, having received within himself another <lb/>
            ruler and master, reason and prudence, instead of love and <lb/>
            madness, he has become another man unknown to his favourite. <lb/>
            He then demands a return for former favours, reminding him of <lb/>
            what was done and said, as if he was talking to the same <lb/>
            person; but the other through shame, dares neither say that <lb/>
            he has become another man, nor is he able to adhere to the <lb/>
            oaths and promises of the former insensate reign, now that he <lb/>
            has got possession of his senses and has become prudent, fear­ <lb/>
            ing lest, by doing the same things as before, he should become <lb/>
            like what he was, and the same thing again. 40. Hence he <lb/>
            becomes a runaway, and of necessity a defrauder, who was <lb/>
            before a lover, and the shell being turned f, he changes from <lb/>
            pursuit to flight; but the other is forced to pursue him with <lb/>
            indignation and curses, having been ignorant from the very <lb/>
            beginning that he ought never to have granted favours to one <lb/>
            that is in love and of necessity out of his senses, but much <lb/>
            rather to one who is not in love, and in his right mind ; other­ <lb/>
            wise he must necessarily give himself up to one that is unfaith­ <lb/>
            ful, morose, envious, disgusting, detrimental to his property, <lb/>
            detrimental to his bodily habit, but far more detrimental to the <lb/>
            cultivation of his soul, than which in truth there neither is nor <lb/>
            ever will be any thing more precious in the sight of gods and <lb/>
            men. It is right, therefore, my boy, to reflect on these things, <lb/>
            and to know that the attachment of a lover is not united with <note type="footnote"> f In allusion to a game among children, in which a shell, white on one <lb/>
            side and black on the other, was thrown up into the air, and according as <lb/>
            either side fell uppermost, one set of playmates ran off and the other <lb/>
            pursued, or vice versa. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            good will, but like food for the sake of repletion, " as wolves <lb/>
            love a lamb, so lovers love a boy."</p>
          <p>This is it, Phsedrus; you must not expect to hear me say <lb/>
            another word, but must let my speech end here.</p>
          <p>41. Phæ. But I thought it was only in the middle, and that <lb/>
            it would say as much about one who is not in love, that he <lb/>
            ought rather to be favoured, mentioning in turn what advan­ <lb/>
            tages he has. Why then, Socrates, do you stop short now ?</p>
          <p>Socr.Did you not observe, my excellent friend, that I was <lb/>
            now uttering epics, and no longer dithyrambics, and this while <lb/>
            giving expression to blame ? If then I should begin to praise <lb/>
            the other, what do you think would become of me ? Do you <lb/>
            not know that I shall be thrown into an exstacy by the <lb/>
            Nymphs, to whom you have purposely exposed me? I say <lb/>
            then, in one word, that whatever vices I have attributed to the <lb/>
            one, to the other the contrary advantages belong. What need <lb/>
            then is there for a long speech ? for enough has been said <lb/>
            about both. Thus the story will be treated as it ought to be <lb/>
            treated: I will, therefore, cross over the river and go home, <lb/>
            before I am compelled by you to do something more difficult.</p>
          <p>42. Phæ. Not yet, Socrates, before the heat has passed <lb/>
            away. Do you not see that it is now nearly high-noon, as it <lb/>
            is called ? Let us, then, remain here, and converse together <lb/>
            about what has been said, and as soon as it grows cool, we <lb/>
            will go home.</p>
          <p>Socr. You are a strange man for speeches, Phædrus, and <lb/>
            really wonderful. For I think that of all the speeches made <lb/>
            during your life-time no one has been the occasion of more <lb/>
            being made than yourself, whether by speaking them yourself, <lb/>
            or in some way or other compelling others. I except Simmias <lb/>
            of Thebes; but you far surpass all the rest. And now again <lb/>
            you appear to me to be the occasion of another speech being <lb/>
            made.</p>
          <p>Phæ. You do not announce war indeed. But how and <lb/>
            what speech is this ?</p>
          <p>43. Socr. When I was about to cross the river, my good <lb/>
            friend, the divine and wonted signal was given me, (it always <lb/>
            deters me from what I am about to do,) and I seemed to hear <lb/>
            a voice from this very spot, which would not suffer me to <lb/>
            depart before I had purified myself, as if I had committed <lb/>
            some offence against the deity. Now I am a prophet, though <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            not a very good one, but like bad writers, am good enough for <lb/>
            my own purposes. Accordingly, I clearly perceive my offence : <lb/>
            for, my friend, the soul is in some measure prophetic ; and <lb/>
            mine troubled me some time since as I was delivering the <lb/>
            speech, and some how I was cast down, as Ibycus says, for <lb/>
            fear I should offend the gods, and gain honour from men in <lb/>
            exchange. But now I perceive my offence.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What do you say it is ?</p>
          <p>Socr. A dreadful, dreadful speech, Phædrus, you both <lb/>
            brought here yourself, and compelled me to utter.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Foolish, and in some sort impious : and can any thing <lb/>
            be more dreadful than this ?</p>
          <p>44. Phæ. Nothing, if you say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? Do you not think that Love is son of <lb/>
            Venus, and a god ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. So it is said.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet not by Lysias, nor by that speech of yours which <lb/>
            was uttered through my mouth when bewitched by you. But <lb/>
            if Love be, as indeed he is, a god, or something divine, he can­ <lb/>
            not be in any respect evil; yet both our late speeches spoke of <lb/>
            him as such. In this therefore they committed an offence <lb/>
            against Love, besides their silliness was very amusing, in that <lb/>
            they said nothing sound or true, yet they prided themselves as <lb/>
            if they were something, because they might perhaps impose on <lb/>
            some simpletons and gain their approbation. It is necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, my friend, that I should purify myself. But there is <lb/>
            an ancient purification for those who offend in matters relating <lb/>
            to mythology, which Homer was not acquainted with, but <lb/>
            Stesichorus was. For, being deprived of sight for defaming <lb/>
            Helen, he was not ignorant like Homer, but as a friend of the <lb/>
            Muses, knew the cause, and immediately composed the follow­ <lb/>
            ing lines: " This tale is not true, thou didst not go on board <lb/>
            the well-benched ships, nor reach the towers of Troy." Thus <lb/>
            having composed this entire recantation as it is called, he im­ <lb/>
            mediately recovered his sight. I however, will be wiser than <lb/>
            them in this respect; for before I suffer any harm for defaming <lb/>
            Love, I will endeavour to present him my recantation, with my <lb/>
            head bare, and not, as before, covered through shame.</p>
          <p>45. Phæ. There is nothing, Socrates, that you could say to <lb/>
            me more agreeable than this.</p><pb n="319"/>
            
          <p>Socr. For, my good Phædrus, you must be sensible how <lb/>
            shamelessly both our speeches were composed, as well mine as <lb/>
            that which was read from the book. For, if any generous <lb/>
            man, and of mild disposition, who is either now in love with, <lb/>
            or has formerly been enamoured of another like himself, had <lb/>
            happened to hear us say that lovers contract violent enmities <lb/>
            for trifling causes, and are envious of, and detrimental to, their <lb/>
            favourites, can you suppose that he would do otherwise than <lb/>
            think he was listening to men brought up among sailors, and <lb/>
            who had never witnessed an ingenuous love, and would be far <lb/>
            from assenting to the censures we cast upon Love ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Probably he would, by Jupiter, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Out of respect to him, then, and fear of Love himself, <lb/>
            I am anxious to wash out as it were the brackish taste by a <lb/>
            sweet speech. And I advise Lysias, too, to write as soon as <lb/>
            possible, that it is proper, under similar circumstances, to fa­ <lb/>
            your a lover rather than one who is not in love.</p>
          <p>46. .hæ. You may be well assured that this will be done; <lb/>
            for, when you have spoken in praise of the lover, Lysias must <lb/>
            needs be compelled by me to write another speech on the same <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>Socr. This I believe, while you continue the man you are.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Speak then with confidence.</p>
          <p>Socr. But where is my boy, to whom I spoke ? that he may <lb/>
            hear this too, and may not, from not hearing it, hastily grant <lb/>
            favours to one who is not in love.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Here he is always very near to you, whenever you <lb/>
            want him.</p>
          <p>Socr. Understand then, my beautiful boy, that the former <lb/>
            speech was that of Phædrus, son. of Pythocles, a man of Myrr­ <lb/>
            hinus; but that which I am now about to deliver is the speech <lb/>
            of Stesichorus, son of Euphemus, of Himera. It must begin <lb/>
            thus:</p>
          <p>" The assertion is not true which declares that when a lover <lb/>
            is present favour ought rather to be shewn to one who is not <lb/>
            in love, because the one is mad and the other in his sober <lb/>
            senses. 47. For if it were universally true that madness is <lb/>
            evil, the assertion would be correct. But now the greatest <lb/>
            blessings we have spring from madness, when granted by di­ <lb/>
            vine bounty. For the prophetess at Delphi, and the priest­ <lb/>
            esses at Dodona, have, when mad, done many and noble ser­ <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            vices for Greece, both privately and publicly, but in their sober <lb/>
            senses, little or nothing. And if we were to speak of the Sybil <lb/>
            and others, who, employing prophetic inspiration, have cor­ <lb/>
            rectly predicted many things to many persons respecting the <lb/>
            future, we should be too prolix in relating what is known to <lb/>
            every one. 48. This, however, deserves to be adduced by way <lb/>
            of testimony, that such of the ancients as gave names to things <lb/>
            did not consider madness as disgraceful or a cause of reproach: <lb/>
            for they would not have attached this very name to that most <lb/>
            noble art by which the future is discerned, and have called it a <lb/>
            mad art; but considering it noble when it happens by the di­ <lb/>
            vine decree, they gave it this name; but the men of the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day, by ignorantly inserting the letter r, have called it the <lb/>
            prophetic art s. Since also with respect to the investigation of <lb/>
            the future by people in their senses, which Is made by means <lb/>
            of birds and other signs, inasmuch as men by means of reflec­ <lb/>
            tion, furnished themselves by human thought with intelligence <lb/>
            and information, they gave it the name of prognostication h, <lb/>
            which the moderns, by using the emphatic long o, now call <lb/>
            augury. But how much more perfect and valuable, then, pro­ <lb/>
            phecy is than augury, one name than the other, and one effect <lb/>
            than the other, by so much did the ancients testify that mad­ <lb/>
            ness is more noble than sound sense, that which comes from <lb/>
            God than that which proceeds from men. 49. Moreover, for <lb/>
            those dire diseases and afflictions, which continued in some' <lb/>
            families in consequence of ancient crimes committed by some <lb/>
            or other of them, madness springing up and prophesying to <lb/>
            those to whom it was proper, discovered a remedy, fleeing for <lb/>
            refuge to prayers and services of the gods, whence obtaining <lb/>
            purifications and atoning rites, it made him who possessed it <lb/>
            sound, both for the present and the future, by discovering to <lb/>
            him, who was rightly mad and possessed, a release from present <lb/>
            evils. There is a third possession and madness proceeding <lb/>
            from the Muses, which seizing upon a tender and chaste soul, <lb/>
            and rousing and inspiring it to the composition of odes and <note type="footnote"> g It is impossible, in an English version, to retain Plato's explanation <lb/>
            of the progressive application of kindred words ; if the unlearned reader <lb/>
            can decypher the following Greek letters he may possibly understand our <lb/>
            author's meaning; <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανία</foreign> is madness, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανική</foreign>, the mad art, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαντική</foreign>, the pro­ <lb/>
            phetic art. </note><note type="footnote"> h <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰονιστική</foreign>, prognostication, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰωνιστική</foreign>, augury. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            other species of poetry, by adorning the countless deeds of an­ <lb/>
            tiquity, instructs posterity. But he who without the madness <lb/>
            of the Muses approaches the gates of poesy under the persua­ <lb/>
            sion that by means of art he can become an efficient poet, both <lb/>
            himself fails in his purpose, and his poetry, being that of a sane <lb/>
            man, is thrown into the shade by the poetry of such as are mad.</p>
          <p>50. So great and even more noble effects of madness pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from the gods I am able to mention to you. Let us <lb/>
            not, therefore, be afraid of this, nor let any argument disturb <lb/>
            and frighten us so as to persuade us that we ought to prefer a <lb/>
            sane man as our friend in preference to one who is under the <lb/>
            influence of a divine impulse; but let him carry all the victory <lb/>
            when he was shewn this in addition, that love is sent by the <lb/>
            gods for no benefit to the lover and the beloved. But we, on <lb/>
            the other hand, must prove that such madness is given by the <lb/>
            gods, for the purpose of producing the highest happiness. Now <lb/>
            the proof will be incredible to the subtle, but credible to the <lb/>
            wise. It is necessary, therefore, first of all to understand the <lb/>
            truth with respect to the nature of the soul both divine and <lb/>
            human, by observing its affections and operations. 51. This <lb/>
            then is the beginning of the demonstration.</p>
          <p>Every soul is immortal: for whatever is continually moved is <lb/>
            immortal; but that which moves another and is moved by an­ <lb/>
            other, when it ceases to move, ceases to live. Therefore that <lb/>
            only which moves itself, since it does not quit itself, never <lb/>
            ceases to be moved, but is also the source and beginning of motion <lb/>
            to all other. things that are moved. But a beginning is uncre­ <lb/>
            ate : for every thing that is created must necessarily be created <lb/>
            from a beginning, but a beginning itself from nothing whatever; <lb/>
            for if a beginning were created from any thing, it would not be <lb/>
            a beginning. 52. Since then it is uncreate it must also of <lb/>
            necessity be indestructible; for should a beginning perish, it <lb/>
            could neither itself be ever created from any thing, nor any thing <lb/>
            else from it, since all things must be created from a beginning. <lb/>
            Thus then the beginning of motion is that which moves itself: <lb/>
            and this can neither perish nor be created, or all heaven and all <lb/>
            creation must collapse and come to a stand-still, and never <lb/>
            again have any means whereby it may be moved and created. <lb/>
            53. Since then it appears that that which is moved by itself is <lb/>
            immortal, no one will be ashamed to say that this is the very <lb/>
            essence and true notion of soul. For every bodv which is <note type="footnote"> y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            moved from without, is soulless, but that which is moved from <lb/>
            within of itself, possesses a soul, since this is the very nature of <lb/>
            soul. But if this be the case, that there is nothing else which <lb/>
            moves itself except soul, soul must necessarily be both uncreate <lb/>
            and immortal. This then may suffice for its immortality.</p>
          <p>But respecting its idea we must speak as follows: what it <lb/>
            is, would in every way require a divine and lengthened exposi­ <lb/>
            tion to tell, but what it is like, a human and a shorter one : in <lb/>
            this way then we will describe it. 54. Let it then be likened <lb/>
            to the combined power of a pair of winged steeds and a <lb/>
            charioteer. Now the horses and charioteers of the gods are all <lb/>
            both good themselves and of good extraction, but all others are <lb/>
            mixed. In the first place, then, our ruling power drives a pair <lb/>
            of steeds, in the next place, of these horses it has one that is <lb/>
            beautiful and noble, and of similar extraction, but the other is <lb/>
            of opposite extraction, and opposite character; our driving <lb/>
            therefore is necessarily difficult and troublesome. But we <lb/>
            must endeavour to explain in what respect an animal is called <lb/>
            mortal or immortal. All soul takes care of all that is without <lb/>
            soul, and goes about all heaven, appearing at different times in <lb/>
            different forms. 55. While it is perfect, then, and winged, it <lb/>
            soars aloft and governs the universe: but when it has lost its <lb/>
            wings it is borne downward, until it meets with something <lb/>
            solid, in which having taken up its abode, by assuming an <lb/>
            earthly body, which appears to move itself by means of its own <lb/>
            power, the whole together is called an animal, soul and body <lb/>
            compounded, and takes the appellation of mortal. But the <lb/>
            immortal derives its name from no deduction of reasoning, but <lb/>
            as we neither see, nor sufficiently understand God, we repre­ <lb/>
            sent him as an immortal animal possessed of soul, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of body, and these united together throughout all time. <lb/>
            Let these things, however, so be and be described as God <lb/>
            pleases. But let us now discover the cause of the loss of the <lb/>
            wings, why they fall off from the soul. It is something of the <lb/>
            following kind:</p>
          <p>56. The natural power of a wing, is to carry up heavy sub­ <lb/>
            stances by raising them aloft to the regions where the race of <lb/>
            the gods dwells; and of the parts connected with the body, it <lb/>
            probably partakes most largely of that which is divine. But <lb/>
            that which is divine is beautiful, wise, good, and every thing of <lb/>
            that kind. By these then the wings of the soul are chiefly <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            nourished and increased, but by what is base and vile, and <lb/>
            other similar contraries, it falls to decay and perishes. Now <lb/>
            the mighty chief in heaven, Jupiter, goes first, driving a winged <lb/>
            chariot, ordering and taking care of all things; and there <lb/>
            follows him a host of gods and demons, distributed into eleven <lb/>
            divisions, for Vesta remains alone in the dwelling of the gods: <lb/>
            but of the others all that have been assigned a station as chief <lb/>
            gods in the number of the twelve, lead in the order to which <lb/>
            they have been severally appointed. 57. But there are many <lb/>
            delightful sights and paths within heaven among which the <lb/>
            race of the blessed gods move, each performing his own proper <lb/>
            work; and whoso has both will and power accompanies them; <lb/>
            for envy stands aloof from the heavenly choir. But when they <lb/>
            proceed to a banquet and feast, they now ascend by an up-hill <lb/>
            path to the highest arch-of heaven: and the chariots of the <lb/>
            gods, which from being equally poised are obedient to the <lb/>
            rein, move easily, but all others with difficulty; for the horse <lb/>
            that partakes of vice weighs them down, leaning and pressing <lb/>
            heavily towards the earth, if he happens not to have been well <lb/>
            trained by his charioteer. Here then the severest toil and trial <lb/>
            is laid upon the soul. For those that are called immortal, <lb/>
            when they reach the summit, proceeding outside, stand on the <lb/>
            back of heaven, and while they are stationed here, its revolu­ <lb/>
            tion carries them round, and they behold the external regions <lb/>
            of heaven. 58. But the region above heaven no poet here has <lb/>
            ever yet sung of, nor ever will sing of, as it deserves. It is, <lb/>
            however, as follows: for surely I may venture to speak the <lb/>
            truth, especially as my subject is truth. For essence, that <lb/>
            really exists, colourless, formless and intangible, is visible only <lb/>
            to intelligence that guides the soul, and around it the family of <lb/>
            true science have this for their abode. As then the mind of <lb/>
            deity is nourished by intelligence and pure science, so the mind <lb/>
            of every soul that is about to receive what properly belongs to <lb/>
            it, when it sees after a long time that which is, is delighted, <lb/>
            and by contemplating the truth, is nourished and thrives, until <lb/>
            the revolution of heaven brings it round again to the same <lb/>
            point. And during this circuit it beholds justice herself. it <lb/>
            beholds temperance, it beholds science, not that to which <lb/>
            creation is annexed, nor that which is different in different <lb/>
            things of those which we call real, but that which is science in <lb/>
            what really is. And in like manner, having beheld all other <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            things that really are, and having feasted on them, it again <lb/>
            enters into the interior of heaven, and returns home. 59. And <lb/>
            on its return, the charioteer having taken his horses to the <lb/>
            manger, sets ambrosia before them, and afterwards gives them <lb/>
            nectar to drink. And this is the life of the gods.</p>
          <p>But, with respect to other souls, that which best follows <lb/>
            and imitates a god, raises the head of its charioteer to the <lb/>
            outer region, and is carried round with the rest in the revolu­ <lb/>
            tion, yet is confused by its horses, and scarcely able to behold <lb/>
            real existences; but another at one time rises, at another sinks, <lb/>
            and owing to the violence of the horses, partly sees, and partly <lb/>
            not. The rest follow, all eager for the upper region, but being <lb/>
            unable to reach it they are carried round sunk beneath the <lb/>
            surface, trampling on and striking against each other, in en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to get one before another. Hence the tumult, and <lb/>
            struggling, and sweating is extreme; and here through the <lb/>
            fault of the charioteers many are maimed, and many break <lb/>
            many of their feathers; and all of them having undergone <lb/>
            much toil depart without having succeeded in getting a view <lb/>
            of that which is, and after their departure they make use of <lb/>
            the food of mere opinion. 60. And this is the reason for the <lb/>
            great anxiety to behold the field of truth, where it is; the pro­ <lb/>
            per pasture for the best part of the soul happens to be in the <lb/>
            meadow there, and it is the nature of the wing by which the <lb/>
            soul is borne aloft, to be nourished by it; and this is a law of <lb/>
            Adrastiai, that whatever soul, in accompanying a deity, has <lb/>
            beheld any of the true essences, it shall be free from harm <lb/>
            until the next revolution, and if it can always accomplish this, <lb/>
            it shall be always free from harm : but whenever from inability <lb/>
            to keep up it has not seen any of them, and from meeting with <lb/>
            some misfortune, has been filled with oblivion and vice, and <lb/>
            so weighed down, and from being weighed down has lost its <lb/>
            wings, and fallen to the earth, then there is a law that this <lb/>
            soul should not be implanted in any brutal nature in its first <lb/>
            generation, but that the soul which has seen most, should <lb/>
            enter into the germ of a man who will become a philosopher <lb/>
            or a lover of the beautiful, or a votary of the Muses and Love ; <lb/>
            but that the second should enter into the form of a constitu­ <lb/>
            tional king, or a warrior and commander, the third into that of <lb/>
            a statesman, or economist, or merchant, the fourth into one <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, " an inevitable law." </note> <lb/>

            who loves the toil of gymnastic exercises, or who will be em­ <lb/>
            ployed in healing the body, the fifth will have a prophetic life <lb/>
            or one connected with the mysteries, to the sixth the poetic <lb/>
            life or some other of those employed in imitation will be best <lb/>
            adapted, to the seventh a mechanical or agricultural life, to the <lb/>
            eighth the life of a sophist or mob-courtier, to the ninth that <lb/>
            of a tyrant. 61. But among all these, whosoever passes his <lb/>
            life justly afterwards obtains a better lot, but who unjustly, a <lb/>
            worse one. For to the same place, whence each soul comes, <lb/>
            it does not return till the expiration of ten thousand years ; for <lb/>
            it does not recover its wings for so long a period, except it is <lb/>
            the soul of a sincere lover of wisdom, or of one who has made <lb/>
            philosophy his favouritek. But these in the third period of a <lb/>
            thousand years, if they have chosen this life thrice in succes­ <lb/>
            sion, thereupon depart, with their wings restored in the three <lb/>
            thousandth year. But the others, when they have ended their <lb/>
            first life, are brought to trial; and being sentenced, some go <lb/>
            to places of punishment beneath the earth and there suffer for <lb/>
            their sins, but others, being borne upwards by their sentence <lb/>
            to some region in heaven, pass their time in a manner worthy <lb/>
            of the life they have lived in human form. But in the thousandth <lb/>
            year, both kinds coming back again for the allotment and choice <lb/>
            of their second life, choose that which they severally please. <lb/>
            And here a human soul passes into the life of a beast, and from <lb/>
            a beast he who was once a man passes again into a man. 62. <lb/>
            For the soul which has never seen the truth, cannot come into <lb/>
            this form : for it is necessary that a maIl should understand ac­ <lb/>
            cording to a generic form, as it is called, which proceeding from <lb/>
            many perceptions is by reasoning combined into one. And <lb/>
            this is a recollection of those things which our soul formerly <lb/>
            saw when journeying with deity, despising the things which we <lb/>
            now say are, and looking up to that which really is. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, with justice, the mind of the philosopher is alone furnished <lb/>
            with wings; for, to the best of his power, his memory dwells <lb/>
            on those things, by the contemplation of which even deity is <lb/>
            divine. But a man who makes a right use of such memorials <lb/>
            as these, by constantly perfecting himself in perfect mysteries, <lb/>
            alone becomes truly perfect. And by keeping aloof from human <lb/>
            pursuits, and dwelling on that which is divine, he is found fault <note type="footnote"> k <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδεραστήσατος μετὰ φιλοσοφίας</foreign>. So in the Gorgias (§ 82) So­ <lb/>

            with by the multitude as out of his senses, but it escapes the <lb/>
            notice of the multitude that he is inspired.</p>
          <p>63. To this then comes our whole argument respecting the <lb/>
            fourth kind of madness, on account of which any one, who, on <lb/>
            seeing beauty in this lower world, being reminded of the true, <lb/>
            begins to recover his wings, and, having recovered them, longs <lb/>
            to soar aloft, but being unable to do it, looks upwards like a <lb/>
            bird, and despising things below, is deemed to be aflected with <lb/>
            madness. Our argument comes to this then, that this is the <lb/>
            best of all enthusiams, and of the best origin, both for him <lb/>
            who possesses and for him who partakes of it, and that he who <lb/>
            loves beautiful objects, by having a share of this madness, is <lb/>
            called a lover. For, as we have mentioned,. every soul of man <lb/>
            has, from its very nature, beheld real existences, or it would <lb/>
            not have entered into this human form; for it is not easy for <lb/>
            every one to call to mind former things from the present, neither <lb/>
            for those who then had but a brief view of the things there, <lb/>
            nor for those who after their fall hither, were so unfortunate as <lb/>
            to be turned aside by evil associations to injustice, and so to <lb/>
            have forgotten the sacred things they formerly beheld. Few <lb/>
            therefore are left who have sufficient memory. But these, <lb/>
            when they see any resemblance of the things there, are amazed <lb/>
            and no longer masters of themselves, and they know not what <lb/>
            this affection is, because they do not thoroughly perceive it. <lb/>
            64. Now of justice and temperance and whatever else souls <lb/>
            deem precious, there is no brightness in the resemblances here, <lb/>
            but by means of dull instruments with difficulty a few only, <lb/>
            on approaching the images, are able to discern the character of <lb/>
            that which is represented. But beauty was then splendid to <lb/>
            look on, when with that happy choir, we in company with <lb/>
            Jupiter, and others with some other of the gods, beheld that <lb/>
            blissful sight and spectacle, and were initiated into that which <lb/>
            may be rightly called the most blessed of all mysteries, which <lb/>
            we celebrated when we were whole and unaffected by the <lb/>
            evils that awaited us in time to come, and moreover when <lb/>
            we were initiated in, and beheld in the pure light, perfect, <lb/>
            simple, calm, and blessed visions, being ourselves pure, and as <lb/>
            yet unmasked with this which we now carry about with us and <lb/>
            call the body, fettered to it like an oyster to its shell.</p>
          <p>65. Let this much be said out of regard to memory, on <lb/>
            account of which, from a longing for former things, I have now <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            spoken at greater length than I ought. But with respect to <lb/>
            beauty, as we observed, she both shone among things there, <lb/>
            and on our coming hither we found her, through the clearest <lb/>
            of our senses, shining most clearly. For sight is the keenest <lb/>
            of our bodily senses, though wisdom is not. seen by it. For <lb/>
            vehement would be the love she would inspire, if she came <lb/>
            before our sight and shewed us any such clear image of herself, <lb/>
            and so would all other loveable things; but now beauty only <lb/>
            has this privilege of being most manifest and most lovely. <lb/>
            66. He, then, who has not been recently initiated, or who has <lb/>
            become corrupted, is not speedily carried hence thither to <lb/>
            beauty itself, by beholding here that which takes its name from <lb/>
            it. So that he does not reverence it when he beholds it, but, <lb/>
            giving himself up to pleasure, like a beast he attempts to <lb/>
            mount it and to have intercourse with it, and in his wanton <lb/>
            advances he is neither afraid nor ashamed of this unnatural <lb/>
            pursuit of pleasure. But he who has been recently initiated, <lb/>
            and who formerly beheld many things, when he sees a god­ <lb/>
            like countenance, or some bodily form that presents a good <lb/>
            imitation of beauty, at first shudders and some of the former <lb/>
            terrors come over him, then as he looks stedfastly at it, he <lb/>
            reverences it as a god, and if he did not dread the imputation <lb/>
            of excessive madness, he would sacrifice to his favourite, as to <lb/>
            a statue or a god. 67. But after he has beheld it, as commonly <lb/>
            happens, after shuddering, a change, a sweating and unusual <lb/>
            heat comes over him. For having received the emanation of <lb/>
            beauty through his eyes, he has become heated, so that the <lb/>
            wings that are natural to him are refreshed ; and by his being <lb/>
            heated, the parts where they grow are softened, which having <lb/>
            been long closed up through hardness prevented them from <lb/>
            shooting out. But when this nutriment flows in, the quill of <lb/>
            the wing begins to swell, and makes an effort to burst from <lb/>
            the root, beneath the whole form of the soul; for of old it was <lb/>
            all winged. In this state, then, the whole boils and throbs <lb/>
            violently, and as is the case with infants cutting their teeth, <lb/>
            when they are just growing out there is a pricking and sore­ <lb/>
            ness of the gums, in the same way the soul is affected of one <lb/>
            who is beginning to put forth his wings, it boils and is sore, <lb/>
            and itches as it puts them forth. 68. When, therefore, by <lb/>
            beholding the beauty of a boy, and receiving particles that <lb/>
            proceed and flow from thence, which are for that reason called <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            desire, it becomes refreshed and heated; it is relieved from <lb/>
            pain and filled with joy : but when it is separated and becomes <lb/>
            parched, the orifices of the passages through which the wing <lb/>
            shoots forth, become closed through drought and shut up the <lb/>
            germ of the wing. But it being shut in together with desire, <lb/>
            leaping like throbbing veins, strikes against each passage that <lb/>
            is shut against it, so that the whole soul, being pricked all <lb/>
            round, is frantic and in agony; but again retaining the <lb/>
            memory of the beautiful one, it is filled with joy. 69. And <lb/>
            from both these mingled together, it is tormented by the <lb/>
            strangeness of the affection, and not knowing what to do be­ <lb/>
            comes frenzied, and being in this frantic state it can neither <lb/>
            sleep at night, nor remain quiet by day, but runs about with <lb/>
            longing wherever it may hope to see the possessor of the <lb/>
            beauty. And on beholding him and drawing in fresh supplies <lb/>
            of desire, it loosens the parts that were closed up, and recover­ <lb/>
            ing breath has a respite from stings and throes, and again for <lb/>
            the present enjoys this most exquisite pleasure. Wherefore, it <lb/>
            never willingly leaves him, nor values any one more than the <lb/>
            beautiful one, but forgets mothers and brothers and friends all <lb/>
            alike, and if its substance is wasting through neglect, it reckons <lb/>
            that as of no consequence, and despising all customs and de­ <lb/>
            corums in which it formerly prided itself, it is ready to be a <lb/>
            slave and to lie down wherever any one will allow it as near as <lb/>
            possible to the object of its longing. For in addition to its <lb/>
            reverence for the possessor of beauty, it has found that he is <lb/>
            the only physician for its severest troubles.</p>
          <p>70. Now this affection, my beautiful boy, you I mean to <lb/>
            whom I am speaking, men call love, but when you hear what <lb/>
            the gods designate it, you will probably laugh, on account of <lb/>
            your youth. Some Homerics, I think, adduce out of their <lb/>
            secret poems two verses on love, of which the second is very <lb/>
            insolent, and not altogether delicate: they sing as follows : <lb/>
            " Him mortals indeed call winged Eros, but immortals Pteros <lb/>
            (Flyer) for his flighty nature 1."</p>
          <p>These verses then, you are at liberty to believe, or not; how­ <lb/>
            ever, this assuredly is the cause and the condition of lovers. <lb/>
            71. Now when one of the attendants upon Jupiter is seized, he <lb/>
            is able to bear with greater firmness the burden of the wing- <note type="footnote"> I I must own myself indebted to Air. Wright's version of this dialogue <lb/>
            for this happy translation of these two lines. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            named god; but such as are in the service of Mars and went <lb/>
            round heaven with him, when they are caught by Love, and <lb/>
            think that they are at all injured by the object of their love, are <lb/>
            blood-thirsty, and ready to immolate both themselves and their <lb/>
            favourite. And so with respect to each several god, whose <lb/>
            choir each followed, he spends his life in honouring and imitat­ <lb/>
            ing him to the best of his power, so long as he remains free <lb/>
            from corruption, and is living here his first generation; and in <lb/>
            this way he associates with and behaves to his beloved and all <lb/>
            others. 72. Every one, therefore, chooses his love out of the <lb/>
            objects of beauty according to his own taste, and, as if he <lb/>
            were a god to him, he fashions and adorns him like a statue, as <lb/>
            if for the purpose of reverencing him and celebrating orgies in <lb/>
            his honour. They then that are followers of Jupiter seek for <lb/>
            some one who resembles Jupiter in his soul, to be the object of <lb/>
            his love. They therefore consider whether he is by nature a <lb/>
            lover of wisdom, and fitted to command; and when, on finding <lb/>
            one, they have become enamoured of him, they do every thing in <lb/>
            their power to make him such. If, then, they have not already <lb/>
            entered upon this study, they now set about it, and learn it <lb/>
            from whatever source they can, and themselves pursue it; and <lb/>
            by endeavouring to discover of themselves the nature of their <lb/>
            own deity, they succeed by being compelled to look stedfastly on <lb/>
            their god, and when they grasp him with their memory, being <lb/>
            inspired by him, they receive from him their manners and pur­ <lb/>
            suits, as far it is possible for man to participate of deity. <lb/>
            73. And considering the object of their love as the cause of <lb/>
            all this, they love him still more, and if they have drawn their <lb/>
            inspiration from Jupiter, like the Bacchanals, they pour it <lb/>
            into the soul of their beloved, and make him as much as possi­ <lb/>
            ble resemble their own god. But such as attended Juno seek <lb/>
            after a royal favourite, and when they have found one, they act <lb/>
            towards him in precisely the same manner. And such as at­ <lb/>
            tended Apollo, and each of the other gods, following the exam­ <lb/>
            ple of their several deities, desire that their favourite may have <lb/>
            a corresponding character, and when they have gained such an <lb/>
            one, both by imitation on their own part, and by persuading <lb/>
            and alluring their favourite, they lead him to the peculiar pur­ <lb/>
            suit and character of that god ; not, indeed, by employing envy <lb/>
            or illiberal severity towards their favourite, but endeavouring <lb/>
            by every means in their power to lead him to a perfect resem­ <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            blance of themselves and their god, they act accordingly. <lb/>
            74. A zeal, then, on the part of those who truly love, and an <lb/>
            initiation, as I call it, if they succeed in what they desire, so <lb/>
            beautiful and blessed, falls to the lot of the beloved one at the <lb/>
            hands of him that is maddened by love, if only he be won. But <lb/>
            he that is won, is won in the following manner.</p>
          <p>As in the beginning of this account I divided each soul into <lb/>
            three parts, two of them having the form of horses, and the <lb/>
            third that of a charioteer, so let us still maintain that division: <lb/>
            but of the horses, one, we said, was good and the other not: <lb/>
            what however is the virtue of the good one, or the vice of the <lb/>
            bad one, we have not yet explained, but must now declare. <lb/>
            That one of them, then, which is in the nobler condition, is in <lb/>
            form erect, finely-moulded, high-necked, hook-nosed, white- <lb/>
            coloured, black-eyed, a lover of honour, with temperance and <lb/>
            modesty, and a companion of true glory, without the whip is <lb/>
            driven by word of command and voice only: the other, on the <lb/>
            other hand, is crooked, thick set, clumsily put together, strong- <lb/>
            necked, short-throated, flat-faced, black-coloured, gray-eyed, <lb/>
            hot-blooded, a companion of insolence and swaggering, shaggy <lb/>
            about the ears, deaf, scarcely obedient to whip and spur toge­ <lb/>
            ther. 75. When, therefore, the charioteer beholds the love- <lb/>
            inspiring sight, his whole soul becoming heated by sensation, <lb/>
            he is filled with irritation and the stings of desire, the horse that <lb/>
            is obedient to the charioteer, then as ever, overpowered by shame <lb/>
            restrains himself from leaping on the beloved object: but the <lb/>
            other, no longer heeds either the whip or the spurs of the <lb/>
            charioteer, but bounding forward is carried violently along, <lb/>
            and giving every kind of trouble to his yoke-fellow and the <lb/>
            charioteer, compels them to hurry to the favourite, and to in­ <lb/>
            dulge in the delights of love. They at first resist from indig­ <lb/>
            nation at being compelled to such a dreadful and lawless <lb/>
            course: but at length, when there is no end to the evil, they <lb/>
            go on as they are led, having submitted and consented to do what <lb/>
            they are ordered; and now they come up to him and behold <lb/>
            the gleaming countenance of the favourite. 76. But the memory <lb/>
            of the charioteer when he beholds him is carried back to the <lb/>
            nature of absolute beauty, and again sees her together with <lb/>
            temperance standing on a chaste pedestal. And, on beholding, <lb/>
            itm shudders, and awe-struck falls down backward, and at the <note type="footnote"> m " It," memory. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            same time is compelled to draw back the reins so violently, as <lb/>
            to throw both the horses on their haunches, the one indeed <lb/>
            willingly, from his not resisting, but the insolent one very <lb/>
            much against his will. When they have withdrawn to some <lb/>
            distance, the former through shame and amazement drenches <lb/>
            the whole soul with sweat, but the other, having got rid of the <lb/>
            pain which he suffered from the bit and the fall, when he has <lb/>
            scarcely recovered his breath, bursts out into passionate revil­ <lb/>
            ings, vehemently reproaches the charioteer and his yoke-fellow, <lb/>
            for having abandoned their station and compact from cowardice <lb/>
            and effeminacy. And again compelling them against their <lb/>
            wills to approach, he with difficulty yields to their entreaties <lb/>
            to defer it to a future time. 77. But when the time agreed on <lb/>
            comes, reminding them who pretend to forget it, plunging, <lb/>
            neighing, and dragging forward, he compels them again to <lb/>
            approach the favourite for the same purpose. And when they <lb/>
            are near, bending down his head and extending his spear, he <lb/>
            champs the bit and drags them on with wantonness. But <lb/>
            the charioteer being affected as before, though more strongly, <lb/>
            as if he were falling back from the starting rope, pulls back <lb/>
            the bit with still greater violence from the teeth of the insolent <lb/>
            horse, and covers his railing tongue and jaws with blood, and <lb/>
            forcing his legs and haunches to the ground, tortures him with <lb/>
            pain. 78. But when by being often treated in the same way, <lb/>
            the vicious horse has laid aside his insolence, being humbled <lb/>
            he henceforth follows the directions of the charioteer, and when <lb/>
            he beholds the beautiful object, he swoons through fear. So <lb/>
            that it comes to pass, that thenceforth the soul of the lover <lb/>
            follows its favourite-with reverence and awe. Since then he is <lb/>
            worshipped with all observance as if he were a god, not by a <lb/>
            lover who feigns the passion, but who really feels it, and since <lb/>
            he is by nature inclined to friendship, he directs his affection <lb/>
            to accord with that of his worshipper, even though in past <lb/>
            times he may have been misled by his associates or some <lb/>
            others, who told him that it was disgraceful to allow a lover to <lb/>
            approach him, and he may for this reason have rejected his <lb/>
            lover, yet in process of time his age and destiny induce him to <lb/>
            admit his lover to familiarity. 79. For surely it was never <lb/>
            decreed by fate, that the evil should be a friend to the evil, or <lb/>
            the good not a friend to the good. When, therefore, he has <lb/>
            admitted him and accepted his conversation and society, the <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            benevolence of the lover being brought into close contact <lb/>
            astonishes the beloved, when he perceives that all his other <lb/>
            friends and relatives together exhibited no friendship at all to­ <lb/>
            wards him in comparison with his inspired friend. But when <lb/>
            he has spent some time in doing this, and has approached <lb/>
            so near as to come in contact in the gymnastic schools and <lb/>
            other places of social intercourse, then the fountain of that <lb/>
            stream to which Jupiter, when in love with Ganymede, gave <lb/>
            the name of desire, streaming in great abundance upon the <lb/>
            lover, partly sinks into him, and partly flows out from him <lb/>
            when he is full. And as a wind or any sound rebounding <lb/>
            from smooth and hard substances, is borne back again to the <lb/>
            place from whence it proceeded, so this stream of beauty, <lb/>
            .flowing back again to the beautiful one through the eyes, by <lb/>
            which way it naturally enters the soul, and having returned <lb/>
            thither and fledged itself anew, refreshes the outlets of the <lb/>
            feathers, and moves him to put forth wings, and in turn fills <lb/>
            the soul of the beloved one with love. 80. Accordingly he is <lb/>
            in love, but with whom he knows not; neither is he aware <lb/>
            nor is he able to tell what has happened to him, but like a person <lb/>
            who has caught a disease in the eyes from another, he is unable <lb/>
            to assign the cause, and is not aware that he beholds himself in <lb/>
            his lover, as in a mirror. And when the lover is present, he <lb/>
            is freed from pain in the same way as the lover is; but, when <lb/>
            he is absent, he in turn longs for him in the same manner that <lb/>
            he is longed for, possessing love's image, love returned; but he <lb/>
            calls it and considers it to be not love but friendship. And he <lb/>
            desires, in the same way as the lover, though more feebly, to <lb/>
            see, to touch, to kiss, to lie down with him; and, as is probable, <lb/>
            he soon afterwards does all this. 81. In this lying down <lb/>
            together, then, the unbridled horse of the lover has something <lb/>
            to say to its charioteer, and begs to be allowed some small en­ <lb/>
            joyment in recompence for his many toils, but the same horse <lb/>
            of the favourite has nothing to say, but swelling with love <lb/>
            and in doubt, embraces the lover, and kisses him as he would <lb/>
            kiss a very dear friend, and when they are laid down together, <lb/>
            he is unable to refuse, as far as in his power, to gratify his <lb/>
            lover in whatever he requires. But his yoke-fellow, together <lb/>
            with the charioteer, resists this familiarity with shame and rea­ <lb/>
            son. If, then, the better parts of their mind have prevailed <lb/>
            so as to lead them to a well-regulated mode of living and phi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            losophy, they pass their life here in bliss and concord, having ob­ <lb/>
            tained the mastery over themselves, and being orderly, through <lb/>
            having brought into subjection that part of the soul in which vice <lb/>
            was engendered, and having set free that in which was virtue: <lb/>
            and when they depart this life, becoming winged and light, they <lb/>
            have been victorious in one of the three truly Olympic con­ <lb/>
            tests, a greater good than which neither human prudence nor <lb/>
            divine madness can possibly bestow on man. 82. If, however, <lb/>
            they have adopted a coarser and less philosophic mode of liv­ <lb/>
            ing, yet still honourable, but perhaps in a fit of drunkenness <lb/>
            or some other thoughtless moment, their two unbridled beasts <lb/>
            finding their souls unguarded, and bringing them together to <lb/>
            one place, have made and consummated that choice which <lb/>
            most men deem blissful; and having once consummated it <lb/>
            they continue to practise it for the future, though rarely, in <lb/>
            that they are doing what is not approved by their whole mind. <lb/>
            These too, then, pass their life dear to each other, but less so <lb/>
            than the others, both during the period of love and after it, <lb/>
            thinking that they have both given to and received from each <lb/>
            other the strongest pledges, which it were impious to vio­ <lb/>
            late, and so at any time become alienated. 83. But in the <lb/>
            end, without wings indeed, yet making an effort to become <lb/>
            winged, they quit the body, so as to carry off no trifling prize <lb/>
            of impassioned madness: for there is a law that those who <lb/>
            have already set out in the heavenward path should never <lb/>
            again enter on darkness and the paths beneath the earth, but <lb/>
            that, passing a splendid life, they should be happy walking <lb/>
            with each other, and that, for their love's sake, whenever they <lb/>
            become winged, they should be winged together.</p>
          <p>These so great and divine things, my boy, will the affection <lb/>
            of a lover confer on you. But the familiarity of one who is <lb/>
            not in love, being mingled with mortal prudence, and dispens­ <lb/>
            in- mortal and niggardly gifts, generating in the beloved soul <lb/>
            an illiberality which is praised by the multitude as virtue, will <lb/>
            cause it to be tossed about the earth and beneath the earth for <lb/>
            nine thousand years, devoid of intelligence. 84. To thee, be­ <lb/>
            loved Love, this recantation, the most beautiful and the best, <lb/>
            according to my ability, is presented and duly paid, both in <lb/>
            other respects and by certain poetical phrases, of necessity, <lb/>
            adorned for the sake of Phsedrus. But do thou, pardoning my' <lb/>
            former speech, and graciously accepting this, propitiously and <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            benignly, neither take from me the art of love which thou hast <lb/>
            given me, nor maim it in thy wrath, but grant that even more <lb/>
            than now I may be honoured by the beautiful. And if, in our <lb/>
            former speech, Phædrus and I have said any thing offensive to <lb/>
            thee, blaming Lysias as the author of the speech, make him <lb/>
            desist from such speeches in future, and convert him to philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, as his brother Polemarchus has been converted, so that <lb/>
            this lover of his may no longer remain neutral as now, but <lb/>
            may wholly devote his life to love, in conjunction with philo­ <lb/>
            sophic discourses.</p>
          <p>Pltæ. I join with you in praying, Socrates, that if this is better <lb/>
            for us, so it may be. 85. But I have been long wondering at <lb/>
            your speech, how much more beautiful you have made it than <lb/>
            the former one ; so that I am afraid that Lysias will appear to <lb/>
            me but poor, even if he should be willing to produce another in <lb/>
            opposition to it. For only the other day, my admirable friend, <lb/>
            one of our public men, as he was attacking him, upbraided <lb/>
            him with this very thing, and throughout the whole of his at­ <lb/>
            tack called him a writer of speeches. Perhaps, therefore, for <lb/>
            ambition's sake he will refrain from writing any more.</p>
          <p>Socr. The opinion you express, my youth, is ridiculous; <lb/>
            and you very much mistake your friend, if you imagine him to <lb/>
            be so easily frightened. Perhaps, too, you think that his assail­ <lb/>
            ant really meant what he said.</p>
          <p>86. Phæ. He seemed to do so, Socrates ; and you are doubt­ <lb/>
            less yourself aware, that the most powerful and considerable <lb/>
            men in a city are ashamed to write speeches, and to leave their <lb/>
            own compositions behind them, through fear of the opinion of <lb/>
            posterity, lest they should be called sophists.</p>
          <p>Socr. It has escaped your notice, Phædrus, that the proverb <lb/>
            " a sweet bend" is derived from that long bend in the Nile: <lb/>
            and as well as the bend, it escapes your notice, that these pub­ <lb/>
            lic men who think most highly of themselves are most fond of <lb/>
            writing speeches, and of leaving their compositions behind <lb/>
            them; and moreover, whenever they write a speech, they so <lb/>
            love its supporters, that they prefix their names who on each <lb/>
            occasion commend them.</p>
          <p>87. Phæ. How do you mean? for I don't understand you.</p>
          <p>Socr. Don't you understand, that at the beginning of a states­ <lb/>
            man's writing, the name of its supporter is written first.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How?</p><pb n="335"/>
            
          <p>Socr. " Approved," I think the writing itself says, " by the <lb/>
            council, or the people, or both," and he who proposed it, speak­ <lb/>
            ing very pompously of and extolling himself, namely the com­ <lb/>
            poser, after this makes a speech so as to display his own wisdom <lb/>
            to his supporters, sometimes making a very long composition. <lb/>
            Does this appear to you to be any thing else than a written <lb/>
            speech ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. It does not to me.</p>
          <p>88. Socr. If, then, it happens to be approved, the composer <lb/>
            goes home from the theatre delighted. But if it should be rubbed <lb/>
            out, and he debarred from writing speeches, and from the dig­ <lb/>
            nity of an author, both he and his friends take it greatly to <lb/>
            heart.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is clear, then, that they do not despise this practice, <lb/>
            but admire it exceedingly.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Certainly. <lb/>
            |</p>
          <p>Socr. What then, when an orator or a king has proved himself competent to assume the power of a Lycurgus, or a <lb/>
            Solon, or a Darius, and to become immortal as a speech-writer <lb/>
            in a state, does he not deem himself godlike, while he is yet <lb/>
            alive, and do not posterity think the very same of his writings ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>89. Socr. Do you think then that any person of this sort, <lb/>
            however ill-disposed he may be towards Lysias, would upbraid <lb/>
            him merely because he is a writer ?</p>
          <p>Phas. It does not seem probable from what you say; for in <lb/>
            that case, as it appears, he would upbraid his own passion.</p>
          <p>Socr. This, then, must be clear to every one, that the mere <lb/>
            writing of speeches is not disgraceful.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Why should it be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But this I think now is disgraceful, not to express <lb/>
            and write them well, but shamefully and ill.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Clearly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then is the method of writing well or ill ? Have <lb/>
            we not occasion, Phædrus, to enquire about this from Lysias <lb/>
            or some one else, who has at some time or other written or <lb/>
            means to write, either a political or private composition, in <lb/>
            metre as a poet, or without metre as a prose-writer ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Do you ask, if we have occasion ? For what purpose <lb/>
            in the world should any one live, but for the sake of pleasures <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            of this kind ? Not, surely, for those which cannot even be <lb/>
            enjoyed unless they are preceded by pain, which is the case <lb/>
            with nearly all the pleasures connected with the body; on <lb/>
            which account they are justly called servile.</p>
          <p>90. Socr. We have leisure, however, as it seems: and more­ <lb/>
            over the grasshoppers, while, as is their wont in the heat of the <lb/>
            day, they are singing over our heads and talking with one ano­ <lb/>
            ther, appear to me to be looking down upon us. If, then, <lb/>
            they should see us too, like most men, not conversing at mid- <lb/>
            day, but falling asleep and lulled by them, through indolence <lb/>
            of mind, they would justly laugh us to scorn, thinking that <lb/>
            some slaves or other had come to them in this retreat, in <lb/>
            order like sheep to take a mid-day sleep by the side of the <lb/>
            fountain. But if they see us conversing, and sailing by them, <lb/>
            as if they were Syrens unenchanted, the boon which they have <lb/>
            from the gods to confer upon men, they will perhaps out of <lb/>
            admiration bestow upon us.</p>
          <p>Phæ. But what is this that they have ? For I happen not <lb/>
            to have heard of it, as it seems.</p>
          <p>- Socr. Yet it is not proper that a lover of the Muses should <lb/>
            not have heard of things of this kind. It is said, then, that <lb/>
            these grasshoppers were men before the Muses were born; <lb/>
            but that when the Muses were born, and song appeared, some <lb/>
            of the men of that time were so overcome by pleasure, that <lb/>
            through singing they neglected to eat and drink, until they <lb/>
            died unawares. 91. From these the race of grasshoppers <lb/>
            afterwards sprung, having received this boon from the Muses, <lb/>
            that they should need no nourishment from the time of their <lb/>
            birth, but should continue singing without food and without <lb/>
            drink till they died, and that after that they should go to the <lb/>
            Muses and inform them who of those here honoured each of <lb/>
            them. Therefore by informing Terpsichore of those who <lb/>
            honour her in the dance they make them dearer to her; and <lb/>
            Erato they inform of her votaries in love; and so all the rest in <lb/>
            a similar manner, according to the kind of honour belonging to <lb/>
            each. But. the eldest, Calliope, and next to her Urania, they <lb/>
            tell of those who pass their lives in philosophy, and honour <lb/>
            their music; and these most of all the Muses, being conver­ <lb/>
            sant with heaven, and discourse both divine and human, pour <lb/>
            forth the most beautiful strains. For many reasons, therefore, <lb/>
            we should converse and not sleep at mid-day.</p><pb n="337"/>
            
          <p>Phæ. We should converse, indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, as we lately proposed to consider, we should <lb/>
            enquire in what consists a correct method of speaking and <lb/>
            writing, and in what not.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Evidently.</p>
          <p>92. Socr. Is it not, then, essential, in order to a good and <lb/>
            beautiful speech being made, that the mind of the speaker <lb/>
            should know the truth of the subject on which he is about to <lb/>
            speak ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. I have heard say on this subject, my dear Socrates, <lb/>
            that it is not necessary for one who purposes to be an orator to <lb/>
            learn what is really just, but what would appear so to the mul­ <lb/>
            titude, who will have to judge; nor what is really good or <lb/>
            beautiful, but what will appear so: for that persuasion pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds from these, and not from truth.</p>
          <p>Socr. We ought not to reject a saying", which wise men <lb/>
            utter, but should consider whether they say any thing worth <lb/>
            attending to. Wherefore we must not pass by what you have <lb/>
            now said.</p>
          <p>93. Phæ. You are right.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us then consider it as follows.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How?</p>
          <p>Socr. Suppose I should persuade you to purchase a horse <lb/>
            for the purpose of repelling enemies, but both of us should be <lb/>
            ignorant what a horse is, suppose, however, I did happen to <lb/>
            know this much, that Phsedrus believes a horse to be that <lb/>
            tame animal which has the longest ears.</p>
          <p>Phæ. That would be ridiculous indeed, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Wait a moment: if I should earnestly persuade you, <lb/>
            by composing a speech in praise of the ass, calling him a horse, <lb/>
            and asserting that it is well worth while to purchase this beast <lb/>
            both for domestic purposes and for military service, that he is <lb/>
            useful to fight from, and able to carry baggage, and serviceable <lb/>
            in many other respects.</p>
          <p>Phæ. This, now, would be perfectly ridiculous.</p>
          <p>Socr. But is it not better that a friend should be ridiculous, <lb/>
            than dangerous and mischievous ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Clearly so.</p>
          <p>94. Socr. When an orator, therefore, who is ignorant of <lb/>
            good and evil, having found a city that is likewise so, en­ <note type="footnote">n An expression taken from Homer, Iliad, ii. 65. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            deavours to persuade it, not by celebrating the praises of an <lb/>
            ass's shadowo, as if it were a horse, but of evil, as if it were <lb/>
            good, and having studied the opinions of the multitude should <lb/>
            persuade them to do evil instead of good, what kind of fruit do <lb/>
            you suppose rhetoric will afterwards reap from such a sowing?</p>
          <p>Phæ. By no means a good one.</p>
          <p>Socr. But have we not, my good friend, reviled the art of <lb/>
            speaking more roughly than is proper ? for she may, perhaps, <lb/>
            say: " Why, sirs, do you talk so foolishly ? For I compel no <lb/>
            one who is ignorant of the truth to learn how to speak: but if <lb/>
            my advice is worth any thing, when he has acquired that, he <lb/>
            then has recourse to me. This, then, I insist on, that without <lb/>
            me one who knows the truth will not for all that be able to <lb/>
            persuade by art."</p>
          <p>Phæ. Will she not speak justly, in asserting this ?</p>
          <p>95. Socr. I admit it, at least if the arguments that assail <lb/>
            her testify that she is an art. For I think I have heard some <lb/>
            arguments coming up and insisting that she lies and is not an <lb/>
            art, but an inartistic trick. But a genuine art of speaking, <lb/>
            says the Spartan, without laying hold of truth, neither exists, <lb/>
            nor ever can exist hereafter.</p>
          <p>PhaS. We must have these arguments, Socrates; so bring <lb/>
            them forward and examine what they say, and in what manner.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come hither then, ye noble creatures, and persuade <lb/>
            Phædrus with the beautiful children, that, unless he has suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently studied philosophy, he will never be competent to <lb/>
            speak on any subject whatever. Let Phsedrus answer then.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Put your questions.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must not then rhetoric in general be an art that leads <lb/>
            the soul by means of argument, not only in courts of justice, <lb/>
            and other public assemblies, but also in private, equally with <lb/>
            respect to trivial and important matters ? and is its right use <lb/>
            at all more valued when employed about grave than about <lb/>
            trifling things ? What have you heard said about this ?</p>
          <p>96. Phæ. By Jupiter, nothing at all of this kind; but it is <lb/>
            for the most part spoken and written according to art in <lb/>
            judicial trials, and it is spoken also in popular assemblies; but <lb/>
            I have never heard any thing further.</p>
          <p>Socr. What, have you heard only of the rhetorical arts of <note type="footnote"> 0 A proverb meaning " a thing of no value." See Suidas <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕνου σκιά</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            Nestor and Ulysses, which they composed during their leisure <lb/>
            in Ilium, and have you never heard of those by Palamedes ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. And, by Jupiter, I have not even heard of those by <lb/>
            Nestor, unless you make Gorgias a Nestor, or Thrasymachus <lb/>
            and Theodorus a Ulysses.</p>
          <p>Socr. Perhaps I do. But let us pass over these; do you <lb/>
            say however; in courts of justice what do adversaries do? do <lb/>
            they not contradict each other ? or what shall we say ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. That very thing.</p>
          <p>Socr. And respecting the just and unjust ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will not he, then, who accomplishes this by art, make <lb/>
            the same thing appear to the same persons, at one time just, <lb/>
            and, when he pleases, unjust ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. And in a popular assembly the same things seem to <lb/>
            the state at one time good, and at another the contrary ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>97. Socr. And do we not know that the Eleatic Palamedes P <lb/>
            spoke by art in such a manner that the same things appeared <lb/>
            to his hearers similar and dissimilar, one and many, at rest <lb/>
            and in motion ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Boer. The art, then, of arguing on both sides has not only to <lb/>
            do with courts of justice and popular assemblies, but as it <lb/>
            seems, it must be one and the same art, if it is an art, with <lb/>
            respect to all subjects of discourse, by which a man is able to <lb/>
            make all things appear similar to each other so far as they are <lb/>
            capable of being made appear so, and to drag them to light, <lb/>
            when another attempts to make them appear similar and con­ <lb/>
            ceals his attempt.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What mean you by this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I think it will be evident if we enquire as follows : <lb/>
            Does deception more frequently occur in things that differ <lb/>
            much or little ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. In things that differ little.</p>
          <p>Socr. But by changing your position gradually; you will <lb/>
            more easily escape detection in going to the opposite side, than <lb/>
            by doing so rapidly. <note type="footnote"> P By Palamedes, as the Scholiast observes, he means Zeno of Elea, the <lb/>
            friend of Parmenides. </note></p><pb n="340"/>
            
          <p>98. Phæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. It is necessary, then, that he who means to deceive <lb/>
            another, but not be deceived himself, should be able to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish with accuracy the similarity and dissimilarity of things.</p>
          <p>Phæ. It is indeed necessary.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will he be able, then, if ignorant of the truth of each <lb/>
            particular thing, to discern the smaller or greater similarity of <lb/>
            the thing of which he is ignorant, in other things ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Impossible.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is clear, therefore, that in the case of those who <lb/>
            have formed opinions contrary to the truth and are deceived, <lb/>
            this error has found its way in by means of certain resemblances.</p>
          <p>99. PAce. It doubtlessly does happen so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it possible, then, that one, who is ignorant of what <lb/>
            is the nature of each particular thing, should have sufficient <lb/>
            art to bring over any one by degrees by leading him through <lb/>
            means of resemblances, from each several truth to its opposite, <lb/>
            or himself to escape from being so led ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Never.</p>
          <p>Socr. He therefore, my friend, who does not know the <lb/>
            truth, but hunts after opinions, will, as it appears, produce but <lb/>
            a ridiculous and inartistic art of speaking.</p>
          <p>Phœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are you willing, then, in the speech of Lysias, which <lb/>
            you have with you, and in those which I delivered, to look for <lb/>
            instances of what I assert is inartistic and artistic ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. I should like it of all things ; for now we are speak­ <lb/>
            ing in a bald sort of way, for want of sufficient examples.</p>
          <p>100. Socr. And, indeed, by some lucky chance, as it seems, <lb/>
            two speeches have been made which furnish examples, of how <lb/>
            one who is acquainted with the truth, while he is jesting in <lb/>
            his arguments, can lead his hearers astray. And for my part, <lb/>
            Phsedrus, I attribute that to the deities of the spot. Perhaps, <lb/>
            also, the interpreters of the Muses, the songsters over head, <lb/>
            have inspired us with this gift; for I at least have no part in <lb/>
            any art of speaking.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Be it as you say, only make your meaning clear.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, read out to me the beginning of Lysias's <lb/>
            speech.</p>
          <p>100. Phæ. " You are well acquainted with the state of my <lb/>
            affairs, and I think you have heard that it would be for our <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            advantage if this took place. And I claim, not for this reason <lb/>
            to fail in ray request, because I do not happen to be one of <lb/>
            your lovers : for they repent"-</p>
          <p>Socr. Stop. We are to say, then, in what he errs, and acts <lb/>
            inartistically : are we not ?</p>
          <p>PAce. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now is it not plain to every one, that in some things <lb/>
            of this kind we are agreed, on others at variance ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. I think I understand what you mean; but explain <lb/>
            yourself still more clearly.</p>
          <p>Socr. When any one pronounces the word iron or silver, do <lb/>
            we not all understand the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what when any one pronounces the word just, or <lb/>
            good ? are we not carried different ways, and do we not differ <lb/>
            both with one another and with ourselves ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. In some things, therefore, we agree, in others not.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. In which class of things, then, are we more easily <lb/>
            deceived ? and in which of the two has rhetoric greater power ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Clearly in that in which we are easily led astray.</p>
          <p>102. Socr. He, therefore, who means to pursue the art of <lb/>
            rhetoric, ought first of all to have distinguished these methodi­ <lb/>
            cally, and to have discovered a certain character of each species, <lb/>
            both of that in which the generality of men must necessarily <lb/>
            be led astray, and of that in which that is not the case.</p>
          <p>'Phæ. He who has attained to this, Socrates, will have <lb/>
            devised a noble classification of species.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then, I think, when he comes to each particular case, <lb/>
            he ought not to be at a loss, but should perceive quickly to <lb/>
            which of the two classes the subject, on which he is going to <lb/>
            speak, belongs.</p>
          <p>Phos. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. What then with respect to Love ? shall we say that he <lb/>
            belongs to things doubtful, or to such as are not so ?</p>
          <p>PAce. To things doubtful, surely; otherwise do you think <lb/>
            he would have allowed you to say what you just now said <lb/>
            about him, that he is both a mischief to the beloved and the <lb/>
            lover, and again, that he is the greatest of blessings ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You speak admirably. But tell me this too, for from <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            being carried away by enthusiasm, I do not quite remember <lb/>
            whether I defined love at the beginning of my speech.</p>
          <p>Phæ. By Jupiter you did, and with wonderful accuracy.</p>
          <p>103. Socr. Alas; how much more artistic in speech-making <lb/>
            do you say the nymphs of Acheloiis and Pan son of Mercury <lb/>
            are than Lysias son of Cephalus! Or am I wrong, and did <lb/>
            Lysias too, in the beginning of his love-speech, compel us to <lb/>
            conceive of Love, as some one particular thing, which he wished <lb/>
            it to be, and then complete all the rest of his speech in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with this ? Are you willing that we should read over <lb/>
            again the beginning of his speech ? '</p>
          <p>Phæ. If you wish it; though what you seek is not there.</p>
          <p>Socr. Read, however, that I may hear him in person.</p>
          <p>104. Phæ. " You are well acquainted with the state of my <lb/>
            affairs, and I think you have heard, that it would be for our <lb/>
            advantage if this took place. And I claim, not for this reason <lb/>
            to fail in my request, because I do not happen to be one of <lb/>
            your lovers: for they repent of the benefits they have conferred, <lb/>
            as soon as their desires cease."</p>
          <p>Socr. He seems to be far indeed from doing what we are <lb/>
            seeking for, since in making his speech he attempts to swim <lb/>
            backwards, with his face uppermost, not setting out from the <lb/>
            beginning, but from the end, and he begins with what the lover <lb/>
            would say to his favourite at the close of his speech. Have I <lb/>
            said nothing to the purpose, Phædrus, my dear friend ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. It is indeed, Socrates, the end of the subject about <lb/>
            which he is speaking,</p>
          <p>105. Socr. But what as to the rest? do not the other parts <lb/>
            of the speech appear to have been put together at random? <lb/>
            or does it appear that what is said in the second place ought <lb/>
            from any necessity to have been placed second, or any thing <lb/>
            else that he said ? For it seems to me, who however know <lb/>
            nothing about the matter, that the writer has without any <lb/>
            scruple said whatever came uppermost, But do you know of <lb/>
            any rule in speech-writing, in conformity to which he disposed <lb/>
            his sentences in the order he has done one after another ?</p>
          <p>PAce. You are pleasant, in supposing that I am able to see <lb/>
            through his compositions so accurately.</p>
          <p>Socr. But this at least I think you will allow, that every <lb/>
            speech ought to be put together like a living creature, with a <lb/>
            body of its own, so as to be neither without head, nor without <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            feet, but to have both a middle and extremities, described pro­ <lb/>
            portionately to each other and to the whole.</p>
          <p>106. Phæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider, then, your friend's speech, whether it is so <lb/>
            or otherwise ; and you will find that it is in no respect different <lb/>
            from the epigram which some say is inscribed on the tomb of <lb/>
            Midas the Phrygian.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What is it, and what is there remarkable in it ?</p>
          <p>Socr. It is as follows; <lb/>
            " I am a maiden of brass and I lie on Midas's sepulchre, <lb/>
            So long as water flows and tall trees flourish, <lb/>
            Remaining here on the tomb of Midas, <lb/>
            I will tell all passers by, that Midas is buried here."</p>
          <p>That it makes no difference which line is put first or last, you <lb/>
            must perceive, I think.</p>
          <p>Phæ. You are jesting at our speech, Socrates.</p>
          <p>107. Socr. That you may not be angry, then, we will have <lb/>
            done with this ; (though it appears to me to contain very many <lb/>
            examples, which any one might examine with advantage, so <lb/>
            long as he does not at all attempt to imitate them ;) and let us <lb/>
            proceed to the two other speeches; for there was something in <lb/>
            them, I think, fit to be looked into by those who wish to ex­ <lb/>
            amine into the subject of speeches.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Socr. They were in a manner opposed to each other. For <lb/>
            one said that favour ought to be shewn to a person that is in <lb/>
            love, the other to a person that is not in love.</p>
          <p>Phæ. And this, most strenuously.</p>
          <p>Socr. I thought you were going to say, with truth, madly. <lb/>
            However, this is the very thing I was seeking for. For we <lb/>
            said that love was a kind of madness, did we not ?</p>
          <p>.hæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But there are two kinds of madness, one arising from <lb/>
            human diseases, the other from an inspired deviation from <lb/>
            established customs.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>108. Socr. But dividing the divine mania of the four deities <lb/>
            into four parts, and assigning prophetic inspiration to Apollo, <lb/>
            mystic to Bacchus, poetic to the Muses, and the fourth to Venus <lb/>
            and Love, we said that the madness of Love is the best, <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            and I know not how representing the passion of love, pro­ <lb/>
            bably lighting on some truth and perhaps earned off elsewhere, <lb/>
            we compounded a speech not altogether improbable, and <lb/>
            sang a kind of mythical hymn, in a seemly and devotional <lb/>
            manner, in honour of my lord and thine, Phædrus, Love, the <lb/>
            guardian of beautiful boys.</p>
          <p>Phæ. And one by no means unpleasant to me to hear.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us endeavour to find out, then, from the speech <lb/>
            itself, how it was able to pass from censure to praise.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What mean you by this ?</p>
          <p>109. Socr. To me it appears that in all other respects we <lb/>
            have really been jesting; but as regards the two methods q that <lb/>
            are seen in these casually uttered speeches, if any one could <lb/>
            apprehend their power by art, it would be by no means an <lb/>
            unwelcome circumstance.</p>
          <p>Pha. What methods are these ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The one is to see under one aspect and to bring to­ <lb/>
            gether under one general idea, many things scattered in various <lb/>
            places, that, by defining each, a person may make it clear what <lb/>
            the subject is that he wishes to discuss, as just now with re­ <lb/>
            spect to love, its nature being defined, whether it was well or <lb/>
            ill described; at all events for that reason my speech was <lb/>
            able to attain perspicuity and consistency.</p>
          <p>Phæ. And what is the other method you speak of, So­ <lb/>
            crates ?</p>
          <p>110. Soer. The being able, on the other hand, to separate <lb/>
            that general idea into species, by joints, as nature points out, <lb/>
            and not to attempt to break any part, after the manner of an un­ <lb/>
            skilful cook; but as, just now, my two speeches comprehended <lb/>
            mental derangement under one common class. But as from one <lb/>
            body there spring two sets of members bearing the same name, <lb/>
            one called the left the other the right, so my speeches having <lb/>
            considered mental derangement as naturally one class in us, <lb/>
            then the speech that had to divide the left part, did not leave <lb/>
            off dividing this again until having found in its members a kind <lb/>
            of left-handed love, it reviled it deservedly: but the other <lb/>
            taking us to the right hand side of madness, and having found <lb/>
            a kind of love bearing the same name as the former, but <lb/>
            divine, brought it to light and commended it as the cause of <lb/>
            the greatest blessings to us. <note type="footnote"> q The two methods are "definition" and "division," afterwards explained. </note></p><pb n="345"/>
            
          <p>111. Phæ. You speak most truly. r r</p>
          <p>Socr. For my part, Phsedrus, I am not only myself a lover <lb/>
            of these divisions and generalisations, in order that I may be <lb/>
            able both to speak and think; but if I perceive any one else <lb/>
            able to comprehend the one and the many, as they are in <lb/>
            nature, him "I follow behind as in the footsteps of a god r." <lb/>
            But whether I designate those who are able to do this, rightly <lb/>
            or not, God knows, however I have hitherto called them dialec­ <lb/>
            ticians. But now, tell me by what name ought we to call those <lb/>
            who take lessons from you and Lysias ? is this that art of <lb/>
            speaking, by the use of which Thrasymachus and others have <lb/>
            become able speakers themselves, and make others so who are <lb/>
            willing to bring presents to them, as to kings ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. They are indeed royal men, yet not skilled in the <lb/>
            particulars about which you enquire. However you appear to <lb/>
            me to call this method rightly, in calling it dialectical; but the <lb/>
            rhetorical appears to me still to escape us.</p>
          <p>112. Socr. How say you? A fine thing indeed that must be, <lb/>
            which is destitute of this and yet can be apprehended by art. <lb/>
            It must on no account be neglected by you and me; but we <lb/>
            must consider what is the remaining part of rhetoric.</p>
          <p>Phæ. There are indeed very many things, Socrates, which <lb/>
            you will find in the books written on the art of speaking.</p>
          <p>Socr. You have reminded me very opportunely, The ex­ <lb/>
            ordium, I think, must first be spoken at the beginning of the <lb/>
            speech. You mean these, do you not? the refinements of <lb/>
            the art?</p>
          <p>Phce. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And secondly a kind of narration, and evidence to <lb/>
            support it; thirdly, proofs; fourthly, probabilities; and I think <lb/>
            „ that a famous Byzantian tricker-out of speeches mentions con­ <lb/>
            firmation and after-confirmation.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Do you mean the excellent Theodorus?</p>
          <p>Socr. I do. He says, too, that refutation and after-refuta­ <lb/>
            tion must be employed both in accusation and defence. And <lb/>
            must we not adduce the most illustrious Parian, Evenus, who <lb/>
            first discovered subordinate intimations and bye-praises? and <lb/>
            some say that he put into metre bye-censures, to assist the <lb/>
            memory: for he is a wise man. 113. But shall we suffer <lb/>
            Tisias and Gorgias to sleep, who found out that probabilities <note type="footnote"> r See Homer's Odyssey, v. 193. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            were more to be valued than truths, and who by force of words <lb/>
            make small things appear great, and great things small, and <lb/>
            new things old, and the contrary new, and who discovered a <lb/>
            concise method of speaking and an infinite prolixity on all sub­ <lb/>
            jects? When Prodicus once heard me tell this, he laughed, <lb/>
            and said that he alone had discovered what speeches are <lb/>
            required by art; that we require them neither long nor short, <lb/>
            but of a moderate length.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Most wisely, Prodicus.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do we not mention Hippias? for I think our <lb/>
            Elean friend was of the same opinion with him.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Why not?</p>
          <p>114. Socr. But how shall we describe Polus's new-fangled <lb/>
            method of speaking, as his reduplication of words, his sen­ <lb/>
            tences, his similitudes, and the words which Licymnius made <lb/>
            him a present of, in order to produce a graceful diction.</p>
          <p>Phæ. But was not the system of Protagoras, Socrates, some­ <lb/>
            thing of this kind ?</p>
          <p>Socr. His was a correctness of diction, my boy, and many <lb/>
            other fine things besides, but in the art of dragging in speeches <lb/>
            to excite commiseration for old age and poverty, the Chalce­ <lb/>
            donian hero appears to me to have carried off the palm. He <lb/>
            was moreover a powerful man to rouse the anger of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude, and again, when enraged, to soothe them by enchantment, <lb/>
            as he used to say; he was most skilful in raising and removing <lb/>
            calumnies, on any ground whatever. But all seem to agree in <lb/>
            the same opinion with respect to the conclusion of speeches, to <lb/>
            which some have given the name of recapitulation, others a <lb/>
            different'name.</p>
          <p>Pha. You mean the summarily reminding the hearers, at <lb/>
            the conclusion, of the several things that have been said.</p>
          <p>115. Socr. I mean that, and now consider if you have any <lb/>
            thing else to say about the art of speaking.</p>
          <p>Pha. Only some trifling things, and not worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us pass over trifles; and rather examine these <lb/>
            things in the clear light, and see what influence they have in <lb/>
            art, and on what occasion.</p>
          <p>Phæ. A very powerful influence, Socrates, at least in assem­ <lb/>
            blies of the people.</p>
          <p>Socr. They have indeed. But, my admirable friend, do you <lb/>
            also observe whether their web does not appear to you to be <lb/>
            very wide as it does to me.</p><pb n="347"/>
            
          <p>Thæ. Explain what you mean.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me then: If any one should go to your friend <lb/>
            Eryximachus, or his father Acumenus, and should say, " I <lb/>
            know how to apply such things to the body, as will make it <lb/>
            warm or cold, as I please, and if I think proper, I can produce <lb/>
            vomitings, and again purgings, and many other things of the <lb/>
            kind, and as I know these things I consider myself a physician, <lb/>
            and that I can make any one else so, to whom I impart the <lb/>
            knowledge of these particulars :" what do you think they would <lb/>
            say on hearing this ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. What else, but ask him if he knew besides to what per­ <lb/>
            sons, and when, and how far, he ought to do each of these things ?</p>
          <p>116. Socr. If then, he should say, " Not in the least; but I <lb/>
            expect that he who should learn these things from me, would <lb/>
            be able to do what you ask ?"</p>
          <p>Phæ. He would say, I think, that the man is mad; and that, <lb/>
            having heard from some book or other, or having met with <lb/>
            certain drugs, he fancies that he has become a physician, though <lb/>
            he knows nothing at all about the art.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what if any one were to go to Sophocles and <lb/>
            Euripides, and tell them, that he knew how to make very long <lb/>
            speeches on a trifling subject, and very short ones on a great <lb/>
            subject, and whenever he pleased, piteous and contrariwise, ter­ <lb/>
            rible and threatening speeches, and other things of the kind, <lb/>
            and that by teaching these he thought he could impart the <lb/>
            power of writing tragedy ?</p>
          <p>117. PAce. They too, I think, Socrates, would laugh, if any <lb/>
            one should suppose that tragedy was any thing else than the <lb/>
            composition of all these, so disposed as to be consistent with <lb/>
            each other and the whole.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, I think, they would not upbraid him rudely, but <lb/>
            as a musician, who happened to meet with a man who believes <lb/>
            himself to be skilled in harmony, because he knows how to <lb/>
            make the highest and lowest note, would not harshly say to him, <lb/>
            " Miserable fellow, you are stark mad;" but, being a musician, <lb/>
            he would speak more mildly; " My excellent man, it is indeed <lb/>
            necessary for one who means to be skilled in harmony, to know <lb/>
            these things, but at the same time there is nothing to hinder a <lb/>
            person from possessing the knowledge you have without his <lb/>
            understanding harmony in. the least; for you know what is <lb/>
            necessary to be learnt before harmony, but not harmony itself."</p><pb n="348"/>
            
          <p>Phæ. Most correctly.</p>
          <p>118. Socr. In like manner, Sophocles might reply to the <lb/>
            person who displayed his learning to them, that he knew the <lb/>
            things before tragedy, but not tragedy itself; and Acume­ <lb/>
            nus, that the medical pretender knew things before medicine, <lb/>
            but not medicine itself.</p>
          <p>PAce. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what must we think the sweet-voiced Adrastus, <lb/>
            or even Pericles would do, if they were to hear of the beautiful <lb/>
            contrivances which we have just now enumerated, the short <lb/>
            sentences and similitudes, and all the rest, which when we went <lb/>
            through them, we said must be examined by the clear light, <lb/>
            whether they, as you and I did, would rudely make some ill­ <lb/>
            mannered remark against those who had written and who teach <lb/>
            such things as if they constituted the art of rhetoric, or, as <lb/>
            being wiser than we are, would they not reprove us, saying, 119. <lb/>
            " Phsedrus and Socrates, you ought not to be angry with, but <lb/>
            rather to excuse those who, through being ignorant of dialectics, <lb/>
            are unable to define what rhetoric is, and who, in consequence <lb/>
            of this ignorance, possessing the things necessary to be learnt <lb/>
            preparatory to the art, think that they have discovered rhetoric <lb/>
            itself, and, suppose that by teaching these things to others, they <lb/>
            can teach them rhetoric in perfection; but how each of them <lb/>
            is to be used persuasively, and the whole combined together, <lb/>
            this, as being of no consequence in the world, they think their <lb/>
            pupils ought to acquire for themselves in composing their <lb/>
            speeches."</p>
          <p>PAce. Such indeed, Socrates, appears to be the case with the <lb/>
            art which these men teach and write about as rhetoric; and <lb/>
            you seem to me to have spoken the truth: but how and from <lb/>
            whence can one acquire the art of true rhetoric and per­ <lb/>
            suasion?</p>
          <p>120. Socr. The ability, Phsedrus, to become a perfect pro­ <lb/>
            ficient, probably, or rather necessarily, depends on the same <lb/>
            things as in other cases: for, if you naturally possess rhetorical <lb/>
            abilities, you will be a distinguished orator by adding science <lb/>
            and practice; but in whichever of these you are deficient, in <lb/>
            that respect you will be imperfect. But so far as it is an art, <lb/>
            its method, I think, will not be found in the way that Lysias <lb/>
            and Thrasymachus are proceeding.</p>
          <p>Phæ. In what way then ?</p><pb n="349"/>
            
          <p>Socr. Pericles, my excellent friend, appears, with good rea­ <lb/>
            son, to have been the most perfect of all men in rhetoric.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. All the great arts require a subtle and speculative re­ <lb/>
            search into the law of nature: for that loftiness of thought <lb/>
            and perfect mastery over every subject seems to be derived <lb/>
            from some such source as this; which Pericles possessed in <lb/>
            addition to a great natural genius. For meeting, I think, with <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, who was a person of this kind, and being filled <lb/>
            with speculative research, and having arrived at the nature of <lb/>
            intelligence and want of intelligence, about which Anaxagoras <lb/>
            made that long discourse, he drew from thence to the art of <lb/>
            speaking whatever could contribute to its advantage.</p>
          <p>121. Phæ. What mean you by this?</p>
          <p>Socr. The method of the art of rhetoric is, in a manner, the <lb/>
            same as that of medicine.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. In both it is requisite that nature should be thoroughly <lb/>
            investigated, the nature of the body in the one, and the soul in <lb/>
            the other, if you mean not only by practice and experience, but <lb/>
            by art, to give health and strength to the former by applying <lb/>
            medicine and diet, and to impart such persuasion as you please <lb/>
            and virtue to the latter, by means of speeches and legitimate <lb/>
            employments.</p>
          <p>Phæ. This indeed seems probable, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do you think it possible rightly to understand the <lb/>
            nature of the soul, without understanding the nature of the <lb/>
            universe ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. If we are to believe Hippocrates, of the family of <lb/>
            Æsculapius, we cannot understand even the nature of body <lb/>
            without this method.</p>
          <p>Socr. For he says well, my friend. But it is necessary, in <lb/>
            addition to the authority of Hippocrates, to examine our argu­ <lb/>
            ment, and consider whether it is consistent.</p>
          <p>Phce. I agree.</p>
          <p>122. Socr. Consider, then, with respect to nature, what Hip­ <lb/>
            pocrates and true reason say. Is it not thus necessary to exa. <lb/>
            mine into the nature of any thing ? In the first place, whether <lb/>
            that is simple or manifold about which we are desirous, both <lb/>
            ourselves to be skilled, and to be able to make others so; and, <lb/>
            in the next place, if it be simple, to examine the power it <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            naturally possesses of acting on each particular thing, or of <lb/>
            being acted upon by each particular thing ? And if it possesses <lb/>
            several species, having enumerated these, as in the case of the <lb/>
            one, ought we not to consider this in each of them, what active <lb/>
            and passive power they naturally have ?</p>
          <p>Phce. It seems so, Socrates.</p>
          <p>123. Soer. The method, then, that neglected these, would <lb/>
            resemble the walk of a blind man. He however who proceeds <lb/>
            by art, ought on no account to be compared either to a blind <lb/>
            or a deaf man; but it is clear that whosoever teaches another <lb/>
            speaking by art, should accurately shew the real nature of the <lb/>
            things to which he will have to apply his speeches; and this <lb/>
            surely is the soul.</p>
          <p>PAce. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. His whole endeavour, therefore, must be directed to <lb/>
            this; for in this he attempts to produce persuasion. Is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>PAce. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is clear, therefore, that Thrasymachus, and any one <lb/>
            else who seriously endeavours to teach the art of rhetoric, will in <lb/>
            the first place describe with all possible accuracy, and make it be <lb/>
            seen whether the soul is naturally one and similar, or, like the <lb/>
            form of the body, composed of different elements; for this we <lb/>
            say is to make known nature.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And, in the second place, in what respect it naturally <lb/>
            acts or is acted upon by any thing.</p>
          <p>124. Phce. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. In the third place, having set in order the different <lb/>
            kinds of speech and of soul, and the different manners in which <lb/>
            these are affected, he will go through the several causes, adapt­ <lb/>
            ing each to each, and teaching what kind of soul is necessarily <lb/>
            persuaded, and what not persuaded, by particular kinds of <lb/>
            speech, and for what reason.</p>
          <p>Phce. It will assuredly be best done in this way, as it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. Never then, my dear friend, will any thing that is <lb/>
            otherwise explained or spoken, be spoken or written by art, <lb/>
            either in any other case or in this. But the modern writers <lb/>
            on the art of speech-making, whom you yourself have heard, <lb/>
            are dissemblers, and conceal the very admirable knowledge they <lb/>
            have of the soul. Until, then, they both speak and write ac­ <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            cording to this method, let us never be persuaded that they <lb/>
            write artistically.</p>
          <p>Phæ. What method is this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not easy to mention the very words themselves; <lb/>
            but how it is proper to write, if a man means to be as artistic <lb/>
            as he possibly can, I am willing to tell you.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Tell me then.</p>
          <p>125. Socr. Since the power of speech is that of leading the <lb/>
            soul, it is necessary that he who means to be an orator should <lb/>
            know how many kinds of soul there are : but they are sor many, <lb/>
            and of such and such kinds; whence some men are of this <lb/>
            character and some of that character. These then being thus <lb/>
            divided, there are again so many kinds of speech, each of a <lb/>
            certain character. Now men of such a character are for this <lb/>
            particular reason easily persuaded by certain speeches, and <lb/>
            persons of a different character are for these reasons with <lb/>
            difficulty persuaded. It is necessary, therefore, that he, after <lb/>
            having sufficiently understood all this, when he afterwards per­ <lb/>
            ceives these very things taking place in actions, and being done, <lb/>
            should be able to follow them rapidly by perception, otherwise <lb/>
            he will know nothing more than the very things which he <lb/>
            formerly heard from his preceptor. 126. But when he is sum­ <lb/>
            ciently competent to say, what-kind of person is persuaded by <lb/>
            what kind of speeches, and is able, when he sees him before him, <lb/>
            to point out to himself that this is the person and this the nature <lb/>
            for which those speeches were formerly made now actually <lb/>
            present before me, and to which these particular speeches are <lb/>
            to be addressed, in order to persuade him to these particular <lb/>
            things,-when he has acquired all this, and has learnt more­ <lb/>
            over the proper seasons for speaking and being silent, and <lb/>
            again has made himself master of the seasonable and un­ <lb/>
            seasonable occasions for brevity, plaintiveness, and vehemence, <lb/>
            and all the other several kinds of speech which he has learnt, <lb/>
            then his art will be beautifully and perfectly accomplished, but <lb/>
            not before. But whoever is deficient in any of these parti­ <lb/>
            culars, either in speaking, or teaching, or writing, and yet <lb/>
            asserts that he speaks by art, is overcome by the person who <lb/>
            will not be persuaded. 127. " What then," perhaps the writer <lb/>
            on rhetoric will say, " does it appear to you, Phsedrus and <lb/>
            Socrates, that the art of speaking, as it is called, must be ob­ <lb/>
            tained in this or some other way ?"</p><pb n="352"/>
            
          <p>Phæ. It is impossible, Socrates, that it should be obtained <lb/>
            in any other way; though it seems to be a work of no small <lb/>
            labour.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say truly. And on this account we ought to <lb/>
            turn over all speeches again and again, and consider whether <lb/>
            any easier and shorter way to it can be found, in order that <lb/>
            we may not in vain go by a long and rough one, when we <lb/>
            might have taken a short and smooth one. If, therefore, you <lb/>
            have heard of any thing that will assist us, from Lysias or any <lb/>
            one else, endeavour to call it to mind, and tell it me.</p>
          <p>Phæ. If the endeavour were enough I should be able to do <lb/>
            so, but just at present I cannot.</p>
          <p>128. Soar. Are you willing, then, that I should repeat to <lb/>
            you a statement which I heard from persons who take an <lb/>
            interest in such matters.</p>
          <p>Phæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Boer. It is said, however, Phædrus, to be right to state even <lb/>
            the wolfs case.</p>
          <p>Phæ. And do you do so.</p>
          <p>Socr. They say, then, that there is no occasion to treat <lb/>
            these matters so solemnly, nor to carry them back so far, by <lb/>
            such long windings. For as we said in the beginning of our <lb/>
            discussion, there is no need at all for one who wishes to become <lb/>
            a competent orator to have any thing to do with the truth re­ <lb/>
            specting actions just or good, or men who are such, either by <lb/>
            nature or education. For that in courts of justice no attention <lb/>
            whatever is paid to the truth of these things, but only to what <lb/>
            is plausible, and that it is probability to which one who wishes <lb/>
            to speak by art ought to apply himself. And that sometimes <lb/>
            even facts that have actually happened must not be stated, <lb/>
            unless they are probable, but probabilities both in accusation <lb/>
            and defence: and, in short, that a speaker should pursue the <lb/>
            probable, and pay no regard at all to truth. For that when <lb/>
            this method is observed throughout the whole speech, it con­ <lb/>
            stitutes the perfection of the art.</p>
          <p>129. Phæ. You have described the very things, Socrates, <lb/>
            which they say who profess to be skilled in speech-making; <lb/>
            and I remember that we touched briefly upon this in a former <lb/>
            part of our discussion; but this appears to be matter of the <lb/>
            utmost consequence to those who study these things.</p>
          <p>Socr. However you have thoroughly fumbled Tisias himself. <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            Let Tisias then tell us this, whether he means any thing else <lb/>
            by the probable than that which accords with the opinion of the <lb/>
            multitude.</p>
          <p>PAce. What else can it be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Having made, then, as it seems, this wise and artistic <lb/>
            discovery, he has written, that if a weak but brave man should <lb/>
            be brought to trial for having knocked down a strong and <lb/>
            cowardly one, and for having robbed him of his clothes or any <lb/>
            thing else, then that neither of them ought to speak the truth, <lb/>
            but the coward should say that he was not knocked down by <lb/>
            the brave man alone, and the latter should prove this, that <lb/>
            they were alone, and then urge this ; " How could a man like <lb/>
            me ever attack a man like him?" But the other will not <lb/>
            admit his own cowardice, but, in attempting to tell some other <lb/>
            falsehood, will perhaps supply his adversary with the means of <lb/>
            refuting him. And in other cases, such things as these are <lb/>
            said according to art. Is it not so, Phædrus ?</p>
          <p>130. Phæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Wonderfully clever seems to have been the inventor <lb/>
            of this abstruse art, whether Tisias or whoever else he was, <lb/>
            and by whatever name he delights to be called. But, my friend, <lb/>
            shall we say to him or not ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. What?</p>
          <p>Socr. Tisias, long since before your arrival, we happened to <lb/>
            say, that this probability of yours derives its influence with the <lb/>
            multitude from its resemblance to truth ; and we just now con­ <lb/>
            cluded that in all cases he knows best how to discover resem­ <lb/>
            blances who is best acquainted with the truth. So that, if you <lb/>
            have any thing else to say about the art of speaking, we will <lb/>
            listen to you ; but if not, we shall hold to the conclusions we <lb/>
            have lately come to, that unless a man has reckoned up the <lb/>
            different natures of those who will have to hear him, and is <lb/>
            able to divide things themselves into species, and to compre­ <lb/>
            hend the several particulars under one general idea, he will <lb/>
            never be skilled in the art of speaking so far as it is possible <lb/>
            for a man to be so. 131. But this he can never acquire with­ <lb/>
            out great labour, which a wise man ought not to bestow for the <lb/>
            purpose of speaking and acting amongst men, but that he may <lb/>
            be able to speak such things as are acceptable to the gods, and <lb/>
            act acceptably to them, to the utmost of his power. For, as <lb/>
            wiser men than we say, Tisias, a man of understanding ought <note type="footnote"> A a </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            not to make it his principal study to gratify his fellow-servants, <lb/>
            except by the way, but good masters and of good extraction. <lb/>
            If therefore the circuit be long, wonder not; 132. for it is to <lb/>
            be undertaken for the sake of great ends, not such as you think. <lb/>
            And even these, as our argument proves, if any one is willing, <lb/>
            will be best attained by those means.</p>
          <p>Phæ. This appears to me, Socrates, to be very finely said, if <lb/>
            only a man could attain to it.</p>
          <p>Socr. But when one is attempting noble things, it is surely <lb/>
            noble also to suffer whatever it may befal us to suffer.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. As regards, then, the art and want of art in speaking, <lb/>
            let this suffice.</p>
          <p>133. Phæ. How should it not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But as regards elegance and inelegance in writing, in <lb/>
            what way it may be done well, and in what way inelegantly, <lb/>
            remains to be considered. Does it not ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you know, then, how you may best please God <lb/>
            with regard to speeches, both acting and speaking ?</p>
          <p>.hæ. Not at all. Do you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I can tell a story I have heard of the ancients, its truth <lb/>
            they know. But if we ourselves could discover this, do you <lb/>
            think we should any longer pay any regard to the opinions of <lb/>
            men?</p>
          <p>Phæ. Your question is ridiculous; but relate what you say <lb/>
            you have heard.</p>
          <p>134. Socr. I have heard then, that at Naucratis, in Egypt, <lb/>
            there was one of the ancient gods of that country, to whom was <lb/>
            consecrated the bird, which they call Ibis; but the name of the <lb/>
            deity himself was Theuth. That he was the first to invent num­ <lb/>
            bers and arithmetic, and geometry and astronomy, and moreover <lb/>
            draughts and dice, and especially letters, at the time when <lb/>
            Thamus was king of all Egypt, and dwelt in the great city of <lb/>
            the upper region which the Greeks call Egyptian Thebes, but <lb/>
            the god they call Ammon; to him Theuth went and shewed <lb/>
            him his arts, and told him that they ought to be distributed <lb/>
            amongst the rest of the Egyptians. Thamus asked him what <lb/>
            was the use of each, and as he explained it, according as he <lb/>
            appeared to say well or ill, he either blamed or praised them. <lb/>
            135. Now Thamus is reported to have said many things to <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            Theuth respecting each art, both for and against it, which it <lb/>
            would be tedious to relate. But when they came to the letters, <lb/>
            " This knowledge, 0 king," said Theuth, " will make the <lb/>
            Egyptians wiser, and better able to remember; for it has been <lb/>
            invented as a medicine for memory and wisdom." But he <lb/>
            replied, " Most ingenious Theuth, one person is able to give birth <lb/>
            to art, another to judge of what amount of detriment or advan­ <lb/>
            tage it will be to those who are to use it, and now you, as being <lb/>
            the father of letters, out of fondness have attributed to them <lb/>
            just the contrary effect to that which they will have. For this <lb/>
            invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who <lb/>
            learn it through the neglect of memory, for that through trust­ <lb/>
            ing to writing, they will remember outwardly by means of <lb/>
            foreign marks, and not inwardly by means of their own facul­ <lb/>
            ties. So that you have not discovered a medicine for memory, <lb/>
            but for recollection. And you are providing for your disciples <lb/>
            the appearance and not the'reality of wisdom. For hearing <lb/>
            many things through your means without instruction, they will <lb/>
            appear to know a great deal, although they are for the most <lb/>
            part ignorant, and will become troublesome associates, through <lb/>
            thinking themselves wise instead of being so."</p>
          <p>136. Phæ. Socrates, you easily make Egyptian and any <lb/>
            other country's tales you please.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, my friend, those who dwell in the temple of <lb/>
            Dodonæan Jupiter said that the first prophetic words issued <lb/>
            from an oak. It was sufficient for the men of those days, <lb/>
            seeing they were not wise like you moderns, in their simplicity, <lb/>
            to listen to an oak and a stone, if only they spoke the truth: <lb/>
            and does it make any difference to you, forsooth, who the <lb/>
            speaker is, and to what country he belongs? For you do not <lb/>
            consider that only, whether the case is so or otherwise.</p>
          <p>Phæ. You have very properly reproved me; and the case <lb/>
            with regard to letters appears to me just as the Theban says.</p>
          <p>137. Socr. He therefore, who thinks to leave an art in <lb/>
            writing, and again, he who receives it, as if something clear and <lb/>
            solid would result from the writing, must be full of simplicity, <lb/>
            and in reality ignorant of the prophecy of Ammon, since he <lb/>
            thinks that written words are of further value than to remind <lb/>
            one who already knows the subject of which the writings treat.</p>
          <p>Phæ. Most correct.</p>
          <p>Socr. For writing, indeed, Phsedrus, has this inconvenience; <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            and truly resembles painting. For its productions stand ou <lb/>
            as if they were alive, but, if you ask them any question, they <lb/>
            observe a solemn silence. And so it is with written dis­ <lb/>
            courses; you would think that they spoke as though they <lb/>
            possessed some wisdom, but if you ask them about any thing <lb/>
            they say, from a desire to understand it, they give only one <lb/>
            and the self-same answer. And when it is once written, every <lb/>
            discourse is tossed about every where, equally among those <lb/>
            who understand it, and among those whom it in no wise con­ <lb/>
            cerns, and it knows not to whom it ought to speak, and to <lb/>
            whom not. And when it is ill-treated and unjustly reviled, it <lb/>
            always needs its father to help it; for, of itself, it can neither <lb/>
            defend nor help itself.</p>
          <p>138. Phæ. This, too, you have said most correctly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? shall we consider another discourse, this <lb/>
            one's legitimate brother, in what manner it is produced, and <lb/>
            how far better and more powerful it naturally is than this ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. What is that, and how do you say it is produced ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which is written with science in the learner's <lb/>
            soul, which is able to defend itself, and knows before whom it <lb/>
            ought to speak and be silent.</p>
          <p>PAce. You mean the discourse of a man endued with know­ <lb/>
            ledge that has life and soul, of which the written may be justly <lb/>
            called an image.</p>
          <p>Socr. Assuredly. But tell me this. Would an intelligent <lb/>
            husbandman, who has seeds that he cares for and which he <lb/>
            wishes to be fruitful, seriously sow them in summer-time in the <lb/>
            gardens of Adonis, and rejoice at seeing them growing up <lb/>
            beautifully within eight days, or would he do this, if he did it <lb/>
            at all, for the sake of sport or pastime; but the seed which he <lb/>
            treats seriously, availing himself of the husbandman's skill and <lb/>
            sowing it in its proper soil, would he be content that what he <lb/>
            has sown shall come to maturity in the eighth month ?</p>
          <p>139. Phæ. Just so, Socrates, he would do the one seriously, <lb/>
            and the other, as you say, for amusement.</p>
          <p>Socr. But shall we say that he who possesses a knowledge <lb/>
            of what is just, beautiful and good, shews less intelligence than <lb/>
            a husbandman in the management of his own seeds ?</p>
          <p>Phæ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. He will not, then, seriously write them in water, sow­ <lb/>
            ing them with ink by means of a pen, with words that are <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            unable to defend themselves by speech, and unable adequately <lb/>
            to teach the truth.</p>
          <p>Phæ. In all probability he will not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Surely not. But, as it seems, he will sow and write, <lb/>
            when he does write, in the gardens of letters for the sake of <lb/>
            diversion, treasuring up memoranda for himself, when he comes <lb/>
            to the forgetfulness of old age, and for all who are going on the <lb/>
            same track, and he will be delighted at seeing them in their <lb/>
            tender growth, and while other men pursue other diversions, <lb/>
            refreshing themselves with banquets, and other pleasures akin <lb/>
            to these, he, as it appears, instead of these, will pass his time <lb/>
            in the diversions I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>140. Phæ. You speak of a very noble in comparison of a <lb/>
            mean diversion, Socrates, when a man is able to divert himself <lb/>
            with discourses, telling stories about justice and the other <lb/>
            things you mention.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is so indeed, my dear Phædrus. But, in my opinion, <lb/>
            a far more noble employment results from this, when a man <lb/>
            availing himself of dialectic art, on meeting with a congenial <lb/>
            soul, plants and sows scientific discourses which are able to aid <lb/>
            both themselves and him that planted them, and are not un­ <lb/>
            fruitful but contain seed within themselves, from whence others <lb/>
            springing up in other minds are able to make this seed im­ <lb/>
            mortal, and make their possessor happy as far as it is possible <lb/>
            for man to be so.</p>
          <p>Phæ. This that you mention is far more noble.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now then, Phsedrus, since this is agreed on, we are <lb/>
            able to determine our former questions.</p>
          <p>Phœ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Those which, in our desire to consider them, led us to <lb/>
            the present point: namely, that we might examine into the <lb/>
            reproach cast on Lysias for writing speeches, and then speeches <lb/>
            themselves, which are written by art or without art. Now <lb/>
            that which is artistic, and that which is not appears to me to <lb/>
            have been tolerably well explained.</p>
          <p>141. Phœ. It appears so. But remind me of it again, in <lb/>
            what way.</p>
          <p>Socr. Before a man knows the truth of each subject on <lb/>
            which he speaks or writes, and is able to define the whole of a <lb/>
            thing, and when he has defined it again knows how to divide <lb/>

            manner, having distinguished the nature of the soul, and having <lb/>
            found out what kind of speech is adapted to the nature of each, <lb/>
            lie so disposes and adorns his speech, applying to a soul of <lb/>
            varied powers speeches that are various and all-harmonious, <lb/>
            and simple ones to a simple soul, before this is done, he will <lb/>
            not be able to manage speech with art, as far as it might be <lb/>
            done, either for the purpose of teaching or persuading, as the <lb/>
            whole of our former argument has proved.</p>
          <p>Phœ. This is exactly how it appeared.</p>
          <p>142. Socr. But what as to its being honourable or disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful to speak and write speeches, and under what circumstances <lb/>
            it may be called a reproach or not, has not what we have said <lb/>
            a little before sufficed to prove ?</p>
          <p>Phœ. What was that ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That if either Lysias, or any one else, has ever writ­ <lb/>
            ten, or shall hereafter write, privately or publicly, writing a <lb/>
            state document in proposing a law, and thinks that there is in <lb/>
            it great stability and clearness, this is a reproach to the writer, <lb/>
            whether any one says so or not. For to be utterly ignorant of <lb/>
            what is just and unjust, evil and good, cannot be otherwise <lb/>
            than truly disgraceful, though the whole mass of mankind <lb/>
            should unite in its praise.</p>
          <p>143. Phœ. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But he who thinks that in a written discourse, on <lb/>
            whatever subject, there must necessarily be much that is sport­ <lb/>
            ive, and that no discourse, in prose or verse, deserving of much <lb/>
            study, has ever been written or spoken, as those declamations <lb/>
            used to be spoken without discrimination and instructive <lb/>
            method, for the sake of persuasion, but that in truth the best <lb/>
            of them were for the purpose of reminding those who al­ <lb/>
            ready know, but that only in discourses taught and spoken for <lb/>
            the sake of instruction, and really written in the soul about <lb/>
            things just, and beautiful, and good, there is found what is <lb/>
            clear and perfect and worthy of study; and that such dis­ <lb/>
            courses ought to be called as it were their author's legitimate <lb/>
            offspring; first of all that which is in himself, if it is there by <lb/>
            his own invention, then any children or brothers of the former <lb/>
            that have at the same time worthily sprung up in the souls of <lb/>
            others; whoever thinks thus and dismisses all others, that <lb/>
            man, Phædrus, appears to be such a one as you and I should <lb/>
            pray that we might become.</p><pb n="359"/>
            
          <p>144. PAm. I, for my part, entirely wish and pray for what <lb/>
            you mention.</p>
          <p>Socr. Be we then content with having thus far amused <lb/>
            ourselves with the subject of speeches; and do you go and <lb/>
            tell Lysias that we, having descended to the fountain of the <lb/>
            nymphs, have heard words which charged us to tell Lysias <lb/>
            and any one else who composes speeches, and Homer and any <lb/>
            one else who is in the habit of composing poety, epic or <unclear>lyric5</unclear>, <lb/>
            and thirdly, Solon and whosoever commits political discourses <lb/>
            to writing under the name of laws, if they composed their works <lb/>
            knowing how the truth stands, and able to defend them when <lb/>
            brought to account for what they have written, and being <lb/>
            themselves capable by speaking to shew that their writings are <lb/>
            poor, then they ought not to be named from these works, but <lb/>
            from those to which they have seriously applied themselves.</p>
          <p>145. Phœ. What name, then, do you assign them ?</p>
          <p>Socr. To call them wise, Phsedrus, appears to me to be a <lb/>
            great matter, and proper for God alone; but lovers of wisdom, <lb/>
            or some such name, would suit them better, and be in better <lb/>
            taste.</p>
          <p>Phœ. And it would be nothing out of the way.</p>
          <p>Socr. Him, therefore, who has nothing more valuable than <lb/>
            what he has written, by turning it upwards and downwards for <lb/>
            a long time, patching and clipping it bit by bit, may you not <lb/>
            justly designate a poet, or a compiler of speeches, or a writer <lb/>
            of laws ?</p>
          <p>Phœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Boer. Tell this, then, to your friend.</p>
          <p>Phœ. But you? what will you do ? For we must not pass <lb/>
            over your friend.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whom do you mean ?</p>
          <p>146. Phœ. The beautiful Isocrates. What news will you <lb/>
            take him, Socrates ? what shall we say he is ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Isocrates is still young, Phsedrus; but what I pro­ <lb/>
            phesy of him I am willing to say.</p>
          <p>PAce. What?</p>
          <p>Socr. He appears to me to have better natural endowments <lb/>
            than to be compared with the speeches of Lysias, and more­ <lb/>
            over to be endued with a nobler disposition, so that it would <lb/>
            not be at all wonderful if, as he advances in age, he should in <note type="footnote"> s <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψιλὴν ἢ ἐν ᾠδῃ̂</foreign>, without music or with. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            this very pursuit of speech-making, to which he is now apply­ <lb/>
            ing himself, surpass all who have ever attempted speeches, as <lb/>
            if they were boys, and besides, if he should not be content <lb/>
            with this, that a more divine impulse may lead him to greater <lb/>
            things; for, my friend, there is a natural love of wisdom in <lb/>
            the mind of the man. This message, then, I will take from <lb/>
            the gods of this spot to Isocrates my favourite, and do you <lb/>
            take the other to Lysias as yours.</p>
          <p>147. Phœ. This shall be done. But let us depart, since the <lb/>
            heat has become less oppressive.</p>
          <p>Socr. Ought we not to go after we have prayed to these <lb/>
            gods?</p>
          <p>Phœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. 0 beloved Pan, and all ye other gods of this place, <lb/>
            grant me to become beautiful in the inner man, and that what­ <lb/>
            ever outward things I have may be at peace with those within. <lb/>
            May I deem the wise man rich, and may I have such a portion <lb/>
            of gold as none but a prudent man can either bear or employ.</p>
          <p>• Do we need any thing else, Phædrus? for myself I have <lb/>
            prayed enough.</p>
          <p>Phœ. Make the same prayer for me, too; for the posses­ <lb/>
            sions of friends are common.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us depart.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE THEÆTETUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THEODORUS, a famous geometrician of Cyrene and a follower <lb/>
            of Protagoras, is represented to have met Socrates at Athens, <lb/>
            and to have been asked by him whether among his pupils there <lb/>
            were any who promised to become eminent. Theodorus parti­ <lb/>
            cularizes one above all the rest, who, while he is speaking, is <lb/>
            seen approaching. His name is Theætetus. Socrates, having <lb/>
            heard him so highly spoken of by Theodorus, at once opens <lb/>
            upon the subject which he wishes to discuss, and asks What <lb/>
            science is. Thesetetus, in answer, enumerates several parti­ <lb/>
            cular sciences, but is soon led to understand that the question <lb/>
            is not, how many sciences there are, but what science itself is; <lb/>
            and by an instance in point shews that he does so. Still he <lb/>
            doubts his own ability to answer the question proposed, but is <lb/>
            at length induced to make the attempt by Socrates pleasantly <lb/>
            describing himself as inheriting his own mother's skill in mid­ <lb/>
            wifery, by which he is able to bring to the birth and deliver the <lb/>
            mental conceptions of those whose souls are pregnant with ideas a.</p>
          <p>Thesetetus, then, first of all says that science is nothing <lb/>
            else than perception. This, Socrates observes, is the opinion <lb/>
            of Protagoras, differently expressed; for he said, that man <lb/>
            is the measure of all things, in other words that all things <lb/>
            are such as they appear to each person. In order to examine <lb/>
            the truth of this doctrine Socrates begins by stating it more <lb/>
            fully. Protagoras asserts that nothing exists of itself, nor can <lb/>
            any thing be designated by any quality, for what we call great <lb/>
            will, in reference to something else, be also small, and what we <lb/>
            call heavy, light, and so on, so that nothing ever exists but is <lb/>
            always becoming. Consequently all things spring from motion, <lb/>
            and the relation that they bear to each other. Thus, with re­ <lb/>
            spect to colour, it does not actually exist, it is neither in the <note type="footnote"> A § 1—22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            1 object seen nor in the eye itself, but results from the applica­ <lb/>
            tion of the eye to the object, and so is the intermediate pro­ <lb/>
            duction of both. Again if you compare six with four they ap­ <lb/>
            pear to be half as many again, but if with twelve, only the half, <lb/>
            whence it appears that the same number is at one time great, <lb/>
            at another small, which would not be the case if numbers had <lb/>
            a fixed and determined magnitude. The principle then on <lb/>
            which all things depend is this, That the universe is nothing <lb/>
            but motion, of which there are two species, the one active, <lb/>
            the other passive, by the union of which that which is per­ <lb/>
            ceivable and perception itself consist. Thus when the eye <lb/>
            and a corresponding object, meeting together, produce white­ <lb/>
            ness and its connate perception, the eye sees, and becomes <lb/>
            not vision, but a seeing eye, and the object itself becomes not <lb/>
            whiteness but white: so that nothing is essentially one, but is <lb/>
            always being produced by something else, and therefore the <lb/>
            word "being" must be entirely done away with. But here it <lb/>
            may be objected that the perceptions produced in persons who <lb/>
            dream, or are diseased or mad, are utterly false, and so far <lb/>
            are the things that appear to them from existing, that none of <lb/>
            them have any real existence at all; how then can it be said <lb/>
            that perception is science, and that things which appear to <lb/>
            every one are to that person what they appear to be ? The <lb/>
            answer is, that the things which appear are most certainly <lb/>
            true to the percipient; just as if wine appears bitter to a <lb/>
            sick person, to him it is certainly bitter; and again with re­ <lb/>
            gard to dreams, there is no certain way of distinguishing a <lb/>
            state of being awake from dreaming; and as the object per­ <lb/>
            ceived and the percipient exist or are produced by relation to <lb/>
            each other, neither exists or is produced of itself, but the ob­ <lb/>
            ject perceived does exist in relation to the percipient and to <lb/>
            him is true, so that he has a scientific knowledge of what he <lb/>
            perceives b</p>
          <p>Socrates then proposes to examine the correctness of Prota­ <note type="footnote"> b § 23—46. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            goras's theory. If what he says is true, a pig or any other <lb/>
            creature that possesses perception will be the measure of all <lb/>
            things, as well as a man, and man himself will be equal in <lb/>
            wisdom to the gods. To which Protagoras is supposed to <lb/>
            answer, that the gods are not to be brought into the question at <lb/>
            all, for that it does not appear whether they exist or not, and <lb/>
            as to brute creatures, it would be strange if every man did not <lb/>
            excel them in wisdom, and besides no argument deduced from <lb/>
            them can be conclusive but rests only on probability, which <lb/>
            cannot be allowed in a discussion respecting science. Well <lb/>
            then, when we hear barbarians speak, whose language we have <lb/>
            not learnt, are we to say that we both hear and know what <lb/>
            they say ? to which the answer is, that we both hear and know <lb/>
            the sounds, but not the meaning of the words. Again it is <lb/>
            objected, if perception is science, a person may remember a <lb/>
            thing and not know it, for instance he may obtain a knowledge <lb/>
            of a thing by seeing it, and then shut his eyes, in that case he <lb/>
            remembers it, but does not see it, but inasmuch as sight is per­ <lb/>
            ception and perception knowledge, he cannot know it, because <lb/>
            he does not see it, and yet he remembers it; which is absurd. <lb/>
            But Protagoras will not admit this conclusion, but will say <lb/>
            that memory is very different from perception, and that the <lb/>
            things which we appear to remember are not the same as those <lb/>
            that we formerly perceived. Still, though all things are as they <lb/>
            appear to each person, it must be admitted that there is such a <lb/>
            thing as wisdom and a wise man, and he is wise who changes <lb/>
            the aspect of objects to another, and causes things that appear <lb/>
            and are evil to any one, to appear and be good; just as a <lb/>
            physician by means of medicine changes the habit of the body <lb/>
            from bad to good c.</p>
          <p>Thus far Socrates had carried on the discussion with There­ <lb/>
            tetus, adducing the answers which Protagoras himself would <lb/>
            have given to the objections brought against his theory, but <lb/>
            expressing no opinion of his own. He now persuades Theodo­ <note type="footnote"> « § 47—65. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            rus to advocate the cause of Protagoras, and himself under- <lb/>
            takes to refute it. Protagoras, then, maintains that what ap­ <lb/>
            pears to each person exists to him to whom it appears; now <lb/>
            all men think themselves in some respects wiser than others, <lb/>
            and others wiser than themselves, so that all admit that there <lb/>
            is wisdom and ignorance among themselves. Now is not wis­ <lb/>
            dom true opinion, and ignorance false opinion ? If so, some <lb/>
            men form false opinions, and yet that could not be if man is <lb/>
            the measure of all things. Again, according to his doctrine, <lb/>
            the same thing will be both true and false ; for instance, Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras's own theory will be true to himself, but false to all <lb/>
            who do not agree with him, and by how many more they are <lb/>
            to whom it does not appear to be true than those to whom it <lb/>
            does so appear, by so much the more it is not than it is: and <lb/>
            so in admitting that the opinion of those who differ from him <lb/>
            is true he admits that his own opinion is false. Moreover, in <lb/>
            political matters Protagoras will admit that things honourable <lb/>
            and base, just and unjust, are such to each city as each city <lb/>
            considers them; but he will allow that one counsellor excels <lb/>
            another, and that all laws are not equally expedient, though <lb/>
            the city that enacts them thinks them sod.</p>
          <p>The mention of political matters leads Socrates to interrupt <lb/>
            the course of the argument, and to contrast the life of a poli­ <lb/>
            tician with that of a philosopher, in which he shews how far <lb/>
            more exalted are the views of the latter than of the former. <lb/>
            The digression, however, has this connexion with the subject <lb/>
            in hand, that it exposes the utter worthlessness of political ex­ <lb/>
            pediency, which depends on appearances only, and vindicates <lb/>
            the aspirations of philosophers, who devote themselves to the <lb/>
            contemplation of wisdom and true virtue e.</p>
          <p>To return, then, to the original subject. Those who main­ <lb/>
            tain that whatever appears to each person exists to him to <lb/>
            whom it appears, persist that what a city enacts as appearing <lb/>
            just to itself is just to that city as long as it continues in force; <note type="footnote"> d § 66—75. </note><note type="footnote">a § 76—87. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            but in enacting laws the real object is to make them as advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to itself as possible, but what is advantageous regards <lb/>
            also the future, for laws are enacted that they may be advan­ <lb/>
            tageous for the future. But if man is the measure of all things, <lb/>
            he must also contain within himself the criterion of things <lb/>
            about to happen; yet it will be admitted, in a variety of in­ <lb/>
            stances that are adduced, that a person who is skilled is better <lb/>
            able to judge of the future than one who is unskilled : and Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras himself can judge beforehand better than any private <lb/>
            person what arguments are likely to be available in a court of <lb/>
            justice, so that not every man, but the wise man only, is the <lb/>
            true measure of thingsf.</p>
          <p>This part of the argument being brought to a close, Socrates <lb/>
            next proposes to consider the essence that is said to consist in <lb/>
            motion, a doctrine which the followers of Heraclitus were then <lb/>
            advocating very strenuously. Now there are two species of <lb/>
            motion, removal and change; the former is when a thing <lb/>
            passes from one place to another, the latter a change of qua­ <lb/>
            lity, as when a thing becomes black from white, or hard from <lb/>
            soft; and all things must undergo both kinds of motion, other­ <lb/>
            wise the same thing would be both in motion and at rest at <lb/>
            the same time, and in that case it would not be more correct <lb/>
            to say that all things are in motion than that they are at rest. <lb/>
            Since then every thing must be continually undergoing a pro­ <lb/>
            cess of change at the same time that it is in motion, there can <lb/>
            be nothing fixed and certain, so that perception cannot be <lb/>
            science, for, as all things are in motion, perception itself, which <lb/>
            results from the relation between the object and the percipient, <lb/>
            must be in a constant state of motion and change g.</p>
          <p>Thesetetus now resumes the argument, and though it would <lb/>
            seem that Protagoras's doctrine had been already sufficiently <lb/>
            refuted, yet Socrates resolves to try it by one more test. Each <lb/>
            sense has its peculiar perception, and such things as are per­ <lb/>
            ceived by one faculty cannot be perceived by another; for <lb/>
            Instance, what is perceived by hearing cannot be perceived by <note type="footnote"> f § 87—91. </note><note type="footnote">g § 91-100-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            sight, and what is perceived by sight cannot be perceived by <lb/>
            hearing; yet we can form a notion of them both together, and <lb/>
            observe what properties they have in common, and how they <lb/>
            differ: this, however, is not done by the senses, but by the <lb/>
            soul itself, for children as soon as they are born are able to <lb/>
            perceive by the bodily organs, but only arrive, with much <lb/>
            labour and difficulty, at the power of comparing things with <lb/>
            each other, and so obtain a knowledge of them, whence again <lb/>
            it follows that perception and science are not the sameh.</p>
          <p>The first definition of science attempted by Theætetus being <lb/>
            thus overthrown, Socrates again asks him, What science is. <lb/>
            To which he answers that it appears to be true judgment. <lb/>
            Socrates however thinks proper first to enquire whether there <lb/>
            is such a thing as false judgment. People, he says, must either <lb/>
            know or not know things about which they form judgments. <lb/>
            Now false judgments are formed, when a person thinks that <lb/>
            things which he does not know are certain other things that <lb/>
            he does not know, or when he thinks that things which he <lb/>
            does know are other things that he does know, or that things <lb/>
            which he does not know are things that he does know. But <lb/>
            none of these things can happen, therefore it is not possible to <lb/>
            form false judgments. Again if existence is put for knowledge <lb/>
            a similar train of reasoning leads to the same conclusion. A <lb/>
            third method of forming false judgments may be when any <lb/>
            one says that any real object is another real object, changing <lb/>
            one for the other in his thoughts. But in that case he must <lb/>
            think of both of them or one only; if the former he would <lb/>
            contradict himself; if the latter he cannot judge that the one <lb/>
            ' is the other, for he thinks of one only, so that Neither in this <lb/>
            way can false judgment be formed. There still remains an­ <lb/>
            other mode in which false judgments may be formed. Suppose <lb/>
            that we have in our souls a waxen tablet of various qualities in <lb/>
            different persons : on this tablet are impressed the images of <lb/>
            our perceptions and thoughts, and whatever is so impressed we <lb/>
            remember and know so long as the image remains. But by ex­ <note type="footnote"> h § 101—107. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            amining every possible mode by which perception in the senses <lb/>
            and impressions in the mind can be varied and inter-changed, <lb/>
            it will be found that false judgment takes place where either <lb/>
            the perception or the impression is imperfect and indistinct</p>
          <p>Socrates, however, is not satisfied with this conclusion, that <lb/>
            false judgment proceeds from the conjunction of perception <lb/>
            with thought, and shews that the mind alone by itself may err, <lb/>
            for instance a man may think that seven and five make eleven, <lb/>
            though he knows they make twelve; so that there must be <lb/>
            either no false judgment at all, or it is possible for a person <lb/>
            not to know what he knows. Thesetetus is unable to choose <lb/>
            between these alternatives. Socrates therefore proposes to <lb/>
            abandon their present course of argument and at once to enquire <lb/>
            what it is to know. Some people say it is to have science, <lb/>
            Socrates prefers saying it is to possess science; for having <lb/>
            differs from possessing in that what we have, we use, but what <lb/>
            we possess, we use or not as we please. Suppose the soul <lb/>
            then to be a kind of aviary containing all sorts of birds, and <lb/>
            let the birds stand for sciences ; now all the sciences that are <lb/>
            shut up in this aviary a man may be said to possess, but when <lb/>
            he has occasion to use any particular science, he may by mis­ <lb/>
            take take one instead of another, thus when he thinks that eleven <lb/>
            is twelve he takes the science of eleven instead of that of twelve, <lb/>
            and so judges falsely; but when he takes that which he en­ <lb/>
            deavours to take, he judges truly. Still another even worse <lb/>
            inconvenience appears to Socrates to follow from this ; for it is <lb/>
            absurd to suppose that a person who has the science of any <lb/>
            thing should at the same time be ignorant of that thing; and <lb/>
            if that can be, nothing hinders but that ignorance when present <lb/>
            should make us know something. So that after all they have <lb/>
            only come round again to the point from whence they started <lb/>
            and have still to enquire what science is. Thesetetus persists <lb/>
            in answering that it is true judgment. But Socrates shews <lb/>
            that this cannot be the case ; for that judges, who listen to the <lb/>
            arguments of lawyers, form true judgments without science, <note type="footnote"> » § 108-125. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            whence it follows that true judgment and-science are not the <lb/>
            same k.</p>
          <p>Theætetus, pressed by this objection, attempts a third defi­ <lb/>
            nition of science, and says it is true judgment in conjunction <lb/>
            with reason. But then, observes Socrates, how are we to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish the things that can be known from those that cannot ? <lb/>
            For instance, elements cannot be defined, but things composed <lb/>
            of them can be defined. Again, elements can be perceived but <lb/>
            not known, for he who cannot give an explanation of a thing <lb/>
            cannot know it, but things compounded of them, because they <lb/>
            can be defined, can also be known. Theætetus agrees to this; <lb/>
            but Socrates is not satisfied with the statement, that the ele­ <lb/>
            ments are unknown, but the nature of things compounded of <lb/>
            them known. He illustrates his objection by an examination <lb/>
            of the component parts of a syllable, and shews that if a whole <lb/>
            is known its parts must also be known ; if, then, letters are the <lb/>
            elements of a syllable, being also the parts of it, they must also <lb/>
            be known as well as the syllable1.</p>
          <p>But in order to ascertain the accuracy of Theaetetus's last <lb/>
            definition of science, it is necessary to determine the meaning <lb/>
            of the word logos. First of all, then, it may mean the express­ <lb/>
            ing one's thoughts by means of words, but in that case there <lb/>
            will be no difference between true judgment and science. <lb/>
            Secondly, it may mean the being able to describe a thing by <lb/>
            its elements; but this has been already answered in consider­ <lb/>
            in- the elements of syllables. Lastly, it may mean definition ; <lb/>
            but it is absurd to say that science is true judgment joined to <lb/>
            definition, for definition can only be of that which a person <lb/>
            already knows, so that this would be to say that science is true <lb/>
            judgment joined to sciencem.</p>
          <p>At this point the argument is broken off, without having <lb/>
            been brought to any satisfactory conclusion. But Socrates <lb/>
            requests that they may meet again the following day and con­ <lb/>
            tinue the discussion. <note type="footnote"> k § 126—138. </note><note type="footnote">1 § 139—149. </note><note type="footnote">m § 149—157. </note></p>

          <p>Euc. ARE you just now, Terpsion, or long since come from <lb/>
            the country ?</p>
          <p>Ter. A considerable time since, and I have been seeking for <lb/>
            you in the forum, and wondered that I could not find you.</p>
          <p>Euc. I was not in the city.</p>
          <p>Ter. Where then ?</p>
          <p>Euc. As I was going down to the port, I met with These­ <lb/>
            tetus, who was being carried from the camp at Corinth to <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>Ter. Alive or dead ?</p>
          <p>Euc. Alive, though scarcely so ; for he is in a bad state <lb/>
            from several wounds, though he suffers more from the disease <lb/>
            that is prevalent in the army.</p>
          <p>Ter. Is it dysentery ?</p>
          <p>Euc. Yes.</p>
          <p>Ter. What a man you speak of as being in danger!</p>
          <p>Euc. An honourable and good man, Terpsion, and I just <lb/>
            now heard some persons highly extolling his conduct in <lb/>
            the battle.</p>
          <p>Ter. Nor is that surprising, but it would be much more <lb/>
            wonderful if he had not behaved so. But why did he not stop <lb/>
            here at Megara ?</p>
          <p>Euc. He was hastening home; although I begged and <lb/>
            advised him, yet he would not. And after I had attended him <lb/>
            on his journey, on my return hither I recollected, and was <lb/>
            filled with admiration of Socrates, who. often spoke pro- <note type="footnote"> B b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            phetically about other things, and especially about him. 2. For <lb/>
            if I remember rightly, a little before his death, he met with <lb/>
            Theætetus who was then a youth, and being in company and <lb/>
            discoursing with him, he very much admired his natural dis­ <lb/>
            position. And when I went to Athens, he related to me the <lb/>
            conversation he had had with him, which was very well worth <lb/>
            hearing, and he said that he must necessarily distinguish <lb/>
            himself, if he lived to a mature age.</p>
          <p>Ter. And he spoke truly as it seems. But what was the <lb/>
            conversation ? are you able to relate it ?</p>
          <p>Euc. No, by Jupiter, not by heart; but as soon as I re­ <lb/>
            turned home, I made notes of it, and afterwards at my leisure <lb/>
            calling it to mind I wrote it down, and as often as I came to <lb/>
            Athens, I asked Socrates to repeat what I did not remember, <lb/>
            and, on my return hither, corrected it; so that I have nearly <lb/>
            the whole conversation written out.</p>
          <p>3. Ter. True : I have heard you say so before, and though <lb/>
            I always meant to beg you to shew it me, I have hitherto <lb/>
            delayed doing so. But what should hinder us from now going <lb/>
            through it ? For I am in great need of rest, having just <lb/>
            come from the country.</p>
          <p>Euc. I too accompanied Thesetetus as far as Erinion, so that <lb/>
            I should not be at all sorry to rest myself. Let us go, then, <lb/>
            and while we rest the boy shall read to us.</p>
          <p>Ter. You say well.</p>
          <p>Euc. This then is the book, Terpsion. But I wrote the <lb/>
            conversation thus, not as if Socrates related it to me, as he did, <lb/>
            but as if he was conversing with the persons with whom he <lb/>
            said he did converse. But these, he said, were Theodorus the <lb/>
            geometrician, and Thesetetus. 4. In order, then, that phrases <lb/>
            interposed in the discourse might not give us trouble in the <lb/>
            writing, when Socrates spoke of himself, as " I said," or <lb/>
            " Thereupon I replied," and again when he spoke of the per­ <lb/>
            son who gave the answer, " He assented," or " He denied," <lb/>
            for this reason I have introduced Socrates himself as convers­ <lb/>
            ing with them, and have done away with all such expressions.</p>
          <p>Ter. And that is not at all improper, Euclides.</p>
          <p>Euc. Here then, boy, take the book and read.</p>
          <p>Socr. If I took more interest in the people at Cyrene, Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus, I should enquire of you what is going on there, and of <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            the people, whether there are any young men there who <lb/>
            devote their attention to geometry, or any other liberal <lb/>
            study. But now, for I love them less than these, I am more <lb/>
            anxious to know who of our young men promise to become <lb/>
            eminent. For I myself examine into this as far as I am able, <lb/>
            and enquire of others, with whom I see the young men willingly <lb/>
            associating. But no small number attach themselves to you, <lb/>
            and justly; for you deserve it, both in other respects, and on <lb/>
            account of your geometry. If, therefore, you have met with <lb/>
            any one worth mentioning, I should be glad to be informed <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>5. Theo. And indeed, Socrates, it is very well worth while <lb/>
            both for me to tell and you to hear, what a youth I have met <lb/>
            with among your fellow-citizens. And if he were beautiful, I <lb/>
            should be very much afraid to mention him, lest I should appear <lb/>
            to any one to be enamoured with him; but now, and don't <lb/>
            be angry with me, he is not handsome, for he resembles you in <lb/>
            the flatness of his nose and the prominence of his eyes: but <lb/>
            he has these in a less degree than you. You see I speak with­ <lb/>
            out reserve. Be assured then, that of all I ever met with, and <lb/>
            I have been in company with very many, I never yet knew <lb/>
            one of such an admirable disposition. For a man to be apt to <lb/>
            learn, as it is at all times difficult, and at the same time re­ <lb/>
            markably mild, and added to this brave beyond compare, I, <lb/>
            for my part, thought could never happen, nor do I see any who <lb/>
            are so. But those who are acute, as this one, sagacious, and <lb/>
            of a good memory, are for the most part easily roused to anger, <lb/>
            and are hurried violently along like ships without ballast, and <lb/>
            are naturally rather furious than brave; on the other hand <lb/>
            those who are more sedate commonly set about their studies <lb/>
            more sluggishly and are forgetful. 6. But he so calmly, <lb/>
            steadily, and effectually applies himself to his studies and in­ <lb/>
            vestigations, with so much gentleness, like oil flowing noise­ <lb/>
            lessly, that one wonders how one at his age can manage to do <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>Socr. You bring good news. But whose son is he of our <lb/>
            citizens ?</p>
          <p>Theo. I have heard the name, but do not remember it. <lb/>
            However he is the middle one of those who are now approach­ <lb/>
            ing. For both he and these who are some of his companions <lb/>
            were just now anointing themselves in the outer course; and <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            now they appear to me to be coming here after having anointed <lb/>
            themselves. Observe, however, if you know him.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do know him. He is the son of. Euphronius of <lb/>
            Sunium, who, my friend, was just such a man as you describe <lb/>
            the son to be, and who was otherwise a person of considera­ <lb/>
            tion, and besides left behind him a very large fortune.</p>
          <p>7. Theo. Thesetetus is his name, Socrates. But I think his <lb/>
            guardians have squandered his fortune. However notwith­ <lb/>
            standing this, he is wonderfully liberal with his money, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. You describe a noble man. Bid him come here, and <lb/>
            sit down by us.</p>
          <p>Theo. I will. Thesetetus, come hither to Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. By all means come, Thesetetus, that I may look at <lb/>
            myself, and see what sort of a face I have. For Theodorus <lb/>
            says I am like you. But if we had each of us a lyre, and he <lb/>
            should say that they were modulated alike, should we be­ <lb/>
            lieve him at once, or consider first whether he speaks as a <lb/>
            musician ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. We should consider that first.</p>
          <p>Socr. Should we not, then, on finding that he was so, believe <lb/>
            him, but, if he was ignorant of music, disbelieve him ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. True.</p>
          <p>Soar. Now, then, I think, if we care at all about the re­ <lb/>
            semblance of our faces, we should consider whether he speaks <lb/>
            as a painter, or not.</p>
          <p>Thes. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is Theodorus a painter then ?</p>
          <p>Thes. Not that I know of.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is he not a geometrician either ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Most assuredly he is, Socrates.</p>
          <p>8. Socr. Is he also an astronomer, a reasoner, and a musi­ <lb/>
            cian, and acquainted with all such things as are requisite for a <lb/>
            good education ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. He appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, then, he says that we resemble each other in some <lb/>
            part of our body, praising or blaming it, it is not very well <lb/>
            worth while to pay any attention to him.</p>
          <p>Thes. Perhaps not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what if he should praise the soul of either of us <lb/>
            for virtue or wisdom ? would it not be worth while for the on,! <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            who heard him to take pains to examine him that was praised, <lb/>
            and for the latter to discover himself willingly ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is time then, my dear Theætetus, for you to dis­ <lb/>
            cover yourself, and for me to examine you; for be assured that <lb/>
            Theodorus, though he has ere now praised many both strangers <lb/>
            and citizens to me, has never praised any one so much as he <lb/>
            praised you just now.</p>
          <p>Theœ. May it be well, Socrates ; but beware that he did not <lb/>
            speak in jest.</p>
          <p>Socr. That is not Theodorus's habit. But do not retract <lb/>
            what you have granted, under the pretence that he spoke in <lb/>
            jest, lest he should be compelled to bear witness. For no one <lb/>
            assuredly will accuse him of giving false evidence. Therefore <lb/>
            adhere firmly to your agreement.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is proper to do so, if you think fit.</p>
          <p>9. Socr. Tell me, then; Do you learn geometry from Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus ?</p>
          <p>' Theœ. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. And, likewise, astronomy, and harmony, and rea­ <lb/>
            soning.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. I endeavour to do so.</p>
          <p>Socr. I too, my boy, endeavour to learn both from him and <lb/>
            from others who I think understand any thing of these matters. <lb/>
            However, though I am tolerably well informed in other sub­ <lb/>
            jects, yet I am in'doubt about a trifle which I wish to consider <lb/>
            with you, and these here present. Tell me, then, is not to <lb/>
            learn to become wiser in that which one learns ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. How otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And by wisdom, I think, the wise are wise.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But does this differ at all from science ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. What?</p>
          <p>Socr. Wisdom. Are not men wise in things of which they <lb/>
            have a scientific knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Then are wisdom and science the same ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>10. Socr. This, then, is the thing that I doubt about, and I <lb/>
            am not able to determine satisfactorily by myself what science <lb/>
            is. Can we then explain it ? What do you say ? Which of us <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            shall speak first ? But he that mistakes, and as often as any <lb/>
            one mistakes, shall sit as an ass, as the boys say when they <lb/>
            play at ball; but whoever shall get the better without making <lb/>
            a mistake shall be our king, and shall order any question he <lb/>
            pleases to be answered. Why are you silent ? Am I rude at <lb/>
            all, Theodorus, from my love of talking, and in my anxiety to <lb/>
            bring about a conversation amongst us, and of making us all <lb/>
            friends, and sociable with one another ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Such a thing, Socrates, cannot by any means be rude, <lb/>
            but bid one of these young men answer you. For I am unac­ <lb/>
            customed to this kind of conversation, and am not of an age to <lb/>
            accustom myself to it; whereas it is suitable to them, and they <lb/>
            will benefit by it much more; for, in truth, youth can derive <lb/>
            benefit from every thing. As you begun, therefore, do not let <lb/>
            Theætetus off, but question him.</p>
          <p>11. Socr. You hear, Theætetus, what Theodorus says, whom, <lb/>
            I think, you will neither be willing to disobey, nor is it right <lb/>
            for a young man not to submit to a wise man, when he com­ <lb/>
            mands him in matters of this kind. Tell me, therefore, frankly <lb/>
            and ingenuously, what does science appear to you to be ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I must then, Socrates, since you bid me. And if I <lb/>
            make any mistake you will assuredly correct me.</p>
          <p>Socr. Certainly, if we are able.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It appears to me, then, that sciences are such things <lb/>
            as one may learn from Theodorus, geometry, and the others <lb/>
            which you just now enumerated; and again, the shoemaker's <lb/>
            art, and those of other artizans, all and each of these are <lb/>
            nothing else but science.</p>
          <p>Socr. Nobly and munificently, my friend, when asked for <lb/>
            one thing you give many, and various things instead of the <lb/>
            single one.</p>
          <p>Theœ. What mean you by this, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Perhaps nothing: but I will tell you what I think. <lb/>
            When you speak of the shoemaker's art, do you mean any <lb/>
            thing else than the science of making shoes ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Nothing.</p>
          <p>12. Socr. But what of the carpenter's art? Do you mean <lb/>
            any thing else than the science of making implements in wood ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Still nothing else.</p>
          <p>Socr. In both, then, do you not define that of which each is <lb/>
            the science ?</p><pb n="375"/>
            
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But the question asked, Theætetus, was not this, of <lb/>
            what things there is science, nor how many sciences there are ; <lb/>
            for we did not enquire, with a view to enumerate them, but to <lb/>
            know what science itself is. Do I say nothing to the purpose ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. You speak very correctly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider this too. If any one should ask us about <lb/>
            any mean and obvious thing, as, for instance, clay, what it is, <lb/>
            if we were to answer him, there is the potters' clay, the oven­ <lb/>
            builders' clay, and the brick-makers' clay, should we not be <lb/>
            ridiculous ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Probably.</p>
          <p>Socr. In the first place, we should be ridiculous for thinking <lb/>
            that he who asks the question can understand from our answer, <lb/>
            when we say Clay, adding, image-makers, or any other arti­ <lb/>
            zans whatever. Do you think that any one can understand <lb/>
            the name of a thing when he does not know what that thing <lb/>
            is ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. By no means.</p>
          <p>13. Socr. Neither does he understand the science of shoes <lb/>
            who does not know what science is ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. He does not.</p>
          <p>Socr. He then does not understand what is the art of shoe­ <lb/>
            making, or any other art, who is ignorant of what science is ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is, therefore, a ridiculous answer for one to give <lb/>
            who is asked what science is, when he answers the name of <lb/>
            some art. For he answers, of what there is a science, though <lb/>
            this is not what he was asked.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. In the next place, when he might have answered <lb/>
            plainly and briefly he goes round an endless way. As for in­ <lb/>
            stance to the question about clay, it is a plain and simple answer <lb/>
            to give, that clay is earth mixed with moisture, without men­ <lb/>
            tioning what use is made of it.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It appears easy now, in this way, Socrates; for you <lb/>
            appear to ask just such a question as lately occurred to me <lb/>
            when we were conversing together, I and your namesake here, <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. What was that, Thesetetus ?</p>
          <p>14. Theœ. Theodorus here was describing to us something <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            about powers, with respect to magnitudes of three and five feet, <lb/>
            shewing that they are not commensurate in length to a magni­ <lb/>
            tude of one foot, and thus proceeding through every number as <lb/>
            far as to a magnitude of seventeen feet; at this he stopped. <lb/>
            Since then powers appeared to be infinite in multitude, some­ <lb/>
            thing of the following kind occurred to us, to endeavour to <lb/>
            comprehend them in one name, by which we might denominate <lb/>
            all these powers.</p>
          <p>Socr. And did you discover any thing of the kind ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I think we did. But do you also consider.</p>
          <p>Socr. Say on.</p>
          <p>Theœ. We divided all number into two classes; then com­ <lb/>
            paring that in which the factors a are the same to a square <lb/>
            figure, we called it square and equilateral.</p>
          <p>Socr. Very well.</p>
          <p>Theœ. But the intermediate numbers, such as three and five, <lb/>
            and every one in which the factors are not the same, but a <lb/>
            greater number is multiplied by a less, or a less by a greater, <lb/>
            so that a greater and a lesser side always enclose them, we <lb/>
            compared to an oblong figure, and called them oblong numbers.</p>
          <p>Socr. Admirable. But what next ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Such lines as square an equilateral and plane number, <lb/>
            we defined to be length, and such as square an oblong number, <lb/>
            powers, as not being commensurate with them in length, but <lb/>
            with the planes which they produce. And the case is the same <lb/>
            with solids.</p>
          <p>15. Socr. Excellently done, my boys; so that Theodorus <lb/>
            appears to me not liable to the charge of having given false <lb/>
            testimony.</p>
          <p>Theœ. However, Socrates, I shall not be able to answer your <lb/>
            question about science, as I did that about length and power; <lb/>
            though you appear to me to seek something of the same kind. <lb/>
            So that Theodorus again appears to be a false witness.</p>
          <p>Socr. How so ? If, praising you for running, he should say <lb/>
            that he never met with any youth who ran so swift, and after­ <lb/>
            wards you should be defeated in running by a man who is full <lb/>
            grown and very swift, do you think he would have praised you <lb/>
            with less truth ? <note type="footnote"> a The literal translation instead of " in which the factors are the same," <lb/>
            is " which is able to become equally equal," by which is meant a number <lb/>
            multiplied by itself. </note></p><pb n="377"/>
            
          <p>Theœ. I do not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But with respect to science, as I just now spoke of it, <lb/>
            do you think it is a trifling matter to find out what it is, and <lb/>
            not in every way difficult ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. By Jupiter, I think it difficult in the extreme.</p>
          <p>16. Socr. Have confidence, then, in yourself, and think that <lb/>
            Theodorus spoke to the purpose, and endeavour by all possible <lb/>
            means to comprehend the notion both of other things, and also <lb/>
            ofscience, what it is.</p>
          <p>Theœ. As far as endeavour goes, Socrates, it shall be found <lb/>
            out.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then: for you began very well just now; <lb/>
            endeavour, in imitation of your answer about powers, as you <lb/>
            comprised those, which are many, under one general idea, so <lb/>
            likewise to designate many sciences by one notion.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Be assured, Socrates, I have often attempted to ex­ <lb/>
            amine this, on hearing the questions that are propounded by <lb/>
            you ; but I can neither persuade myself that I can say any <lb/>
            thing satisfactory, nor can I hear any one else answering in the <lb/>
            manner you require, though still I do not desist from the <lb/>
            attempt.</p>
          <p>17. Socr. You are in labour, my dear Theætetus, not be­ <lb/>
            cause you are empty, but pregnant.</p>
          <p>Theœ. I know not, Socrates; however I tell you how the <lb/>
            case stands with me.</p>
          <p>Socr. What, absurd youth, have you not heard that I am <lb/>
            son of the very noble and awful midwife Phsenarete ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I have heard so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And have you also heard that I study the same art ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. Be assured, however, that it is so: but do not betray <lb/>
            me to others. For they are not aware, my friend, that I pos­ <lb/>
            sess this art ? but they, since they are ignorant of it, do not say <lb/>
            this of me, but that I am a most absurd man, and make men <lb/>
            doubt. Have you not heard this?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. I have.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall I tell you the reason of it ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider, then, every thing that relates to midwives, <lb/>
            and you will more easily understand what I mean. For you <lb/>
            doubtless know, that not one of them delivers others, while she <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            herself can conceive and bring forth, but those who can no <lb/>
            longer bring forth.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>18. Socr. But they say that Diana is the cause of this, be­ <lb/>
            cause being herself a virgin she has the charge of child-births. <lb/>
            Now to barren women she has not given the power of be­ <lb/>
            coming midwives, because human nature is too weak to under­ <lb/>
            take an art in things of which it has had no experience, but <lb/>
            she has imposed that office on those who from their age are <lb/>
            incapable of bearing children, doing honour to the resemblance <lb/>
            of herself.</p>
          <p>Theœ. That is reasonable.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not this also reasonable and necessary, that <lb/>
            who are pregnant and who are not should be better known by <lb/>
            midwives than by others ?</p>
          <p>Thes. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Moreover, midwives by applying drugs and using en­ <lb/>
            chantments, are able both to excite and, if they please, to alle­ <lb/>
            viate the pangs, and to deliver those that bring forth with <lb/>
            difficulty, and if the child appears to be abortive, they produce <lb/>
            a miscarriage.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have you not also heard this of them, that they are <lb/>
            most skilful match-makers, as being perfectly competent to <lb/>
            distinguish what kind of woman ought to be united to what <lb/>
            kind of man, in order to produce the finest children ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I did not altogether know that.</p>
          <p>19. Socr. Be assured, then, that they pride themselves more <lb/>
            in this than in cutting the navel-string. For consider; do <lb/>
            you think it belongs to the same or a different art to cultivate <lb/>
            and gather in the fruits of the earth, and again to know in <lb/>
            what soil what plant or seed ought to be sown ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. No, but to the same art.</p>
          <p>Socr. But with respect to women, my friend, do you think <lb/>
            that there is one art of that kind b, and another of gathering in <lb/>
            the fruit ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It is not reasonable to suppose so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not. But by reason of the illegitimate and ill­ <lb/>
            assorted unions of men and women, to which the name of pan­ <lb/>
            dering has been given, midwives out of regard to their own <note type="footnote"> b That is, of choosing the soil. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            dignity avoid match-making also, fearing lest by this they <lb/>
            should incur the other imputation, since it doubtless belongs to <lb/>
            real midwives only to make marriages properly.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Such then is the office of midwives, but less important <lb/>
            than my task. For it does not happen to women, sometimes <lb/>
            to bring forth images, and sometimes realities, which cannot <lb/>
            be easily discriminated; for, if it did happen, it would be the <lb/>
            greatest and noblest work for midwives to distinguish that <lb/>
            which is true and that which is not; do you not think so ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I do.</p>
          <p>20. Socr. But in my art of midwifery all other things are <lb/>
            the same as in theirs; but it differs in this, that it delivers <lb/>
            men and not women, and that it attends to their souls bring­ <lb/>
            ing forth and not their bodies. But the most important thing in <lb/>
            my art is, that it is able to test in every possible way whether <lb/>
            the mind of a young man is bringing forth an image and a <lb/>
            cheat, or what is genuine and true: for the case is the same <lb/>
            with me as with midwives; I am barren of wisdom, and as to <lb/>
            what many have reproached me with, that I question others, <lb/>
            but give no answer myself on any subject, because I have no <lb/>
            wisdom, they reproach me truly. But the cause of this is as <lb/>
            follows: the deity compels me to act the part of a midwife, <lb/>
            but forbids me to bring forth myself. I am not, therefore, <lb/>
            myself at all wise, and I have no such discovery as is the off­ <lb/>
            spring of my own mind; but those who associate with me at <lb/>
            first 'appear, some of them, exceedingly ignorant, but all, as <lb/>
            our intimacy continues, to whom the deity grants that privi­ <lb/>
            lege, make a wonderful proficiency, as is evident both to them­ <lb/>
            selves and others; and this is clear, that they make this pro­ <lb/>
            ficiency without ever learning any thing from me, but from <lb/>
            their own resources finding and becoming possessed of many <lb/>
            beautiful things; of the midwife's office, however, the deity <lb/>
            and I are the cause. 21. But it is evident from this: many, <lb/>
            from not knowing this, and deeming themselves to be the <lb/>
            cause, but despising me, either of themselves or through the <lb/>
            persuasion of others, have left me sooner than was proper, and <lb/>
            after they have left me have miscarried for the future, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of their depraved associations, and badly nurturing <lb/>
            what they have been delivered of through me, they have de­ <lb/>
            stroyed it, setting a higher value on cheats and images than on <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            that which is true, they have at last appeared to be ignorant <lb/>
            both to themselves amd others. One of these was Aristides <lb/>
            son of Lysimachus, and many others, with some of whom, <lb/>
            when they again come to me, begging to renew their inter­ <lb/>
            course with me, and doing every thing in their power to ob­ <lb/>
            tain it, the demon that attends me prevents me from associ­ <lb/>
            ating, but with others it allows me, and these again make <lb/>
            considerable proficiency. And they that associate with me are <lb/>
            in this respect affected in the same way as women who bring <lb/>
            forth; they suffer pangs, and are filled with anxieties, to a far <lb/>
            greater degree than the women are. But their pangs my art <lb/>
            is able both to excite and appease. And these are affected in <lb/>
            this way. 22. But sometimes, Thesetetus, there are some who <lb/>
            do not appear to me to be at all pregnant, and I, knowing that <lb/>
            they do not need my assistance, very kindly sue others for <lb/>
            them, and with the aid of the deity, conjecture well enough, <lb/>
            from associating with whom they will derive benefit. Of these <lb/>
            I have handed many over to Prodicus, and many to other wise <lb/>
            and divine men. I have dwelt long on this, my excellent <lb/>
            friend, for this reason, because I suspect, as you also think <lb/>
            yourself, that you are in pain from being pregnant with some­ <lb/>
            thing inwardly. Deal with me, then, as son of a midwife, and <lb/>
            as myself skilled in midwifery, and endeavour to answer the <lb/>
            questions I put to you to the best of your ability. And if, on <lb/>
            examining any thing that you say, I shall consider it to be an <lb/>
            image and not true, and should thereupon remove it and throw <lb/>
            it away, do not be angry with me, like women who are deli­ <lb/>
            vered for the first time are for their children: for many, my <lb/>
            admirable friend, have ere this been so affected towards me as <lb/>
            to be actually ready to bite me, when I take away any trifle <lb/>
            from them, and they do not think that I do this with a good <lb/>
            design, in that they are very far from knowing that no deity <lb/>
            designs ill to men, and that neither do I do any thing of this <lb/>
            kind through ill-will, but because it is by no means allowable <lb/>
            for me to give way to falsehood and conceal the truth. 23. <lb/>
            Again, therefore, from the beginning, Theætetus, endeavour to <lb/>
            tell me what science is ; but never say that you are unable to <lb/>
            do so; for if God wills and you strive manfully you will be <lb/>
            able.</p>
          <p>Ther. Indeed, Socrates, when you are thus urgent, it would <lb/>
            be disgraceful for one not to endeavour to the utmost of one's <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            power to say what one is able. He, then, that knows any <lb/>
            thing appears to me to perceive what he knows, and, as it now <lb/>
            seems, science is nothing else than perception.</p>
          <p>Socr. Well and nobly said, my boy; for it is right thus to <lb/>
            declare one's opinion. But come, let us consider this toge­ <lb/>
            ther, whether it is solid or empty. Science, you say, is per­ <lb/>
            ception ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. You appear, indeed, to have given no mean definition <lb/>
            of science,, but that which Protagoras has given; but he said <lb/>
            the same thing in a different manner. For he says that man <lb/>
            is the measure of all things, of the existence of those that ex­ <lb/>
            ist, and of the non-existence of those that do not exist. You <lb/>
            have doubtless read this ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I have read it, and that often.</p>
          <p>24. Socr. Does he not say pretty much, that such as every <lb/>
            thing appears to me, such it is to me, and as it appears to you, <lb/>
            such it is to you, but you and I are men ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. He does indeed say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is probable however that a wise man does not trifle; <lb/>
            let us, therefore, follow him. Does it not sometimes happen <lb/>
            that when the same wind blows, one of us is cold; and another <lb/>
            not, and one slightly, but another exceedingly ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether, then, shall we say, that the wind at that <lb/>
            time is in itself cold or not cold? or shall we believe Prota­ <lb/>
            goras, that it is cold to him that is cold, but not to him that is <lb/>
            not?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Sacr. Does it not, then, appear so to both of them ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But to appear is the same as to be perceived ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Appearance then and perception are the same in <lb/>
            things hot, and every thing of that kind ; for such as every <lb/>
            one perceives things to be; such also they seem to be to every <lb/>
            one.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Perception, therefore, has always reference to that <lb/>
            which really is, and is free from falsehood, as being science.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It appears so.-</p><pb n="382"/>
            
          <p>25. Socr. By the graces, then, was not Protagoras a very <lb/>
            wise man, and did he express himself thus enigmatically to us, <lb/>
            the general rabble, but speak the truth to his disciples in <lb/>
            secret ?</p>
          <p>,Thecæ. What mean you by this, Socrates?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will tell you, and that no mean account; he asserts, <lb/>
            that no one thing exists of itself, nor can you correctly desig­ <lb/>
            nate any thing by any quality, but if you call it great, it will <lb/>
            appear small, and if heavy, light, and so with every thing else; <lb/>
            as if nothing was one thing, or any thing, or possessed of any <lb/>
            quality: but as if all things which we say exist, become so <lb/>
            from impulse, motion, and admixture with each other, thereby <lb/>
            designating them incorrectly ; for nothing ever is, but is always <lb/>
            becoming. And in this all the wise men in succession, except <lb/>
            Parmenides, agreed, namely, Protagoras, Heraclitus, and Empe­ <lb/>
            docles, and of the poets, those who rank highest in each kind <lb/>
            of poetry, in comedy Epicharmus, and in tragedy Homer; <lb/>
            for in saying that c " Oceanus is father of the gods, and Tethys <lb/>
            mother," he asserts that all things are produced by flux and <lb/>
            motion. Does he not seem to say so ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. To me he does.</p>
          <p>26. Socr. Who then can contend with such an army, with <lb/>
            Homer for its leader, and not be ridiculous ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is not easy, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not, indeed, Theætetus. For this is a strong <lb/>
            proof in favour of their argument, that motion gives the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of existence and of generation, but repose of non-exist­ <lb/>
            ence and decay; for heat and fire, which engenders and sup­ <lb/>
            ports other things, is itself engendered by impulse and friction, <lb/>
            but this is motion. Are not these the origin of fire ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Surely they are.</p>
          <p>Socr. And moreover the race of animals springs from the <lb/>
            same causes.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? Does not the habit of the body perish by <lb/>
            rest and inaction, but is it not for the most part preserved by <lb/>
            exercise and motion?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But does not the habit of the soul acquire and retain <lb/>
            learning and become better by study and practice, which are <note type="footnote"> c Iliad, xiv. 201. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            motions, but by rest, which is want of practice and ignorance, <lb/>
            it neither learns any thing, and forgets what it has learnt ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>27. Socr. Motion, therefore, is good both for the soul and <lb/>
            the body; but rest, the contrary.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall I add further, with respect to stillness of the air, <lb/>
            and calms and things of that kind, that rest corrupts and de­ <lb/>
            stroys, but the contrary preserves. And besides this shall I <lb/>
            put the finishing stroke to my argument by compelling you to <lb/>
            admit, that by the golden chain Homer meant nothing else than <lb/>
            the sun, and intimated that as long as the universe and the sun <lb/>
            are moved, all things exist, and are preserved, both amongst gods <lb/>
            and amongst men; but if they were to stand still, as it were <lb/>
            bound, all things would be destroyed, and, as the saying is, <lb/>
            turned upside down.</p>
          <p>Thece. He appears to me too, Socrates, to intimate what you <lb/>
            say.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then put the argument thus, my excellent friend: <lb/>
            first with respect to the eyes, suppose that what you call white <lb/>
            colour is not any thing different, external to your eyes, nor in <lb/>
            your eyes ; nor can you assign it any place ; for then it would <lb/>
            have a fixed position, and would continue, and not be liable to <lb/>
            production.</p>
          <p>28. Theœ. But how ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us follow our late principle, and lay it down that <lb/>
            there is nothing which is of itself one thing; and thus black <lb/>
            and white, and every other colour, will appear to us to be pro­ <lb/>
            duced by the application of the eyes to a corresponding move­ <lb/>
            ment, and each thing that we say is colour, will neither be that <lb/>
            which is applied, nor that to which it is applied, but some inter­ <lb/>
            mediate production peculiar to each. Would you positively <lb/>
            maintain, that what each colour appears to you, such it also <lb/>
            appears to a dog, and every other animal ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Not I, by Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? Does any thing appear similar to another <lb/>
            man and to you ? are you positive about this, or rather that it <lb/>
            does not appear the same even to you, because you are never <lb/>
            identical with yourself ?'</p>
          <p>Thecæ. The latter seems to me to be the case rather than the <lb/>
            former.</p><pb n="384"/>
            
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, that which we measure by comparison, <lb/>
            or which we touch, were great, or white, or warm, it would <lb/>
            never, by coming in contact with any thing else, become differ­ <lb/>
            ent, for it would not be in any respect changed. But if that <lb/>
            which measures or touches were some one of these things, it <lb/>
            could not, in consequence of something else approaching it or <lb/>
            being affected in any way, become any thing else, because it <lb/>
            would not itself be in any respect affected. 29. For now, my <lb/>
            friend, we are in a manner compelled to assert things altoge­ <lb/>
            gether wonderful and ridiculous, as Protagoras would acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge, and every one who supports his opinions.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How and what do you mean?</p>
          <p>Socr. Take a trifling example, and you will understand all <lb/>
            that I wish. Six dice for instance, if you should put four by <lb/>
            them, we say are more than the four and half as many again, <lb/>
            but if twelve we say they are fewer, and the half; nor would it <lb/>
            be allowable to say otherwise. Would you allow it?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Not I, indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? If Protagoras or any one else should <lb/>
            ask, " Thesetetus, is it possible for any thing to become greater <lb/>
            or more otherwise than by being increased ? What would you <lb/>
            answer ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. If, Socrates, I should answer what appears to me to <lb/>
            be the case with reference to the present question, I should <lb/>
            say that it is not possible; but if with reference to the former <lb/>
            question, to avoid contradicting myself, I should say that it is <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Juno, well and divinely said, my friend. But, as <lb/>
            it seems, if you should answer that it is possible, something <lb/>
            like that saying of Euripides will happen; for the tongue will <lb/>
            be blameless, but the mind not blameless d.</p>
          <p>Theœ. True.</p>
          <p>30. Socr. If, therefore, you and I were skilful and wise, <lb/>
            after we had thoroughly examined our minds, we should then, <lb/>
            out of mere wantonness, make trial of each other's strength, and <lb/>
            engaging in such a contest after the manner of the sophists, <lb/>
            should mutually parry argument with argument: but now, as <lb/>
            being novices, we shall desire first of all, to examine what the <lb/>
            things themselves are which we have in our minds, whether <lb/>
            they accord with each other, or not at all. <note type="footnote"> d See Eurip. Hippol. 1. 612. </note></p><pb n="385"/>
            
          <p>Theœ. I should certainly desire this.</p>
          <p>Socr. And so do I. But since this is the case, shall we not <lb/>
            quietly, seeing we have abundance of leisure, again consider, <lb/>
            not feeling any annoyance, but really examining ourselves, in <lb/>
            order to see what those appearances in us are. And on con­ <lb/>
            sidering them, we shall say in the first place, I think, that no­ <lb/>
            thing ever becomes greater or less, either in bulk, or number, <lb/>
            as long as it continues equal to itself. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>31. Socr. And, in the second place, that a thing to which <lb/>
            nothing is either added and from which nothing is taken away, <lb/>
            will neither be ever increased or diminished, but always be <lb/>
            equal.</p>
          <p>Theo. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And shall we not say, in the third place, that it is im­ <lb/>
            possible for a thing which did not before exist, to exist after­ <lb/>
            wards, without it has been produced and is produced.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so, indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. These three admissions, I think, contend with each <lb/>
            other in our soul, when we speak about dice, or when we say that <lb/>
            I, being of the size I am, having neither increased, nor suffered <lb/>
            diminution in the space of a year, am now larger than you, who <lb/>
            are a young man, but afterwards less, though my bulk has not <lb/>
            been diminished, but yours has been increased. For I am after­ <lb/>
            wards, what I was not before, without having been made so. <lb/>
            32. For it is impossible for a thing to have been made, with­ <lb/>
            out being made, and having lost nothing of my bulk, I cannot <lb/>
            have been made less. And the case is the same with ten <lb/>
            thousand other things with reference to ten thousand others, if <lb/>
            we admit this. You doubtless follow me, Thesetetus ; for you <lb/>
            appear to me not to be a novice in things of this kind.</p>
          <p>Theo. By the gods, Socrates, I wonder extremely what <lb/>
            these things can be, and, truly, sometimes when I look at <lb/>
            them, I become dizzy.</p>
          <p>Socr. Theodorus, my friend, appears not to have formed an <lb/>
            erroneous estimate of your disposition; for wonder is very <lb/>
            much the affection of a philosopher ; for there is no other be­ <lb/>
            ginning of philosophy than this, and he who said that Iris was <lb/>
            the daughter of Thaumas e, seems not to have described her <lb/>
            genealogy badly. But do you understand now, why these <note type="footnote"> e Hesiod, Theog. 1. 780. Thauma signifies " wonder." </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            things are so, from what we say Protagoras maintains, or <lb/>
            not yet ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I don't think I do yet.</p>
          <p>33. Socr. Shall you not, then, be obliged to me, if I assist <lb/>
            you in searching out the true, but concealed opinion of a man, <lb/>
            or rather of men of celebrity ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. How should I not be, and indeed exceedingly obliged <lb/>
            to you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Look round, then, and see that no profane person <lb/>
            hears us. But they are so who think that nothing else exists <lb/>
            except what they can grasp with their hands, but do not admit <lb/>
            that actions, and productions, and whatever is invisible, are to <lb/>
            be reckoned in the number of things that exist.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Indeed, Socrates, you speak of hard and obstinate <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>Socr. For they are very ignorant f, my boy. But there are <lb/>
            others far more refined than these, whose mysteries I am about <lb/>
            to reveal to you. Their principle, on which all the things, that <lb/>
            we have just now mentioned, depend, is this : That the universe <lb/>
            is motion, and nothing else besides, but that there are two <lb/>
            species of motion, each infinite in amount, and that one has an <lb/>
            active, the other a passive power. 34, That from the inter­ <lb/>
            course and friction of these with one another are formed pro­ <lb/>
            ductions infinite in number, but of two kinds, one that is per­ <lb/>
            ceivable, the other perception, which always coincides and is <lb/>
            engendered together with that which is perceivable. Now to <lb/>
            the perceptions we give the following names, seeing, hearing, <lb/>
            smelling, cold and heat, and moreover pleasures, pains, desires, <lb/>
            and fears are so called, and there are innumerable others which <lb/>
            have no name, and vast multitudes that have been named: <lb/>
            again there is a class of perceivable things akin to each of <lb/>
            these, all kinds of colours to all kinds of vision, and in like <lb/>
            manner voices to hearing, and other perceivable things are pro­ <lb/>
            duced corresponding to the other perceptions. What then is <lb/>
            the meaning of this discourse, Thegetetus, in reference to the <lb/>
            former ? Do you understand what it is ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Not very well, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. But observe if by any means it can be brought to a <lb/>
            conclusion. For it means to say that all these things are, as <lb/>
            we said, moved, and that there is swiftness and slowness in <note type="footnote"> f Literally "unmusical." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            their motion. 35. Whatever then is slow is moved in the <lb/>
            same place and towards things near it, and so produces, and <lb/>
            the things which are produced are accordingly slower; and on <lb/>
            the contrary, whatever is swift moves towards things at a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, and so produces, and the things which are produced are <lb/>
            accordingly swifter, for they are impelled, and their motion <lb/>
            consists in impulse. When, therefore, the eye and any of the <lb/>
            things that correspond to it meet together and produce white­ <lb/>
            ness, and the perception connate to this, which would never <lb/>
            have been produced had each of them approached something <lb/>
            else, then they being in the meanwhile impelled, that is to say, <lb/>
            sight from the eyes, and whiteness from that which together <lb/>
            with it generates colour, the eye becomes filled with vision, <lb/>
            and then sees, and becomes not vision, but a seeing eye; but <lb/>
            that which together with it generates colour is filled with <lb/>
            whiteness, and becomes not whiteness, but white, whether it is <lb/>
            wood or stone, or whatever may happen to be tinted with <lb/>
            a colour of this kind. 36. And so with the rest, hard and <lb/>
            warm, and every thing, we must in the same manner conceive <lb/>
            that none of these is any thing of itself, as we have observed <lb/>
            before that all things and of all kinds are produced by their <lb/>
            intercourse with each other, from motion, for, as they say, we <lb/>
            cannot determine positively with regard to any one thing, that <lb/>
            that which is active really exists, nor again that which is pas­ <lb/>
            sive ; for neither is the active any thing before it meets with <lb/>
            the passive, nor the passive before it meets with the active ; and <lb/>
            that which, meeting with any thing, is active, when it falls <lb/>
            upon something else, is found to be passive. 37. So that it <lb/>
            results from all this, as we said at the beginning, that nothing <lb/>
            is essentially one, but is always being produced by something, <lb/>
            and the word " being" must be entirely done away with, <lb/>
            although we have already been compelled by custom and igno­ <lb/>
            rance to use it frequently; but, as the sages say, we ought not <lb/>
            to allow any thing, either of any other, or of me, or this, or <lb/>
            that, or any other name which designates permanency, but that <lb/>
            according to nature, things ought to be said to be produced and <lb/>
            made, to perish and be changed: so, if any one asserts per­ <lb/>
            manency of any thing, he who does so may easily be confuted. <lb/>
            Thus then we ought to speak of things individually, and of <lb/>
            many collectively, to which collection are given the names of <lb/>
            man, stone, animal, and each several species. Do not these <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            things, Theætetus, appear pleasant to you, and have you not <lb/>
            found them agreeable to your taste ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I don't know, Socrates; for I can't make you out; <lb/>
            whether you are giving your own opinions or are trying me.</p>
          <p>38. Socr. You do not remember, my friend, that I neither <lb/>
            know nor claim as my own any of these things, but that I am <lb/>
            barren of them, but I act the midwife towards you, and for this <lb/>
            purpose I enchant you, and put before you the opinions of the <lb/>
            several wise men, that you may taste them, until I bring your <lb/>
            own opinion to light: but when it is brought forth, I will then <lb/>
            examine whether it shall prove to be empty or productive. Be <lb/>
            therefore confident and bold, and answer in an honest and <lb/>
            manly way, what you think of the questions I put to you.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Ask then.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me then again, whether it is your opinion that the <lb/>
            good, and the beautiful, and every thing that we just now men­ <lb/>
            tioned, have an actual existence or are constantly being produced ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. To me indeed, when I hear you thus explaining the <lb/>
            matter, it is wonderful how far you appear to have reason on <lb/>
            your side, and I think that your statements must be admitted.</p>
          <p>39. Socr. Let us not, then, omit what remains of it. But it <lb/>
            remains that we should speak of dreams, diseases, and, besides <lb/>
            other things, of madness; and whatever else is called error of <lb/>
            hearing or seeing, or of any other perception. For you know, <lb/>
            without doubt, that in all these cases the doctrine which we <lb/>
            have just now described, is considered to be completely con­ <lb/>
            futed, since the sensations produced in these instances are <lb/>
            utterly false, and so far are the things that appear to each per­ <lb/>
            son from existing, that quite contrariwise none of the things <lb/>
            that appear have any real existence.</p>
          <p>Theœ. You speak most truly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. What argument, then, remains for him, who asserts <lb/>
            that perception is science, and that things which appear to <lb/>
            every one are to that person what they appear to be ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have no answer <lb/>
            to give, because you just now blamed me for having said so: <lb/>
            but in truth I cannot controvert the fact, that those who are <lb/>
            mad or dreaming, form false opinions, since some of the former <lb/>
            think they are gods, and the latter that they are winged and <lb/>
            fancy that they are flying in their sleep.</p>
          <p>40. Socr. Do you not know, then, the controversy that is <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            raised on these points, especially about dreaming and being <lb/>
            awake ?</p>
          <p>Them. What is that?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which I think you have often heard, when people <lb/>
            ask, what proof one could give, if any one should ask us now <lb/>
            at the present moment, whether we are asleep, and all our <lb/>
            thoughts are dreams, or whether we are awake, and really con­ <lb/>
            versing with each other.</p>
          <p>Them. And indeed, Socrates, it is difficult to say what proof <lb/>
            one ought to give: for in both states all things in a manner <lb/>
            correspond with each other. For, with respect to our present <lb/>
            conversation, nothing hinders our fancying that we converse <lb/>
            with each other in a dream: and when in sleep we fancy we <lb/>
            are telling our dreams, the similarity of one with the other is <lb/>
            surprising s.</p>
          <p>Socr. You see, then, that it is not difficult to raise a con­ <lb/>
            troversy, since it is even controverted whether a state is that <lb/>
            of being awake or dreaming; moreover since the time during <lb/>
            which we sleep is equal to that when we are awake, in each of <lb/>
            these states our soul persists that the opinions that are present <lb/>
            for the time are most certainly true, so that for an equal space <lb/>
            of time we say that these are real, and for an equal space <lb/>
            that those are, and we are equally positive for each of them.</p>
          <p>Them. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>41. Socr. May not, then, the same argument be used with <lb/>
            respect to diseases and madness, except with regard to time, <lb/>
            that it is not equal.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Right.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? Shall truth be defined by length and <lb/>
            brevity of time ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. That, indeed, would be ridiculous in many ways.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have you, then, any other clear mark by which you <lb/>
            can shew which of these opinions is true ?</p>
          <p>Theo. I think not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Hear, therefore, from me, what will be said about <lb/>
            these things by those who maintain that appearances are <lb/>
            always real to the person to whom they appear. They will <lb/>
            question you thus, I think: " Theaetetus, can a thing which is <lb/>
            totally different from another, have the same power as that <note type="footnote"> g Of conversations when awake, and of fancied conversations in <lb/>
            dreams. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            other ?" And we are not to suppose that the thing we ask <lb/>
            about is partly the same, and partly different, but altogether <lb/>
            different.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is impossible that it should possess any thing the <lb/>
            same, either in power, or in any other respect, since it is <lb/>
            entirely different.</p>
          <p>42. Socr. Must we not, then, necessarily confess, that a <lb/>
            thing of this kind is dissimilar ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, any thing happens to become similar or <lb/>
            dissimilar to any thing, whether to itself or to another, so far <lb/>
            as it becomes similar we shall say it is the same, but, so far <lb/>
            as dissimilar, different.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have we not said before, that there are many, and in­ <lb/>
            deed innumerable things, which are active, and likewise passive ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And moreover, that one thing commingled first with <lb/>
            one thing and then with another, will produce not the same, <lb/>
            but different things.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us speak, then, of you and me and other things in <lb/>
            the same manner, of Socrates in health, and again of Socrates <lb/>
            ill. Whether shall we say that the latter is similar to the <lb/>
            former or dissimilar ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. By Socrates ill, do you mean the whole of the latter <lb/>
            opposed to the whole of the former, Socrates in health ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You understand me perfectly; that is the very thing <lb/>
            I mean.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Dissimilar, surely.</p>
          <p>43. Socr. And is it not different inasmuch as it is dis­ <lb/>
            similar ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And should you not speak in the same way of Socrates <lb/>
            asleep, and in the several states we just now described ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I should.</p>
          <p>Socr. But will not each of those things whose nature it is <lb/>
            to make any thing something else, when it lights upon Socrates <lb/>
            in health, treat me as one thing, and when ill, as a different <lb/>
            thing ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. How should it not ?</p><pb n="391"/>
            
          <p>Socr. And shall we not produce different things in each <lb/>
            case, both I the patient, and that the agent ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Now when I drink wine, being in health, it appears <lb/>
            to me pleasant and sweet.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. For, from what has been already granted, the agent <lb/>
            and the patient produce sweetness and perception, both being <lb/>
            put in motion together; and the perception proceeding from the <lb/>
            patient causes the tongue to perceive, but the sweetness pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from the wine and set in motion about it, causes the <lb/>
            wine both to be and to appear sweet to a healthy tongue.</p>
          <p>44. Theœ. Certainly, what was granted before comes to <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>Socr. But when it lights on me, being ill, first of all does <lb/>
            not a different thing in reality light on one who is not the <lb/>
            same person ? for it approaches one who is dissimilar.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But Socrates in this state, and the wine drunk, again <lb/>
            generate different things, with regard to the tongue a percep­ <lb/>
            tion of bitterness, and with regard to the wine bitterness pro­ <lb/>
            duced and set in motion, and that, indeed, not bitterness, but <lb/>
            bitter, and me not perception, but perceiving.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Exactly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore I shall never become any thing else while I <lb/>
            perceive thus; for a different perception of a different thing <lb/>
            causes the percipient to be changed and different: nor will <lb/>
            that, which thus affects me, by coming in contact with another, <lb/>
            though it produces the same effect, ever become such as it was <lb/>
            to me; for by generating a different thing from a different <lb/>
            thing it will become changed.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither, then, shall I become such by myself, nor will <lb/>
            it become such by itselfh.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is necessary that I, when I become percipient, <lb/>
            should become so in relation to something : for it is impossible ' <lb/>
            to become percipient, and yet percipient of nothing : and it is <lb/>
            likewise necessary, when any thing becomes sweet or bitter, or <note type="footnote"> * That is to say, the relation between agent and patient is so close that <lb/>
            neither can be what it is, under that particular aspect, without the other. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            any thing of the kind, that it should become so in relation to <lb/>
            some one; for it is impossible for a thing to become sweet, <lb/>
            and yet sweet to no one.</p>
          <p>Them. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>45. Socr. It remains, I think, that we i, if we are, should be, <lb/>
            or if we are produced, should be produced, by relation to each <lb/>
            other; since necessity unites our existence together, and unites <lb/>
            it to no other thing, nor even to ourselves. It remains, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that we are united to each other. So that, if any one <lb/>
            says that any thing exists, he must say that it exists for some­ <lb/>
            thing, or of something, or in relation to something, and in like <lb/>
            manner of any thing said to be produced: but he must not <lb/>
            say, nor must he allow any one else to say, that any thing ex­ <lb/>
            ists or is produced of itself, as the argument we have deduced <lb/>
            clearly proves.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Assuredly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Since, then, that which affects me is relative to me <lb/>
            and not to another, do not I perceive it, and another not per­ <lb/>
            ceive it ?</p>
          <p>Thece. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. My perception, therefore, is true to me ; for it always <lb/>
            belongs to my existence. And I, according to Protagoras, am <lb/>
            a judge of things that exist in relation to me, that they do ex­ <lb/>
            ist, and of things that do not so exist, that they do not exist.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>46. Socr. How then, since I am not deceived and do not <lb/>
            falter in my mind about things that exist or are produced, can <lb/>
            I fail to have a scientific knowledge of things which I per­ <lb/>
            ceive ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It cannot fail to be so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It was, therefore, very finely said by you, that science <lb/>
            is nothing else than perception; and all come to the same re­ <lb/>
            sult, the doctrine of Homer and Heraclitus and all that tribe, <lb/>
            that all things are in motion like streams, and that of the very <lb/>
            wise Protagoras, that man is the measure of all things, and <lb/>
            that of Theætetus, that, if this is the case, perception must be <lb/>
            science. Is it not so, Theaetetus ? Shall we say that this is <lb/>
            your new-born infant as it were, delivered by my midwifery ? <lb/>
            How say you ?</p>
          <p>Thece. It is necessary to say so, Socrates. <note type="footnote"> &gt; "We," that is, the agent and patient. </note></p><pb n="393"/>
            
          <p>47. Socr. This, then, as it appears, we have with much dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty produced, whatever it may turn out to be. But after the <lb/>
            birth, we must, in truth, perform the ceremony of runningj <lb/>
            round in argument, and consider whether, without our per­ <lb/>
            ceiving it, that which is produced is not unworthy of being <lb/>
            reared, but empty and false. Do you think that we ought <lb/>
            by all means to rear your offspring, and not expose it ? and <lb/>
            will you endure to see it refuted, and not be very much offended <lb/>
            if any one should take it away from you, as having been deli­ <lb/>
            vered for the first time ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Theætetus will endure this, Socrates, for he is not at <lb/>
            all morose. But, by the gods, say whether it is not so.</p>
          <p>Socr. You are really very fond of discussion, Theodorus, and <lb/>
            pleasant, in thinking that I am a sack full of arguments, and <lb/>
            that I can easily pick one out and prove that these things are <lb/>
            not so. But you do not observe how the case stands, that no <lb/>
            argument proceeds from me, but always from the person who <lb/>
            is conversing with me, and that I know nothing but a very <lb/>
            little, just enough to apprehend and examine moderately well <lb/>
            an argument advanced by another who is wise. And now I <lb/>
            will endeavour to do this from him, without saying any thing <lb/>
            -of myself.</p>
          <p>48. Theo. You say well, Socrates ; then do so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you know, Theodorus, what I wonder at in your <lb/>
            friend Protagoras ?</p>
          <p>Theo. What?</p>
          <p>Socr. In other respects I thought what he said was very <lb/>
            acceptable, that what appears to each person, really exists, but <lb/>
            I wondered at the beginning of his essay, that he did not say <lb/>
            at the commencement of his book on Truth that a pig or a <lb/>
            cynocephalus or some other more monstrous creature that pos­ <lb/>
            sesses perception, is the measure of all things, in order that he <lb/>
            might begin by speaking grandly and very contemptuously to <lb/>
            us, shewing that we indeed admire him as if he were a god, <lb/>
            for his wisdom, whereas with respect to understanding, he is <lb/>
            no better than a tadpole, let alone any other man. What are <lb/>
            we to say, Theodorus ? 49. For if that opinion which is formed <lb/>
            from perception will be true to each person, and no one will be <note type="footnote"> j On the fifth day after the birth of a child the midwives, having purl- <lb/>

            these are right and true, why in the world, my friend, should <lb/>
            Protagoras be so wise as to be thought justly worthy to teach <lb/>
            others for high pay, while we are more ignorant and must have <lb/>
            recourse to him, though each person is to himself the measure <lb/>
            of his own wisdom ? How can we avoid saying that Protagoras <lb/>
            speaks thus out of joke ? As to myself and my art of mid­ <lb/>
            wifery, I say nothing of the ridicule we should be exposed to, <lb/>
            and I think, so would the whole study of reasoning; for will it <lb/>
            not be great and signal vanity to examine and endeavour to <lb/>
            confute the fancies and opinions of others, each person's being <lb/>
            true, if the Truth of Protagoras is true, and he has not uttered <lb/>
            his oracles in sport from the sanctuary of his book ?</p>
          <p>50. Theo. Socrates, he is my friend, as you just now said; <lb/>
            I cannot, therefore, allow Protagoras to be confuted by my <lb/>
            concessions, nor yet can I oppose you contrary to my own <lb/>
            opinion. Again, therefore, take Thesetetus; for he certainly <lb/>
            appears to have listened to you just now very attentively.</p>
          <p>Socr. If you went to Lacedæmon, Theodorus, to the wrest­ <lb/>
            ling grounds, and were to see others naked, some of them <lb/>
            mean, should you hesitate to strip yourself and shew your own <lb/>
            form in turn ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Why do you think I should not, at least if they would <lb/>
            permit me and be persuaded by me ? as I think I shall now <lb/>
            persuade you to allow me to be a spectator, and not drag me to <lb/>
            the gymnasium, now that my limbs are stiff, but for you to <lb/>
            wrestle with one who is younger and more supple.</p>
          <p>51. Socr. But if this is agreeable to you, Theodorus, it is <lb/>
            not disagreeable to me, as the vulgar saying goes. I must <lb/>
            have recourse again, therefore, to the wise Theætetus. Tell <lb/>
            me, then, Thesetetus, first of all as to what we just now dis­ <lb/>
            cussed, do you not wonder with me, that you have so suddenly <lb/>
            discovered yourself to be not inferior in wisdom to any man <lb/>
            or god ? or do you think that the measure of Protagoras has <lb/>
            less to do with gods than men ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Not I, by Jupiter: and I very much wonder at your <lb/>
            question. For when we discussed in what manner they said, <lb/>
            that what appears to each person is true to him to whom it <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            appears, it seemed to me to be well said, but now the very <lb/>
            contrary has speedily occurred to me.</p>
          <p>Boer. For you are young, my dear boy, and quickly give ear <lb/>
            to and are persuaded by plausible speeches. For to these <lb/>
            things Protagoras or some one on his behalf would say: <lb/>
            " Noble boys and old men, you here sit and converse together, <lb/>
            dragging gods into the question, of whom, whether they exist <lb/>
            or not, I do not think proper either to speak or write, and <lb/>
            what the multitude hear and admit, this you assert, as if it <lb/>
            were strange if every man did not excel any beast whatever in <lb/>
            wisdom, but you do not adduce any proof, or conclusive argu­ <lb/>
            ment, but have recourse to likelihood, which if Theodorus or <lb/>
            any other geometrician were to employ in geometry, he would <lb/>
            be deemed unworthy of notice." 52. Do you, therefore, and <lb/>
            Theodorus, consider, whether on such matters you will admit <lb/>
            of arguments deduced from probability and likelihood.</p>
          <p>Thece. But, Socrates, neither would you nor we say that this <lb/>
            is right.</p>
          <p>Socr. We must therefore consider it in another way, as it <lb/>
            appears, according to what you and Theodorus says.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. In another way, certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us, then, consider it thus, whether science and per­ <lb/>
            ception are the same or different: for to this surely our whole <lb/>
            discourse tends, and for the sake of this we have mooted these <lb/>
            many absurd points; have we not ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we allow then that whatever we perceive by <lb/>
            sight or hearing, this we at the same time know ? for instance, <lb/>
            before we have learnt the language of barbarians, whether shall <lb/>
            we deny that we hear them when they speak, or that we both <lb/>
            hear and know what they say ? And again, when unacquainted <lb/>
            with letters, on looking at them, whether shall we insist that <lb/>
            we do not see, or know them, though we do see them ?</p>
          <p>53. Theœ. Whichever of them, Socrates, we see and hear, <lb/>
            we shall say that we know, for that of the latter we see and <lb/>
            know the form and colour, and of the former, that we both hear <lb/>
            and know the sharpness and flatness of the sounds; but that <lb/>
            what grammarians and interpreters teach about them, we <lb/>
            neither perceive by sight or hearing, nor know.</p>
          <p>Socr. Admirable, Theætetus, and it is not worth while to dis­ <lb/>
            pute with you about these things, in order that you may make <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            a greater proficiency. But observe also this other difficulty <lb/>
            that stands in our way, and consider how we can repel it.</p>
          <p>Theœ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>. Socr. This: if any one should ask, whether it is possible for <lb/>
            a person who still possesses and retains the memory of a thing <lb/>
            which he once knew, at the very time when he remembers it, <lb/>
            not to know the very thing that he remembers. But I am <lb/>
            becoming prolix, as it seems, through a wish to ask whether a <lb/>
            person who has learnt any thing and remembers it, does not <lb/>
            know it.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How should he not, Socrates? for, otherwise, what <lb/>
            you say would be a prodigy.</p>
          <p>Socr. Am I then trifling? Consider. 54. Do you not then <lb/>
            say that to see is to perceive, and that sight is perception ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Has not he, then, who sees any thing, obtained a scien­ <lb/>
            tific knowledge of that which he sees, according to our late <lb/>
            argument ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? do you not say that memory is some­ <lb/>
            thing ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether of nothing or something ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Of something, surely.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not, then, of the things which he learns and per­ <lb/>
            ceives, of some such things as these ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. What else?</p>
          <p>Socr. And what a person sees, does he not sometimes re­ <lb/>
            member ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. He does remember.</p>
          <p>Socr. When he shuts his eyes too ? or, when he does this, <lb/>
            does he forget ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It would be strange to say that, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. We must say it though, if we would keep to our former <lb/>
            argument, otherwise it is gone.</p>
          <p>Theœ. And I suspect so, by Jupiter, though I do not clearly <lb/>
            understand it; but tell me how.</p>
          <p>55. Socr. Thus. We say that a person who sees has ob­ <lb/>
            tained a scientific knowledge of that which he sees; for sight <lb/>
            and perception and science are allowed to be the same.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly.</p><pb n="397"/>
            
          <p>Socr. But lie who sees, and has obtained a scientific know­ <lb/>
            ledge of that which he sees, if he shuts his eyes, remembers it <lb/>
            indeed, but does not see it. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But to say that he does not see is as much as to say <lb/>
            he does not know, since to see is the same thing as to know.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. It follows, therefore, that a person who still remembers <lb/>
            a thing of which he had a scientific knowledge, does not know <lb/>
            it, because he does not see it; which we have said would be <lb/>
            a prodigy, if it happened.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. You say most truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. An impossibility, then, appears to result, if any one <lb/>
            should say that science and perception are the same.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Each, then, must be confessed to be different.</p>
          <p>Theæ. So it seems.</p>
          <p>56. Socr. What then is science ? must again, as it appears, <lb/>
            be enquired from the beginning. What however shall we do, <lb/>
            Theeetetus ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. About what ?</p>
          <p>Socr. We appear to me, like a dunghill cock, to have jumped <lb/>
            from our argument and begun to crow, before we have gained <lb/>
            the victory.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Like disputants we seem to have come to an agree­ <lb/>
            ment about the allowed meaning of words, and, having got the <lb/>
            better thus far in the discussion, to be content, and though we <lb/>
            say we are not wranglers but lovers of wisdom, we do the same <lb/>
            as those shrewd men.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do not yet understand what you mean.</p>
          <p>Socr. But I will endeavour to explain what I mean on this <lb/>
            point. We enquired whether a person who has learnt and <lb/>
            remembers any thing, does not know it, and having shewn that <lb/>
            a person who has seen a thing and then shut his eyes, remem­ <lb/>
            bers it, but does not see it, we proved that he does not know it <lb/>
            and remembers it at the same time; but that this is impossible. <lb/>
            And so the Protagorean fable is destroyed, and yours at the <lb/>
            same time of science and perception, that they are the same.</p>
          <p>57. Theæ. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It would not be so, my friend, I think, if the father cf <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            the other fable were alive, but he would defend it stoutly : but <lb/>
            now, as it is an orphan, we have insulted it. For not even the <lb/>
            guardians, whom Protagoras left, are willing to assist it, in the <lb/>
            number of whom is Theodorus here. We ourselves, however, <lb/>
            for justice sake, will venture to assist it.</p>
          <p>Theo. It is not I, Socrates, but rather Callias son of Hippo­ <lb/>
            nicus who is guardian of his doctrine ; for I very quickly turn <lb/>
            aside from mere disputations to geometry. Nevertheless, I <lb/>
            shall be obliged to you if you will assist him.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say well, Theodorus. Observe, then, what <lb/>
            assistance I give. For any one would make more strange <lb/>
            admissions than those just now, if he did not attend carefully <lb/>
            to the meaning of words, in what way we are generally accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to employ them in affirming and denying. Shall I tell <lb/>
            you or Thesetetus, in what way ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Tell us both together, but let the younger answer. <lb/>
            For if he makes a mistake, it will be less disgraceful.</p>
          <p>58. Socr. I am going to propose then a very strange ques­ <lb/>
            tion ; it-is, I think, something of this kind: Is it possible that <lb/>
            he who knows any thing should not know the thing that he <lb/>
            knows ?</p>
          <p>Theo. What shall we answer, Thesetetus ?</p>
          <p>Thece. Impossible without doubt, I think.</p>
          <p>Socr. Not so, if you maintain that to see is to know. For <lb/>
            how will you deal with this inexplicable question, as the say­ <lb/>
            ing is, you will be caught in a well, if an imperturbable oppo­ <lb/>
            nent should ask you, closing one of your eyes with his hand, <lb/>
            whether you see his dress with the closed eye ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I should say, I think, Not with this, but I do with the <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>Socr. Would you not, therefore, see, and not see the same <lb/>
            thing at the same time ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. In some respects.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do not require this, he will say, nor did I ask in <lb/>
            what respect, but whether, what you know, this' you also do <lb/>
            not know. But now what you do not see, you are found to <lb/>
            see: and you have already admitted, that to see is to know, <lb/>
            and not to see, not to know. Infer then, what conclusion fol­ <lb/>
            lows from this.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I infer the very contrary to what I supposed.</p>
          <p>59. Socr. But perhaps, my admirable youth, many things of <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            this kind would happen to you, if any one should further ask <lb/>
            you whether it is possible to know sharply and dully, and near, <lb/>
            but not at a distance, intensely and slightly as well, and ten <lb/>
            thousand other questions, which a cunning mercenary light- <lb/>
            armed combatant would put to you in discussion, when you <lb/>
            asserted science and perception to be the same, attacking the <lb/>
            hearing, smelling, and such other channels of perception, and <lb/>
            he would confute you, keeping you to it and not letting you off, <lb/>
            until through admiration of his exquisite wisdom you are com­ <lb/>
            pletely caught in his toils, from whence, after he had conquered <lb/>
            and bound you, he would at length set you free on payment of <lb/>
            such a ransom as you and he could agree on. What argument, <lb/>
            should you probably say, would Protagoras adduce in support <lb/>
            of his own opinions ? Shall we endeavour to say ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By all means.</p>
          <p>60. Socr. He will, then, both say all that we have said in <lb/>
            his defence, and besides, I think, he will come to the encounter, <lb/>
            despising us and saying; " This fine fellow Socrates, because <lb/>
            a boy, when asked by him, whether it were possible for the <lb/>
            same person to remember the same thing, and at the same time <lb/>
            not to know it, was frightened, and being frightened, answered <lb/>
            in the negative, through being unable to look on to results, has <lb/>
            made me appear ridiculous by his arguments. But, most <lb/>
            stupid Socrates, the case is thus, when you examine any of my <lb/>
            opinions by questioning, if he to whom the questions are put <lb/>
            gives the same answers that I should give and is proved wrong, <lb/>
            I am confuted, but if he gives different answers, then he that <lb/>
            is questioned is confuted. For, to the point, do you think that <lb/>
            any one would grant you, that memory is present to any one, <lb/>
            of the things by which he has been affected, as if memory were <lb/>
            such an affection as he then experienced, though now he ex­ <lb/>
            periences it no longer? Far from it. Do you think, again, <lb/>
            that he would hesitate to allow, that it is possible for the same <lb/>
            person to know and not to know the same thing ? or if he <lb/>
            should be afraid to say this, do you think he would ever grant <lb/>
            that a person who has become changed is the same as he was <lb/>
            before he was changed ? but rather that he is one person, and <lb/>
            not several, and those infinite in number, since change is con­ <lb/>
            stantly going on, for we must beware of catching at one <lb/>
            another's words. 61. But my good sir," he will say, " attack <lb/>
            my system in a more generous spirit, confute what I say, if you <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            can, and shew that we have not perceptions peculiar to each of <lb/>
            us, or that, if they are peculiar, it does not follow that what <lb/>
            appears to any one becomes, or if we must use the word exist­ <lb/>
            ence, exists to him alone to whom it appears. But when you <lb/>
            speak of pigs and cynocephali, you not only act like a pig your­ <lb/>
            self, but you persuade those that hear you to treat my writings <lb/>
            in the same way, herein not doing well. For I affirm that the <lb/>
            truth is, as I have written; for that each of us is the measure <lb/>
            both of things that do and do not exist; though there is an in­ <lb/>
            finite difference between one man and another, in this very cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance, that they are and appear different to one person <lb/>
            from what they are and do to another. And I am far from <lb/>
            denying that there is such a thing as wisdom and a wise man, <lb/>
            but I call that man wise, who, changing the aspect of objects <lb/>
            to any of us, to whom they appear and are evil, causes them to <lb/>
            appear and to be good. 62. But do not, again, follow out my <lb/>
            arguments, attending to the words only, but thus in a still clearer <lb/>
            manner understand what I mean. For call to mind what was <lb/>
            said in a former part of the discussion, that to a sick man what <lb/>
            he eats appears and is bitter, but to a man in health it is <lb/>
            and appears the contrary. But there is no need to make either <lb/>
            of them wiser than the other; for that is not possible ; nor <lb/>
            must we allege that the sick man is ignorant, because he is of <lb/>
            a different opinion, and that he who is in health is wise, be­ <lb/>
            cause he thinks differently; but we must endeavour to make <lb/>
            him change over to the other side ; for the other habit is bet­ <lb/>
            ter. In like manner, in education, we should endeavour to <lb/>
            make a man change from one habit to a better. But the phy­ <lb/>
            sician effects a change by medicines, and the sophist by argu­ <lb/>
            ments. 63. For no one ever makes one who entertains false <lb/>
            opinions, afterwards entertain true ones ; for it is not possible <lb/>
            for a man to have an opinion on things that do not exist, or on <lb/>
            any others than those by which he is affected, and these are <lb/>
            always true. And I think that a man, who from a depraved <lb/>
            habit of soul forms opinions corresponding to it, a good habit <lb/>
            causes to form different opinions of the same character, but <lb/>
            these appearances some people, through ignorance, call true, <lb/>
            but I say that some things are better than others, but not at all <lb/>
            more true. Moreover, my dear Socrates, I am far from calling <lb/>
            the wise, frogs, but as regards bodies, I call them physicians, <lb/>
            and as regards plants, husbandmen. For I say that these last <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            produce in plants, when they are at all diseased, instead of <lb/>
            depraved perceptions, good and wholesome perceptions and <lb/>
            truths, and that wise and good orators cause good instead of <lb/>
            depraved things to appear to be just to states. For what­ <lb/>
            ever things appear just and honourable to each city, these are <lb/>
            so to that city, so long as it thinks them so; but a wise <lb/>
            man, instead of the several depraved things that they have, <lb/>
            makes good things to be and to appear. 64. By the same <lb/>
            reason a sophist, who is thus able to instruct his pupils, is wise, <lb/>
            and deserves large pay from those whom he instructs. And <lb/>
            thus some are wiser than others, and yet no one entertains false <lb/>
            opinions, and you must admit, whether you will or not, that <lb/>
            you are the measure of things; for this principle is maintained <lb/>
            throughout, if then you are able to controvert this from the <lb/>
            beginning, do so, by answering it in a consecutive speech, or if <lb/>
            you had rather by questioning, do it by questioning; for neither <lb/>
            is this to be avoided, but most of all pursued by a man of sense. <lb/>
            However do it thus; don't act unfairly in your questions. For <lb/>
            it is a great inconsistency for one who pretends to be a lover of <lb/>
            virtue, to persevere in doing nothing else but act unfairly in <lb/>
            argument. But it is to act unfairly in a matter of this kind, <lb/>
            when a man does not make a difference between-disputation <lb/>
            and discussion, and in the former jests and leads into error as <lb/>
            far as he can, but in the latter speaks seriously, and sets the <lb/>
            person with whom he is conversing right, pointing out to him <lb/>
            those errors only into which he has been led by himself and his <lb/>
            former conversations. 65. If, then, you act thus, those who con­ <lb/>
            verse with you will have to blame themselves for their own con­ <lb/>
            fusion and perplexity, but not you, and they will follow and love <lb/>
            you, but hate themselves, and fly from themselves to philosophy, <lb/>
            that, becoming different, they may be changed from what they <lb/>
            formerly were : but if you act the contrary to this, as most <lb/>
            men do, the very contrary will befal you, and you will make <lb/>
            those who associate with you, instead of being philosophers, <lb/>
            hate this pursuit, when they are more advanced in life. If, <lb/>
            then, you will be persuaded by me, as I said before, applying <lb/>
            yourself to it not hostilely or pugnaciously, but in a-favourable <lb/>
            spirit, you will truly consider what I have said, in maintaining <lb/>
            that all things are moved, and that whatever appears to every <lb/>
            one, also exists, both to an individual and a city; and from <lb/>
            hence you will further consider, whether science and perception <note type="footnote"> D d </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            are the same or different, and you will not, as just now, depart <lb/>
            from the usual meaning of words and names, which most men <lb/>
            forcing wherever it suits them, occasion one another all kinds <lb/>
            of perplexity." 66. These things, Theodorus, I have advanced <lb/>
            by way of assistance to your friend, according to my ability, <lb/>
            trifling from trifling means; but, if he were alive, he would <lb/>
            defend his own opinions in a more noble manner.</p>
          <p>Theo. You are joking, Socrates: for you have defended the <lb/>
            man very vigorously.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say well, my friend. But tell me: did you ob­ <lb/>
            serve that Protagoras said just now and reproached us, that in <lb/>
            arguing with a boy, we took advantage of the boy's fear to op­ <lb/>
            pose his principles, and giving it the contemptuous name of <lb/>
            cavilling, and vaunting his measure of all things, he exhorted <lb/>
            us to be serious in examining his doctrine ?</p>
          <p>Theo. How should I not have observed it, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? Do you require us to obey him ?</p>
          <p>Theo. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you see, then, that all these, except you, are boys ? <lb/>
            If then we are to obey him, it is requisite that you and It <lb/>
            questioning and answering each other, should be serious in <lb/>
            examining his doctrine, that he may not have this to object to <lb/>
            us that we have discussed this question again jesting with­ <lb/>
            youths.</p>
          <p>67. Theo. But what? Would not Thesetetus follow this <lb/>
            investigation much better than many who have long beards ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But not better than you, Theodorus. Do not, there­ <lb/>
            fore, think that I ought in every way to defend your deceased <lb/>
            friend, but you not at all. But come, my good sir, follow me <lb/>
            a little, just so far as to enable us to see whether it is right that <lb/>
            you should be the measure-of diagrams, or whether all men <lb/>
            equally with you are sufficient for themselves in astronomy, <lb/>
            and the other things in which you have the reputation of <lb/>
            excelling.</p>
          <p>Theo. It is not easy, Socrates, for one who is sitting by you, <lb/>
            to refuse to answer you. But I was just now trifling when <lb/>
            I said that you would permit me not to strip myself, and that <lb/>
            you would not compel me like the Lacedaemonians. But you <lb/>
            appear to me to resemble Scironk rather. For the Lacedae­ <note type="footnote"> k A noted robber between Megara and Corinth, who used to throw all <lb/>
            travellers whom he fell in with into the sea. He was slain by Theseus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            monians bid us either depart or strip ; but you seem to me to <lb/>
            act rather like Antæus1, for you do not let any one go who <lb/>
            approaches you until you have compelled him to strip and <lb/>
            wrestle with you in argument.</p>
          <p>68. Socr. You have found out an admirable comparison for <lb/>
            my disease, Theodorus, though I am stronger than they were; <lb/>
            for an innumerable multitude of Herculeses and Theseuses; <lb/>
            who were powerful in argument, have met with me and beaten <lb/>
            me heartily, but I do not desist any the more, such a strange <lb/>
            passion for this kind of exercise has got possession of me. Do <lb/>
            not you, therefore, refuse to have a fall with me, and to benefit <lb/>
            yourself and me at the same time.</p>
          <p>Theo. I hold out no longer, but lead me wherever you <lb/>
            please : I must needs submit to the destiny that you weave for <lb/>
            me, and be confuted. However I shall not be able to give <lb/>
            myself up to you further than you proposed.</p>
          <p>Socr. So far will be sufficient. And I be- of you observe <lb/>
            this very closely, that we do not, unawares, get into a puerile <lb/>
            mode of talking, and so let any one reproach us again for that.</p>
          <p>, Theo. I will endeavour, as far as I can.</p>
          <p>69. Socr. First of all, then, let us impugn the argument <lb/>
            which we did before, and see whether we correctly or incor­ <lb/>
            rectly find fault with and reprobate the assertion, that every <lb/>
            one is sufficient to himself with respect to wisdom. Now Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras has conceded to us that some men excel others with <lb/>
            respect to better or worse, and those too who are wise: has <lb/>
            he not ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. If he then being present in person had agreed to this, <lb/>
            and we in assisting him had not made this concession in his <lb/>
            behalf, there would be no need to recur to it in order to con­ <lb/>
            firm it; but now, perhaps, some one may consider us incom­ <lb/>
            petent to assent on his behalf, wherefore it will be better to <lb/>
            come to a more clear understanding on this point; for it <lb/>
            makes no small difference whether it is so or otherwise.</p>
          <p>Theo. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Not from others, then, but from his own statements, <lb/>
            we may in very few words get his assent. <note type="footnote"> 1 Antaeus dwelt in a cave in Lybia, and compelled all strangers who <lb/>
            came by to wrestle with him. He met with his match in Hercules, and. <lb/>
            was slain. </note></p><pb n="404"/>
            
          <p>70. Theo. How so ?</p>
          <p>Boer. Thus. Does he not say that what appears to each <lb/>
            person exists to him to whom it appears ?</p>
          <p>Theo. He does say so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now, Protagoras, we speak the opinions of a man, or <lb/>
            rather of all men, and say that there is no one who does not <lb/>
            think himself in some respects wiser than others, and in other <lb/>
            respects others wiser than himself, and in the greatest dangers, <lb/>
            when men are in peril, in wars, or diseases, or storms at sea, <lb/>
            they behave towards those who have power in each several <lb/>
            case as towards gods, looking up to them as their saviours, <lb/>
            though they excel them in nothing else than in knowledge; <lb/>
            and the whole world is almost full of men seeking for masters <lb/>
            and governors of themselves and other animals and works, and <lb/>
            again of men who think themselves competent to teach and <lb/>
            competent to rule. And in all these cases what else shall we <lb/>
            say, than that men themselves think that there is wisdom and <lb/>
            ignorance among themselves ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do they not, then, think that wisdom is true opinion, <lb/>
            and ignorance false opinion ?</p>
          <p>Theo. How should they not ?</p>
          <p>71. Socr. How then, Protagoras, shall we deal with the <lb/>
            assertion ? Whether shall we say that men always form true <lb/>
            opinions, or sometimes true and sometimes false ? For in either <lb/>
            way the result is that they do not always form true opinions, <lb/>
            but both true and false. For consider, Theodorus, whether <lb/>
            any one of the followers of Protagoras, or you yourself, would <lb/>
            contend that no one thinks that there is another who is igno­ <lb/>
            rant, and forms false opinions.</p>
          <p>Theo. That is incredible, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet the assertion, that man is the measure of all <lb/>
            things, of necessity comes to this ?</p>
          <p>Theo. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. When you have determined any thing within your­ <lb/>
            self, and make known your opinion to me on any point, then, <lb/>
            according to his statement, your opinion must be true to you; <lb/>
            but may not the rest become judges of your judgment, or must <lb/>
            we determine that you always form true opinions ? Will not <lb/>
            myriads, who form contrary opinions to yours, continually op­ <lb/>
            pose you, deeming that you judge and think falsely ?</p><pb n="405"/>
            
          <p>Theo. By Jupiter, Socrates, there are myriads, as Homer' <lb/>
            says, who give me a vast deal of trouble.</p>
          <p>72. Socr. What then? Will you allow us to say that you <lb/>
            then form opinions that are true to yourself, but false to innu­ <lb/>
            merable others ?</p>
          <p>Theo. This seems to me necessary, from the assertion.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what with respect to Protagoras himself? If <lb/>
            neither he thought that man is the measure of all things, nor <lb/>
            the multitude, as indeed they do not, does it not necessarily' <lb/>
            follow that this truth which he has described exists to no­ <lb/>
            one ? But if he himself thought so, but the multitude do not <lb/>
            agree with him, you must be aware that, in the first place, by <lb/>
            how many more they are to whom it does not appear so, than <lb/>
            those to whom it does so appear, by so much the more it is <lb/>
            not than it is ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Necessarily so, since, according to each several opi-' <lb/>
            nion, it will be or will not be.</p>
          <p>Socr. In the next place, this is very pleasant; for he, with­ <lb/>
            respect to his own opinion, admits, that the opinion of those <lb/>
            who differ from him, in that they think he is in error, is true, <lb/>
            since he allows that all men form opinions of things that <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>Theo. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Must he not, therefore, admit that his own opinion' is <lb/>
            false, if he allows that the opinion of those who think he is in <lb/>
            error is true ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. The others however do not admit that they are in <lb/>
            error ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Surely not.</p>
          <p>73. Socr. He however, from what he has written, allows <lb/>
            that this opinion also is true.</p>
          <p>Theo. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It will therefore be controverted by all men, Prota­ <lb/>
            goras not excepted, or rather will be allowed by him, that <lb/>
            when he admits to one who differs from him, that he forms a <lb/>
            true opinion, then even Protagoras himself will admit that <lb/>
            neither a dog, nor any man whatever, is the measure of a thing <lb/>
            that he has not learnt. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theo. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, since this is controverted by all men, Pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            tagoras's truth will not be true to any one, neither to any one <lb/>
            else, nor to himself.</p>
          <p>Theo. We run down my friend too severely, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, moreover, my friend, it is uncertain whether we <lb/>
            have not also exceeded the bounds of propriety. For it is <lb/>
            probable that he being older is wiser than we are : and if he <lb/>
            should suddenly rise up as far as his neck, having reproved me <lb/>
            much for trifling, as is probable, and you for assenting, he <lb/>
            would sink down again and hurry away. 74. But it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary for us, I think, to make use of our own abilities such as <lb/>
            they are, and to say whatever appears to us to be true. Well <lb/>
            then, shall we now say that any one will grant this, that one <lb/>
            man is wiser than another, and another also more ignorant ?</p>
          <p>Theo. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Soer. Shall we say too that our argument holds good as we <lb/>
            have laid it down in our endeavours to assist Protagoras, that <lb/>
            most things are as they appear to every one, warm, dry, sweet, <lb/>
            and all other things of this kind; but that if in some things he <lb/>
            shall admit that one man excels another, he would say with <lb/>
            regard to things wholesome and unwholesome, that not every <lb/>
            silly woman, -boy and brute, is. competent to cure itself by <lb/>
            knowing what is wholesome for itself, but that here, if any <lb/>
            where, one excels another ?</p>
          <p>• Theo. So it appears to me.</p>
          <p>75. Socr. And with respect to political matters, he will <lb/>
            admit that things honourable and base, just and unjust, holy <lb/>
            and unholy, as each city thinks right to enact laws for itself, <lb/>
            are in truth such to each city, and yet that in these things one <lb/>
            individual is not at all wiser than another, nor one city than <lb/>
            another; but in enacting what is expedient, for itself or not ex­ <lb/>
            pedient, here again, if any where, he will allow that one coun­ <lb/>
            sellor excels another, and the opinion of one city that of an­ <lb/>
            other with regard to truth; nor will he by any means venture <lb/>
            to affirm, that the laws which a city enacts, thinking them to <lb/>
            be expedient for itself, must certainly be so. But here in the <lb/>
            matter I am speaking about, with respect to what is just and <lb/>
            unjust, holy and unholy, men will persist that none of these <lb/>
            have by nature an essence of their own, but that what appears <lb/>
            to the community to be true, that becomes true at the time <lb/>
            when it so appears, and so long as it appears. And those who <lb/>
            do not altogether, hold the doctrine of Protagoras, deal with <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            philosophy in some such manner as this. But one topic of <lb/>
            conversation, Theodorus, springs from another, a greater from <lb/>
            a less.</p>
          <p>76. Theo. Have we not leisure, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Boer. We appear to have. And I have often at other times <lb/>
            observed, my excellent friend, and especially now, with what <lb/>
            good reason those who have spent much time in philosophical <lb/>
            studies, are found to be ridiculous orators when they enter <lb/>
            courts of justice.</p>
          <p>Theo. What mean you by this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. They that have been from their youth in courts of <lb/>
            justice, and places of that kind, when compared with those <lb/>
            who have been nurtured in philosophy and such-like studies, <lb/>
            appear to have been educated like slaves compared with free- <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>Theo. In what respect ?</p>
          <p>Socr. In this, that these, as you said, have always leisure, <lb/>
            and converse in peace at their leisure, just as we now <lb/>
            are taking up our third topic in succession, so they too, if <lb/>
            any question occurs to them that pleases them better than <lb/>
            the one in hand, as is the case with us, are not at all con­ <lb/>
            cerned whether they speak at length or briefly, if they can <lb/>
            but arrive at the truth. But the others always speak in a <lb/>
            hurry, for the running water presses them on, nor are they <lb/>
            allowed to speak on whatever subject they wish, but their <lb/>
            opponent stands by them with this instrument of compulsion m, <lb/>
            and the record (which they call the pleadings) read aloud, out <lb/>
            of which they must not travel; and their speeches are always <lb/>
            about a fellow slave before the master who is seated holding <lb/>
            the scales of justice in his hand, their contests too, are never <lb/>
            unrestrained, but are always to the point before them, and <lb/>
            oftentimes it is a race for life. 77. So that, from all these <lb/>
            causes they become vehement and keen, knowing how to <lb/>
            flatter the master by words, and to conciliate him by actions, <lb/>
            being mean and not upright in soul. For slavery from child­ <lb/>

            compelling them to do crooked actions, by exposing their yet <lb/>
            tender souls to great dangers and fears, which not being able <lb/>
            to bear up against with justice and truth, they immediately <lb/>
            have recourse to lying and injuring one another, and become <lb/>
            so bent and distorted, that they pass from youth to manhood <lb/>
            without having any solidity in their minds, but have become <lb/>
            clever and wise, as they think. Such then are these, Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus. But are you willing that I should describe the men <lb/>
            of our band, or that, passing them by, we should return again <lb/>
            to our subject, lest we abuse too much our liberty and powers <lb/>
            of digression, which we just now spoke of.</p>
          <p>78. Theo. By no means, Socrates, but describe them. For <lb/>
            you observed very well, that we who are members of this band, <lb/>
            are not the servants of topics of discussion, but they are our <lb/>
            servants as it were, and each of them must wait for its com­ <lb/>
            pletion until we think proper. For neither does a judge nor a <lb/>
            spectator preside over us, to rebuke and keep us in order, as is <lb/>
            the case with the poets.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us speak then, as we ought, since it is agreeable <lb/>
            to you, about the chiefs; for why should any one speak of <lb/>
            those who spend their time in philosophy to but little pur­ <lb/>
            pose ? These then from early youth do not know the way to <lb/>
            the forum, nor where the law-court, or senate house, or any <lb/>
            other public place of assemblage in the city is situated; and they <lb/>
            neither see nor hear laws or decrees, proclaimed or written. <lb/>
            And canvassing of partisans for magistracies, and meetings, <lb/>
            and banquets, and revelry with flute-players, they never think <lb/>
            of even in a dream. Whether any one in a city is well or ill <lb/>
            born, or what evil has befallen any one from his ancestors, <lb/>
            whether men or women, is as little known to him as how <lb/>
            many measures of water there are in the sea, as the saying is.</p>
          <p>79. And he does not know that he is ignorant of all this ; for <lb/>
            he does not keep aloof from them for vanity's sake, but in <lb/>
            reality his body only is situated and dwells in the city, but <lb/>
            his mind, considering all these things as trifling and of no con­ <lb/>
            sequence, holds them in contempt, and is borne every where, <lb/>
            according to the expression of Pindar, measuring things be­ <lb/>
            neath the earth and upon its surface, contemplating the stars <lb/>
            in heaven above, and searching thoroughly into the entire <lb/>
            nature of every thing in the universe, and not stooping to <lb/>
            any thing that is near.</p><pb n="409"/>
            
          <p>Theo. What mean you by this, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Just, Theodorus, as a smart and witty Thracian <lb/>
            servant-girl is related to have joked Thales, when, contem­ <lb/>
            plating the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a well, that <lb/>
            he was anxious to know what was going on in heaven,, but <lb/>
            forgot to notice what was before him, and at his feet. 80. <lb/>
            The same joke is applicable to all who devote themselves to <lb/>
            philosophy; for, in reality, such a one is ignorant about his <lb/>
            near neighbour, not only what he is doing but almost whether <lb/>
            he is a man or some other animal. But what man is, and <lb/>
            what such a nature ought to do or suffer beyond others, he <lb/>
            enquires and takes pains to investigate. You understand me <lb/>
            surely, Theodorus ; do you not ?</p>
          <p>Theo. I do: and you say truly.</p>
          <p>Boer. Therefore, my friend, a man of this kind dealing pri­ <lb/>
            vately with each person, or publicly, as I said at the outset, when <lb/>
            he is compelled, in a court of justice or any where else, to speak <lb/>
            about things at his feet and before his view, affords laughter not <lb/>
            only to Thracian damsels, but to the rest of the crowd, by fall­ <lb/>
            ing into wells and all kinds of perplexities through inexperience; <lb/>
            and his strange awkwardness gives him a character of stupidity; <lb/>
            81. For when he is reviled he has nothing personal to retort <lb/>
            against any one, as he does not know any evil of any one from <lb/>
            not having troubled himself about such matters; therefore, not <lb/>
            having any thing to say, he appears to be ridiculous: and <lb/>
            when he hears others praise and boast of themselves, being <lb/>
            seen to laugh not feignedly but really he is considered to be a <lb/>
            simpleton. For when encomiums are passed on a tyrant or <lb/>
            king, he thinks that he hears a herdsman, a swineherd for <lb/>
            instance, or a shepherd, or a cowkeeper pronounced happy for <lb/>
            milking abundantly : but he thinks that they feed and milk an <lb/>
            animal that is more hard to manage and more cunning than the <lb/>
            others do; and that such a one must necessarily, from their <lb/>
            occupations, be not at all less rustic and uneducated than <lb/>
            herdsmen, being shut up within walls as in a mountain pen. <lb/>
            But when he hears that any one who possesses ten thousand <lb/>
            acres of land or even more, is possessed of vast property, it, <lb/>
            appears to him very trifling, as he has been accustomed to <lb/>
            survey the whole earth. 82. And when they extol nobility of <lb/>
            birth, accounting any one noble from being able to shew <lb/>
            seven rich ancestors, he thinks that this praise proceeds from <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            men of dull minds, and who look at trifles, being unable <lb/>
            through want of education to look at the succession of ages and <lb/>
            compute that every man has had innumerable myriads of <lb/>
            grandsires and ancestors, amongst whom there must have been <lb/>
            an innumerable multitude of rich and poor, kings and slaves, <lb/>
            barbarians and Greeks; but when they pride themselves in a <lb/>
            catalogue of five-and-twenty ancestors, and refer their origin to <lb/>
            Hercules son of Amphitryon, it appears to him absurd from its <lb/>
            littleness; and he laughs at their being unable to compute <lb/>
            and so rid themselves of the vaunting of a silly mind, that the <lb/>
            five-and-twentieth ancestor from Amphitryon and the fiftieth <lb/>
            from him was such as fortune happened to make him. In all <lb/>
            these things, therefore, such a man is ridiculed by the multi­ <lb/>
            tude, partly from bearing himself haughtily, as it seems, and <lb/>
            partly from not knowing what is at his feet, and being on all <lb/>
            occasions embarrassed.</p>
          <p>Theo. You say exactly what takes place, Socrates.</p>
          <p>83. Soer. But when he is able, my friend, to draw any one <lb/>
            upwards, and any one is willing to leave those questions, of <lb/>
            “What injury do I do you?" or "What injury do you do <lb/>
            me?" for the consideration of justice and injustice themselves, <lb/>
            what each of them is, and in what respect they differ from all <lb/>
            other things, or from each other, or the inquiry, Whether a <lb/>
            king is happy, and again, he who possesses abundance of gold, <lb/>
            for the consideration of royalty and human happiness and <lb/>
            misery in general; what they both are, and in what way it is <lb/>
            proper for the nature of man to seek the one and shun the <lb/>
            other,-when, therefore, it is requisite for that little-minded, <lb/>
            sharp, and pettifogging fellow to give an account of all these <lb/>
            things, he then shews the opposite side of the picture; becoming <lb/>
            dizzy through being suspended aloft and looking so high up, <lb/>
            from want of use, and becoming stupified, and perplexed, and <lb/>
            stammering, he does not, indeed, afford laughter to the Thra­ <lb/>
            cian damsels or any other uneducated person, (for they do not <lb/>
            perceive any thing,) but to all who have been brought up <lb/>
            otherwise than as slaves. 84. This, then, is the character of each <lb/>
            of them, Theodorus, the one, that of him who is truly brought <lb/>
            up in liberty and leisure, whom you call a philosopher, to whom <lb/>
            it is no disgrace to be thought simple and to be good for <lb/>
            nothing, when he has to attend to servile offices, for instance, <lb/>
            that he does not know how to pack and tie up luggage, or <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            season viands or make flattering speeches; the other, that of <lb/>
            him who is able to perform all such offices dexterously and <lb/>
            quickly, but knows not how to gather up his cloak with his <lb/>
            right hand like a well-bred person, nor perceiving harmony of <lb/>
            language to celebrate the life of gods and happy men such as <lb/>
            it really is.</p>
          <p>Theo. If, Socrates, you could persuade all men of what you <lb/>
            say, as you have me, there would be more peace and less evil <lb/>
            among men.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is not possible, Theodorus, that evil should be <lb/>
            destroyed; for it is necessary that there should be always <lb/>
            something contrary to good; nor can it be seated among the <lb/>
            gods, but of necessity moves round this mortal nature and this <lb/>
            region. Wherefore we ought to endeavour to fly hence thither <lb/>
            as quickly as possible. But this flight consists in resembling <lb/>
            God as much as possible, and this resemblance is the becoming <lb/>
            just and holy with wisdom. 85. But, my excellent friend, it <lb/>
            is not very easy to. persuade men, that not for the reasons for <lb/>
            which most men say we ought to flee from vice and pursue <lb/>
            virtue, ought we to study the one and not the other, namely, <lb/>
            that a man may not seem to be vicious, but may seem to be <lb/>
            good; for these are, as the saying is, the drivellings of old <lb/>
            women, as it appears to me. But let us describe the truth as <lb/>
            follows. God is never in any respect unjust, but as just as <lb/>
            possible, and there is not any thing that resembles him more <lb/>
            than the man amongst us who has likewise become as just as <lb/>
            possible. And on this depends the true excellence of a man; <lb/>
            and his nothingness and worthlessness. For the knowledge of <lb/>
            this is wisdom and true virtue, but the not knowing it is mani. <lb/>
            fest ignorance and vice, but all other seeming excellencies and <lb/>
            wisdoms, when they are found in political government, are ab­ <lb/>
            ject, but in arts sordid. It is therefore by far the best not to <lb/>
            allow him who acts unjustly, and who speaks or acts impi­ <lb/>
            ously, to excel by reason of his wickedness; for they delight <lb/>
            in this reproach, and think they hear that they are not value­ <lb/>
            less, mere burdens on the earth, but men such as they ought <lb/>
            to be who will be safe in a city. The truth, therefore, must be <lb/>
            spoken, that they are so much the more what they think they <lb/>
            are not, from not thinking that they are such. For they are <lb/>
            ignorant of the punishment of injustice, of which they ought <lb/>
            to be least of all ignorant: for it does not consist in what they <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            imagine, stripes and death, which they sometimes suffer who do <lb/>
            not commit injustice, but in that which it is impossible to avoid.</p>
          <p>86. Theo. What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Since, my friend, there are two models in the nature <lb/>
            of things, one divine and most happy, the other ungodly and <lb/>
            most miserable, they, not perceiving that this is the case, <lb/>
            through stupidity and extreme folly, unknown to themselves <lb/>
            become similar to the one by unjust actions, and dissimilar to <lb/>
            the other. Wherefore they are punished, by leading a life <lb/>
            suited to that to which they are assimilated. But if we should <lb/>
            tell them, that unless they abandon this excellence, that place <lb/>
            which is free from all evil will not receive them when dead, <lb/>
            but here they will always lead a life resembling themselves, <lb/>
            and there will associate with evil, these things, as being alto­ <lb/>
            gether shrewd and crafty, they will listen to as the extrava­ <lb/>
            gances of foolish men.</p>
          <p>87. Theo. Assuredly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soer. I know it, my friend. One thing, however, happens <lb/>
            to them; it is, that if they have to give and listen to reasons <lb/>
            privately respecting the things that they blame, and if they are <lb/>
            willing to persevere manfully for a length of time, and not fly <lb/>
            like cowards,. then at length, my excellent friend, they are <lb/>
            very absurdly displeased with themselves for what they have <lb/>
            said, and that rhetoric of theirs becomes somehow so weak <lb/>
            that they appear to be no better than boys. However, let us <lb/>
            quit this subject, since what we have been saying was only a <lb/>
            digression; if we do not, more topics constantly flowing in <lb/>
            will shut out the subject with which we began. Let us, then, <lb/>
            return to our former subject, if it is agreeable to you.</p>
          <p>Theo. Such things, Socrates, are not at all unpleasing to me <lb/>
            to hear; for it is easier for one of my age to follow them; if <lb/>
            you please, however, let us return to our subject.</p>
          <p>Soer. If I mistake not, then, we were at that part of our <lb/>
            discussion in which we said that those who maintain motion <lb/>
            to be essence, and that whatever appears to each person exists <lb/>
            also to him to whom it appears, would in other things persist, <lb/>
            and especially with regard to justice, that on every account <lb/>
            what a city enacts as appearing just to itself, this also is just <lb/>
            to the city that enacts it, so long as it continues in force : but <lb/>
            that with respect to what is good, no one is so hardy as to <lb/>
            venture to contend that whatever things a city has enacted, <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            thinking that they are advantageous to itself, are also advan­ <lb/>
            tageous so long as they continue in force, except one should <lb/>
            speak only of the name: but this would be a mere mockery <lb/>
            on such a subject as we are speaking on; would it not ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Certainly.</p>
          <p>88. Socr. Let him not, then, speak of the name, but of the <lb/>
            thing designated by it.</p>
          <p>Theo. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But the thing that the name designates is doubtless <lb/>
            that which the city aims at in enacting laws, and enacts all <lb/>
            laws, as far as it thinks and is able, to be as advantageous <lb/>
            to itself as possible. Does it look to any thing else in enact­ <lb/>
            ing laws ?</p>
          <p>Theo. By no means.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does it, then, always accomplish its purpose, or is <lb/>
            every city often mistaken ?</p>
          <p>Theo. I think it is often mistaken.</p>
          <p>Socr. Still more then would every one allow this very thing, <lb/>
            if the question should be asked with reference to the whole <lb/>
            genus, to which the advantageous belongs: but surely it re­ <lb/>
            gards also the future; for, when we enact laws, we enact them <lb/>
            that they may be advantageous for the time to come; and this <lb/>
            we should correctly call the future.</p>
          <p>Theo. Certainly.</p>
          <p>89. Socr. Come then, let us thus question Protagoras, or some <lb/>
            one else who holds the same opinions with him, Man, as you <lb/>
            say, Protagoras, is the measure of all things, white, heavy, <lb/>
            light, and every thing of that kind: for, as he contains the <lb/>
            criterion of them within himself, in thinking they are such as <lb/>
            he feels them to be, he thinks what is true to himself, and <lb/>
            really is ? Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theo. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we also say, Protagoras, that he contains within <lb/>
            himself the criterion of things about to happen, and that such <lb/>
            things as he thinks will happen, do become such to him who <lb/>
            thinks so? For instance, with regard to heat, when any parti­ <lb/>
            cular person thinks that he shall catch a fever, and that this <lb/>
            kind of heat will happen to him, and another, a physician, thinks <lb/>
            differently, according to the opinion of which of the two shall <lb/>
            we say will the result prove? or will it be according to the <lb/>
            opinion of both of them, and to the physician will he be neither <lb/>
            hot nor feverish, but to himself both ? ’</p><pb n="414"/>
            
          <p>» Theo. That, indeed, would be ridiculous.</p>
          <p>Socr. And I think the opinion of the husbandman, and not <lb/>
            that of the harper, respecting the future sweetness or rough. <lb/>
            ness of wine, would prevail. &gt;</p>
          <p>Theo. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Nor again would a teacher of gymnastics form a <lb/>
            better opinion than a musician respecting what will be in­ <lb/>
            harmonious and harmonious, and what will afterwards appear <lb/>
            to the teacher of gymnastics himself to be harmonious.</p>
          <p>Theo. By no means.</p>
          <p>90. Socr. Therefore also, when a banquet is prepared, the <lb/>
            judgment of one who, not being skilled in cookery is about to <lb/>
            feast on it, is less sound than that of the cook, respecting the <lb/>
            pleasure that will ensue. For we are not arguing at all about <lb/>
            that which now is or has been pleasant to each person, but <lb/>
            about that which will hereafter both appear and be so, whe­ <lb/>
            ther every one is the best judge for himself? Could not you, <lb/>
            Protagoras, judge beforehand better than any private person <lb/>
            what arguments are likely to be available for us in a court <lb/>
            -of justice ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Indeed, Socrates, in this he himself professes to excel <lb/>
            all men by far.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Jupiter, he does, my friend; otherwise no one <lb/>
            would pay him large sums for his instructions, if he had not</p>
          <p>.persuaded his pupils that no prophet or other person would be <lb/>
            able to judge better than he could for himself, as to what in <lb/>
            future would both be and appear to be.</p>
          <p>Theo. Most true.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do not legislation and the useful regard the future, <lb/>
            and would not every one acknowledge, that a city, in enacting <lb/>
            laws, of necessity often misses that which is most useful ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>91. Socr. We have, therefore, rightly urged against your <lb/>
            master, that he must needs confess, that one man is wiser <lb/>
            than another, and that such a one is the true measure, but <lb/>
            that there is no necessity at all for me who am ignorant, to <lb/>
            become a measure, as the argument advanced on his behalf <lb/>
            just now compelled me to be, whether I would or not.</p>
          <p>Theo. In that way, Socrates, his argument appears to me <lb/>
            to be effectually refuted, and it was also refuted by this, that he <lb/>
            makes the opinions of others sound; and these were found to <lb/>
            consider his arguments as by no means to be true.</p><pb n="415"/>
            
          <p>Socr. In many other ways, too, Theodorus; this may be de­ <lb/>
            monstrated, that not every opinion of every man is true. But, <lb/>
            with respect to the manner in which each person is affected, <lb/>
            whence perceptions and corresponding opinions are produced, <lb/>
            it is more difficult to demonstrate that they are not true. But <lb/>
            perhaps I should say, it is quite impossible : for probably they <lb/>
            cannot be refuted, and those who say that they are certain and <lb/>
            sciences, may possibly say the truth, and in that case Thesetetus <lb/>
            here did not speak amiss in asserting that perception and <lb/>
            science are the same. 92. Let us, then, approach nearer to it, <lb/>
            as the argument advanced in behalf of Protagoras enjoined us, <lb/>
            and examine this essence, that is said to consist in motion n, by <lb/>
            knocking it, and see whether it sounds whole or cracked. For <lb/>
            the contest about it is neither mean nor among a few.</p>
          <p>Theo. It is very far from being mean, but is spreading very <lb/>
            much throughout Ionia. For the partisans of Heraclitus advo. <lb/>
            cate this doctrine very strenuously.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore, my dear Theodorus, we should the rather <lb/>
            examine it from the beginning, as they propound it.</p>
          <p>Theo. Assuredly. For, Socrates, with respect to these</p>
          <p>.Heraclitian, or, as you say, Homeric, and even older doctrines, <lb/>
            it is no more possible to converse about them with the people of <lb/>
            Ephesus who pretend to be acquainted with them, than with <lb/>
            persons who are raving mad. For, just as their written doc­ <lb/>
            trines, they are truly in constant motion, but to keep to an <lb/>
            argument and a question, and quietly to answer and ask in turn, <lb/>
            is less in their power than any thing; or rather the power of <lb/>
            rest in these men is infinitely less than nothing. But if you <lb/>
            ask any one of them a question, they draw out, as from a quiver, <lb/>
            certain dark enigmatical words, and shoot them off, and if you <lb/>
            wish to get from him a reason for what he has said, you will <lb/>
            be forthwith stricken with another newly coined word, but will <lb/>
            never come to any conclusion with any one of them; nor do <lb/>
            they with one another, but they take very good care not to <lb/>
            allow any thing to be fixed, either in their discourse, or in their <lb/>
            souls, thinking, as it appears to me, that this very thing is <lb/>
            stationary°; and they make constant war upon it, and as far as <lb/>
            they are able, expel it from every where.</p>
          <p>93. Socr. Perhaps, Theodorus, you have seen these men <note type="footnote"> ° See § 87. </note><note type="footnote"> 0 And so opposed to their doctrine of constant motion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            contending, but have never been in their company when peace­ <lb/>
            able, for they are no friends of yours. But I think they say <lb/>
            such things when at leisure, to their disciples, whom they wish <lb/>
            to render like themselves.</p>
          <p>Theo. What disciples, my good friend? Amongst such <lb/>
            men, one is not the disciple of another, but they spring up <lb/>
            spontaneously, from whatever place each of them happens to <lb/>
            be seized with a frenzy, and each thinks that the other knows <lb/>
            nothing. From these, therefore, as I was just now saying, <lb/>
            you will never get a reason either willingly or unwillingly: <lb/>
            but we must take the matter up as if it were a problem and <lb/>
            examine it ourselves.</p>
          <p>Socr. You say right. But have we not received this problem <lb/>
            from the ancients, who by the aid of poetry concealed it from <lb/>
            the multitude, that Ocean and Tethys, the origin of all things, <lb/>
            are streams, and that nothing is at rest, and from the moderns, <lb/>
            as being wise, who have declared openly, so that even cobblers <lb/>
            on hearing them learn wisdom, and give up their foolish opi­ <lb/>
            nion, that some things are at rest and others in motion, and <lb/>
            learning that all things are in motion, they pay great respect <lb/>
            to their teachers. 94. But I had almost forgotten, Theodorus, <lb/>
            that others have declared the very contrary to this, that " that <lb/>
            which is called the universe is immoveable," and every thing <lb/>
            else that the followers of Melissus and Parmenides maintain in <lb/>
            opposition to all this, as, that all things are one, and that this <lb/>
            is at rest in itself, and has no place in which it can be moved. <lb/>
            What then shall we do with all these people, my friend ? For <lb/>
            advancing by little and little, we have unawares fallen between <lb/>
            both of them, and if we do not defend ourselves and escape, we <lb/>
            shall be punished like those who in the wrestling grounds play <lb/>
            on the line, who, when they are caught by both parties, are <lb/>
            dragged in contrary directions. It appears therefore to me, <lb/>
            that we should first of all consider those with whom we set out, <lb/>
            the advocates of perpetual motion, and, if they shall prove to <lb/>
            speak to the purpose, we will join with them, and endeavour to <lb/>
            escape from the others; but if those who say that the universe <lb/>
            is at rest appear to speak more truly, we will on the other <lb/>
            hand fly to them from those who move even things immoveable. <lb/>
            95. And if both shall be found to speak nothing right, we shall <lb/>
            be ridiculous for thinking that we, mean as we are, can say any <lb/>
            thing to the purpose, after we have condemned men of great <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            antiquity and wisdom. Consider therefore, Theodorus, whether <lb/>
            it is for our interest to venture on so great a danger.</p>
          <p>Theo. It would be unpardonable, Socrates, not thoroughly <lb/>
            to examine what each of these men say.</p>
          <p>Socr. We must examine it, since you are so anxious to do <lb/>
            so. It appears to me then, that the first thing to be done in <lb/>
            an enquiry about motion, is to find out what they mean by <lb/>
            saying that all things are in motion. I mean this : whether <lb/>
            they say that there is one species of motion, or, as it appears <lb/>
            to me, two. Nor should it appear to me only, but do you <lb/>
            also join with me, that we may both fall into the same error, <lb/>
            if we must err. Tell me, therefore, do you call it being in <lb/>
            motion, when a thing passes from one place to another, or is <lb/>
            turned round in the same place ?</p>
          <p>Theo. I do.</p>
          <p>96. Socr. Let this, therefore, be one species. But when it <lb/>
            remains in the same place, and grows old, and either becomes <lb/>
            black from white or hard from soft, or undergoes any other <lb/>
            change, is it not right to say that this is another species of <lb/>
            motion ?</p>
          <p>Theo. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Socr. It must be so : I say, then, that there are these two <lb/>
            species of motion, change and removal.</p>
          <p>' Theo. You say right.</p>
          <p>Socr. Having, therefore, made this distinction, let us now <lb/>
            address ourselves to those who say that all things are in motion, <lb/>
            and ask them: Whether do you say that every thing under­ <lb/>
            goes both kinds of motion, and is both removed and changed, <lb/>
            or that one thing is moved both ways, and another only in <lb/>
            one way ?</p>
          <p>Theo. By Jupiter, I know not what to answer; but I think <lb/>
            they would say, both ways.</p>
          <p>Socr. Otherwise, my friend, the same things would appear to <lb/>
            them to be both in motion and at rest, and it would not be at <lb/>
            all more correct to say that all things are in motion, than that <lb/>
            they are at rest.</p>
          <p>Theo. You speak most truly.</p>
          <p>Boer. Since, therefore, it is necessary that every thing <lb/>
            should be in motion, and that the absence of motion should be <lb/>
            in nothing, all things must always be moved with every kind <lb/>
            of motion. <note type="footnote"> E e </note></p><pb n="418"/>
            
          <p>97. Theo. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Consider this, then, I beg : did we not say that they <lb/>
            '.explain the generation of heat, or whiteness, or any thing else <lb/>
            pretty much in this manner, that each of them is impelled, <lb/>
            together with perception, between the agent and the patient, <lb/>
            and that the patient becomes affected by perception, but is not <lb/>
            yet perception itself, and that the agent becomes affected by a <lb/>
            certain quality, but is not quality itself? Perhaps, however, <lb/>
            quality may appear to you to be a strange word, and you may <lb/>
            not understand it when used in this collective sense. Hear <lb/>
            me, then, explain it in detail. For the agent becomes neither <lb/>
            heat nor whiteness, but hot and white, and so with respect to <lb/>
            other things. For you surely remember that we said before P, <lb/>
            that no one thing exists of itself, neither that which is an agent <lb/>
            nor that which is a patient, but that, from the meeting together <lb/>
            of each with the other, perceptions and objects of perception <lb/>
            being produced cause the one to be of a certain quality, and <lb/>
            the other percipient.</p>
          <p>98. Theo. I recollect. How should I not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us then dismiss the rest of their system, whether <lb/>
            they speak this way or that way; and let us keep to that <lb/>
            point alone which concerns our discussion and ask, Are all <lb/>
            things in motion and in a state of flux, as you say ? Is it <lb/>
            not so?</p>
          <p>Theo. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And by both those kinds of motion which we have <lb/>
            distinguished, removal and change ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Undoubtedly; if they are to be perfectly moved.</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, they were only removed, but not changed, <lb/>
            we should surely be able to say what kind of things are re­ <lb/>
            moved. Must we not say so ?</p>
          <p>Theo. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But since not even this continues in the same state, <lb/>
            namely that that which flows continues to flow white, but it <lb/>
            changes so that there is also a flux of this very thing, white­ <lb/>
            ness, and a transition into another colour, in order that it may <lb/>
            not be found continuing in the same state, will it ever be pos­ <lb/>
            sible to call any thing a colour, so as to designate it correctly ?</p>
          <p>Theo. How is it possible, Socrates ? or any thing else of the <lb/>
            kind, since, while we are speaking about it, it is constantly <lb/>
            escaping, as being in a state of flux ? <note type="footnote"> " § 28. </note></p><pb n="419"/>
            
          <p>Soer. But what shall we say of any kind of perception, for <lb/>
            instance of seeing or hearing ? Does it ever continue in the <lb/>
            state of seeing or hearing ?</p>
          <p>Theo. It ought not, since all things are in motion.</p>
          <p>99. Soer. We must not affirm then, that any one sees rather <lb/>
            than not sees, or has any other perception rather than not, since <lb/>
            all things are in constant motion.</p>
          <p>Theo. Surely not.</p>
          <p>Soer. Yet perception is science, as Thesetetus and I said.</p>
          <p>Theo. That is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. On being asked, therefore, what science is, we an­ <lb/>
            swered, that it is not at all science rather than not science.</p>
          <p>Theo. You appear to have done so.</p>
          <p>Socr. A fine correction of our answer it would be, if we <lb/>
            endeavour to prove that all things are in motion, in order that <lb/>
            our former answer may appear correct. But this, as it seems, <lb/>
            is the result, if all things are in motion, every answer on what­ <lb/>
            ever subject it may be given, will be equally correct, whether <lb/>
            we say that a thing is so or is not so, or, if you will, becomes <lb/>
            so, that we may not fix them by a definite expression.</p>
          <p>Theo. You say rightly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Except, Theodorus, that I said " so and not so." But we <lb/>
            ought not to use this word " so," for in this way it will no longer <lb/>
            be in motion ; nor again must we use the expression " not so," <lb/>
            for neither does this express motion; but they who maintain <lb/>
            this doctrine must find out some other term, since at present <lb/>
            they have not words suited to their hypothesis, except perhaps, <lb/>
            this, " not in any manner." This would suit them best, as <lb/>
            having an indefinite meaning.</p>
          <p>Theo. This manner of speaking would indeed be most proper <lb/>
            for them.</p>
          <p>100. Socr. We have done then with your friend, Theodorus, <lb/>
            nor can we by any means concede to him, that any man is the <lb/>
            measure of all things, except he is wise: nor can we concede <lb/>
            to him that science is perception, at least according to the <lb/>
            doctrine that all things are in motion; unless Thesetetus here <lb/>
            says otherwise.</p>
          <p>Theo. You say admirably well, Socrates; for since these <lb/>
            things are brought to a conclusion, it is right that I too should <lb/>
            have done with answering according to our agreement, now that <lb/>
            our discussion about the doctrine of Protagoras has come to end.</p><pb n="420"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. Not so, Theodorus, until you and Socrates have dis­ <lb/>
            cussed the doctrine of those who say that the universe is at <lb/>
            rest, as you just now proposed to do.</p>
          <p>Theo. Do you who are so young, Thesetetus, teach old men <lb/>
            to act unjustly, by violating their compacts. But prepare to <lb/>
            give account to Socrates of what remains to be discussed.</p>
          <p>Theæ. If he wishes it, though I should be very glad to hear <lb/>
            you on the subject I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Theo. You are challenging riders to a race in challenging <lb/>
            Socrates to a discussion. Ask therefore and you will hear.</p>
          <p>Socr. But I think, Theodorus, I shall not comply with the <lb/>
            request of Thesetetus.</p>
          <p>Theo. Why not comply ?</p>
          <p>101. Socr. Though I am ashamed of examining with too <lb/>
            much freedom Melissus and others, who say that the universe is <lb/>
            one and immoveable, yet I am less ashamed to do so with respect <lb/>
            to them than Parmenides alone. For Parmenides appears to <lb/>
            me, that I may use the words of Homer q, " both venerable and <lb/>
            formidable." For I was acquainted with him when I was very <lb/>
            young and he was very old, and he appeared to me to possess <lb/>
            a depth of wisdom altogether extraordinary. I am afraid, <lb/>
            therefore, that we should not understand his words, and that <lb/>
            we should be much less able to discover the meaning of what <lb/>
            he said, and above all, I fear lest with respect to the main subject <lb/>
            of our discussion, science, what it is, should be left uncon­ <lb/>
            sidered by reason of the digressions that will rush across us, if <lb/>
            we listen to them. Besides, the question which we have now <lb/>
            raised is of immense extent, and if one should consider it only <lb/>
            by the way, it would be treated unworthily, but if as it deserves, <lb/>
            the discussion, being extended to too great length, will put out <lb/>
            of sight the subject of science. But neither of these things <lb/>
            ought to happen; but we ought to endeavour, by the mid­ <lb/>
            wife's art, to deliver Thesetetus of his conceptions respecting <lb/>
            science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is proper to do so, if you think well.</p>
          <p>102. Socr. Again, therefore, Thesetetus, consider this with <lb/>
            respect to what has been said. You answered that perception <lb/>
            is science; did you not.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes. <note type="footnote"> q Iliad, iii. 172. </note></p><pb n="421"/>
            
          <p>Soer. If then any one should ask you, with what a man sees <lb/>
            things white and black, and with what he hears sounds sharp <lb/>
            and flat, you would say, I think, with the eyes and ears.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I should.</p>
          <p>Socr. The free use of names and words and without exces­ <lb/>
            sive precision, is for the most part not unbecoming a person of <lb/>
            education, but rather the contrary to this is illiberal, though <lb/>
            sometimes it is necessary; as in the present case it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to find fault with your answer, so far as it is not correct. <lb/>
            For consider, which answer is more correct, that it is the eyes <lb/>
            with which we see or by which we see, and the ears with which <lb/>
            we hear, or by which we hear ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By which we receive each perception, it seems to me, <lb/>
            Socrates, rather than with which.</p>
          <p>Socr. For surely it would be strange, my boy, if many senses <lb/>
            were seated in us, as in wooden horses, and they did not all <lb/>
            tend to one certain form, whether it is soul, or whatever it is <lb/>
            proper to call it, with which, by means of these as instruments, <lb/>
            we perceive all objects of perception.</p>
          <p>Theæ. The case appears to me to be rather in this way than <lb/>
            in that.</p>
          <p>103. Socr. But why do I require so much accuracy from <lb/>
            you on this point? For this reason, that we may discover <lb/>
            whether by some one and the same part in us we, by means of <lb/>
            the eyes, attain to things white and black, and again other <lb/>
            things by means of the other senses, and whether, when ques­ <lb/>
            tioned, you will be able to refer all such things to the bodily <lb/>
            organs. But perhaps it will be better that you should say this <lb/>
            by answering my questions, than that I should take all this <lb/>
            trouble for you. Tell me, then; the things by which you per­ <lb/>
            ceive things hot and dry, and light and sweet, do you refer each <lb/>
            of them to the body, or to any thing else ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. To nothing else.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are you also willing to allow, that such things as you <lb/>
            perceive by means of one faculty it is impossible for you to <lb/>
            perceive by means of another, for instance, that what you per­ <lb/>
            ceive by means of hearing you cannot perceive. by means of <lb/>
            sight, and what you perceive by means of sight, you cannot <lb/>
            perceive by means of hearing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How should I not be willing to allow it ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If, then, you form a notion of them both together, you <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            cannot receive this perception of both together by means of one <lb/>
            organ or the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Surely not.</p>
          <p>104. Socr. Now with respect to sound and colour, is not <lb/>
            this the very. first notion that you have of them both, that they <lb/>
            both exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it not alSO,. that each is different from the other, and <lb/>
            the same with itself?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. And that both are two, but each one ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. And this also.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are you not also able to consider whether they are <lb/>
            like or unlike each other ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Probably.</p>
          <p>Socr. By means of what, then, do you acquire all these <lb/>
            notions about them ? For it is not possible by means either of <lb/>
            hearing or sight to apprehend that which is common between <lb/>
            them. Moreover, this too is a proof of what we say. For, if <lb/>
            it were possible to examine respecting them both, whether they <lb/>
            are salt or not, you know you would be able to say with what <lb/>
            you would make this examination, and this proves to be <lb/>
            neither sight nor hearing, but something else.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not, and that the faculty of taste by means of <lb/>
            the tongue ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You say well. But in what does the faculty consist <lb/>
            which shews you that which is common to all things, and to <lb/>
            these two, to which you give the name of existence and non- <lb/>
            existence, and those other names about which we were just <lb/>
            now asking? what organs will you attribute to all these, by <lb/>
            means of which our perceptive faculty perceives these several <lb/>
            things ?</p>
          <p>105. Theæ. You speak of existence and non-existence, simi­ <lb/>
            litude and dissimilitude, identity and difference, and moreover <lb/>
            of unity and other numbers: and it is evident that you ask <lb/>
            about the even and odd and whatever else depends on them, <lb/>
            by which of the organs of the body we perceive these things <lb/>
            in our soul.</p>
          <p>Socr. You follow me exceedingly well, and these, Thesetetus, <lb/>
            are the very things about which I ask.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But by Jupiter, Socrates, I know not what to say, <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            except that it seems to me that there. is no organ at all <lb/>
            peculiar to these things as there is to the others, but the <lb/>
            soul of itself appears to me to examine that which is com­ <lb/>
            mon in all things.</p>
          <p>Socr. You are beautiful, Thesetetus, and not ugly, as Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus said; for he who speaks beautifully is beautiful and good. <lb/>
            But, besides being beautiful, you have done well in having re­ <lb/>
            leased me from a very long discussion, if it appears to you that <lb/>
            the soul beholds some things by itself, and others by the <lb/>
            faculties of the body. For this was the very thing that <lb/>
            seemed to me, and I wished it might likewise seem so to you.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And indeed it does appear so to me.</p>
          <p>106. Socr. To which of the two classes, then, do you re­ <lb/>
            fer existence ? For this especially attaches to all things.</p>
          <p>'hec. I refer it to those. things which the soul of itself <lb/>
            reaches after.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it the same with similarity and dissimilarity, identity <lb/>
            and difference?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? with the beautiful and the ugly, good <lb/>
            and evil ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears to me that the soul especially considers <lb/>
            the essence of these in reference to each other, comparing <lb/>
            within itself things past and present with the future.</p>
          <p>Socr. Stay: will it not perceive the hardness of that which <lb/>
            is hard by the touch, and the softness of that which is soft in <lb/>
            like manner ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But their essence, both what they are, and their opposi­ <lb/>
            tion to each other, and the nature of this opposition, the soul <lb/>
            itself, examining them repeatedly and comparing them with <lb/>
            each other, endeavours to determine for us.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are not, then, both men. and beasts by nature able <lb/>
            to perceive as soon as they are born those things that pass by <lb/>
            means of the bodily organs to the soul, but comparisons of <lb/>
            these with reference to their essence and use they arrive at with <lb/>
            difficulty, and after a long time, by means of much labour and <lb/>
            study, if ever they do arrive at it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. For is it possible to apprehend the truth of that of <lb/>
            which we cannot apprehend the existence ?</p><pb n="424"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. Impossible.</p>
          <p>107. Boer. But can any one possess a scientific knowledge <lb/>
            of a thing, of which he cannot apprehend the truth ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How can he, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Boer. There is, therefore, no science in sensations, but in <lb/>
            reasoning on them; for in this way, as it seems, it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to touch upon essence and truth, but in that way im­ <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>Them. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Can you, therefore, call that and this the same, when <lb/>
            there is so great a difference between them ?</p>
          <p>TheB. It would not be right to do so.</p>
          <p>Socr. What name, then, do you give to that, to sight, hear­ <lb/>
            ing, smelling, tasting, being hot, and being cold ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Perceiving; for what other name can be given ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you, therefore, call the whole of this perception ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. To which, as we said, it does not appertain to touch <lb/>
            upon truth, for it does not ever touch upon essence.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Nor, therefore, upon science ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. No.</p>
          <p>Socr. Perception, therefore, and science, Thesetetus, can <lb/>
            never be the same ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears not, Socrates.</p>
          <p>108. Socr. And now it has been made perfectly clear that <lb/>
            science is something different from perception. But we did <lb/>
            not commence this conversation with this view, that we might <lb/>
            find out what science is not, but what it is. However, we have <lb/>
            advanced so far as not to seek it at all in perception, but in that <lb/>
            name, whatever it is, which the soul possesses when it em­ <lb/>
            ploys itself about things that exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But this, I think, Socrates, is called, to judge.</p>
          <p>Socr. You think rightly, my friend. And now consider <lb/>
            again from the beginning, having obliterated all that has been <lb/>
            said before, if you see at all more clearly, now that you have <lb/>
            come to this point. And tell me again what science is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is impossible, Socrates, to say that it is every <lb/>
            judgment, because there is also false judgment. But it ap­ <lb/>
            pears that true judgment is science, and let this be my answer. <lb/>
            For if, as we proceed, it shall not appear to be so, as it does at <lb/>
            present, we will endeavour to say something else.</p><pb n="425"/>
            
          <p>109. Socr. Thus, then, Theætetus, you must speak more <lb/>
            promptly, and not, as at first, hesitate to answer. For if we <lb/>
            do so, one of two things will happen; we shall either find <lb/>
            that which we are in search of, or we shall in a less degree <lb/>
            think that we know what we do not know at all; though this <lb/>
            would be no despicable reward. Now, then, what do you <lb/>
            say? Since there are two species of judgment, one true, and <lb/>
            the other false, do you define science to be true judgment ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do; for this at present appears to me to be the <lb/>
            case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it, then, worth while again to resume the discus­ <lb/>
            sion respecting judgment ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Somehow this matter troubles me just now, and has <lb/>
            often done so at other times, so that I have had great doubt <lb/>
            with respect to myself and others, from not being able to say <lb/>
            what this affection in us is, and in what way it is produced.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What affection ?</p>
          <p>Socr. This, that any one forms false judgments; and I even <lb/>
            now still consider and am in doubt whether we shall let this <lb/>
            alone, or examine it in a different manner than we did just <lb/>
            now.</p>
          <p>Them. How not, Socrates ? at least if it appears necessary <lb/>
            to be done in some way or other? For you and Theodorus <lb/>
            just now remarked, not badly, respecting leisure, that there is <lb/>
            no urgency in matters of this kind.</p>
          <p>110. Socr. You have reminded me very properly. For per­ <lb/>
            haps it will not be foreign to our purpose in a manner to <lb/>
            retrace our steps. For it is better to finish a little well than <lb/>
            much insufficiently.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Why not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. How then ? what do we say ? do we not affirm that <lb/>
            sometimes judgments are false ? or that one of us forms false <lb/>
            judgments and another true ones, as if this was naturally the <lb/>
            case ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We doubtless do affirm this.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not this happen to us with regard to things in <lb/>
            general and each particular, that we either know it or do not <lb/>
            know it ? For learning and forgetting, as being between these, <lb/>
            I pass by for the present, for now they have nothing to do <lb/>
            with our discussion..</p><pb n="426"/>
            
          <p>Them. However, Socrates, there is no other alternative with <lb/>
            respect to each particular, except knowing or not knowing it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Then, is it not necessary, that he who judges should <lb/>
            judge either what he does know, or does not know ?</p>
          <p>Them. It is necessary.</p>
          <p>Socr. But that a person who knows should not know the <lb/>
            same thing, or that he who does not know it should know it, is <lb/>
            impossible.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not he, then, who forms a false judgment about <lb/>
            what he knows, think that these are not the same, but different <lb/>
            from what he knows, and thus while he knows both, he is at <lb/>
            the same time ignorant of both ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. But this is impossible, Socrates.</p>
          <p>111. Socr. Does he, then, think that things which he does <lb/>
            not know are certain other things that he does not know, and <lb/>
            is it possible for one who knows neither Theætetus nor <lb/>
            Socrates, to imagine that Socrates is Theætetus, or Theætetus <lb/>
            Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Theo. How could that be ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither, surely, does any one think that the things <lb/>
            which he knows are the same as those that he does not know, <lb/>
            nor again that the things which he does not know, are the <lb/>
            same as those that he does know.</p>
          <p>Theæ. For that would be monstrous.</p>
          <p>Socr. How then can any one form false judgments? For it <lb/>
            is impossible to form judgments in any other way than this, <lb/>
            since we either know or do not know all things, and in these <lb/>
            it appears to be by no means possible to form false judgments.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most true.</p>
          <p>Socr. Ought we, then, to consider the object of our enquiry, <lb/>
            not by proceeding according to knowing and not knowing, but <lb/>
            according to being and not being ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Soer. Whether it is not universally true, that he who thinks <lb/>
            things that are not, with respect to any thing whatever, must <lb/>
            unavoidably form a false judgment, however intelligent he may <lb/>
            be in other respects.</p>
          <p>Theæ. That is reasonable, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. How then ? what shall we say, Theætetus, if any one <lb/>
            should ask us, " Is it possible for any one to do what you say, <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            and can any man think that which is not, whether respecting <lb/>
            any real object or abstract essence?" And we, it seems, shall <lb/>
            say to this, "When he who thinks does not think what is <lb/>
            true." What else can we say ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>112. Socr. Does a thing of this kind happen also in other <lb/>
            cases ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of what kind?</p>
          <p>Boer. If a person sees something, and yet.sees nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But how can that be ?</p>
          <p>Boer. But if he sees some one thing, he sees something that <lb/>
            exists; and do you think that one thing is ever among things <lb/>
            that do not exist ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do not.</p>
          <p>Socr. He, therefore, who sees some one thing sees that <lb/>
            which exists.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And, therefore, he who hears something, both hears <lb/>
            some one thing, and hears that which exists.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And doubtless he who touches both touches some one <lb/>
            thing, and that which exists, since it is one thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. And this too.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not he then who judges, judge some one thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of necessity.</p>
          <p>Socr. And does not he who judges some one thing, judge <lb/>
            something that exists ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I grant it.</p>
          <p>Boer. He therefore who judges what does not exist, judges <lb/>
            nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But he who judges nothing, does not judge at all.</p>
          <p>Theæ. That is evident, as it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is impossible, therefore, to judge that which is not, <lb/>
            either with respect to real objects or abstract essences.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears not.</p>
          <p>Socr. To form false judgments, therefore, is different from <lb/>
            judging things that do not exist. '</p>
          <p>Them. It seems to be different.</p>
          <p>Socr. Neither then in this way nor in the way we considered <lb/>
            a little before, is false judgment formed in us.</p><pb n="428"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. On no account.</p>
          <p>113. Socr. Do we then give that name to what takes place <lb/>
            as follows.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How?</p>
          <p>Socr. We say that a mistaken judgment is a false judgment, <lb/>
            when any one says that any real object is another real object, <lb/>
            changing one for the other in his thoughts. For thus he al­ <lb/>
            ways judges that which exists, but one thing instead of another, <lb/>
            and erring in that which he was considering, he may be justly <lb/>
            said to form a false judgment.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You now appear to me to have spoken most correctly: <lb/>
            for, when any one forms a judgment that a thing is ugly in­ <lb/>
            stead of beautiful, or beautiful instead of ugly, then he truly <lb/>
            forms a false judgment.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is evident, Theætetus, that you esteem me lightly <lb/>
            and have no fear of me.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Soer. I do not seem to you, I imagine, likely to lay hold of <lb/>
            your " truly false," by asking whether it is possible for swift to <lb/>
            take place slowly or light heavily, or any other contrary, not <lb/>
            according to its own nature, but according to the nature of <lb/>
            its contrary, contrariwise to itself. This, however, I dismiss, <lb/>
            that your confidence may not be in vain. But are you satisfied, <lb/>
            as you say, that to form false judgments is to form mistaken <lb/>
            judgments ?</p>
          <p>Thece. I am.</p>
          <p>114. Socr. It is possible, then, according to your opinion, <lb/>
            for one thing to be comprehended in the mind as another, and <lb/>
            not as it is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is possible.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, any one's mind does this, is it not <lb/>
            necessary that it should think about objects, both, or one of <lb/>
            them ?</p>
          <p>Thece. Quite necessary.</p>
          <p>Socr. Either together or in turns ?</p>
          <p>Thece. Very well.</p>
          <p>Socr. But by thinking do you mean the same that I do ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What do you mean by it ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The discourse which the soul holds with itself about <lb/>
            the objects that it considers. I explain this to you as a person <lb/>
            who does not know what he says. For the soul, when it thinks, <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            appears to me to do nothing else than discourse with itself, <lb/>
            asking itself questions and answering them, affirming and deny­ <lb/>
            in- ; but when it has decided, whether it has come to its de­ <lb/>
            cision more slowly or more rapidly, and now asserts and does <lb/>
            not doubt, this we call judgment. So that to form a judgment <lb/>
            I call to speak, and judgment a sentence spoken, not indeed to <lb/>
            another person nor with the voice but in silence to itself. But <lb/>
            what do you call it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. The same.</p>
          <p>Socr. When any one, therefore, forms a judgment that one <lb/>
            thing is another, he says to himself, as it seems, that one thing <lb/>
            is another.</p>
          <p>115. Theæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Recollect, then, whether you have ever said to your­ <lb/>
            self, that the beautiful is certainly ugly, or the unjust, just, or <lb/>
            even, chief of all, consider whether you have ever attempted to <lb/>
            persuade yourself, that one thing is certainly another, or, quite <lb/>
            contrariwise, whether you have ever ventured even in sleep to <lb/>
            say to yourself, that undoubtedly odd is even, or any thing else <lb/>
            of the kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But do you think that any one else in his senses or <lb/>
            even mad would venture to say seriously to himself, being him­ <lb/>
            self persuaded, that an ox must needs be a horse, or two one ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Not I, by Jupiter. I</p>
          <p>Socr. If, therefore, to speak to one's-selfis to form judgments, <lb/>
            no one, who speaks and forms judgments of both objects, and <lb/>
            touches upon both with his soul, would say and judge that one <lb/>
            is another. You must therefore give up what you said about <lb/>
            the other. For I assert this, that no one thinks that the ugly <lb/>
            is beautiful, or any thing else of the kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I give it up then, Socrates, and it appears to me as <lb/>
            you say.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is impossible, then, for one who forms judgments <lb/>
            about both, to think that the one is the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>116. Socr. He, however, who judges one thing only, but the <lb/>
            other in no respect, will never judge that the one is the other. I</p>
          <p>Theæ. You say truly: for he would be compelled to touch <lb/>
            upon that also of which he does not judge.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not possible then for a person who judges either <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            both or one of the two, to judge that one is the other: so that <lb/>
            if any one should define false judgment to be the judgment of <lb/>
            one thing instead of another, he would say nothing to the pur­ <lb/>
            pose ; for neither in this way, nor in those before mentioned, <lb/>
            does it appear that false judgment pertains to us.</p>
          <p>Thes. It seems not.</p>
          <p>Socr. However, Theætetus, if this should appear not to be <lb/>
            so, we shall be compelled to admit many absurdities.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will not tell you, until I have endeavoured to con­ <lb/>
            sider the matter in every point of view; for I should be <lb/>
            ashamed for both of us, if, while we are in the difficulty we are, <lb/>
            we should be compelled to admit what I now say. But if we <lb/>
            discover the object of our search and become free, then we <lb/>
            will speak of others, as subject to this, being ourselves placed <lb/>
            beyond the reach of ridicule: but if we shall continue still in­ <lb/>
            volved in difficulties, we must humble ourselves, I imagine, <lb/>
            and give ourselves up to discussion, like those who are sea­ <lb/>
            sick, to be trampled on and treated as it pleases. Hear, then, <lb/>
            how I still find a way out of our enquiry.</p>
          <p>117. Theæ. Only speak.</p>
          <p>Soer. I shall deny that we made a correct admission, when <lb/>
            we admitted that it is impossible for a person to judge that <lb/>
            what he knows is what he does not know and be thus de­ <lb/>
            ceived ; but in some respect it is possible.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Do you mean that which I suspected at the time <lb/>
            when we said this, might be the case, that sometimes I know­ <lb/>
            ing Socrates, and seeing another person at a distance whom I <lb/>
            do not know, have thought it was Socrates, whom I do know ? <lb/>
            For what you mention happens in a case of this kind.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are we not, then, driven from that position, because it <lb/>
            made us, while we know, not know the things that we do know ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us not, then, make our assumption in this way <lb/>
            but as follows; and perhaps it will in some respect succeed for <lb/>
            us, and perhaps it will oppose us. For we are in a condition <lb/>
            in which it is necessary to examine our whole argument in <lb/>
            every point of view. Consider, therefore, whether I say any <lb/>
            thing to the purpose. Is it possible for a person who did not <lb/>
            know something before, afterwards to learn it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is indeed.</p><pb n="431"/>
            
          <p>Socr. And can he not also learn another thing after another ? <lb/>
            118. Theæ. Why not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Suppose, then, I beg, for the sake of argument, that <lb/>
            we have in our souls a waxen tablet, in one larger, in an­ <lb/>
            other smaller, in one of purer wax, in another of impurer, in <lb/>
            some of harder, and in others again of softer, but in some of <lb/>
            a moderate quality.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do suppose it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us say, then, that this is a gift of Mnemosyne the <lb/>
            mother of the Muses ; and that, whatever we wish to remember <lb/>
            of things that we have seen, or heard, or have ourselves thought <lb/>
            of, we impress in this, by placing it under our perceptions and <lb/>
            thoughts, as if we were taking off the impressions from rings: <lb/>
            and that whatever is imprinted, this we remember and know, <lb/>
            as long as its image remains; but when it is effaced, or can be <lb/>
            no longer imprinted, we forget and do not know it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, a person knows these things and <lb/>
            considers any of the things that he sees or hears, consider <lb/>
            whether in this way he can judge falsely ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Socr. By thinking with respect to what he knows, that they <lb/>
            i are at one time the things that he knows, and at another the <lb/>
            things that he does not know. For in a former part of our <lb/>
            discussion we made an improper admission in admitting that <lb/>
            this was impossible.</p>
          <p>119. Them. But how do you mean now ?</p>
          <p>Socr. We must speak thus on this subject, defining it from <lb/>
            the beginning: It is impossible that he who knows any thing, <lb/>
            and has a remembrance of it in his soul, but does not actually <lb/>
            perceive it, can think that it is some other thing that he knows, <lb/>
            of which he has the impression, though he does not perceive <lb/>
            it: and again, it is impossible that any one can think that what <lb/>
            he knows is that which he does not know, and of which he <lb/>
            has not the seal: or that what he does not know is that which <lb/>
            he does not know: or that what he does not know is that <lb/>
            which he does know: or think that what he perceives is some <lb/>
            other thing that he perceives: or that what he perceives is <lb/>
            something that he does not perceive : or that what he does not <lb/>
            perceive is some other thing that he does not perceive : or that <lb/>
            what he does not perceive is something that he docs perceive. <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            And again it is still more impossible, if that can be, that a <lb/>
            person should think that what he knows and perceives, and of <lb/>
            which he has an impression by means of perception, is some­ <lb/>
            thing else that he knows and perceives, and of which in like <lb/>
            manner he has an impression by means of perception. And it <lb/>
            is impossible that what he knows and perceives, and of which <lb/>
            he has a correct remembrance, he can think is something else <lb/>
            that he knows : or that what he knows and perceives, and in <lb/>
            like manner retains in his remembrance, is something else that <lb/>
            he perceives: or again, that what he neither knows nor per­ <lb/>
            ceives is something else that he neither knows nor perceives: <lb/>
            or that what he neither knows nor perceives is something else <lb/>
            that he does not know; or that what he neither knows nor <lb/>
            perceives is something else that he does not perceive. In all <lb/>
            these cases it is utterly impossible for any one to judge falsely. <lb/>
            It remains, therefore, that it must take place, if anywhere, in <lb/>
            the following cases.</p>
          <p>120. Theæ. In what cases ? perhaps I shall understand you <lb/>
            better from them ; for at present I do not follow you.</p>
          <p>Socr. In things which a person knows, he may think that <lb/>
            they are different from the things that he knows and perceives; <lb/>
            or from those which he does not know, but perceives; or that <lb/>
            the things which he knows and perceives are some of the <lb/>
            things which he likewise knows and perceives.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Now I am left much further behind than I was.</p>
          <p>Socr. Listen again, then, as follows: I, knowing Theodorus, <lb/>
            and remembering within myself what kind of a person he is, <lb/>
            and in like manner, Theaetetus, do I not sometimes see them, <lb/>
            and sometimes not, and sometimes touch them, and sometimes <lb/>
            not, and hear or perceive them by some other sense, but some­ <lb/>
            times have I no perception of you at all, yet nevertheless do I <lb/>
            remember you, and know you within myself?</p>
          <p>Thece. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Understand this, then, the first of the things that I <lb/>
            wish to prove, that it is possible for a man not to perceive <lb/>
            what he knows, and that it is possible for him to perceive it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. And does it not often happen that a man does not per­ <lb/>
            ceive what he does not know, and often that he perceives it <lb/>
            only?</p>
          <p>TheB. This also is true.</p><pb n="433"/>
            
          <p>121. Consider then, whether you can now follow me better. <lb/>
            Socrates knows Theodorus and Thesetetus, but he sees neither <lb/>
            of them, nor has he any other perception respecting them, now <lb/>
            he can never form this judgment within himself, that Theæ­ <lb/>
            tetus is Theodorus? Do I say any thing to the purpose or <lb/>
            not ?</p>
          <p>Them. Yes, quite true.</p>
          <p>Socr. This then was the first of the cases that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Them. It was.</p>
          <p>Socr. But the second was this, that I knowing one of you, <lb/>
            but not knowing the other, and perceiving neither, should <lb/>
            never think that he whom I know is the person whom I do <lb/>
            not know.</p>
          <p>Them. Right.</p>
          <p>Socr. The third was this, that I neither knowing nor per­ <lb/>
            ceiving either of them, should not think that he whom I do' <lb/>
            not know is some other person of those whom I do not know: <lb/>
            and consider that you again hear in succession all the instances <lb/>
            before put, in which I shall never form a false judgment re­ <lb/>
            specting you and Theodorus, neither while knowing nor igno­ <lb/>
            rant of you both, nor while knowing one, and not the other; <lb/>
            and in the same way with regard to perceptions, if you follow <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>Them. I do follow you.</p>
          <p>122. Socr. It remains, therefore, that I may form a false judg­ <lb/>
            ment in this case, when knowing you and Theodorus, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing the impression of both of you in that waxen tablet made by <lb/>
            a seal ring as it were, seeing you both from a distance and not <lb/>
            sufficiently distinguishing you, I endeavour, by attributing the <lb/>
            peculiar impression of each to his peculiar aspect, applying it <lb/>
            so as to adapt it to its own form in order that I may recognise <lb/>
            it, then failing in this, and changing them like those that put <lb/>
            their shoes on the wrong feet, I fit the aspect of each to the <lb/>
            impression of the other, as happens in looking into mirrors, <lb/>
            where the sight passes from the right to the left, so I fall into <lb/>
            the same error; then mistaken opinion and false judgment take <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>Them. What happens with regard to judgment, Socrates, <lb/>
            seems wonderfully like what you describe.</p>
          <p>Socr. Still further, when, knowing both of you, in addition <lb/>
            to knowing I perceive one, but not the other, I have a know- <note type="footnote"> F f </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            ledge of the other not according to perception, which I thus <lb/>
            described before, but you did not then understand me.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I did not.</p>
          <p>123. Socr. I said this however, that a person who knows <lb/>
            and perceives one and has a knowledge of him according to <lb/>
            perception, will never think that he is some other person <lb/>
            whom he knows and perceives, and of whom he has a know­ <lb/>
            ledge according to perception. Was not this what I said?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. There remained then the case that was just now <lb/>
            mentioned, in which we said that false judgment takes place, <lb/>
            when a person knowing you both and seeing you both, or <lb/>
            having some other perception of you both, has not the im­ <lb/>
            pression of each according to the perception of each, but, <lb/>
            like an unskilful archer, shoots beside the mark and misses, <lb/>
            this then is called a falsehood.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very properly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, perception is present to one of the <lb/>
            impressions, and not to the other, and the one applies the im­ <lb/>
            pression of the absent perception to that which is present, in <lb/>
            this case the mind is 'altogether deceived: and, in a word, with <lb/>
            respect to things that a person has neither known nor ever per­ <lb/>
            ceived, it is not possible, as it seems, either to be deceived, or <lb/>
            to form a false judgment, if there is any soundness in what we <lb/>
            now say: but with respect to things that we know and perceive, <lb/>
            in these very things judgment is conversant and turns round, <lb/>
            becoming both false and true, by collecting together in a direct <lb/>
            and straight line the copies and marks proper to each, it is <lb/>
            true, but sideways and obliquely, false.</p>
          <p>124. Theæ. Is it not well described, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. You will say so still more, when you hear what <lb/>
            follows. For to judge truly is beautiful, but to be deceived <lb/>
            is base.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. They say, then, that these things proceed from hence. <lb/>
            When the wax in any one's soul is deep, abundant, smooth, and <lb/>
            properly moulded, objects entering by means of the percep­ <lb/>
            tions and impressing themselves on this heart r of the soul, as <note type="footnote"> A play on the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέαρ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κη̑ρ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κήρος</foreign>, which cannot be retained <lb/>

            the impressions of the perceptions, but form true judgments; <lb/>
            for, as these impressions are clear, and in a wide space, they <lb/>
            quickly distribute to their proper images each of the things <lb/>
            that are called beings.; and such men are called wise. Does <lb/>
            it not appear so to you ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>125. Socr. When, therefore, any one's heart is covered with <lb/>
            hair, which the very wise poet has celebrated, or when it is <lb/>
            muddy, and not of pure wax, or very soft, or hard, those in whom <lb/>
            it is soft are easily taught, but are forgetful, and those in whom <lb/>
            it is hard, the contrary; but those who have it hairy and rough, <lb/>
            and stony or full of earth or mixed mud, have indistinct im­ <lb/>
            pressions ; they are also indistinct in those that are hard, for <lb/>
            there is no depth in them; they are likewise indistinct in those <lb/>
            that are soft, for by being confused they soon become obscure ; <lb/>
            but if, in addition to all this, they fall one upon another by <lb/>
            reason of narrowness of space, if any one's soul is little, they <lb/>
            are still more indistinct than the others. All these, therefore, <lb/>
            are such as form false judgments. For when they see, or <lb/>
            hear, or think about any thing, not being able at once to <lb/>
            attribute each object to its impression, they are slow, and <lb/>
            attributing different objects to different impressions, they for <lb/>
            the most part see wrongly, and hear wrongly, and think <lb/>
            wrongly; and these are said to be deceived in objects and <lb/>
            ignorant.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You speak as correctly as man can do, Socrates.</p>
          <p>126. Socr. Shall we say, then, that there are false judg­ <lb/>
            ments in us ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. And true judgments also ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. And true.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do we, then, consider it to have been sufficiently <lb/>
            established that these two judgments do without doubt <lb/>
            exist ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. A talkative man, Theætetus, appears to be really <lb/>
            troublesome and disagreeable.</p><pb n="436"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. How so ? Why do you say this ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Because I am angry at my own ignorance, and, in <lb/>
            truth, talkativeness. For what other name can any one give <lb/>
            it when a man drags the conversation upwards and downwards, <lb/>
            and cannot be persuaded through his dulness, and is with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty torn from each several topic ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. But why are you angry ?</p>
          <p>Soer. I am not only angry, but I am afraid that I should <lb/>
            not know what to answer, if any one should ask me, " Socrates, <lb/>
            have you found that false judgment is neither in the percep­ <lb/>
            tions compared with each other, nor in the thoughts, but in <lb/>
            the conjunction of perception with thought ?" I think I shall <lb/>
            say, I have, priding myself as if we had made a very fine dis­ <lb/>
            covery.</p>
          <p>127. Theæ. What has just now been proved appears to me, <lb/>
            Socrates, to be by no means despicable.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you therefore assert, he will say, that we can never <lb/>
            suppose that a man whom we think of only, but do not see, is <lb/>
            a horse, which we neither see nor touch, but think of only; <lb/>
            and do not perceive in any other way ? I believe I should say, <lb/>
            that I do assert this.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And rightly.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? he will say, according to this mode of <lb/>
            reasoning, can the number eleven, which one thinks of only, <lb/>
            ever be supposed to be twelve, which also one thinks of only ? <lb/>
            Come then, do you answer ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I should answer, that a person seeing or touching <lb/>
            might suppose that eleven are twelve, but that he would never <lb/>
            think thus respecting numbers which he embraces only in <lb/>
            thought.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then? do you suppose that any one has ever <lb/>
            proposed to consider within himself of five and seven, I do not <lb/>
            mean seven and five men, or any thing else of the kind, but <lb/>
            the numbers five and seven themselves, which we said were in <lb/>
            his soul like impressions in wax, and that it is impossible to <lb/>
            judge falsely respecting them,-has any man at any time con­ <lb/>
            sidered these very things, speaking to himself and asking how <lb/>
            many they are, and answered, one that he supposes they are <lb/>
            eleven, and another that they are twelve, or do all men say <lb/>
            and suppose that they are twelve ?</p>
          <p>128. Theæ. No, by Jupiter, but many suppose that they are <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            eleven. And if a person considers about a greater number, he <lb/>
            is still more mistaken; for I suppose that you rather speak <lb/>
            about every number.</p>
          <p>Socr. You suppose rightly, but consider whether any thing <lb/>
            else ever happens than this, that he supposes that the number <lb/>
            twelve impressed in his soul is eleven ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does it not then come back to our former statements ? <lb/>
            For he who is in this condition supposes that what he knows is <lb/>
            something else that he also knows, which we said was impos­ <lb/>
            sible, and from which very circumstance we demonstrated that <lb/>
            there is no such thing as false judgment, in order that the <lb/>
            same person might not be compelled to know and not to know <lb/>
            the same thing at the same time.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most true.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore we must shew that false judgment is some­ <lb/>
            thing else than an interchange of mind with perception. For, <lb/>
            if this were so, we could never be deceived in the thoughts <lb/>
            themselves: but now there is either no such thing as false <lb/>
            judgment, or it is possible for a person not to know what he <lb/>
            knows : and which of these two do you choose ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. You offer me a difficult choice, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Our argument however appears as if it would not <lb/>
            allow both these to take place : though (for we must venture <lb/>
            on every thing), what if we should determine to lay aside all <lb/>
            shame ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How ?</p>
          <p>Socr. By taking upon ourselves to declare what it is to <lb/>
            know.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But why would this be shameless ?</p>
          <p>129. Socr. You do not seem to consider that the whole of <lb/>
            our discussion from the beginning has been an investigation <lb/>
            respecting science, as if we did not know what it is.</p>
          <p>Theos. I do consider it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does it not, then, appear to be a shameless thing, to <lb/>
            explain what it is to know, when we are ignorant of what <lb/>
            science is ? But, Theætetus, our conversation has been all along <lb/>
            full of defects. For we have over and over again used the <lb/>
            expressions, We know, and We do not know, We have a <lb/>
            scientific knowledge, and We have not a scientific knowledge, <lb/>
            as if we both of us understood something about it, whereas we <lb/>
            are still ignorant of what science is. But if you please, we <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            will still at the present moment use the terms, to be ignorant, <lb/>
            and to understand, as if we could properly use them, though <lb/>
            we are destitute of science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But how will you converse, Socrates, if you abstain <lb/>
            from the use of these expressions ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Not at all, while I am what I am. If however I were <lb/>
            contentious, or if a person of that kind were now present, he <lb/>
            would say that I must abstain from them, and . would <lb/>
            strongly object to what I say. But as we are poor creatures, <lb/>
            do you wish I should venture to say what it is to know ? For <lb/>
            it appears to me that it would be worth while to do so.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Venture then, by Jupiter; for you will be readily <lb/>
            pardoned for not abstaining from these expressions.</p>
          <p>130. Socr. Have you heard, then, what they now say it is <lb/>
            to know ?</p>
          <p>TheB. Perhaps so; but at present I do not remember.</p>
          <p>Socr. They say, I believe, that it is to have science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let us, then, change it a little, and say that it is to <lb/>
            possess science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But in what will you say this differs from that ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Perhaps in nothing: but whether it seems to differ or <lb/>
            not, listen and examine with me.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I will, if I am able.</p>
          <p>Socr. To possess, therefore, does not appear to me to be the <lb/>
            same as to have: for instance, if any one having bought a <lb/>
            garment, and having it in his power, should not wear it, we <lb/>
            should not say that he has it, but that he possesses it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very properly.</p>
          <p>Socr. See then whether it is possible thus to possess science <lb/>
            without having it: just as if any one having caught some wild <lb/>
            birds, as doves or any others, and having constructed a dove­ <lb/>
            cote at home, should feed them ; we should probably say that <lb/>
            in some respects he always has them, because he possesses <lb/>
            them : should we not ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But in another respect we should say that he has <lb/>
            none of them, but that he has acquired a power over them, <lb/>
            since he has brought them under his control, in an enclosure <lb/>
            of his own, so as to take and have them when he pleases, by <lb/>
            catching whichever he wishes, and again of letting them go: <lb/>
            and this he is at liberty to do as often as he thinks fit.</p><pb n="439"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>131. Socr. Again, therefore, as in a former part of our dis­ <lb/>
            cussion we constructed I know not what kind of waxen fig­ <lb/>
            ment in the soul, so now let us make in each soul a kind of <lb/>
            aviary of all sorts of birds, some being in flocks, apart from <lb/>
            others, and others few together, and others alone, flying <lb/>
            amongst all the rest wherever it may chance.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Suppose it to be made: but what next ?</p>
          <p>Socr. While we are children, we must say, that this recep­ <lb/>
            tacle is empty, and instead of birds we must understand <lb/>
            sciences; whatever science, then, one has become possessed of <lb/>
            and shut up in this enclosure, one must say that he has learnt <lb/>
            or discovered the thing of which this is the science, and that <lb/>
            this is to know.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Be it so. i</p>
          <p>Socr. Again, therefore, when any one wishes to catch any <lb/>
            one of these sciences, and, when he has taken it, to have it, and <lb/>
            again to let it go, consider what words he requires, whether <lb/>
            the same as before, when he possessed them, or different ones. <lb/>
            But from what follows you will more clearly understand what <lb/>
            I mean. Do you call arithmetic an art ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>132. Socr. Suppose this to be a catching of the sciences of <lb/>
            every even and odd number.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do suppose it.</p>
          <p>Socr. By this art, then, I think, he has the sciences of <lb/>
            numbers under his control, and, if he pleases, transfers them to <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And we say that he who transfers them teaches, and <lb/>
            that he who receives them learns, but that having them, by <lb/>
            possessing them in that aviary, he knows them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Attend now to what follows. Does not he who is a <lb/>
            perfect arithmetician know all numbers ? for the sciences of all <lb/>
            numbers are in his soul.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not then such a- person sometimes calculate <lb/>
            either something within himself, or something else that is <lb/>
            external, that is capable of being calculated.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Undoubtedly.</p><pb n="440"/>
            
          <p>Socr. But to calculate we shall say is nothing else than to <lb/>
            examine what is the quantity of any number.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. What therefore he knows, he appears to examine, as <lb/>
            if he did not know, though we admitted that he knows all <lb/>
            number. You surely hear such questions as these.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do.</p>
          <p>133. Socr.' We, therefore, carrying on our comparison with <lb/>
            the possession and catching of doves, will say that this catching <lb/>
            is of two kinds, one before possessing for the sake of possess­ <lb/>
            ing, the other when one has already obtained possession, for <lb/>
            the purpose of taking and having in the hands what was <lb/>
            already possessed. So with respect to the things of which a <lb/>
            person has already acquired the science by learning, and which <lb/>
            he knew, he may learn these same things again, and recover <lb/>
            and retain the science of each, which he formerly possessed, <lb/>
            but had not ready in his mind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. On this account, I just now asked, what words it is <lb/>
            proper to use in speaking of these things, when an arithmeti­ <lb/>
            cian sets about calculating, or a grammarian reading any thing. <lb/>
            Shall we say that knowing such a subject he again applies <lb/>
            himself to learn from himself what he knows ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. This would be absurd, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we say, then, that he is going to read or calcu­ <lb/>
            late what he does not know, though we have granted him that <lb/>
            he knows all letters and all numbers ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. This too would be unreasonable.</p>
          <p>134. Socr. Will you, then, that we say, that we care nothing <lb/>
            at all about words, in what way any one chooses to employ the <lb/>
            words knowing and learning, but, since we have settled that it <lb/>
            is one thing to possess a science, and another to have it, we <lb/>
            maintain that it is impossible for a person not to possess what <lb/>
            he does possess, so that it never happens that any one does not <lb/>
            know what he knows, though it is possible for him to form a <lb/>
            false judgment respecting it? For it is possible for him not to <lb/>
            have the science of this particular thing, but another instead of <lb/>
            it, when hunting after some one of the sciences that he pos­ <lb/>
            sesses as they are flying about, he may by mistake take one <lb/>
            instead of another; accordingly when he thinks that eleven is <lb/>
            twelve, he takes the science of eleven instead of that of twelve, <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            as it were taking a pigeon that he possessed instead of a <lb/>
            dove.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is reasonable to suppose so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But when he takes that which he endeavours to take, <lb/>
            then he is not deceived, and judges truly: and thus we will <lb/>
            say that false and true judgment subsist, and none of the things <lb/>
            which occasioned difficulty before will any longer stand in our <lb/>
            way. Perhaps you agree with me, or what will you do ?</p>
          <p>Them. Agree with you.</p>
          <p>135. Socr. We are freed then, from the dilemma of a man's <lb/>
            not knowing what he knows : for it never happens that we do <lb/>
            not possess what we do possess, whether we are deceived re­ <lb/>
            specting any thing or not. However, another much worse <lb/>
            inconvenience appears to me to present itself.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If the interchange of sciences can ever become false <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But how ?</p>
          <p>Socr. In the first place, that having the science of any thing <lb/>
            one should be ignorant of that thing, not through ignorance, <lb/>
            but through the science of the thing itself, and in the next <lb/>
            place, that one should judge this thing to be another thing <lb/>
            and another thing this, how is it not a great piece of <lb/>
            absurdity, that when science is present the soul should know <lb/>
            nothing, but be ignorant of all things? For, from this mode <lb/>
            of reasoning, nothing hinders but that ignorance when present <lb/>
            should make us know something, and blindness should make <lb/>
            us see, if science will ever make a man ignorant.</p>
          <p>Theo. Perhaps, Socrates, we have done wrong in making <lb/>
            sciences only take the place of the birds, and we ought to have <lb/>
            supposed that various kinds of ignorance were flying about in <lb/>
            the soul with them, and that the sportsman at one time taking <lb/>
            science, and at another time ignorance, with respect to the <lb/>
            same thing, judges falsely through ignorance, but truly through <lb/>
            science.</p>
          <p>136. Socr. It is not by any means easy, Thesetetus, to for­ <lb/>
            bear praising you: however, examine again what you have <lb/>
            just said. For suppose it to be as you say. He who takes <lb/>
            ignorance, will judge falsely you say; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Yet surely he will not think that he judges falsely.</p><pb n="442"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. How should he ?</p>
          <p>Socr. But truly, and he will fancy that he knows the things <lb/>
            about which he is deceived.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. He will therefore judge that by sporting he has taken <lb/>
            science, and not ignorance.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Clearly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Having therefore made a long circuit, we have come <lb/>
            back again to our first doubt. For that critic will laugh at us <lb/>
            and say, " Can any one, my excellent friends, who knows both, <lb/>
            science as well as ignorance, think that what he knows is some <lb/>
            other thing that he knows ? or, knowing neither of them, can <lb/>
            judge that what he does not know, is some other thing that he <lb/>
            does not know? or, knowing one, and not the other, can he <lb/>
            suppose that what he knows is what he does not know, or what <lb/>
            he does not know is what he does know ? Will you tell me <lb/>
            again, that there are sciences of sciences and ignorances, which <lb/>
            their possessor having enclosed in some other ridiculous aviaries, <lb/>
            or waxen figments, knows as long as he possesses them, though <lb/>
            he has them not ready in his soul? And will you be thus <lb/>
            compelled to revolve perpetually round the same circle, with­ <lb/>
            out making any progress ?" What answer shall we give to <lb/>
            this, Theætetus ?</p>
          <p>137. Theæ. By Jupiter, Socrates, I have no notion what <lb/>
            ought to be said.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not the argument, then, my boy, reprove us <lb/>
            very properly, and shew that we did wrong in searching for <lb/>
            false judgment before science, and neglecting that ? But it is <lb/>
            impossible to know this until we have sufficiently discovered <lb/>
            what science is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is necessary, Socrates, at present to think as you <lb/>
            say.</p>
          <p>Socr. Again therefore, what shall one say from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning about science ? For we surely must not give it up yet.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means, unless you refuse to persevere.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me,then, how can we best speak concerning <lb/>
            science so as not to contradict ourselves.</p>
          <p>Theæ. As we attempted to do before, Socrates, for I know <lb/>
            of no other plan.</p>
          <p>Socr. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. That true judgment is science. For to judge truly is <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            surely free from error, and whatever results from it is beautiful <lb/>
            and good.</p>
          <p>Socr. He who acted as guide in fording a river, Theætetus, <lb/>
            said that it would shew its own depth; so if we go on in our <lb/>
            enquiries, perhaps the impediment that we meet with will shew <lb/>
            us what we are in search of, but if we stop nothing will be <lb/>
            clear.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You say well; let us go on then and examine it.</p>
          <p>138. Socr. This then requires but a brief examination, for <lb/>
            one whole art shews that it is not science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ? and what art is it ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which belongs to those who are most renowned <lb/>
            for wisdom, whom they call orators and lawyers. For they, in <lb/>
            fact, persuade, not by teaching, but by making men form such <lb/>
            judgments as-they please. Do you think that there are any <lb/>
            teachers so clever as, when persons have not been present <lb/>
            while others were robbed of their money, or treated with some <lb/>
            other violence, to be able, while a little water is running, to <lb/>
            teach those persons sufficiently of the truth of what took <lb/>
            place ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I by no means think so, but that they can persuade.</p>
          <p>Soer. But do you not say that to persuade is to make a per­ <lb/>
            son form a judgment ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, judges are justly persuaded about <lb/>
            things which can only be known by seeing and in no other way, <lb/>
            then judging these things from hearsay, do they not, when <lb/>
            they form a true opinion, judge without science, being per­ <lb/>
            suaded properly, since they decide correctly ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>139. Socr. But, my friend, if true judgment and science are <lb/>
            the same, a perfect judge could never form a correct judgment <lb/>
            without science; but now each appears to be different from <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I had forgotten, Socrates, what I heard some one say, <lb/>
            but now I remember it: he said that true judgment in con­ <lb/>
            junction with reason is science, but that without reason it is <lb/>
            out of the pale of science, and that things for which a rea­ <lb/>
            son cannot be given cannot be known; these were his very <lb/>
            words; and that things for which a reason can be given are <lb/>
            known.</p><pb n="444"/>
            
          <p>Socr. You speak admirably well. But how do you distin­ <lb/>
            guish the things that can be known from those that cannot ? <lb/>
            tell me, for perhaps you and I have heard the same thing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I know not whether I can explain it; but I could <lb/>
            follow another person describing it, I think..</p>
          <p>Socr. Hear, then, a dream for a dream. For I too seem to <lb/>
            myself to have heard some people say, that the first elements, <lb/>
            as it were, from which we and all other things are composed, <lb/>
            cannot be explained by reason; for that each several element <lb/>
            by itself can only be named, but that nothing else can be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of it, neither that it exists nor does not exist; for that <lb/>
            this would be to attribute to it existence or non-existence, <lb/>
            whereas nothing ought to be added to it, if one means to speak <lb/>
            of the thing itself only; neither must we add to it the term <lb/>
            the, or that, or each, or only, or this, or many others of the <lb/>
            same-kind; for these are constantly varying and are applied to <lb/>
            all things, and are different from the things to which they are <lb/>
            added. 140. But we ought, if it were possible, to speak of <lb/>
            the thing itself, and, if it has a definition peculiar to itself, <lb/>
            to speak of it without the addition of any thing else. Now, <lb/>
            however, it is impossible for any of the first elements to be <lb/>
            explained by a definition, for it does not admit of any thing <lb/>
            else than being named, for it has only a name; but the things <lb/>
            that have been composed from these, as they are complex, so <lb/>
            their names, when connected together, constitute a definition; <lb/>
            for a connection of names is the essence of definition. Thus <lb/>
            the elements themselves cannot be defined or known, but only <lb/>
            perceived, but things compounded of them can be both known <lb/>
            and defined, and apprehended by true judgment. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore,-any one forms a true judgment of any thing, without ex­ <lb/>
            planation, his soul indeed perceives the truth respecting it, but <lb/>
            does not know it, for he who is not able to give and receive an <lb/>
            explanation of a thing must be ignorant of that thing, but when <lb/>
            he adds an explanation to it then he is capable of knowing all <lb/>
            these things, and may be perfect in science. Is it thus that <lb/>
            you have heard the dream, or in some other way ?</p>
          <p>Them. In this way precisely.</p>
          <p>141. Socr. Are you willing then that we should settle it <lb/>
            thus, that science is true judgment in conjunction with reason ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Exactly so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have we, then, Thesetetus, thus on this very day dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            covered what of old so many sages sought for and grew old <lb/>
            before they found it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. For ray part, Socrates, it appears to me that what <lb/>
            has been now stated is well said.</p>
          <p>Socr. And it is reasonable that this very thing should be the <lb/>
            case; for what science could there be without reason and right <lb/>
            judgment ? However one of the things that were stated dis­ <lb/>
            pleases me.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Which is that ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which seems to be very forcibly said, that the <lb/>
            elements are unknown, but that the natures of things com­ <lb/>
            pounded of them are known.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Is not that right ?</p>
          <p>Socr. We must see. For we have as sureties for this doc­ <lb/>
            trine the examples which he used who said all these things.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The elements of letters and syllables: do you think <lb/>
            that he who said what we have mentioned had any thing else <lb/>
            in view when he said it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. No, but these.</p>
          <p>142. Socr. Let us, then, apply ourselves to these and examine <lb/>
            them, or rather ourselves, whether we learnt letters in this way, <lb/>
            , or not. First of all then do syllables admit of a definition, but <lb/>
            are the elements undefinable ?</p>
          <p>Them. Probably.</p>
          <p>Socr. It certainly appears so to me, too. If, then, any one <lb/>
            should ask thus respecting the first syllable of the word So­ <lb/>
            crates, “Thesetetus, tell me, what is So ?" what would you <lb/>
            answer ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. That it is S and o.</p>
          <p>Socr. Have you not, then, this definition of the syllable ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I have.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, in the same way give me the definition of <lb/>
            the letter S.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But how can any one speak of the elements of an ele­ <lb/>
            ment? For S, Socrates, is a consonant, only a sound, as of <lb/>
            the tongue hissing; again the letter B has neither voice nor <lb/>
            sound, nor have most of the elements. So that it is very right <lb/>
            to say that they are undefinable, since the most distinct among <lb/>
            them, to the number of seven, have only a sound, but do not <lb/>
            admit of any definition.</p><pb n="446"/>
            
          <p>Socr. Thus far, then, ray friend, we have determined rightly <lb/>
            with respect to science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We appear to have done so.</p>
          <p>143. Socr. What then ? have we shewn rightly that the ele­ <lb/>
            ment cannot be known, but that the syllable can ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is probable.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, do we say that a syllable is both the ele­ <lb/>
            ments, and, if there are more than two, all of them, or some <lb/>
            one form resulting from their conjunction ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. All, we appear to me to say.</p>
          <p>Socr. Observe, then, with respect to the two letters S and <lb/>
            o ; both of them together form the first syllable of my name, <lb/>
            does not then he who knows this syllable know both of them r</p>
          <p>Theæ. How should he not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. He knows, therefore, S and o.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? is he ignorant of each of them, and know­ <lb/>
            ing neither, does he know both ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. That would be strange and absurd, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. However, if it is necessary to know each, in order <lb/>
            that he may know both, it is quite necessary for a person who <lb/>
            is ever to know a syllable to know the elements first, and thus <lb/>
            our former statement will escape us and be off.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very suddenly too.</p>
          <p>Socr. For we did not guard it well. For, perhaps, we ought <lb/>
            to suppose that a syllable does not consist of the elements, but <lb/>
            of some one species resulting from them, which has a form <lb/>
            peculiar to itself, different from the elements.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly; and perhaps the case is rather in this way <lb/>
            than in the other.</p>
          <p>144. Socr. We must examine it, and not so unmanfully <lb/>
            abandon a weighty and venerable statement.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We ought not, indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. Let it be then as we just now said; let the syllable <lb/>
            be one form resulting from the several elements, connected <lb/>
            together, as well in letters as in all other things.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. It must, therefore, have no parts.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why not?</p>
          <p>Socr. Because where there are parts, the whole must neces­ <lb/>
            . sarily be the same as all the parts: or do you say that a whole <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            resulting from parts is one certain species different from all the <lb/>
            parts ?</p>
          <p>Them. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether do you call all and the whole the same, or <lb/>
            each different from the other ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I cannot say any thing for certain, but since you bid <lb/>
            me answer boldly, I venture to say that they are different.</p>
          <p>Socr. Your boldness, Thesetetus, is right; but whether your <lb/>
            answer is so, must be considered.</p>
          <p>Them. It must indeed.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not the whole, then, differ from all, according to <lb/>
            your present statement ?</p>
          <p>Them. Yes.</p>
          <p>145. Socr. But what, is there any difference between all the <lb/>
            parts, and the all ? for instance when we say one, two, three, <lb/>
            four, five, six, or twice three, or thrice two, or four and two, or <lb/>
            three and two and one, or five and. one, whether in all these <lb/>
            cases do we say the same thing, or that which is different ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. The same thing.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do we say any thing else than six ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing.</p>
          <p>Socr. And in each mode of speaking did we not mention all <lb/>
            the parts of six ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Again, therefore, when we say all the parts do we say <lb/>
            nothing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We necessarily do say something.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do we say any thing else than six ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing.</p>
          <p>Socr. In all things, then, that consist of number, do we not <lb/>
            call the all and all the parts the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Thus then let us speak of them ; the number of an <lb/>
            acre and an acre are the same ; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And the number of a stadium in like manner ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And moreover the number of an army, and an army, <lb/>
            and in like manner with respect to all other things of the kind ? <lb/>
            For all number is all that which each of them is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p><pb n="448"/>
            
          <p>Socr. But is the number of each of them any thing else than <lb/>
            its parts ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing.</p>
          <p>Socr. Such things, then, as have parts must consist of parts ?</p>
          <p>Dec. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is admitted that all the parts are the all, since <lb/>
            all number is the all.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. The whole, therefore, does not consist of parts; for it <lb/>
            would be all, if it were all the parts.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It seems not.</p>
          <p>Socr. But is a part a part of any thing else than a whole ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes, of the all.</p>
          <p>146. Socr. You fight manfully, Thesetetus. But is not this <lb/>
            very all, the all when nothing is wanting to it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. And will not the whole be this very same thing when <lb/>
            nothing is wanting to it ? but when any thing is wanting, it is <lb/>
            neither the whole, nor all, each becoming the same thing from <lb/>
            the same cause ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears to me now, that the whole and the all in <lb/>
            no respect differ from each other.</p>
          <p>Socr. Did we not say, that where there are parts, the whole <lb/>
            and the all will be all the parts ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Again, therefore, to return to what I just now attempted <lb/>
            to prove, if a syllable is not the elements, does it not necessarily <lb/>
            follow that it has not elements as parts of itself, or that, if <lb/>
            it is the same with them, it must be equally known with them ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. In order that this might not follow, did we not sup­ <lb/>
            pose it to be different from them ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? if the elements are not parts of a syl­ <lb/>
            lable, can you mention any other things that are parts of a <lb/>
            syllable, and yet not its elements ?</p>
          <p>147. Theæ. By no means ; for if, Socrates, I should admit <lb/>
            that it has parts, it would surely be ridiculous to reject the <lb/>
            elements and search for other things.</p>
          <p>Socr. From what you now say, therefore, Thesetetus, a <lb/>
            syllable must certainly be some one indivisible form.</p><pb n="449"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you remember then, my friend, tnat we admitted a <lb/>
            little before, and thought it was well said, that there cannot <lb/>
            be a definition of first elements, of which other things are com­ <lb/>
            posed, because each considered by itself is uncompounded, and <lb/>
            neither can the term " being" be correctly attributed to it nor <lb/>
            the term " this," because these things would be said as different <lb/>
            and foreign to it, and indeed this very cause makes it undefin­ <lb/>
            able and unknown.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. I do remember.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is there any other cause, then, than this of its being <lb/>
            simple and indivisible ? I for my part see no other.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. There does not appear to be any.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not the syllable, then, fall under the same class <lb/>
            as the elements, since it has not parts, and is one form ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>148. Socr. If, therefore, a syllable is many elements, and a <lb/>
            whole, and these are its parts, syllables and elements may be <lb/>
            equally known and defined, since all the parts have been <lb/>
            found to be the same as the whole.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. But if it is one and indivisible, a syllable equally as <lb/>
            an element must be undefinable and unknown ; for the same <lb/>
            cause will make them alike.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I cannot say otherwise..</p>
          <p>Socr. We must not, therefore, allow this, if any one should <lb/>
            say, that a syllable is known and definable, but an element the <lb/>
            contrary.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We must not, if we admit this reasoning.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? should you pay any more attention to <lb/>
            one who should assert the contrary of what you are conscious <lb/>
            happened to yourself in learning your letters ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That in learning you did nothing else than endeavour <lb/>
            to distinguish the elements both by sight and hearing, each <lb/>
            separated by itself, in order that their position when pronounced <lb/>
            or written, might not confuse you.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. You say most truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And at your music-master's was learning perfectly <lb/>
            any thing else than the being able to follow each note, and <note type="footnote"> G g </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            distinguish to what chord it belonged, which every one would <lb/>
            allow is called the elements of music.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>149. Socr. If, therefore, we may conjecture from the ele­ <lb/>
            ments and syllables in which we are skilled, to others, we shall <lb/>
            say that the class of elements are capable of a much more <lb/>
            clear and distinct knowledge than that of syllables, in order to <lb/>
            our acquiring each study in perfection; and if any one should <lb/>
            say that a syllable is known, but that an element is by nature <lb/>
            unknown, we shall think that he is jesting either intentionally <lb/>
            or unintentionally.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Moreover, other proofs of this might still be found, <lb/>
            as it appears tome ; but let us not lose sight of the question <lb/>
            before us by considering them, that is to say. what is meant by <lb/>
            the statement, that reason united to true judgment is the most <lb/>
            perfect science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. This, then, we must consider.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come then, what is the signification of the word <lb/>
            logos*: for it appears to me to mean one of three things.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Socr. The first would be to make one's thought clear by the <lb/>
            voice, through the means of verbs and nouns, impressing one's <lb/>
            judgment on what flows from the mouth, as it were on a <lb/>
            mirror, or water ; does not logos appear to you to be something <lb/>
            of this kind ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It does : and we say that he who does this speaks.</p>
          <p>150. Socr. Every one, therefore, is able to do this more <lb/>
            quickly or slowly, that is, can shew what be thinks about <lb/>
            every thing, unless he is altogether dumb or deaf, and thus <lb/>
            all who form right judgments on any matter, will be found to <lb/>
            do so in conjunction with logos, and right judgment will never <lb/>
            subsist without science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. We must not, therefore, too readily condemn him <lb/>
            as having spoken nothing to the purpose, who asserted that <lb/>
            science is that which we are now examining. For perhaps he <note type="footnote"> 2 As no one English word will express the three different meanings <lb/>
            contained in the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>, I have thought it better to retain the original <lb/>
            word throughout this part of the argument. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            who said it did not mean that, but that a person, when asked <lb/>
            what each thing is, should be able to give an answer to the <lb/>
            questioner by means of each thing's element.</p>
          <p>Theæ. For instance, how do you mean, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. As Hesiod for instance says of a chariot, that it is <lb/>
            made of a hundred pieces of wood, which I, for my part, could <lb/>
            not enumerate, neither do I think could you, but we should be <lb/>
            contented, if when asked what a chariot is, we could say <lb/>
            wheels, axle, frame, rails, and yoke.</p>
          <p>151. Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But he probably would think us ridiculous, just as if <lb/>
            we, when asked concerning your name and having answered <lb/>
            syllable by syllable, thereby judging and saying correctly what <lb/>
            we do say, should think ourselves grammarians, and that <lb/>
            we know and speak grammatically the definition of the name of <lb/>
            Theaetetus; whereas it is not possible to say any thing scien­ <lb/>
            tifically, before one has given a complete account of each <lb/>
            thing by means of its elements, together with true judgment, <lb/>
            as was observed before, if I mistake not.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It was observed.</p>
          <p>Socr. So, too, we have a correct judgment respecting a <lb/>
            chariot, but he who is able to describe its nature by means of <lb/>
            those hundred pieces, by adding this, both adds logos to true <lb/>
            judgment, and instead of forming a mere judgment becomes an <lb/>
            artist and knowing in the nature of a chariot, in that he gives <lb/>
            a complete account of the whole, by means of its elements.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Does not this appear to you, Socrates, to be well <lb/>
            said ?</p>
          <p>Socr. If it appears to you, my friend, and you allow that the <lb/>
            description of each thing by its element is logos, and that that <lb/>
            made by syllables, or even larger parts is devoid of logos, tell <lb/>
            me, that we may examine it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I certainly do allow it.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whether do you think that any one has a scientific <lb/>
            knowledge of any thing, when the same thing appears to him <lb/>
            at one time to belong to the same thing and at another to a <lb/>
            different thing, or when he forms at one time one judgment <lb/>
            and at another a different judgment about the same thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By Jupiter, not I.</p>
          <p>152. Socr. Have you forgotten then, that in learning your <lb/>
            letters at first both you and others did this ?</p><pb n="452"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. Do you mean that we thought that at one time one <lb/>
            letter, and at another time another, belonged to the same <lb/>
            syllable, and that we placed the same letter at one time to its <lb/>
            proper syllable, and at another time to another ?</p>
          <p>Soer. I do mean that.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By Jupiter, I do not forget, nor do I think that they <lb/>
            have knowledge who are in this condition.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? when a person at that time of life writing <lb/>
            the name Thesetetus, thinks that he ought to write and does <lb/>
            write Th and e, and again attempting to write Theodorus, <lb/>
            thinks that he ought to write and does write T and e, shall we <lb/>
            say that he knows the first syllable of your names ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We have just now admitted, that a person in this <lb/>
            condition does not yet know..</p>
          <p>Socr. Does, any thing, then, hinder the same person from <lb/>
            being in this condition with respect to the second, third, and <lb/>
            fourth syllable ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing.</p>
          <p>153. Socr. Will he not then have the description by means <lb/>
            of the elements, and write Theætetus with correct judgment, <lb/>
            when he writes it in its proper order ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Clearly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Will he not still be void of science, though he judges <lb/>
            correctly, as we said?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And yet he has logos together with correct judgment; <lb/>
            for he wrote it knowing the order of the elements, which we <lb/>
            allowed to be logos.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Socr. There is, therefore, my friend, correct judgment ac­ <lb/>
            companied with logos which must not yet be called science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. We have been enriched then, as it appears, in a dream, <lb/>
            in thinking that we possess the truest definition of science : or <lb/>
            shall we not condemn it yet? For perhaps some one may not <lb/>
            define logos in this manner, but may consider it to be the remain­ <lb/>
            ing species of the three, one of which we said would be adopted <lb/>
            by him who defined science to be correct judgment accom­ <lb/>
            panied with logos.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You have rightly reminded me; for there is still one <lb/>
            left. For the first was an image of the thought as it were ex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            pressed by the voice: and that just now mentioned was a pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding to the whole by means of the elements: but what do <lb/>
            you say the third is?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which most men would say it is, the being able <lb/>
            to mention some mark by which the object of enquiry differs <lb/>
            from all other things.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Can you give me a logos of any thing by way of <lb/>
            example ?</p>
          <p>154. Socr. For instance, if you please, with respect to the <lb/>
            sun, I think it would be sufficient for you to admit, that it is <lb/>
            the most luminous of the heavenly bodies that move round the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Observe then why this was said. It is that which we <lb/>
            just now mentioned, that when you find the difference of each <lb/>
            thing, by which it differs from all others, you will find, as some <lb/>
            say, the logos; but as long as you lay hold of some common <lb/>
            quality, you will have the logos of those things to which this <lb/>
            common quality belongs.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I understand; and it appears to me very proper to <lb/>
            call such a thing logos.</p>
          <p>Socr. He, therefore, who together with correct judgment <lb/>
            respecting any thing whatever can find out its difference from <lb/>
            all other things, will have arrived at the knowledge of that of <lb/>
            which he before only formed a judgment.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We say it certainly is so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now, however, Thesetetus, since I have come near <lb/>
            what has been said, as if it were a picture in perspective, I find <lb/>
            that I do not understand it in the least, but while I stood at a <lb/>
            distance it appeared to me to have some meaning.</p>
          <p>155. Theæ. How is this?</p>
          <p>Socr. I will tell you, if I can. If; when I have a correct <lb/>
            judgment respecting you, I likewise find your logos, then I <lb/>
            know you, but if not, I only form a judgment.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But logos was the explanation of your difference.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It was. I</p>
          <p>Socr. When, therefore, I formed a judgment only, is it not <lb/>
            true that I reached by my thought none of those things by <lb/>
            which you differ from others ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems that you did not.</p><pb n="454"/>
            
          <p>Socr. I, therefore, thought of some common qualities, none <lb/>
            of which belong to you more than to any one else.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Come, then, by Jupiter, how in such a case did I form <lb/>
            a judgment of you rather than of any one else ? For suppose <lb/>
            me to be thinking that this is Thesetetus, who is a man, and <lb/>
            has nose, eyes, a mouth, and so on with each several member. <lb/>
            Will this thought cause me to think of Theætetus rather than <lb/>
            of Theodorus, or, as the saying is, the last of the Mysians ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How should it ?</p>
          <p>156. Socr. But if I not only think of one who has nose and <lb/>
            eyes, but also of one who has a snub nose and prominent eves, <lb/>
            shall I in that case think of you rather than of myself, or any <lb/>
            other persons of that description ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Not at all.</p>
          <p>Socr. But I think I shall not form the image of Theæte­ <lb/>
            tus in my mind, until his snubbiness shall have impressed on <lb/>
            me and left with me some mark different from all other in­ <lb/>
            stances of snubbiness that I have seen, and so with respect to <lb/>
            the other parts of which you are made up ; which, if I should <lb/>
            meet you to-morrow, would recal you to my mind, and make <lb/>
            me form a correct judgment respecting you.</p>
          <p>Theo. Most true.</p>
          <p>Socr. Right judgment, therefore, respecting each object has <lb/>
            to do with difference.</p>
          <p>Them. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then will become of adding logos to correct <lb/>
            judgment ? For if it means that we should moreover form a <lb/>
            judgment of the manner in which any thing differs from others, <lb/>
            the injunction will be very ridiculous.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Socr. It bids us add a right judgment of the manner in <lb/>
            which things differ from others, when we have a right judg­ <lb/>
            ment of the manner in which they differ from others. And <lb/>
            thus the turning round of a scytala, or a pestle, or any other <lb/>
            proverb of the kind, would be nothing compared with this in­ <lb/>
            junction, though it might more properly be called the advice <lb/>
            of a blind man ; for to bid us add those things that we already <lb/>
            have, in order that we may learn what we already have formed <lb/>
            judgments about, seems remarkably suited to one who is ut­ <lb/>
            terly blind.</p><pb n="455"/>
            
          <p>Theæ. Tell me, then, what did you mean by asking me just <lb/>
            now ?</p>
          <p>157. Socr. If, 0 boy, in bidding us add logos it bids us <lb/>
            know, but not form a judgment of the difference, this most <lb/>
            beautiful of all the definitions of science would be a delightful <lb/>
            thing: for to know, surely, is to acquire science. Is it not ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. When asked, therefore, as it appears, what science is, <lb/>
            he will answer, that it is correct judgment with the science of <lb/>
            difference. For, according to him, this will be the addition of <lb/>
            logos.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is altogether foolish, when we are searching for <lb/>
            science, to say that it is correct judgment with science, either <lb/>
            of difference or any thing else. Neither perception, therefore, <lb/>
            Theætetus, nor true judgment, nor logos united with true <lb/>
            judgment, can be science.</p>
          <p>Thece. It seems not.</p>
          <p>Socr. Are we, then, still pregnant and in labour, my friend, <lb/>
            with reference to science, or have we brought forth every <lb/>
            thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. And by Jupiter, with your help, I have said more than <lb/>
            I had in myself.</p>
          <p>Socr. Does not, then, our midwife's art pronounce that all <lb/>
            these things are empty, and not worth rearing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>158. Socr. If, therefore, after this you should wish to be­ <lb/>
            come pregnant with other things, Theætetus, and if you do <lb/>
            become so, you will be full of better things by means of the <lb/>
            present discussion; but if you should be empty, you will be <lb/>
            less troublesome to your companions, and more meek through <lb/>
            modesty, in not thinking that you know what you do not <lb/>
            know. For thus much only my art is able to accomplish, but <lb/>
            nothing more, nor do I know any of the things which others <lb/>
            do who are and have been great and wonderful men. But this <lb/>
            midwife's art I and my mother received from the deity; she <lb/>
            about women, and I for young and noble men and such as are <lb/>
            beautiful. Now, however, I must go to the king's porch, to <lb/>
            answer the indictment which Melitus has preferred against <lb/>
            me: to-morrow, Theodorus, let us meet here again.</p>

            on. He is surprised at seeing Socrates at such a spot, for he <lb/>
            cannot believe that he has a cause pending there. Socrates <lb/>
            tells him that he is indicted by one Melitus, a person of no <lb/>
            note at Athens, but one who knows how to govern the city <lb/>
            rightly, for that he charges Socrates with impiety in introduc­ <lb/>
            in- new gods and corrupting the youth. Socrates then asks <lb/>
            Euthyphron whether he too has a cause in the same court, and <lb/>
            is informed that he has indicted his own father for murder, <lb/>
            because he had occasioned the death of one of their hired ser­ <lb/>
            vants, who had himself first slain a slave of Euthyphron's <lb/>
            father, and then been cast bound into a ditch, where he died <lb/>
            from hunger and cold. On hearing this, Socrates asks whe­ <lb/>
            ther he has such a perfect knowledge of holiness and impiety <lb/>
            that he is sure he is right in bringing his father to trial; and <lb/>
            on Euthyphron's asserting that he has, Socrates begs that he <lb/>
            will accept him for his disciple, in order that he may learn how <lb/>
            to clear himself in his own approaching trial, and first of all <lb/>
            desires to know what holiness and impiety are. Euthyphron <lb/>
            confidently answers that what he is now doing is holy, namely, <lb/>
            to prosecute any one who acts unjustly, whoever he may be, <lb/>
            but that not to prosecute such an one is impious. Socrates, <lb/>
            however, is not satisfied with this answer, for that he did not <lb/>
            ask about particular actions, but about holiness in the abstract. <lb/>
            " That, then, which is pleasing to the gods is holy," says Eu­ <lb/>
            thyphron. But Socrates shews that different things are pleas­ <lb/>
            ing to different gods, so that the same things are both loved <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            and hated by divers of them, whence it follows that the same <lb/>
            things are both holy and unholy.</p>
          <p>Euthyphron, feeling the force of this objection, next says <lb/>
            that the holy is that which all the gods love, and the impious <lb/>
            that which they all hate : but here again Socrates shews that <lb/>
            this cannot be a correct definition of holiness, for that it is not <lb/>
            holy because they love it, but they love it because it is holy. <lb/>
            To help him out of his difficulty, Socrates suggests that holi­ <lb/>
            ness is a part of justice; to which Euthyphron assents, and <lb/>
            adds that it is that part of it which is concerned about our <lb/>
            care for the gods. But, asks Socrates, what care for the gods <lb/>
            will holiness be ? A kind of service paid to them, is the an­ <lb/>
            swer. But to what end do our services of the gods avail ? <lb/>
            Euthyphron evades the question by saying they are many and <lb/>
            beautiful; but when further pressed, he says that holiness con­ <lb/>
            sists in sacrificing and praying to the gods, wherein, he is led <lb/>
            to admit, men beg those things that they need, and sacrifice <lb/>
            such things as the gods need, from whence Socrates concludes <lb/>
            that holiness is a kind of traffic between gods and men. But <lb/>
            it is clear that the gods cannot be benefited by men; there­ <lb/>
            fore, as Euthyphron says, it must be that which is most dear. <lb/>
            But this definition of holiness had been already rejected. So­ <lb/>
            crates, therefore, proposes to renew the enquiry, but Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron, finding himself defeated at all points, suddenly breaks <lb/>
            off the discussion, on pretence of business elsewhere.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Euth. WHAT new thing has happened, Socrates, that you <lb/>
            have left your haunts in the Lyceum, and are now waiting <lb/>
            about the king's porch ! You surely have not a trial before the <lb/>
            king as I have.</p>
          <p>Socr. The Athenians, Euthyphron, do not call it a trial, but <lb/>
            an indictment.</p>
          <p>Bath. What say you! Some one, it seems, has preferred <lb/>
            an indictment against you, for I cannot believe that you have <lb/>
            indicted any one else.</p>
          <p>Socr. Surely not.</p>
          <p>Euth. Has some one else, then, indicted you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Euth. Who is he ?</p>
          <p>Socr. I do not myself very well know the man, Euthyphron ; <lb/>
            for he appears to me to be young and unknown; however they <lb/>
            call him Melitus, I think; and he is of the borough of Pithos, <lb/>
            if you know any Melitus of Pithos, who has lank hair, a thin <lb/>
            beard, and a hook nose.</p>
          <p>Euth. I don't know him, Socrates, but what indictment has <lb/>
            he preferred against you ?</p>
          <p>Socr. What ? One not unworthy of a high-minded man, as <lb/>
            it appears to me; for it is no contemptible matter for one who <lb/>
            is so young, to be versed in so weighty a business. For he <lb/>
            knows, as he says, how the youth are corrupted, and who they <lb/>
            are that corrupt them. And he appears to be a shrewd man, and, <lb/>
            observing my ignorance, he comes before the city, as before a <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            mother, to accuse me of corrupting those of the same age with <lb/>
            himself. And he appears to me to be the only one of our <lb/>
            statesmen who knows how to govern rightly; for it is right <lb/>
            first of all to pay attention to the young, that they may be­ <lb/>
            come as virtuous as possible, just as it is proper for a good <lb/>
            husbandman first of all to pay attention to the young plants, <lb/>
            and afterwards the others: so Melitus probably first purges <lb/>
            us who corrupt the blossoms of youth, as he says; then after <lb/>
            this it is clear that by paying attention to the older men, he <lb/>
            will be the cause of very many and great blessings to the city, <lb/>
            as may be expected to happen from one who makes such a <lb/>
            beginning.</p>
          <p>2. Euth. I wish it were so, Socrates; but I dread lest the <lb/>
            contrary should happen. For, in reality, he appears to me, in <lb/>
            attempting to injure you, to begin by assailing the city from <lb/>
            the hearth. But tell me, by doing what does he say that you <lb/>
            corrupt the youth?</p>
          <p>Socr. Absurd even to hear mentioned, my admirable friend: <lb/>
            for he says that I am a maker of gods, and, as if I made new <lb/>
            gods and did not believe in the ancient ones, he has indicted <lb/>
            me on their account, as he says.</p>
          <p>Euth. I understand, Socrates, it is because you say that a <lb/>
            demon constantly attends you. As if, then, you introduced <lb/>
            innovations in religion he has preferred this indictment against <lb/>
            you, and he comes to accuse you before the court, knowing <lb/>
            that such charges are readily entertained by the multitude. <lb/>
            And me too, when I say any thing in the public assembly <lb/>
            concerning divine things, and predict to them what is going to <lb/>
            happen, they ridicule as mad; and although nothing that I <lb/>
            have predicted has not turned out to be true, yet they envy <lb/>
            all such men as we are. However we ought not to heed them, <lb/>
            but pursue our own course.</p>
          <p>3. Socr. But, my dear Euthyphron, to be laughed at is per­ <lb/>
            haps of no consequence. For the Athenians, as it appears to <lb/>
            me, do not care very much whether they think a man is clever, <lb/>
            so long as he does not communicate his wisdom; but when <lb/>
            they think a man makes others so, they are angry, either <lb/>
            through envy, as you say, or from some other cause.</p>
          <p>Euth. With respect to that matter, how they are affected <lb/>
            towards me I am not very anxious to try.</p>
          <p>Socr. For perhaps you seem to shew yourself but rarely, and <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            to be unwilling to impart your wisdom ; but I am afraid that, <lb/>
            from my love of mankind, I appear to them to tell every man <lb/>
            too freely whatever I know, not only without pay, but even <lb/>
            gladly offering myself, if any one is willing to listen to me. If <lb/>
            then, as I just now said, they were going to laugh at me, as <lb/>
            you say they do at you, there would be nothing, unpleasant in <lb/>
            passing some time in a court of justice, jesting and laughing ;</p>
          <p>• but if they are in earnest, how this affair may terminate is un­ <lb/>
            known, except to you prophets.</p>
          <p>Euth. Perhaps, however, it will be of no consequence, So­ <lb/>
            crates, but you will conduct your cause to your mind, as I <lb/>
            think I shall mine.</p>
          <p>4. Socr. Have you too a cause, Euthyphron ? Do you de­ <lb/>
            fend it, or prosecute ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I prosecute.</p>
          <p>Socr. Whom?</p>
          <p>Euth. One, in prosecuting whom, I seem to be mad.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? do you prosecute some one that can fly ?</p>
          <p>Euth. He is very far from being able to fly, for he happens <lb/>
            to be very old.</p>
          <p>Socr. Who is he ?</p>
          <p>Euth. My father.</p>
          <p>Socr. Your father, my excellent friend ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what is the charge, and what is the trial about ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Murder, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. By Hercules! Surely, Euthyphron, the generality of <lb/>
            men are ignorant how this can ever be right. For I do not <lb/>
            think any common person could do this properly, but he must <lb/>
            be very far advanced in wisdom.</p>
          <p>Euth. Far indeed, by Jupiter, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it any one of your relations who has been killed by <lb/>
            your father ? It must be so; for surely you would not prose­ <lb/>
            cute him for the murder of a stranger.</p>
          <p>ESth. Ridiculous, Socrates, to think that it makes any dif­ <lb/>
            ference whether the person killed is a stranger or a relation, <lb/>
            and that we ought not to consider this only, whether he killed <lb/>
            him justly or not, and, if justly, let him go, but if not, prosecute <lb/>
            him, even though the murderer should live at the same hearth <lb/>
            and the same table with you. For the pollution is equal, if you <lb/>
            knowingly associate with such a one, and do not purify both <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            yourself and him by bringing him to justice. However, the <lb/>
            deceased was a dependant of our's, and when we were farming <lb/>
            at Naxos, he worked there for us, for hire. This man, then, <lb/>
            having drunk too much wine and being in a passion with one <lb/>
            of our slaves, slew him. My father, therefore, having bound <lb/>
            his hands and feet, and thrown him into a pit, sends a man here <lb/>
            to enquire of the interpreter of religious matters, what he ought <lb/>
            to do with him ; and in the mean time he neglected the prisoner, <lb/>
            and took no care of him as being a murderer, and as if it was <lb/>
            of no consequence if he died ; which did happen. For he died <lb/>
            from hunger, cold, and the chains, before the messenger re­ <lb/>
            turned from the interpreter. For this reason my father and all <lb/>
            my relatives are angry with me, because I, for the sake of a <lb/>
            murderer, accuse my father of murder, who, as they say, did <lb/>
            not kill him, and even if be had killed him, as the deceased was <lb/>
            a murderer, they say that I ought not to concern myself about <lb/>
            such a man; for that it is impious for a son to prosecute his <lb/>
            father for murder; little knowing, Socrates, what the divine <lb/>
            rule is with respect to holiness and impiety.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, by Jupiter, Euthyphron, do you think you have <lb/>
            such an accurate knowledge of divine things, how they are cir­ <lb/>
            cumstanced, with respect both to things holy and impious, <lb/>
            that those things having been done as you say, you are-not <lb/>
            afraid, in bringing your father to trial, lest you should commit <lb/>
            an impious action?</p>
          <p>Euth. I should be a sorry person, Socrates, nor would <lb/>
            Euthyphron in any respect excel the generality of men, if I did <lb/>
            not know all such things accurately.</p>
          <p>5. Socr. Admirable Euthyphron, it will be a most excellent <lb/>
            thing for me to become your disciple, and, before Melitus's <lb/>
            indictment comes on for hearing, to object this very thing to <lb/>
            him, saying, that I hitherto deemed it of the utmost conse­ <lb/>
            quence to be acquainted with divine things, and that now, <lb/>
            since he says I am guilty of acting rashly, and introducing <lb/>
            innovations with respect to divine things, I have become your <lb/>
            disciple. If then, I should say, Melitus, you admit that Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron is wise in such matters and thinks rightly, suppose that I <lb/>
            do so too, and do not bring me to trial; but if otherwise, call <lb/>
            him, the teacher, to account before you do me, as one who <lb/>
            corrupts the elders, both me and his father, me by teaching <lb/>
            me, and him by admonishing and punishing him: and if he is <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            not persuaded by me and does not let me off the trial, or <lb/>
            indict you instead of me, it will be necessary to say these <lb/>
            very things in the court, which I have already objected to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Euth. By Jupiter, Socrates, if he should attempt to indict <lb/>
            me, I should find, I think, his weak side, and we should <lb/>
            much sooner have a discussion in the court about him than <lb/>
            about me.</p>
          <p>Socr. And I, my dear friend, knowing this, am anxious to <lb/>
            become your disciple, being persuaded that some others and <lb/>
            this Melitus do not appear even to see you, though he <lb/>
            has so very keenly and easily seen through me, as to indict <lb/>
            'me for impiety. 6. Now therefore, by Jupiter, tell me what <lb/>
            you just now asserted you know so well; what do you say is <lb/>
            piety and impiety, both with respect to murder and other <lb/>
            things ? Is not holiness itself the same with itself in every <lb/>
            action, and again, is not impiety, which is contrary to all holi­ <lb/>
            ness, in every case similar to itself, and has not every thing <lb/>
            that is impious some one character with respect to impiety ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Most assuredly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me, then, what you say holiness is, and what <lb/>
            impiety ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I say, then, that that is holy which I am now doing, <lb/>
            to prosecute any one who acts unjustly either with respect to <lb/>
            murder or sacrilege, or who commits any similar offence, <lb/>
            whether he be one's father or mother, or whoever else he may <lb/>
            be, but not to prosecute him is impious. For observe, Socrates, <lb/>
            what a great proof I will give you that the law is so, as I have <lb/>
            also said to others, shewing that it is rightly done, when one <lb/>
            does not spare one who acts impiously, whoever he may be. <lb/>
            For all men believe that Jupiter is the best and most just of <lb/>
            the gods, and yet they admit that he put his own father in <lb/>
            -chains, because he unjustly swallowed his children, and again, <lb/>
            that he mutilated his father for other similar reasons, but they <lb/>
            are indignant with me, because I prosecute my father for <lb/>
            having acted unjustly, and thus these men contradict them­ <lb/>
            selves with respect to the gods and me.</p>
          <p>Boer. Is this the reason then, Euthyphron, for which I am <lb/>
            defendant in this indictment, because when any one says things <lb/>
            of this kind respecting the gods, I admit them with difficulty ? <lb/>
            on which account, as it seems, some one will say that I am <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            guilty. Now, therefore, if these things appear so to you like­ <lb/>
            wise, who are well versed in such matters, we must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity, as it seems, agree with you. For what else can we say, <lb/>
            who acknowledge that we know nothing about these things ? <lb/>
            But tell me, by Jupiter, who presides over friendship, do you <lb/>
            think that these things did really happen so ?</p>
          <p>jEth. And things still more wonderful than these, Socrates, <lb/>
            which the multitude are unacquainted with.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you then think that there is in reality war among <lb/>
            the gods one with another, and fierce enmities and battles, and <lb/>
            many other things of the kind such as are related by the poets, <lb/>
            and with representations of which by good painters both other <lb/>
            sacred places have been decorated, and moreover in the great <lb/>
            Panathenaic festival a veil full of such representations is car­ <lb/>
            ried into the Acropolis. Must we say that these things are <lb/>
            true, Euthyphron ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Not these only, Socrates; but, as I just now said, I <lb/>
            can, if you please, relate to you many other things respecting <lb/>
            divine affairs, which I am sure you will be astonished to hear.</p>
          <p>7. Socr. I should not wonder; but you shall relate these <lb/>
            things to me hereafter, at our leisure. Now, however, endea­ <lb/>
            vour to explain to me more clearly what I just now asked you. <lb/>
            For you have not yet, my friend, sufficiently answered my <lb/>
            question as to holiness what it is, but you have told me that <lb/>
            what you are now doing is holy, prosecuting your father for <lb/>
            murder.</p>
          <p>Euth. And I said the truth, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Perhaps so. But, Euthyphron, you may also say that <lb/>
            many other things are holy.</p>
          <p>Euth. For such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you remember, then, that I did not beg this of <lb/>
            you, to teach me some one or two from among many holy <lb/>
            things, but the particular character itself by which all holy <lb/>
            things are holy ? For you surely said that unholy things are <lb/>
            unholy, and holy things holy, from one character: do you not <lb/>
            remember ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Teach me, then, this very character, what it is, in <lb/>
            order that looking to it, and using it as a model, I may say <lb/>
            that such a thing of all that you or any one else does is holy, <lb/>
            and that what is not such is not holy.</p><pb n="464"/>
            
          <p>jEth. But if you wish it, Socrates, I will also tell you this.</p>
          <p>Socr. I do indeed wish it.</p>
          <p>jEth. That, then, which is pleasing to the gods is holy, and <lb/>
            that which is not pleasing to them is impious ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Admirably, Euthyphron, you have answered just as I <lb/>
            begged you to answer. Whether truly, however, I do not yet <lb/>
            know, but you will doubtless convince me that what you say is <lb/>
            true.</p>
          <p>Eut. Certainly.</p>
          <p>8. Socr. Come then, let us consider what we say. A thing <lb/>
            that is pleasing to the gods, and a man who is pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods, are holy; but a thing that is hateful to the gods, and a <lb/>
            man that is hateful to the gods, are impious ; but the holy is <lb/>
            not the same with the unholy, but most contrary to it: is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And this appears to have been well said.</p>
          <p>Euth. I think so, Socrates; for it has been said.</p>
          <p>Socr. And that the gods quarrel, Euthyphron, and are at <lb/>
            variance with each other, and that there are enmities amongst <lb/>
            them one towards another : has not this also been said ?</p>
          <p>Euth. It has.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, my excellent friend, variance about what occa­ <lb/>
            sions enmity and anger ? Let us consider it thus. If you and <lb/>
            I differed about numbers, which of two was the greater, would <lb/>
            a difference on this point make us enemies and angry with <lb/>
            each other, or having recourse to computation, should we soon <lb/>
            be freed from such dissension ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And if we differed about the greater and the less, <lb/>
            by having recourse to measuring should we not soon put an <lb/>
            end to our difference ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Socr. And by having recourse to weighing, as I think, we <lb/>
            should be able to decide respecting the heavier and the lighter ?</p>
          <p>jEth. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. About what then disagreeing and in what being un­ <lb/>
            able to come to a decision, do we become enemies to, and <lb/>
            angry with, each other ? Perhaps you cannot readily answer, <lb/>
            but consider when I say whether they are these, the just and <lb/>
            the unjust, the beautiful and the base, the good and the evil. <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            Are not these the things about which disagreeing, and not being <lb/>
            able to arrive at a satisfactory decision respecting them, we <lb/>
            become enemies to each other when we do become so, both <lb/>
            you and I, and all other men ?</p>
          <p>Euth. This, indeed, is difference itself, Socrates, and it is <lb/>
            about these things.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? If the gods, Euthyphron, differ at all, <lb/>
            must they not differ about these very things ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Most necessarily.</p>
          <p>Socr. According to your account, then, noble Euthyphron, <lb/>
            different gods think different things just, and beautiful and <lb/>
            base, and good and evil. For surely they could not quarrel <lb/>
            with each other if they did not differ about these things; is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>Euth. You say rightly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do they not severally, then, love the things which <lb/>
            they consider beautiful and good and just, and hate their con­ <lb/>
            traries ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And these same things, as you admit, some consider <lb/>
            to be just, and others unjust; disputing about which they <lb/>
            quarrel and make war on each other; is it not so ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. The same things, therefore, as it seems, are both hated <lb/>
            and loved by the gods, and these are both hateful to the gods <lb/>
            and pleasing to the gods.</p>
          <p>Euth. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. From this reasoning also the same things must be <lb/>
            holy and unholy, Euthyphron ?</p>
          <p>Euth. It appears so.</p>
          <p>9. Socr. You have not, therefore, answered my question, <lb/>
            my admirable friend: for I did not ask you this, what is at <lb/>
            the same time both holy and impious; but what is pleasing to <lb/>
            the gods is also hateful to the gods, as it seems. 'So that, Eu­ <lb/>
            thyphron, in punishing your father, as you are now doing, it is <lb/>
            not at all wonderful if in doing this you do what is pleasing to <lb/>
            Jupiter, but odious to Saturn and Heaven, and what is pleas­ <lb/>
            ing to Vulcan, but odious to Juno; and if any other of the <lb/>
            gods differs from another on this point, to them also in like <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>jEth. But I think, Socrates, that no one of the gods will <note type="footnote"> Hh </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            differ from another about this, and say that he ought not to be <lb/>
            punished who has slain any one unjustly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what? Have you ever heard any man doubting, <lb/>
            Euthyphron, whether he who has slain another unjustly, or has <lb/>
            committed any other injustice, ought to be punished ?</p>
          <p>Euth. They never cease doubting about these things, both <lb/>
            elsewhere and in courts of justice. For they who commit very <lb/>
            many acts of injustice say and do every thing in their power to <lb/>
            escape punishment.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do they also confess, Euthyphron, that they have <lb/>
            acted unjustly, and confessing, do they nevertheless say that <lb/>
            they ought not to be punished ?</p>
          <p>Euth. They by no means say this.</p>
          <p>Socr. They do not, therefore, do and say every thing in <lb/>
            their power. For I think they dare not say nor doubt this, <lb/>
            that if they act unjustly they ought to suffer punishment; but, <lb/>
            I think, they deny that they have acted unjustly: is it not so ?</p>
          <p>ESth. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. They do not, therefore, doubt this, whether he who <lb/>
            acts unjustly ought to be punished; but this, perhaps, they <lb/>
            doubt, who has acted unjustly, and by doing what, and when.</p>
          <p>Euth. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do not, then, the very same things happen to the <lb/>
            gods if they quarrel about things just and unjust, according to <lb/>
            your statement, and do not some say that they act unjustly to­ <lb/>
            wards each other, and others again deny it? For surely, my <lb/>
            admirable friend, no one, either of gods or men, dare maintain <lb/>
            this, that he who acts unjustly ought not to suffer punishment.</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes, and what you say is true, Socrates, at least in <lb/>
            general.</p>
          <p>Socr. But they who doubt, Euthyphron, doubt, I think, <lb/>
            about each particular that has been done, both men and gods, <lb/>
            if the gods do doubt: and when they differ about any action, <lb/>
            some say that it has been done justly, and others unjustly: is <lb/>
            it not so ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>10. Socr. Come then, my dear Euthyphron, teach me too, <lb/>
            that I may become wiser, what proof you have that all the gods <lb/>
            think he died unjustly, who serving for wages and having com­ <lb/>
            mitted homicide, and being put in chains by the master of the <lb/>
            deceased, died in his fetters before he that put him in chains <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            received an answer respecting him from the interpreters, as to <lb/>
            what he ought to do; and that for such a cause it is right for <lb/>
            a son to prosecute and demand judgment against his father. <lb/>
            Come, endeavour to make it clear to me, with respect to this, <lb/>
            that all the gods without exception consider this action to be <lb/>
            right. And if you make this sufficiently clear, I will never <lb/>
            cease extolling you for your wisdom.</p>
          <p>Euth. But perhaps this is no trifling matter, Socrates; <lb/>
            though I could prove it to you very plainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. I understand you; I appear to you to be more dull of <lb/>
            apprehension than the judges; for it is evident that you will <lb/>
            prove to them that it was unjust, and that all the gods hate <lb/>
            such actions.</p>
          <p>Euth. Very plainly, Socrates, if only they will hear what I <lb/>
            have to say.</p>
          <p>11. Socr. But they will hear you, if only you shall appear to <lb/>
            speak well. However, while you were speaking, I made this <lb/>
            reflexion, and considered within myself: if Euthyphron should <lb/>
            certainly convince me that all the gods think such a death to <lb/>
            be unjust, what more shall I have learnt from Euthyphron as <lb/>
            to what is holy, and what impious ? For this action, as it <lb/>
            seems, would be hateful to the gods. Yet what was lately de­ <lb/>
            fined has not appeared from this, namely what is holy, and <lb/>
            what not: for that which is hateful to some gods appeared also <lb/>
            to be pleasing to others. So that I grant you this, Euthyphron, <lb/>
            and if you please let all the gods think it unjust, and let them <lb/>
            all hate it. Shall we, then, make this correction in the defini­ <lb/>
            tion, and say, that what all the gods hate is impious, and what <lb/>
            they love is holy ; but that what some love, and others hate, is <lb/>
            neither, or both ? Are you willing that we should give this <lb/>
            definition of the holy and the impious ?</p>
          <p>Euth. What hinders, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Nothing hinders me, Euthyphron; but do you, for <lb/>
            your part, consider whether, assuming this, you can thus easily <lb/>
            teach me what you promised ?</p>
          <p>Euth. But I should say that the holy is that which all the <lb/>
            gods love, and the contrary, the impious, that which all the <lb/>
            gods hate.</p>
          <p>Socr. Shall we examine this, then, Euthyphron, whether it <lb/>
            is well said ? or shall we let it pass, and thus concede both to <lb/>
            ourselves and others, that if any one only says that any thing is <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            so, we shall allow that it is ? or must we examine what the <lb/>
            speaker says ?</p>
          <p>Euth. We must examine it: for my part, however, I think <lb/>
            that this is now well said.</p>
          <p>12. Socr. We shall soon, my good friend, know this more <lb/>
            clearly. For consider it in this way : Is the holy loved by the <lb/>
            gods because it is holy ; or is it holy, because it is loved ?</p>
          <p>.Eth. I don't understand what you mean, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. I will endeavour, then, to express myself more clearly. <lb/>
            We say that a thing is carried, and carries; that it is led, and <lb/>
            leads; that it is seen, and sees: and you understand that all <lb/>
            things of this kind are different from each other, and in what <lb/>
            they differ ?</p>
          <p>jEth. For my part, I seem to understand it.</p>
          <p>Soer. Is not, then, that which is beloved one thing, and that <lb/>
            which loves different from it ?</p>
          <p>Euth. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me, then, is that which is carried, carried because <lb/>
            one carries it, or for some other reason ?</p>
          <p>jEth. No, but for this.</p>
          <p>Socr. And that which is led, because one leads it, and that <lb/>
            which is seen, because one sees it ?</p>
          <p>jEth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. One does not therefore see a thing because it is seen, <lb/>
            but on the contrary it is seen because one sees it: nor does one <lb/>
            lead a thing because it is led, but it is led because one leads it: <lb/>
            nor does one carry a thing because it is carried, but it is car­ <lb/>
            ried because one carries it. Is my meaning clear, then, Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron ? I mean this, that if one does any thing, or suffers any <lb/>
            thing, one does it not because it is done; but it is done because <lb/>
            one does it; nor does one suffer any thing because it is suf­ <lb/>
            fered, but it is suffered because one suffers: do you not admit <lb/>
            this to be the case ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is not, then, the being loved, something either done <lb/>
            or suffered by some one ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. And is not the case the same with this as with all the <lb/>
            former instances; those who love it do not love it because it is <lb/>
            loved, but it is loved, because they love it ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Necessarily so.</p><pb n="469"/>
            
          <p>Socr. What then do we say respecting holiness, Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron? Do not all the gods love it according to your state­ <lb/>
            ment?</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is it for this reason, because it is holy, or for some <lb/>
            other reason ?</p>
          <p>.utA. No, but for this.</p>
          <p>Socr. They love it then because it is holy, but it is not holy <lb/>
            because they love it.</p>
          <p>Eut. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. Therefore because the gods love it it is beloved, and <lb/>
            that which is pleasing to the gods is pleasing to them.</p>
          <p>Euth. How not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. That which is pleasing to the gods, therefore, is not <lb/>
            holy, Euthyphron, nor is that holy which is pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods, as you say, but one is different from the other.</p>
          <p>Euth. How so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Because we agree that what is holy is therefore loved <lb/>
            because it is holy, and that it is not holy because they love it; <lb/>
            is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. But that which is pleasing to the gods because the <lb/>
            gods love it, is from the very circumstance of their loving it <lb/>
            pleasing to them; but they do not love it because it is pleasing <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>Euth. You say truly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But, my dear Euthyphron, if the being pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods and being holy were the same thing, since that which is <lb/>
            holy is loved because it is holy, that which is pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods would also be loved because it is pleasing to them; and <lb/>
            if that which is pleasing to the gods were pleasing to them <lb/>
            because they love it, that which is holy would also be holy <lb/>
            because they love it. Now, however, you see that they are <lb/>
            contrary, as being altogether different from each other. For <lb/>
            the one is such as is loved because they love it, but the other <lb/>
            is loved because it is of such a character that it ought to be <lb/>
            loved. And you appear, Euthyphron, when asked what holi­ <lb/>
            ness is, not to have been willing to make known to me its <lb/>
            essence, but to have mentioned an affection to which this same <lb/>
            holiness is subject, namely the being loved by all the gods; <lb/>
            but what it is, you have not yet told me. If therefore it is <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            agreeable to you, do not conceal it from me, but again say <lb/>
            from the beginning what holiness is, whether it is loved by <lb/>
            the gods, or is subject to any other affection: for we shall not <lb/>
            differ about this. But tell me frankly what the holy is and <lb/>
            what the impious.</p>
          <p>.utA. But, Socrates, I know not how to tell you what I <lb/>
            think. For whatever we put forward some how constantly <lb/>
            moves from its position, and will not remain where we have <lb/>
            placed it.</p>
          <p>Socr. What you have advanced, Euthyphron, appears to <lb/>
            resemble the statues of my ancestor Dædalus. And if I had <lb/>
            said and laid down these things, you would probably have joked <lb/>
            me, for that owing to my relationship to him, my works, by <lb/>
            way of discussion, escape, and will not remain where one places <lb/>
            them. But now, for the hypotheses are yours, there is need <lb/>
            of some other raillery. For they will not remain with you, as <lb/>
            you too perceive yourself.</p>
          <p>Euth. But it appears to me, Socrates, that what has been <lb/>
            said needs pretty much the same raillery. For I am not the <lb/>
            person who causes them to shift about in this way and not re­ <lb/>
            main in the same place, but you appear to me to be the <lb/>
            Dsedalus. For as far as I am concerned, they would have re­ <lb/>
            mained as they were.</p>
          <p>Socr. I appear, then, my friend, to have become much more <lb/>
            skilful than him in my art, in that he only made his own works <lb/>
            moveable, but I besides my own, as it seems, make those of <lb/>
            others so. And this, moreover, is the most wonderful thing in <lb/>
            my art, that I am skilful against any will. For I should wish <lb/>
            that my reasonings should remain and be immovably fixed, <lb/>
            rather than have the riches of Tantalus, in addition to the <lb/>
            skill of Dædalus. But enough of this. 13. Since, however, <lb/>
            you appear to be too nice, I will assist you to shew how <lb/>
            you may teach me respecting holiness, and not be tired be­ <lb/>
            fore you have done. For see, whether it does not appear to <lb/>
            you to be necessary that every thing that is holy should be <lb/>
            just.</p>
          <p>Euth. To me it does.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is, then, every thing that is just also holy, or is every <lb/>
            thing that is holy just, but not every thing that is just holy, <lb/>
            but partly holy, and partly something else ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do not follow your questions, Socrates.</p><pb n="471"/>
            
          <p>Socr. And yet you are younger no less than wiser than I <lb/>
            am; but, as I said, you are too delicate through abundance of <lb/>
            wisdom. However, my blessed friend, exert yourself; for it <lb/>
            is not difficult to understand what I mean. For I mean the <lb/>
            contrary to what the poet said, who wrote, " You are un­ <lb/>
            willing to mention Jove the creator who made this universe: <lb/>
            for where fear is there is also shame." I, however, differ from <lb/>
            this poet. Shall I tell you in what respect ?</p>
          <p>Euth. By all means.</p>
          <p>Socr. It does not appear to me, that where fear is there is <lb/>
            also shame. For there appear to me to be many who fearing <lb/>
            diseases, poverty, and many other things of the kind, fear in­ <lb/>
            deed but are by no means ashamed of what they fear. Does <lb/>
            it not appear so to you ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. But wherever shame is, there is also fear: for is <lb/>
            there any one who is ashamed of and blushes at any thing, <lb/>
            that is not afraid of and does not fear the reputation of <lb/>
            baseness ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Assuredly he does fear it.</p>
          <p>Socr. It is not right, therefore, to say, that where fear is, <lb/>
            there also is shame, but where shame is, there also is fear ; not <lb/>
            however, wherever there is fear, there is also shame. For I think <lb/>
            that fear-is more extensive than shame; for shame is a part <lb/>
            of fear, as the odd is a part of number, so that it does not <lb/>
            follow that wherever number is, there also is the odd, but <lb/>
            wherever the odd is, there also is number. Do you follow me <lb/>
            now ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Perfectly.</p>
          <p>Socr. I asked you, then, about a thing of this kind above, <lb/>
            whether where the just is, there also is the holy, or where the <lb/>
            holy is, there also is the just, but wherever the just is, there is <lb/>
            not always the holy: for the holy is a part of the just. Shall <lb/>
            we say thus, or does it seem to you otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Euth. No, but thus.. For you appear to me to speak cor­ <lb/>
            rectly.</p>
          <p>14. Socr. Observe then what follows. If the holy is a part <lb/>
            of the just, it is necessary, as it seems, that we should find out <lb/>
            what part of the just the holy is. If then you were to ask me <lb/>
            about some of the things before mentioned, for instance, what <lb/>
            part of number the even is, and what number it is, I should <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            say that it is not scalene, but isosceles t. Does it not appear <lb/>
            so to you ?</p>
          <p>jEth. It does.</p>
          <p>Socr. Do you, then, also endeavour in like manner to teach <lb/>
            me what part of the just the holy is, that I may tell Melitus no <lb/>
            longer to treat me unjustly nor indict me for impiety, since I <lb/>
            have now sufficiently learnt from you what things are pious <lb/>
            and holy, and what not.</p>
          <p>jEth. That part of justice then, Socrates, appears to me to <lb/>
            be pious and holy, which is concerned about our care for the <lb/>
            gods ; but that which is concerned about our care for mankind <lb/>
            is the remaining part of justice.</p>
          <p>15. Socr. You appear to me, Euthyphron, to speak well; <lb/>
            but I still require a trifle further. For I do not yet understand <lb/>
            what care you mean. For you surely do not mean such care <lb/>
            is to be had for the gods as is employed about other things. <lb/>
            For we say, for instance, not every one knows how to take <lb/>
            care of horses, but a groom ; do we not ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. For surely the groom's business is the taking care of <lb/>
            horses.</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Nor does every one know how to take care of dogs, <lb/>
            but a huntsman.</p>
          <p>Euth. Just so.</p>
          <p>Socr. For the huntsman's business is the taking care of dogs.</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. And the herdsman's of cattle.</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly,</p>
          <p>Socr. But holiness and piety of the gods, Euthyphron; do <lb/>
            you say so ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. All care, therefore, aims at the same thing, that is to <lb/>
            say, it is for some good and advantage of that which is taken <lb/>
            care of, as you see that horses, taken care of by one skilled in <lb/>
            the groom's business, are benefited and become better : do they <lb/>
            not seem so to you ?</p>
          <p>Euth. They do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Dogs also are benefited by one skilled in the hunts­ <lb/>
            man's business, and oxen by that of the herdsman, and all <note type="footnote"> t That is, it can be divided into equal parts, which the odd cannot. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            other things in like manner: do you think that the care is <lb/>
            employed for the injury of that which is taken care of?</p>
          <p>Euth. Not I, by Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Socr. But for its advantage ?</p>
          <p>Euth. How should it not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Is holiness, therefore, since it is a care for the gods, <lb/>
            an advantage to the gods, and does it make the gods better ? <lb/>
            And would you admit this, that when you do any thing holy, <lb/>
            you make some one of the gods better ?</p>
          <p>JEth. Not I, by Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Socr. Nor do I think, Euthyphron, that you mean this; I <lb/>
            am far from doing so: but for this reason I asked you what <lb/>
            care for the gods you mean, not thinking that you mean such <lb/>
            as this.</p>
          <p>JEth. And rightly, Socrates; for I do not mean such as <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>Socr. Be it so: but what care for the gods will holiness be ?</p>
          <p>Euth. That, Socrates, which slaves take of their masters.</p>
          <p>Socr. I understand: it will be a kind of service, as it seems, <lb/>
            paid to the gods.</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>16. Socr. Can you then tell me, to the performance of what <lb/>
            the service of physicians is subservient ? Do you not think it <lb/>
            is to health ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. But what ? to the performance of what work is the <lb/>
            service of shipwrights subservient?</p>
          <p>Euth. Clearly, Socrates, to that of a ship.</p>
          <p>Socr. And that of architects, to houses ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Yes.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me, then, my excellent friend; to the performance <lb/>
            of what work will the service of the gods be subservient ? For <lb/>
            it is clear that you know, since you say that you have a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of divine things beyond that of other men.</p>
          <p>Euth. And I say truly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Tell me then, by Jupiter, what is that very beautiful <lb/>
            work which the gods effect, by employing us as servants.</p>
          <p>Euth. They are many and beautiful, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. So do generals, my friend; though you could easily <lb/>
            tell the principal of them, that they effect victory in war; is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p><pb n="474"/>
            
          <p>BEth. How should I not ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Husbandmen too, I think, effect many and beautiful <lb/>
            things; but the principal thing they effect is the production of <lb/>
            food from the earth.</p>
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. What then ? of the many and beautiful things which <lb/>
            the gods effect, what is the principal ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I told you just now, Socrates, that it is a difficult mat­ <lb/>
            ter to learn all these things accurately ; this however I tell you <lb/>
            simply, that if any one knows how to speak and do things <lb/>
            grateful to the gods, by praying and sacrificing, these things <lb/>
            are holy, and such things preserve both private houses and <lb/>
            the general weal of cities; but the contraries to things accept­ <lb/>
            able to them are impious, which also subvert and ruin all things.</p>
          <p>17. Socr. You might, if you had pleased, Euthyphron, have <lb/>
            told me the principal of what I asked in fewer words. But it <lb/>
            is clear that you are not willing to teach me. For now when <lb/>
            you were just upon the point of doing so, you turned aside; <lb/>
            whereas if you had answered, I should by this time have suffici­ <lb/>
            ently learnt from you what holiness is. But now (for it is <lb/>
            necessary that he who asks questions should follow the person <lb/>
            questioned wherever he may lead) what again do you say is <lb/>
            the holy, and holiness? Do you not say it is a knowledge <lb/>
            of sacrificing and praying ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Is not to sacrifice to offer gifts to the gods, and to pray <lb/>
            to beg something of the gods ?</p>
          <p>Euth. Assuredly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Boer. From this statement it follows that holiness must be <lb/>
            a knowledge of begging from and giving to the gods.</p>
          <p>Euth. You quite understand what I mean, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. For I am very anxious, my friend, to obtain your <lb/>
            wisdom, and I apply my mind to it: so that what you say will <lb/>
            not fall to the ground. But tell me what this service of the <lb/>
            gods is ? Do you say it is to beg of them and to give to them ?</p>
          <p>Euth. I do.</p>
          <p>18. Socr. Must we not then, therefore, to be- rightly, beg <lb/>
            those things of them which we need from them ?</p>
          <p>Euth. What else ?</p>
          <p>Socr. And again to give rightly must we give them in return <lb/>
            such things as they stand in need of from us? For surely <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            it would not be suitable to offer those gifts to any one which <lb/>
            he does not need.</p>
          <p>jEth. You say truly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Socr. Holiness, therefore, Euthyphron, will be a kind of <lb/>
            traffic between gods and men.</p>
          <p>jEth. A kind of traffic, if it pleases you to call it so.</p>
          <p>Socr. But it is not at all pleasing to me, unless it happens <lb/>
            to be true. Tell me therefore, what advantage the gods derive <lb/>
            from the gifts which they receive from us ? For the advantage <lb/>
            arising from what they give is clear to every one ; for we have <lb/>
            no good at all which they do not impart? but how are they <lb/>
            benefited by what they receive from us ? Do we get so much <lb/>
            the advantage over them in this traffic, that we receive all good <lb/>
            things from them, but they nothing from us ?</p>
          <p>jEth. But do you think, Socrates, that the gods are bene­ <lb/>
            fited by what they receive from us ?</p>
          <p>Socr. What is the use then, Euthyphron, of all our gifts to <lb/>
            the gods?</p>
          <p>jEth. What else do you think except honour and reverence, <lb/>
            and, as I just now mentioned, gratitude ?</p>
          <p>Socr. Holiness then, Euthyphron, is that which is grateful, <lb/>
            but not profitable or dear to the gods.</p>
          <p>Euth. I for my part think it is of all things most dear to <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Socr. This then again is, as it seems, holiness, that which is <lb/>
            dear to the gods.</p>
          <p>jEth. Most certainly.</p>
          <p>19. Socr. Can you wonder then, when you say this, that <lb/>
            your statements do not remain fixed, but move about, and can <lb/>
            you accuse me as being the Daedalus that makes them move <lb/>
            about, when you yourself are far more skilful than Dædalus, <lb/>
            and make them go round in a circle ? Do you not perceive <lb/>
            that our discussion, turning round, comes to the same point ? <lb/>
            For you surely remember that in a former part of our discus­ <lb/>
            sion that which is holy and that which is acceptable to the <lb/>
            gods appeared to us not to be the same, but different from <lb/>
            each other: do you not remember ?</p>
          <p>jEth. I do.</p>
          <p>Socr. Now, then, do you not perceive that you say that holi­ <lb/>
            ness is that which is dear to the gods ? But is this any thing <lb/>
            else than that which is acceptable to the gods ? is it not so ?</p><pb n="476"/>
            
          <p>Euth. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Socr. Either, therefore, we did not then admit that properly, <lb/>
            or, if we did, our present statement is not correct ?</p>
          <p>Euth. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Socr. From the beginning, therefore, we must consider <lb/>
            again what holiness is; for I shall not willingly run away like <lb/>
            a coward, until I have learnt it. Do not then despise me, but <lb/>
            by all means apply your mind earnestly to it and tell me the <lb/>
            truth. For you know it, if any man does; and I cannot let <lb/>
            you go like Proteus, until you have told me. For if you had <lb/>
            not known clearly both what is holy and what is impious, it is <lb/>
            not possible that you could ever have attempted, for the sake <lb/>
            of a hireling, to prosecute your aged father for murder; but <lb/>
            you would have feared both to incur the anger of the gods, in <lb/>
            case you should not act rightly in this matter, and would have <lb/>
            been ashamed in the sight of men. But now I am sure that <lb/>
            you think you clearly know both what is holy and what is not. <lb/>
            Tell me, therefore, most excellent Euthyphron, and do not <lb/>
            conceal from me what you believe it to be ?</p>
          <p>Euth. At some other opportunity then, Socrates: for now I <lb/>
            am in haste to go somewhere, and it is time for me to depart.</p>
          <p>Socr. What are you about, my friend ? By going away you <lb/>
            deprive me of the great hope I entertained that by learning <lb/>
            from you what things are holy and what not, I might get rid <lb/>
            of Melitus's indictment, by shewing him that I had now become <lb/>
            skilled in divine things by the aid of Euthyphron, and that I <lb/>
            no longer through ignorance speak rashly, or introduce innova­ <lb/>
            tions respecting them, and that therefore I should lead a better <lb/>
            life for the future.</p>

          </head>
          <p>As Socrates was one day going from the Academy to the <lb/>
            Lyceum he met with Hippothales, Ctesippus, and other youths, <lb/>
            who were on that day celebrating the Hermæan festival in a <lb/>
            newly-erected palæstra hard by. They invite him to come in <lb/>
            and join their conversation; he promises to do so on condition <lb/>
            that they will first tell him who is the beauty among them. <lb/>
            Hippothales, to whom he first puts the question, shews, by his <lb/>
            embarrassment, that he is himself far gone in love; and on <lb/>
            being taxed with it by Socrates blushes still more, whereupon <lb/>
            Ctesippus says that he is constantly overwhelming them with <lb/>
            his poems and speeches on his favourite Lysis. Socrates, on <lb/>
            hearing this, begs Hippothales to inform him how a lover ought <lb/>
            to speak of or address his favourite. Hippothales, though he <lb/>
            does not deny his being in love, does deny that he makes <lb/>
            verses or speeches; but Ctesippus shews that he is constantly <lb/>
            giving utterance to the most extravagant praises of his fa­ <lb/>
            vourite and his family; on which Socrates remarks that he <lb/>
            should not celebrate his victory before it is won ; for that it is <lb/>
            not wise to praise the object of one's affection before a return <lb/>
            of affection on his part is secured, and moreover such as are <lb/>
            beautiful when highly praised are apt to become arrogant, and <lb/>
            so are more difficult to be won. Hippothales takes these sug­ <lb/>
            gestions in good part, and begs Socrates to advise him how to <lb/>
            address his favourite so as to win his affection, which Socrates <lb/>
            readily promises to do if they will give him an opportunity of <lb/>
            conversing with Lysis. To this end they all enter the palm­ <lb/>
            stra, and almost as soon as Socrates, Ctesippus, Menexenus <lb/>
            and others had seated themselves down in a quiet corner, <lb/>
            Lysis, who is very fond of listening to conversations, comes <lb/>
            and takes his seat next his friend Menexenus, while Hippo­ <lb/>
            thales is concealed in the back-ground out of sight of his <lb/>
            favourite a. <note type="footnote"> a § 1—10. </note></p><pb n="478"/>
            
          <p>Socrates begins by addressing a few words to the latter, but <lb/>
            on Menexenus being called out by the master of the palæstra, <lb/>
            he turns to Lysis, and asks him whether his parents do not <lb/>
            love him very much. On Lysis replying that they certainly do, <lb/>
            Socrates shews him that though, since they love him, they must <lb/>
            needs wish to make him as happy as possible, yet they are <lb/>
            so far from letting him do whatever he pleases, that they put <lb/>
            him under the government of others, even of slaves, and this <lb/>
            not on account of his youth, but because he has not yet ac­ <lb/>
            quired sufficient experience and knowledge to be entrusted <lb/>
            with the government of himself; but that whenever he is wise <lb/>
            enough, not only his father, but all others, will entrust him <lb/>
            with the management of themselves and their affairsb.</p>
          <p>At this point of the conversation Menexenus returned and <lb/>
            resumed his seat near Lysis, who begs of Socrates to say over <lb/>
            again to Menexenus what he had been saying to him; but <lb/>
            Socrates desires him to tell it himself on some future occasion, <lb/>
            and for the present engages to converse on some other subject <lb/>
            with Menexenus. Having observed, therefore, the friendship <lb/>
            that subsisted between Lysis and Menexenus, he asks the lat­ <lb/>
            ter, when any one loves another, which of the two becomes a <lb/>
            friend of the other, the lover or the beloved ? Menexenus re­ <lb/>
            plies that there is no difference. But Socrates shews that it <lb/>
            frequently happens that a lover is not only not loved in turn, <lb/>
            but is even hated. In that case, then, which is the friend ? <lb/>
            Menexenus is forced to admit that unless both love neither <lb/>
            can be a friend to the other. But here Socrates interposes <lb/>
            this difficulty; he remarks that men often love horses, dogs, <lb/>
            and other things which cannot love in turn; and the poet, as <lb/>
            Menexenus admits, speaks truly who says, " Happy the man <lb/>
            who has boys for his friends and horses and dogs," so that the <lb/>
            beloved now appears to be a friend of the lover, and not the <lb/>
            lover of the beloved; and by the same reasoning he who is <lb/>
            hated is an enemy, and not he who hates, whence the absurd <note type="footnote"> b § 10—18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            conclusion follows that people are beloved by their enemies <lb/>
            and hated by their friends. This, however, is impossible; <lb/>
            therefore the reverse must be the case, and the lover must be <lb/>
            a friend of the beloved. " If, then, neither those who love are <lb/>
            to be friends, nor those who are loved, nor yet those who both <lb/>
            love and are loved," who are to be called friends ? Lysis in­ <lb/>
            terposes with the remark that they do not appear to him to <lb/>
            have conducted their enquiries aright; so Socrates avails him­ <lb/>
            self of the opportunity thus offered him, and directs his dis­ <lb/>
            course to Lysis c.</p>
          <p>" The poets say," he observes, that " God ever conducts like <lb/>
            to like," and the wisest among men say the same, " that like <lb/>
            must ever needs be friendly to like." Lysis agrees to this. But, <lb/>
            objects Socrates, only half of this appears to be true, for the <lb/>
            more wicked men are the more hostile are they to each other; <lb/>
            so that it appears that the good man only is a friend to the <lb/>
            good man only, but that the bad man never arrives at true <lb/>
            friendship. But here again a new doubt is started.</p>
          <p>The like can derive no benefit from the like; how, there­ <lb/>
            fore, can they be held in regard by each other ? and how can <lb/>
            that which is not held in regard be a friend ? In like manner, <lb/>
            the good man is sufficient for himself; but he who is sufficient <lb/>
            needs nothing, and so will not regard any thing, and therefore <lb/>
            not love. So that from this it appears, that not even the good <lb/>
            will be friends to each otherd.</p>
          <p>Socrates then remarks, that he once heard some one say that <lb/>
            like is most hostile to like, and the good to the good; and ge­ <lb/>
            nerally that things most like each other are most full of envy, <lb/>
            strife and hatred, but such as are most unlike are most dis­ <lb/>
            posed to friendship, just as the dry desires the moist, the cold <lb/>
            heat, and so on. Menexenus admits the truth of this, and of <lb/>
            its consequence, that the contrary is most friendly to its con­ <lb/>
            trary. But again Socrates drives him to this absurd conclu­ <lb/>
            sion, that since enmity is most contrary to friendship, therefore <note type="footnote"> c § 18—24. </note><note type="footnote">d § 24—27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            an enemy must be a friend to a friend, or a friend a friend to <lb/>
            an enemye.</p>
          <p>Since it appears, then, that neither is the like friendly to <lb/>
            the like, nor the contrary to the contrary, Socrates next pro­ <lb/>
            poses to enquire whether that .which is neither good nor evil <lb/>
            can be the friend of the good. According to an ancient pro­ <lb/>
            verb, the beautiful is friendly, and the good is beautiful, whence <lb/>
            he would conclude that that which is neither good nor evil is <lb/>
            friendly to the beautiful and the good. There are three several <lb/>
            classes of things, he says, the good, the evil, and that which is <lb/>
            neither good nor evil. It has already been proved that the <lb/>
            good is not friendly to the good, nor the evil to the evil, nor <lb/>
            yet the good to the evil, nor the evil to the good ; it remains, <lb/>
            therefore, that that which is neither good nor evil must be <lb/>
            friendly to the good. But a little further discussion leads to <lb/>
            the more narrow conclusion, that that which is neither evil nor <lb/>
            good is friendly to the good, on account of the presence of <lb/>
            evil f.</p>
          <p>Both Lysis and Menexenus agree to this conclusion; but <lb/>
            Socrates soon raises new difficulties, and shews the fallacious­ <lb/>
            ness of their former reasoning. A friend, he says, is a friend <lb/>
            to some one, and for the sake of something, and on account of <lb/>
            something; for a rich man is a friend to a physician on ac­ <lb/>
            count of disease, which is an evil, and for the sake of health, <lb/>
            which is a good, so that that which is friendly is a friend for <lb/>
            the sake of a friend, on account of an enemy. By proceeding <lb/>
            in this way, he argues, we shall at length arrive at some prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, which will not have to be referred to another friend, but <lb/>
            will arrive at the first friend, for the sake of which all other <lb/>
            things are friends, and which is friendly for its own sake. <lb/>
            Now it has already appeared that we are friendly to that which <lb/>
            is good, and that we love the good on account of evil; if, <lb/>
            therefore, evil were to be done away with the good would be <lb/>
            of no use to us, and we should not love it. In this, too, his <note type="footnote"> e § 27—29. </note><note type="footnote">f § 29—33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="481"/>
            young friends are willing to acquiesce, but Socrates dispels <lb/>
            this delusion also, and shews that evil cannot be the cause of <lb/>
            love, since if evil were done away with the desires would still <lb/>
            remain, which in reality are the causes of friendship; for that <lb/>
            which desires desires what it stands in need of, and that which <lb/>
            stands in need is friendly to that of which it stands in need: <lb/>
            and so love, desire, and friendship respect that which, in a <lb/>
            manner, belongs to a man; but then evil belongs to evil and <lb/>
            good to good, consequently they will each severally be friendly <lb/>
            to their fellow, and the evil will be no less a friend to the evil <lb/>
            than the good to the good; but both these positions have <lb/>
            already been shewn to be erroneous, and so no positive solu­ <lb/>
            tion of the question proposed is arrived ats. <note type="footnote"> s § 34—43. </note> <note type="footnote"> I i </note></p>

          </ab>
          <p>I WAS going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum on <lb/>
            the road outside the wall close to the wall itself, but when I <lb/>
            reached the little gate, where is the fountain of the Panops, I <lb/>
            there met with Hippothales son of Hieronymus, Ctesippus the <lb/>
            Pseanian, and other young men with them standing together <lb/>
            in a group. And Hippothales seeing me approach said, <lb/>
            " Socrates, whither are you going, and whence come you ?"</p>
          <p>" From the Academy," I replied, " and am going straight to <lb/>
            the Lyceum."</p>
          <p>" Hither, then," said he, " straight to us. Won't you come <lb/>
            here ? it is worth while."</p>
          <p>" Where do you mean," said I, " and whom do you mean <lb/>
            by'you'?"</p>
          <p>" Hither," he replied, shewing me an enclosure opposite <lb/>
            the wall and an open gate, " there we are passing away our <lb/>
            time, we and a good many other fine fellows."</p>
          <p>" And what is this, and what your occupation ?"</p>
          <p>"A palæstra," he said, " lately built; our occupation con­ <lb/>
            sists chiefly in conversation, which we would gladly share with <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>" You do well," said I. " But who teaches there ?"</p>
          <p>" Your friend and encomiast," said he, " Miccus."</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said I, " he is no mean person, but an apt <lb/>
            sophist."</p>
          <p>" Will you follow us then," said he, " that you may see those <lb/>
            that are there ?"</p>
          <p>2. " I should be glad to hear this first, and on that condition <lb/>
            I enter, who is the beauty ?"</p>
          <p>" To some of us," said he, " Socrates, one appears so, to <lb/>
            some, another."</p>
          <p>" But who appears so to you, Hippothales ? Tell me this." <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            Then he blushed at the question. And I said, " Hippothales, <lb/>
            son of Hieronymus, you need no longer tell me this, whether <lb/>
            you are in love with any one or not: for I know that you are <lb/>
            not only in love, but are already pretty far gone in love. I, <lb/>
            for my part, am in other matters poor and useless, but, this <lb/>
            somehow has been given me by the deity, to be able quickly to <lb/>
            discern both a lover, and one that is beloved."</p>
          <p>On hearing this, he blushed still more. Whereupon Ctesip­ <lb/>
            pus said, " It is a fine thing in you to blush, Hippothales, and <lb/>
            hesitate to tell Socrates the name, though if he were to stay <lb/>
            here with you even for a short time he would be tired to death <lb/>
            with hearing you frequently telling it. 3. He has certainly <lb/>
            deafened our ears, Socrates, and filled them with the name of <lb/>
            Lysis: and if he is somewhat tipsy, it is easy for us, even when <lb/>
            we awake out of sleep, to fancy that we hear the name of Lysis. <lb/>
            And what he tells of him in his ordinary talk, though weari­ <lb/>
            some, is not so very much so; but when he attempts to over­ <lb/>
            whelm us with his poems and set-speeches! and what is still <lb/>
            more wearisome than these, is that he sings about his favourite <lb/>
            with a wonderful voice, which we must endure to listen to. <lb/>
            But now when questioned by you, he blushes."</p>
          <p>" This Lysis, then," said I, " is a youth, as it seems. I con­ <lb/>
            jecture this, because on hearing the name I did not know it."</p>
          <p>" They don't often call him by his own name," said he, " but <lb/>
            he still goes by his father's name, because his father is so very <lb/>
            well known. For I am very sure, that you are far from being <lb/>
            unacquainted with the form of the youth; for he may be suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently known from this only."</p>
          <p>4. " Tell me then," said I, " whose son he is."</p>
          <p>"The eldest son of Democrates, of Æxone," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Well done, Hippothales," said I, " what a noble and in <lb/>
            every way admirable love is this you have met with! Come <lb/>
            then, display to me what you display to these also, that I may <lb/>
            discover whether you know what a lover ought to say about <lb/>
            his favourite, either to himself or to others."</p>
          <p>" Do you really put any weight, Socrates," said he, " on any <lb/>
            thing that he says?"</p>
          <p>" Do you deny,;, said I, " that you are in love with the per­ <lb/>
            son whom he speaks of r"</p>
          <p>" I do not," said he, " but I do deny that I make verses on <lb/>
            my favourite or compose speeches."</p><pb n="484"/>
            
          <p>" He is not in his right senses," said Ctesippus, " but is de­ <lb/>
            lirious and mad."</p>
          <p>Upon this I said, " Hippothales, I do not wish to hear your <lb/>
            verses, nor any song that you may have made on the youth, <lb/>
            but their meaning, that I may know in what way you behave <lb/>
            towards your favourite."</p>
          <p>" He doubtless will tell you," said he, " for he knows and <lb/>
            remembers it well, since, as he says, he has been stunned by <lb/>
            constantly hearing it from me."</p>
          <p>5. " By the gods," said Ctesippus, " assuredly I do ; and <lb/>
            ridiculous it is too, Socrates. For that being a lover, and de­ <lb/>
            voting himself to the youth beyond all others, he should have <lb/>
            nothing of his own to say, that even a boy might not say, how <lb/>
            can it be otherwise than ridiculous ? For what the whole city <lb/>
            resounds with about Democrates and Lysis the boy's grand­ <lb/>
            father, and all his ancestors, their wealth, their breed of horses, <lb/>
            and their victories in the Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean <lb/>
            games, with four horses and with one, these things he puts into <lb/>
            poems and speeches, and besides these, things still more ab­ <lb/>
            surd : for he lately described to us in a poem, the entertain­ <lb/>
            ment of Hercules, how an ancestor of theirs received Hercules <lb/>
            on account of his relationship to him, being himself sprung <lb/>
            from Jupiter and the daughter of the founder of his borough, <lb/>
            such things as old women sing, and many others of the same <lb/>
            kind, Socrates. 6. These are the things that he speaks of and <lb/>
            sings and compels us to listen to."</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this, I said, " 0 ridiculous Hippothales, before <lb/>
            you have gained the victory do you compose and sing an en­ <lb/>
            comium on yourself?"</p>
          <p>" But I neither compose nor sing on myself, Socrates."</p>
          <p>" You do not think so," I replied.</p>
          <p>" How is that?" said he.</p>
          <p>" These songs," said I, " most of all relate to you. For if <lb/>
            you gain your favourite being such as you describe, what you <lb/>
            have said and sung will be an honour to you, and in reality an <lb/>
            encomium on yourself as victorious in having won such a <lb/>
            favourite. But if he should escape you, by how much greater <lb/>
            the encomiums are which you uttered on your favourite, by so <lb/>
            much the more ridiculous will you appear in being deprived of <lb/>
            greater blessings. Whoever therefore, my friend, is skilled in <lb/>
            matters of love, does not praise his beloved before he has caught <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            him, fearing how the event will turn out. Moreover such as <lb/>
            are beautiful when any one praises and extols them, are filled <lb/>
            with pride and arrogance. Do you not think so ?"</p>
          <p>" I do," he replied.</p>
          <p>7. " And by how much the more arrogant they are, are they <lb/>
            not more difficult to be caught ?"</p>
          <p>" That is probable at least."</p>
          <p>" What sort of huntsman, then, would he appear to you to <lb/>
            be, who in hunting should scare away his prey, and make it <lb/>
            more difficult to be caught ?"</p>
          <p>" Without doubt, a bad one."</p>
          <p>" And by speeches and songs not to soothe but exasperate, <lb/>
            shews a great want of skill; does it not ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so to me."</p>
          <p>" Consider then, Hippothales, whether you will not expose <lb/>
            yourself to all these charges by your poetry. Though I think <lb/>
            you would not be willing to allow that a man who harms him­ <lb/>
            self by his poetry can be a good poet, in that he harms <lb/>
            himself."</p>
          <p>" No, by Jupiter," said lie, " for that would be a great piece, <lb/>
            of folly. But on this very account, Socrates, I communicate <lb/>
            the matter to you, and if you have any thing else to suggest, <lb/>
            advise me, by saying what or by doing what one may win the <lb/>
            affections of one's favourite."</p>
          <p>" It is not easy to say," I replied: " but if you will make <lb/>
            Lysis himself converse with me, I could perhaps shew you what <lb/>
            you ought to say to him, instead of the things which your <lb/>
            friends allege that you say and sing."</p>
          <p>8. " There is no difficulty in that," he replied. " For if youwill <lb/>
            enter with Ctesippus here, and sit down and converse, I think <lb/>
            that he will join you of his own accord, for he is exceedingly <lb/>
            fond of listening, Socrates, and moreover, as they are celebrat­ <lb/>
            ing the Hermoea, young men and boys are all mixed up toge­ <lb/>
            ther. He will therefore join you: but if not, he is intimate <lb/>
            with Ctesippus, through his cousin Menexenus; for Mene­ <lb/>
            xenus is his most particular friend. Let him call him, there­ <lb/>
            fore, if he does not join you of his own accord."</p>
          <p>" This," said I, " we must do." And at the same time, <lb/>
            laying hold of Ctesippus, I entered the palæstra, and the others, <lb/>
            came after us.</p>
          <p>On entering there, we found that the boys had finished their <lb/>
             <pb n="486"/>
            sacrifices, and, the ceremonies being now nearly ended, play­ <lb/>
            ing at dice, and all full dressed. 9. Many of them were <lb/>
            playing in the court outside, but some in a corner of the <lb/>
            dressing-room were playing at odd and even with a great <lb/>
            number of dice which they drew out of certain little baskets. <lb/>
            Others stood round these, looking on; and among them was <lb/>
            Lysis, and he stood in the midst of the boys and youths, <lb/>
            crowned, and surpassing them in form, so as not only to <lb/>
            deserve to be called beautiful, but beautiful and noble. Then <lb/>
            we withdrawing to the opposite side sat down, (for it was <lb/>
            quiet there,) and entered into conversation with each other. <lb/>
            Lysis, thereupon, turning round, frequently looked at us, and <lb/>
            was evidently anxious to come to us; but for some time he <lb/>
            hesitated, and was averse to approach alone. Then, Menexenus <lb/>
            comes in, in the midst of his game from the court, and as soon <lb/>
            as he saw me and Ctesippus, came and seated himself by us. <lb/>
            10. Lysis, therefore, seeing him, followed, and sat down by <lb/>
            the side of Menexenus. Others likewise came up, and more­ <lb/>
            over Hippothales, when he saw a good many standing round, <lb/>
            concealing himself behind them, took up a position where he <lb/>
            thought Lysis could not see him, fearing lest he should give <lb/>
            him offence, and in this position he listened to our discourse. <lb/>
            And I, looking towards Menexenus, said, " Son of Demophon, <lb/>
            which of you is the elder ?"</p>
          <p>" We are in doubt," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Should you not also contend which of you is the more <lb/>
            noble ?" said I.</p>
          <p>" Certainly," said he.</p>
          <p>" And in like manner, which of you is the more beautiful ?"</p>
          <p>Hereupon they both laughed. " However," said I, " I will <lb/>
            not ask which of you is the more rich, for you are friends; <lb/>
            are you not ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," they replied.</p>
          <p>" Now the property of friends is said to be common, so that <lb/>
            in this respect there will be no difference between you if <lb/>
            what you say about friendship is true."</p>
          <p>They assented.</p>
          <p>After this, I was purposing to ask, which of them was <lb/>
            the more just and the more wise; but in the meanwhile some <lb/>
            one came and made Menexenus get up, saying that the master <lb/>
            of the palæstra called him; for he appeared to me to be one <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            concerned in the sacrifices. He therefore left us ; and I ques­ <lb/>
            tioned Lysis: 11. "Doubtless," said I, " Lysis, your father <lb/>
            and mother love you very much ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Would they not, then, wish you to be as happy as possible?"</p>
          <p>" How not ?"</p>
          <p>" Does a man appear to you to be happy who is a slave, and <lb/>
            who is not permitted to do any thing he desires ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, no," said he.</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, your father and mother love you and wish <lb/>
            that you may be happy, this is quite evident, that they en­ <lb/>
            deavour to make you happy ?"</p>
          <p>"How should they not?" said he.</p>
          <p>" Do they, therefore, permit you to do what you please, and <lb/>
            in no respect find fault with you or hinder you from doing <lb/>
            whatever you desire ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, Socrates," said he, " they do indeed hinder me <lb/>
            in very many things."</p>
          <p>" How say you ?" I asked, " wishing you to be happy do <lb/>
            they hinder you from doing whatever you please ? Answer <lb/>
            me thus ; If you should desire to mount on one of your father.'s <lb/>
            chariots, and to take the reins when a race is to be run, would <lb/>
            he not allow you, but hinder you ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said he, " he would not allow me."</p>
          <p>" Whom would he then ?"</p>
          <p>" There is a charioteer who receives pay from my father."</p>
          <p>12. " How say you ? Do they suffer a hired servant rather <lb/>
            than you to do what he pleases with the horses, and moreover <lb/>
            pay him money for so doing ?"</p>
          <p>" Why not ?" said he.</p>
          <p>" But I suppose they suffer you to drive the pair of mules, <lb/>
            and, if you wish to take the whip and beat them, they would <lb/>
            allow you."</p>
          <p>" Why allow me ?" said he.</p>
          <p>" But what ?" said I, " is no one allowed to beat them ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," said he, " the mule-driver."</p>
          <p>" Is he a slave, or free ?"</p>
          <p>" A slave," he replied.</p>
          <p>" They think more of a slave then, as it seems, than of you, <lb/>
            their son, and commit their property to him rather than to <lb/>
            you, and allow him to do what he pleases, but you they hinder. <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            Tell me this too. Do they allow you to govern yourself; or <lb/>
            do they not even suffer this ?"</p>
          <p>"How should they suffer it ?" he said.</p>
          <p>" Who then governs you ?"</p>
          <p>"My pædagogue here," said he.</p>
          <p>" Is he a slave ?"</p>
          <p>" How should he be otherwise ? ours though," said he.</p>
          <p>" It is shameful, surely," said I, " that a freeman should be <lb/>
            governed by a slave. And by doing what does this psedagogue <lb/>
            govern you ?"</p>
          <p>" Of course," said he, " he conducts me to my masters."</p>
          <p>" And do they too govern you, the masters ?</p>
          <p>" Assuredly."</p>
          <p>13. " Your father, then, voluntarily sets over you many <lb/>
            rulers and governors. But when you return home to your <lb/>
            mother, does she allow you to do whatever you please, that you <lb/>
            may be happy as far as she is concerned, either with her wool <lb/>
            or her loom when she is spinning ? She surely does not hinder <lb/>
            you from touching the comb or the shuttle, or any other of <lb/>
            her spinning instruments."</p>
          <p>Whereupon, he laughing replied, "By Jupiter, Socrates, she <lb/>
            not only hinders me, but I should be beaten too if I touched <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>" By Hercules," said I, " have you in any way injured your <lb/>
            father or your mother ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, not I," he said.</p>
          <p>" For what reason, then, do they so shamefully hinder you <lb/>
            from being happy and doing what you please, and bring you up <lb/>
            throughout the whole day in subjection to some one, and in a <lb/>
            word let you do scarcely any thing that you wish ? So that, as it <lb/>
            seems, neither have you any advantage from such great riches, <lb/>
            but any one manages them rather than you, nor from your <lb/>
            person, which is so noble, but this too another tends and takes <lb/>
            care of: but you, Lysis, neither govern any thing, nor do any <lb/>
            thing that you wish."</p>
          <p>14. "For I am not yet old enough, Socrates," said he.</p>
          <p>" That should not hinder you, son of Democrates : since <lb/>
            thus far, I think, both your father and mother permit you and <lb/>
            do not wait till you are old enough: for when they wish any <lb/>
            thing to be read to or written for them, they appoint you, I <lb/>
            think, first of all in the house to this office ; do they not ?"</p><pb n="489"/>
            
          <p>" Certainly," said he.</p>
          <p>Are you allowed then, in this case, to write whichever <lb/>
            letter you please first, and which second, and are you allowed <lb/>
            to read in like manner? And when you take the lyre, I <lb/>
            think, neither your father nor your mother hinder you from <lb/>
            tightening and loosening any string you please, and from <lb/>
            twanging and striking them with the quill; do they hinder <lb/>
            you ?"</p>
          <p>" By no means."</p>
          <p>" What then can be the cause, Lysis, that in these cases <lb/>
            they do not hinder you, but do hinder you in those that we just <lb/>
            now mentioned ?"</p>
          <p>" Because, I think," said he, " I know the one, but not the­ <lb/>
            other."</p>
          <p>15. "Be it so," said I, "my excellent youth; your father, <lb/>
            then, is not waiting for your being old enough to entrust every <lb/>
            thing to you, but on the very day that he shall think you are <lb/>
            wiscr than he is, he will entrust to you both himself and his <lb/>
            property ?"</p>
          <p>" I think he will," said he.</p>
          <p>" Be it so," said I, " what then ? Will not your neighbour <lb/>
            follow the same rule as your father respecting you ? Do you <lb/>
            think he will entrust you with the management of his household <lb/>
            when he thinks you are wiscr than himself with respect to <lb/>
            household-management, or will he preside over it himself?"</p>
          <p>" I think he will entrust it to me."</p>
          <p>" But what ? do you think the Athenians will entrust their <lb/>
            affairs to you, when they perceive that you are wise enough ?"</p>
          <p>'I do."</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said I, " what then as to the great king ? <lb/>
            Would he suffer his eldest son, who will succeed to the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Asia, when his meat is being cooked, to throw into <lb/>
            the sauce whatever he pleases, rather than us, if we should go <lb/>
            to him and shew that we are more skilled in the preparation of <lb/>
            dishes than his son ?"</p>
          <p>" Us, clearly," he replied.</p>
          <p>] 6. " And he would not allow him to throw any thing in, <lb/>
            however trifling, but us he would allow, even if we wished to <lb/>
            throw in salt by the handful."</p>
          <p>" How not ?"</p>
          <p>" But what if his son should be diseased in his eyes, would <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            he allow him to touch his own eyes, not considering him a <lb/>
            physician, or would he hinder him ?"</p>
          <p>" He would hinder him."</p>
          <p>" But if he supposed we were good physicians, even if we <lb/>
            wished to open his eyes and sprinkle them with ashes, I think <lb/>
            he would not hinder us, considering we judged rightly."</p>
          <p>" You say true."</p>
          <p>" Would he not entrust every thing else to us rather than to <lb/>
            himself or his son, with respect to which we appeared to him <lb/>
            to be wiser than either of them ?"</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so, Socrates," he replied.</p>
          <p>" This, then, is the case," said I, " my dear Lysis, all per­ <lb/>
            sons, both Greeks and barbarians, men and women, will en­ <lb/>
            trust us with those things with respect to which we are found <lb/>
            to be wise, and we shall do in them whatever wc please, nor <lb/>
            will any one purposely hinder us, but we shall both be free <lb/>
            ourselves in these matters, and governors over others, and <lb/>
            these things will be our own, for we shall derive benefit from <lb/>
            them. 17. But those things about which we have no know­ <lb/>
            ledge no one will suffer us to do as we think proper, but all <lb/>
            men will hinder us as much as they are able, not only strangers, <lb/>
            but even our own father and mother, and any one else who is <lb/>
            more nearly related to us than them, and in these matters we <lb/>
            ourselves shall be subject to others, and they will be strange to <lb/>
            us, for we shall derive no benefit from them. Do you admit <lb/>
            that this is the case ?"</p>
          <p>"I do."</p>
          <p>" Shall we, then, be friends to any one, and will any one <lb/>
            love us in those things in which we are of no use ?"</p>
          <p>" No, surely," said he.</p>
          <p>" Now, then, neither does your father love you, nor does <lb/>
            any one else love another person, in so far as he is useless ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears not," he said.</p>
          <p>" If, then, you become wise, my boy, all men will be your <lb/>
            friends, and all men will be attached to you, for you will be <lb/>
            useful and good. But if not, neither will any one else, nor <lb/>
            your father be a friend to you, nor your mother, nor any of <lb/>
            your kindred. Is it possible, then, Lysis, that any one can <lb/>
            deem himself wise in those things of which as yet he has no <lb/>
            knowledge at all ?"</p>
          <p>" How can he ?" said he.</p><pb n="491"/>
            
          <p>" If, then, you require a teacher, you are not yet wise ?"</p>
          <p>18. "True."</p>
          <p>" Neither, then, are you very wise, if you are still unwise ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said he, " Socrates, I do not think that I <lb/>
            can be."</p>
          <p>Then I, upon hearing this, looked at Hippothales, and al­ <lb/>
            most committed a blunder, for it occurred to me to say, If Thus, <lb/>
            Hippothales, we ought to converse with favourites, humbling <lb/>
            and checking them, and not, as you do, puffing them up and <lb/>
            filling them with vanity." However, perceiving him anxious <lb/>
            and disturbed at what was said, I recollected that, although he <lb/>
            was standing near, he wished to escape the observation of Ly­ <lb/>
            sis; I therefore recovered myself, and restrained my speech.</p>
          <p>At this moment Menexenus came again, and sat down by <lb/>
            Lysis, whence he had risen before. Lysis, then, in a very <lb/>
            boyish and affectionate manner, unobserved by Menexenus, <lb/>
            talking to me a little while, said, If Socrates, say over again to <lb/>
            Menexenus what you have been saying to me."</p>
          <p>And I replied, " Do you tell it him, Lysis, for you paid very <lb/>
            great attention."</p>
          <p>" I certainly did," he replied.</p>
          <p>Endeavour, then," said I, If to remember it as well as you <lb/>
            can, that you may tell him all clearly; but if you forget any <lb/>
            thing, ask me again the first time you meet me."</p>
          <p>19. " I will most certainly do so, Socrates," said he, " be well <lb/>
            assured. But say something else to him, that I too may hear, <lb/>
            until it is time for me to go home."</p>
          <p>"I must do so," said I, " since you bid me; but take care <lb/>
            that. you assist me, if Menexenus should attempt to confute <lb/>
            me. Do you not know that he is fond of disputing ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said he, " very much so; and for this reason <lb/>
            I wish you to converse with him."</p>
          <p>" That I may make myself ridiculous ?" said I.</p>
          <p>No, by Jupiter," said he, " but that you may punish him."</p>
          <p>" How so," said I, " that's not an easy matter, for the man <lb/>
            is clever, a disciple of Ctesippus. And besides, he is here in <lb/>
            person, do not you see Ctesippus?"</p>
          <p>"Don't concern yourself about that, Socrates," said he, <lb/>
            If but come, converse with him."</p>
          <p>" We must converse, then," I replied.</p>
          <p>While we were speaking thus to each other, Ctesippus said,</p><pb n="492"/>
            
          <p>" What are you two feasting on by yourselves, without letting <lb/>
            us share in the conversation ?"</p>
          <p>" But indeed," said I, " you shall have a share, for Lysis <lb/>
            here does not understand something that I have said, but says <lb/>
            he thinks Menexenus knows it, and bids me ask him."</p>
          <p>20. " Why then," said he, " do you not ask him ?"</p>
          <p>" But I will ask him," I replied. " Answer me, then, Menex­ <lb/>
            enus, what I shall ask you; for from my childhood I happen <lb/>
            to have had a desire for a certain thing, as another person may <lb/>
            have of something else: for one desires to possess horses, <lb/>
            another dogs, another gold, and another honours; but I, for <lb/>
            my part, am indifferent about these things, but have a fond <lb/>
            desire for the possession of friends, and I had rather have a <lb/>
            good friend than the best quail or cock in the world; and, by <lb/>
            Jupiter, than the best horse or do-, and I think, by the do,-,, <lb/>
            that I should much rather prefer the possession of an intimate, <lb/>
            than the gold of Darius, or even than Darius himself, so fond <lb/>
            am I of intimate friends. Seeing you, therefore, and Lysis, I was <lb/>
            amazed, and pronounced you happy, because, young as you are, <lb/>
            you have been able so quickly and easily to acquire this posses­ <lb/>
            sion, and you have so quickly and sincerely acquired him for <lb/>
            your friend, and again he you. But I am so far from making <lb/>
            this acquisition, that I do not even know in what way one man <lb/>
            becomes the friend of another; but I wish to ask this very <lb/>
            thing of you, as being an experienced person. 21. Tell me, <lb/>
            then, when any one loves another, which of the two becomes <lb/>
            a friend, the lover of the beloved, or the beloved of the lover? <lb/>
            or is there no difference ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears to me," said he, " that there is no difference."</p>
          <p>" How say you r" I replied, " Do both then become friends <lb/>
            of each other, if one alone loves the other r"</p>
          <p>" To me it appears so," said he.</p>
          <p>" But what ? Is it not possible for one who loves not to be <lb/>
            loved in turn by the object of his love ?"</p>
          <p>" It is."</p>
          <p>" But what ? is it not possible, then, for one who loves ever <lb/>
            to be hated ? as lovers surely sometimes seem to be treated <lb/>
            by their favourites : for though they love most ardently, some <lb/>
            of them think that they are not loved in turn, and some even <lb/>
            that they are hated. Does not this appear to you to be true ?"</p>
          <p>" Quite true," said he.</p><pb n="493"/>
            
          <p>" In such a case, then," said I," does one love, and is the <lb/>
            other loved ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Which then of these is the friend of the other ? the lover <lb/>
            of the beloved, whether he is loved in turn, or even if he is <lb/>
            hated, or the beloved of the lover ? or again, in such a case, is <lb/>
            neither the friend of neither, unless both love each other ?"</p>
          <p>" It seems indeed to be so."</p>
          <p>22. " Now, then, it appears to us otherwise than it ap­ <lb/>
            peared before. For then if one loved, both appeared to be <lb/>
            friends; but now, unless both love neither is a friend."</p>
          <p>" It appears so," said he.</p>
          <p>" Nothing, therefore, is a friend to that which loves unless it <lb/>
            loves in turn."</p>
          <p>" It seems not."</p>
          <p>" Neither, then, are they friends of horses, whom horses do <lb/>
            not love in turn, nor friends of quails, nor again friends of dogs, <lb/>
            and friends of wine, and friends of gymnastics, and of wisdom, <lb/>
            unless wisdom loves them in turn: or do they severally love <lb/>
            these things although they are not friends, and does the poet <lb/>
            speak falsely who says, ' Happy the man who has boys for his <lb/>
            friends, and solid-hoofed horses, and hunting dogs, and a <lb/>
            foreign guest ?'"</p>
          <p>" It does not seem so to me," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But does he appear to you to speak the truth ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" The beloved, then, is a friend to that which loves, as it <lb/>
            seems, Menexenus, whether it loves or whether it hates ; just <lb/>
            as children newly born, who partly do not yet love, and partly <lb/>
            even hate, when they are punished by their mother or their <lb/>
            father, nevertheless, at the very time when they hate, are in the <lb/>
            highest degree beloved by their parents.</p>
          <p>" It appears to me," said he, " that this is the case."</p>
          <p>23. " The lover, therefore, from this reasoning, is not the <lb/>
            friend, but the beloved."</p>
          <p>" It seems so."</p>
          <p>" And he who is hated, therefore, is an enemy, but not he <lb/>
            who hates."</p>
          <p>" So it appears."</p>
          <p>" Many, therefore, are beloved by their enemies and hated <lb/>
            by their friends; and are friends to their enemies, but enemies <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            to their friends, if the beloved is a friend, and not the lover. <lb/>
            Though it is very absurd, ray dear friend, or rather, I think, im­ <lb/>
            possible, to be an enemy to a friend, and a friend to an enemy."</p>
          <p>" You seem to speak truly, Socrates," said he.</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, this is impossible, the lover will be a friend <lb/>
            of the beloved."</p>
          <p>" So it appears."</p>
          <p>" Again, therefore, that which hates must be the enemy of <lb/>
            that which is hated."</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so."</p>
          <p>" Therefore, the result will be that we must of necessity ad­ <lb/>
            mit the very things that we did before, that a man is often a <lb/>
            friend of that which is not a friend, and often even of that which <lb/>
            is an enemy, when either any one loves that which does not <lb/>
            love, or even loves that which hates, and is often an enemy of <lb/>
            that which is not an enemy, or is even a friend, when either <lb/>
            any one loves that which does not hate, or even hates that <lb/>
            which loves."</p>
          <p>" It appears so," said he.</p>
          <p>" What shall we do, then," said I, " if neither those who.love <lb/>
            are to be friends, nor those who are loved, nor yet those who <lb/>
            both love and are loved? Shall we say that some others be­ <lb/>
            sides these become friends to each other ?"</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter, Socrates," said he, " I don't well know what <lb/>
            answer to make."</p>
          <p>24. " Have we not, then, Menexenus," said I, " conducted <lb/>
            our enquiries altogether right ?"</p>
          <p>" To me it appears not, Socrates," said Lysis; and as he <lb/>
            said this he blushed: for his remark appeared to me to escape <lb/>
            from him involuntarily through his earnest attention to the <lb/>
            conversation: and he was plainly most attentive while he was <lb/>
            listening.</p>
          <p>I then, wishing that Menexenus should cease speaking, and <lb/>
            being delighted with the other's love of wisdom, accordingly <lb/>
            turned round and directed my discourse to Lysis, and said, <lb/>
            " Lysis, you seem to me to say truly, that if we had conducted <lb/>
            our enquiries properly, we should never have wandered in this <lb/>
            manner. But let us proceed no longer in this way, (for the <lb/>
            investigation appears to me to be difficult as if it were a road,) <lb/>
            but it seems to me that we should proceed by the road to <lb/>
            which we turned aside, and conduct our enquiries after the <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            poets ; for they are to us, as it were, fathers of wisdom and <lb/>
            guides. They speak however, I imagine, so as not to give a <lb/>
            mean account of such as happen to be friends, but they say <lb/>
            that God himself makes them friends, by conducting them to <lb/>
            each other. They express themselves as I think somehow <lb/>
            as follows: ' God ever conducts like to like and makes them <lb/>
            known ; have you not met with this verse ?"</p>
          <p>" I have," said he.</p>
          <p>25. " Have you not met, too, with the writings of the wisest <lb/>
            of men that say, the very same things, that like must ever <lb/>
            needs be friendly to like ? But these are they who discourse <lb/>
            and write about nature and the universe." <lb/>
            " You say truly," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Whether, then," said I, " do they say well ?"</p>
          <p>.. Perhaps so," said he.</p>
          <p>" Perhaps," said I, " the half is true, and perhaps the whole, <lb/>
            but we do not understand it: for the wicked man, by how <lb/>
            much nearer he approaches, and is more intimate with a wicked <lb/>
            man, seems to us to become so much the more hostile to him ; <lb/>
            for he injures him ; but, surely, it is impossible for those who <lb/>
            injure and are injured to be friends : is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Thus, then, the half of this saying will not be true, since <lb/>
            the wicked are like each other ?"</p>
          <p>" You say true."</p>
          <p>" But they seem to me to say that the good are like each <lb/>
            other and friends, but that the bad, as it is said of them, are <lb/>
            never alike even to themselves, but are inconstant and unsta­ <lb/>
            ble. But that which is unlike and at variance with itself, can <lb/>
            scarcely be like or friendly to another; does it not seem so to <lb/>
            you too ?"</p>
          <p>" To me it does," said he.</p>
          <p>26. They intimate this, then, my friend, as it seems to me, <lb/>
            when they say that like is friendly to like, that the good man <lb/>
            only is a friend to the good man only, but that the bad man <lb/>
            never arrives at true friendship, either with a good or a bad <lb/>
            man : does it seem so to you also ?"</p>
          <p>He nodded assent.</p>
          <p>"We have now discovered, then, who are friends, for oui <lb/>
            argument shews that it must be those who are good." <note type="footnote"> a Homer, Odyss. xvii. 218. </note></p><pb n="496"/>
            
          <p>" It certainly seems so," said he.</p>
          <p>.. And I think so too," said 1. Nevertheless, I find some <lb/>
            difficulty in it. Come then, by Jupiter, let us see what it is I <lb/>
            suspect. The like, in so far as he is like, is a friend to the like, <lb/>
            and such an one is useful to such an one : or rather thus : can <lb/>
            any thing that is like confer any benefit on or do any harm to <lb/>
            any thing that is like, which it cannot also do to itself; or suf­ <lb/>
            fer any thing which it cannot also suffer from itself ? But how <lb/>
            can such things be held in regard by each other when they arc <lb/>
            unable to afford any assistance to each other? is it possible ?"</p>
          <p>" It is not possible."</p>
          <p>" But how can that which is not held in regard be a friend ?"</p>
          <p>" In no way."</p>
          <p>" The like, then, is not a friend to the like: but will the <lb/>
            good be a friend to the good, so far as he is good, and not so <lb/>
            far as he is like ?"</p>
          <p>" Perhaps so."</p>
          <p>27. "But what? Will not the good man, so far as he is <lb/>
            good, be sufficient for himself?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" But he who is sufficient stands in need of nothing, so far <lb/>
            as sufficiency is concerned ?"</p>
          <p>" How can it be otherwise ?"</p>
          <p>" And he who stands in need of nothing will not regard any <lb/>
            thing?"</p>
          <p>" He will not."</p>
          <p>" But he who does not feel a regard cannot love ?"</p>
          <p>" Surely not."</p>
          <p>" How, then, will the good be in any respect friends to the <lb/>
            good, who neither when absent regret each other, for they are <lb/>
            sufficient for themselves when apart, nor when present stand in <lb/>
            need of each other ? By what contrivance can such persons <lb/>
            value each other very highly?"</p>
          <p>" By none at all," said he.</p>
          <p>" But they will not be friends who do not value each other <lb/>
            very highly ?"</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>" Observe then, Lysis, how we are deceived. Are we, then, <lb/>
            deceived in the whole ?"</p>
          <p>" How so ?" said he.</p>
          <p>" I once heard a person say, and I just now call it to <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            mind, that like is most hostile to like, and the good to the <lb/>
            good. And moreover, he adduced Hesiodb as a witness, say­ <lb/>
            ing that ' potter is angry with potter, bard with bard, and beg­ <lb/>
            gar with beggar.' And so, he said, with regard to all other <lb/>
            things, that as a matter of absolute necessity, things most like <lb/>
            each other are most full of envy, strife, and hatred ; but such <lb/>
            as are most unlike, of friendship ; 28. for that the poor man is <lb/>
            compelled to be a friend to the rich, and the weak to the <lb/>
            strong, for the sake of assistance, and the sick man to the phy­ <lb/>
            sician ; and that every one who is ignorant must regard and <lb/>
            love him that has knowledge. Moreover, he carried on the <lb/>
            subject in a more lofty style, saying that the like is so far from <lb/>
            being friendly to the like, that the very contrary to this takes <lb/>
            place. For that the most contrary is in the highest degree <lb/>
            friendly to the most contrary; for every thing desires its con­ <lb/>
            trary, and not its like. Thus the dry desires the moist, the <lb/>
            cold heat, the bitter sweet, the sharp blunt, the empty fulness, <lb/>
            and the full emptiness; and all other things in the same way. <lb/>
            For the contrary is food to the contrary, but the like can de­ <lb/>
            rive no enjoyment from the like. And indeed, my friend, he <lb/>
            who said this seemed to be an accomplished man, for he spoke <lb/>
            well. But how does he seem to you to speak ?" I asked.</p>
          <p>29. " Well," replied Menexenus, " as it seems on first hear­ <lb/>
            ing."</p>
          <p>" Shall we say, then, that the contrary is most friendly to <lb/>
            the contrary ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Be it so," said I, " but is it not monstrous, Menexenus, <lb/>
            and will not those perfectly wise men, the disputants, imme­ <lb/>
            diately spring upon us exultingly, and ask, if friendship is not <lb/>
            most contrary to enmity ? What answer shall we give them? <lb/>
            Must we not of necessity admit that they say truly ?"</p>
          <p>" Of necessity."</p>
          <p>"' Well then,' they will ask, 'is an enemy a friend to a <lb/>
            friend, or is a friend a friend to an enemy?' "</p>
          <p>" Neither the one nor the other," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But is the just a friend to the unjust, or the temperate to <lb/>
            the intemperate, or the good to the bad ?"</p>
          <p>" It does not appear to me to be so."</p>
          <p>" However," said I, " if one thing is a friend to another by <note type="footnote"> 11 Op. et Di., v. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> K k </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            reason of contrariety, these things must also of necessity be <lb/>
            friendly ?"</p>
          <p>" Of necessity."</p>
          <p>" Neither, therefore, is the like friendly to the like, nor the <lb/>
            contrary to the contrary ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears not."</p>
          <p>" Further, let us consider this, whether it still more escapes <lb/>
            our observation, that a friend is in reality none of these, but <lb/>
            that what is neither good nor evil may sometimes become the <lb/>
            friend of the good."</p>
          <p>" How mean you ?" said he.</p>
          <p>" By Jupiter," said I, " I don't know; for I am in reality <lb/>
            myself dizzy with the perplexity of the argument. It appears, <lb/>
            however, according to the ancient proverb, that the beautiful is <lb/>
            friendly. 30. It certainly resembles something soft, smooth, <lb/>
            and plump; on which account perhaps it slips away from us <lb/>
            and escapes us, because it is a thing of this kind. For I say <lb/>
            that the good is beautiful: do you not think so ?"</p>
          <p>" I do."</p>
          <p>"1 say, therefore, prophetically, that that which is neither <lb/>
            good nor evil is friendly to the beautiful and the good. But <lb/>
            hear why I thus prophesy. There appear to me to be as it <lb/>
            were three several classes, one good, a second evil, a third <lb/>
            neither good nor evil. What think you ?"</p>
          <p>" It seems so to me also," said he.</p>
          <p>" Now that the good is friendly to the good, or the evil to <lb/>
            the evil, or the good to the evil, our former argument does not <lb/>
            allow us to say. It remains therefore, if any thing is friendly <lb/>
            to any thing, that that which is neither good nor evil, must be <lb/>
            friendly either to the good, or to that which is such as itself; <lb/>
            for nothing surely can become friendly to the evil."</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>" Neither is like friendly to like, we just now said; did we <lb/>
            not ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>" Therefore to that which is neither good nor evil, that <lb/>
            which resembles it will not be friendly ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears not."</p>
          <p>" The result then is, that that which is neither good nor <lb/>
            evil alone becomes friendly to the good alone ?"</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so, as it seems."</p><pb n="499"/>
            
          <p>31. "Well then, my boys," said I, "does what is now said <lb/>
            lead us in the right direction ? Surely if we will consider, a <lb/>
            healthy body has no need of the medicinal art, or of any assist­ <lb/>
            ance ; for it is sufficient for itself; so that no healthy person <lb/>
            is a friend to a physician on account of health; is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>" No one."</p>
          <p>" But the sick man I think is, on account of disease ?':</p>
          <p>" How not?"</p>
          <p>" But disease is an evil, and the medicinal art beneficial and <lb/>
            good."</p>
          <p>Yes."</p>
          <p>" But a body surely, so far as it is body, is neither good <lb/>
            nor evil."</p>
          <p>" Just so."</p>
          <p>" But a body is compelled, on account of disease, to embrace <lb/>
            and love the medicinal art."</p>
          <p>" It seems so to me."</p>
          <p>" That, therefore, which is neither evil nor good, becomes <lb/>
            friendly to the good, on account of the presence of evil."</p>
          <p>" So it seems."</p>
          <p>" But it is evident that it becomes so, prior to its becoming <lb/>
            evil through the evil which it contains; for when it has once <lb/>
            become evil, it will no longer desire the good, and be friendly <lb/>
            to it: for we have said that it is impossible for the evil to be <lb/>
            friendly to the good."</p>
          <p>" It is impossible."</p>
          <p>" Consider, then, what I say. For I say that some things are <lb/>
            themselves such as that which is present with them, and some <lb/>
            not. Thus, if any one wishes to dye any thing with any colour, <lb/>
            the colour that is dyed in is surely present in the thing that is <lb/>
            dyed."</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>32. " Is then, that which is dyed, afterwards, the same as <lb/>
            to colour, as that which is on it ?"</p>
          <p>" I don't understand you," he replied.</p>
          <p>" But thus," said I, " If any one should dye your hairs, <lb/>
            which are yellow, with white lead, would they then be white, <lb/>
            or appear so ?"</p>
          <p>" They would appear so," he replied.</p>
          <p>" Though whiteness would be present with them."</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p><pb n="500"/>
            
          <p>" And yet your hairs would not be at all the more white, but <lb/>
            though whiteness is present, they are neither white nor black."</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>" But when, my friend, old age has brought this colour on <lb/>
            them, then they become such as that which is present with <lb/>
            them, white by the presence of white."</p>
          <p>" How can it be otherwise ?"</p>
          <p>" This then I now ask, if a thing be present in any thing, <lb/>
            will that which contains it be such as that which is present <lb/>
            with it, or if it be present after a certain manner, will it be <lb/>
            such, but otherwise not ?"</p>
          <p>" Thus, rather," he replied.</p>
          <p>" That then which is neither evil nor good, sometimes when <lb/>
            evil is present, is not yet evil, but sometimes it has already <lb/>
            become such."</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" When, therefore, it is not yet evil, though evil be present, <lb/>
            this very presence of evil makes it desirous of good, but this <lb/>
            presence which makes it evil, deprives it at the same time of <lb/>
            the desire and friendship for the good. 33. For it is now no <lb/>
            longer neither evil nor good, but evil; evil however we saw, is <lb/>
            not friendly to good."</p>
          <p>" It is not."</p>
          <p>" On this account we must say, that those who are already <lb/>
            wise no longer love wisdom, whether they are gods or men ; <lb/>
            nor again do they love wisdom who have so much ignorance, <lb/>
            as to be evil: for no evil and foolish person loves wisdom. <lb/>
            They therefore are left, who possess indeed this evil, ignorance, <lb/>
            but are not yet thereby stupid or foolish, but still think that they <lb/>
            do not know the things that they do not know. Wherefore <lb/>
            they who are not yet either good or evil are lovers of wisdom ; <lb/>
            but such as are evil do not love wisdom, nor do the good: for <lb/>
            we have seen in a former part of our discussion, that neither <lb/>
            is the contrary friendly to the contrary, nor the like to the like : <lb/>
            do you not remember this ?"</p>
          <p>'• Certainly," they both replied.</p>
          <p>" Now then," said I, " Lysis and Menexenus, we have cer­ <lb/>
            tainly discovered what it is that is friendly and what not. For <lb/>
            we say, that with respect to the soul, and with respect to the <lb/>
            body, and every thing else, that which is neither evil nor good, <lb/>
            is friendly to the good on account of the presence of evil."</p><pb n="501"/>
            
          <p>34. They quite admitted and agreed that such was the case.</p>
          <p>And I for my part was rejoicing exceedingly, like any hunter, <lb/>
            in having just caught the prey that I was in chase of. And <lb/>
            then, I know not from what quarter, a most strange suspicion <lb/>
            came into my mind, that what we had assented to was not <lb/>
            true. And immediately being distressed, I said, " Alas, Lysis <lb/>
            and Menexenus, we seem to have grown rich in a dream."</p>
          <p>" Why so?" said Menexenus.</p>
          <p>" I am afraid," I replied, " that as if with braggart men, we <lb/>
            have fallen in with some such false reasonings respecting a <lb/>
            friend."</p>
          <p>" How so ?" he asked.</p>
          <p>" Let us consider it thus," said I; " whether is he who is a <lb/>
            friend, a friend to some one or not ?"</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so," said he.</p>
          <p>" Whether, therefore, for the sake of nothing, and on account <lb/>
            of nothing, or for the sake of something, and on account of <lb/>
            something ?"</p>
          <p>" For the sake of something and on account of something."</p>
          <p>" Whether is that thing friendly for the sake of which a <lb/>
            friend is a friend to a friend, or is it neither friendly nor <lb/>
            hostile ?"</p>
          <p>" I do not quite follow you," said he.</p>
          <p>" Probably," said I. " But thus perhaps you will be able <lb/>
            to follow me; and I think that I too shall better understand <lb/>
            what I say. The sick man, we just now said, is a friend to <lb/>
            the physician :is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>" Is he not, then, a friend to the physician on account of <lb/>
            disease, for the sake of health ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" But disease is an evil ?"</p>
          <p>" How not?"</p>
          <p>" But what is health?" said I; "is it good or evil, or neither?"</p>
          <p>" Good," said he.</p>
          <p>35. " We stated, then, as it seems, that the body, which is <lb/>
            neither good, nor evil, on account of disease, that is on account <lb/>
            of evil, is friendly to the medicinal art: but the medicinal <lb/>
            art is a good; and the medicinal art acquires the friendship <lb/>
            for the sake of health; and health is good; is it not ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p><pb n="502"/>
            
          <p>" But is health a friend, or not a friend ?"</p>
          <p>" A friend."</p>
          <p>" And is disease an enemy ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" That then which is neither evil nor good, on account of <lb/>
            what is evil and an enemy, is a friend to the good, for the sake <lb/>
            of what is good and a friend."</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p>
          <p>" The friendly therefore is a friend for the sake of the friend, <lb/>
            on account of that which is an enemy."</p>
          <p>" So it seems."</p>
          <p>" Well then," said I, " since we have reached this point, my <lb/>
            boys, let us pay every attention that we be not deceived. For <lb/>
            that a friend becomes a friend to a friend, and that like be­ <lb/>
            comes a friend to like, which we said is impossible, I give up. <lb/>
            However let us consider this, that what is now asserted may <lb/>
            not deceive us. The medicinal art, we say, is a friend for the <lb/>
            sake of health ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Is not, then, health also a friend ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>36. " If, then, it is a friend, it must be so for the sake of <lb/>
            something ?"</p>
          <p>"Yes."</p>
          <p>" And indeed of something friendly, if we will keep to our <lb/>
            former admission ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Will not, therefore, that again be a friend, for the sake of <lb/>
            something friendly ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Must we not, then, necessarily be tired out with going on <lb/>
            thus, and arrive at some principle, which will not have to be <lb/>
            referred to another friend, but will arrive at that which is the <lb/>
            first friend, for the sake of which we say that all other things <lb/>
            are friendly ?"</p>
          <p>" Necessarily so."</p>
          <p>" This, then, is what I say, we must take care that all those <lb/>
            other things which we said were friendly for the sake of that, <lb/>
            do not, as being certain images of it, deceive us, but that that <lb/>
            may be the first which is truly a friend. For let us consider <lb/>
            it thus. If any one values any thing very highly, as, for in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            stance, sometimes a father prizes a son above all other things, <lb/>
            will not such an one, because he esteems his son above every <lb/>
            thing, also value something else very highly ? For instance, if <lb/>
            he were to hear that he had drunk hemlock, would he not <lb/>
            value wine very highly, if he thought this would save his <lb/>
            son ?"</p>
          <p>" How should he not ?" said he.</p>
          <p>37. " And the vessel too that contained the wine ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Will he then set the same value on an earthenware cup as <lb/>
            he does upon his son, or three measures of wine as on his son ? <lb/>
            or is the case thus ? all such anxiety is employed not about <lb/>
            those things that are procured for the sake of something else, <lb/>
            but about that for the sake of which all such things are pro­ <lb/>
            cured : for although we often say that we value gold and silver <lb/>
            very highly, yet we may observe that the truth is not at all the <lb/>
            more thus ; but what we value so very highly is that, whatever <lb/>
            it may prove to be, for the sake of which gold and all other <lb/>
            provisions are procured. Shall we not say so ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" May not the same thing also be said of a friend ? for what­ <lb/>
            ever things we say are friendly to us, for the sake of some <lb/>
            friendly thing, we appear to describe by a name that belongs <lb/>
            to another, but that very thing seems in reality to be friendly <lb/>
            in which all those so-called friendships terminate ?"</p>
          <p>"This seems to be the case," said he.</p>
          <p>"That, then, which is in reality friendly is not friendly for <lb/>
            the sake of any other friendly thing ?"</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>"This, then, is settled, that what is friendly is not friendly <lb/>
            for the sake of any other friendly thing. Is the good, then, <lb/>
            friendly ?"</p>
          <p>" It seems so to me."</p>
          <p>38. " Is the good, then, loved on account of evil, and is the <lb/>
            case thus ? If of the three things which we just now men­ <lb/>
            tioned, good, evil, and that which is neither good nor evil, two <lb/>
            only were to be left, but evil were to depart altogether, and <lb/>
            not come in contact with any thing, either with body, or soul, <lb/>
            or any other of the things which we say in themselves are nei­ <lb/>
            ther evil nor good, in that case would not good be of no use <lb/>
            to us, but become useless ? For if there were nothing to hurt <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            us any more, we should stand in need of no assistance what­ <lb/>
            ever. And thus it would then become evident that we had a <lb/>
            regard for and loved the good on account of evil, since good is <lb/>
            a medicine for evil, but evil is a disease. But when there is <lb/>
            no disease, there is no need of medicine. Is this, then, the <lb/>
            nature of good, and is it loved on account of evil, by us who <lb/>
            are placed between evil and good, and is it of no use itself, for <lb/>
            the sake of itself ?"</p>
          <p>" Such seems to be the case," he replied.</p>
          <p>" That which is friendly, therefore, to us, is that in which <lb/>
            terminate all other things, which we said are friendly for the <lb/>
            sake of some other friendly thing, but in no respect resembles <lb/>
            them ? 39. For these are called friendly for the sake of a <lb/>
            friendly thing; but that which is in reality friendly appears to <lb/>
            be of a nature quite contrary to this; for we have found it to <lb/>
            be friendly for the sake of that which is hostile : but if that <lb/>
            which is hostile should depart, it would no longer, as it seems, <lb/>
            be friendly to us."</p>
          <p>" It seems to me that it would not," said he, " according to <lb/>
            what is now said."</p>
          <p>" Whether, by Jupiter," said I, " if evil were to be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, would there no longer be any hunger or thirst, or any <lb/>
            thing else of the kind ? or would there be hunger, if men and <lb/>
            other animals existed, yet not so as to be hurtful ? and thirst, <lb/>
            and other desires, yet not be evil, since evil is destroyed ? or <lb/>
            is the question ridiculous, what would then be the case or <lb/>
            not be the case ? for who knows ? This, however, we know, <lb/>
            that at present it is possible to be harmed by being hungry, <lb/>
            and it is also possible to be benefited; is it not so ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Therefore it is possible that one who thirsts, or is affected <lb/>
            by any-other similar desire, may sometimes be affected by it <lb/>
            beneficially, and sometimes harmfully, and sometimes nei­ <lb/>
            ther ?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly."</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, evil were destroyed, must things that are not <lb/>
            evil be destroyed together with the evil ?"</p>
          <p>" Not at all."</p>
          <p>" There will be, then, such desires as are neither good nor <lb/>
            evil, even if evils were destroyed ?"</p>
          <p>" It appears so."</p><pb n="505"/>
            
          <p>40. " Is it, then, possible, that one who desires and is fond of <lb/>
            any thing, should not love that which he desires and is fond <lb/>
            of?"</p>
          <p>" It does not appear so to me."</p>
          <p>" When evils, then, are destroyed, there will remain, as it <lb/>
            seems, certain friendly things ?"</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Not so; at least if evil were the cause of any thing being <lb/>
            friendly, for, when that is destroyed, one thing could not be <lb/>
            friendly to another: for when the cause is destroyed, it is <lb/>
            surely impossible that that of which it was the cause should <lb/>
            any longer exist ?"</p>
          <p>" You say rightly."</p>
          <p>" Did we not admit that the friendly loved something, and <lb/>
            on account of something, and did we not then think that, <lb/>
            on account of evil, that which is neither good nor evil loved <lb/>
            the good?"</p>
          <p>" True."</p>
          <p>" But now, as it seems, there appears to be some other cause <lb/>
            of loving and being loved ?"</p>
          <p>" So it seems."</p>
          <p>" Whether, then, in reality, as we just now said, is desire <lb/>
            the cause of friendship, and is that which desires friendly to <lb/>
            that which it desires, and at the time when it desires, but is <lb/>
            what we before said was friendly mere trifling, like a poemc <lb/>
            heedlessly composed?"</p>
          <p>" It seems so,*' said he.</p>
          <p>" However," I said, " that which desires desires that which <lb/>
            it stands in need of; does it not "2</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" And is that which stands in need friendly to that of which <lb/>
            it stands in need ?"</p>
          <p>" It seems so to me."</p>
          <p>" And it stands in need of that which is taken from it ?"</p>
          <p>41. "How should it not?"</p>
          <p>" As it seems, then, love, friendship, and desire, respect that <lb/>
            which belongs to a man; so it appears, Menexenus and <lb/>
            Lysis ?" <note type="footnote">5 I have adopted Ast's suggestion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάτην</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακρόν</foreign>. Stallbaum <lb/>
            would retain both, and read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακρὸν μάτην</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> L I </note></p><pb n="506"/>
            
          <p>They both assented.</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, you two are friends to each other, you must, <lb/>
            in a manner, by nature belong to each other ?"</p>
          <p>" Assuredly," they both replied.</p>
          <p>If, then," said I, " any one desires or is fond of another, <lb/>
            my boys, he could never desire, or be fond of, or be a friend, <lb/>
            unless he, in a manner, belonged to the object of his love, <lb/>
            either as to his soul, or as to some habit of the soul, or dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, or form?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly," said Menexenus, but Lysis was silent.</p>
          <p>" Well, then," said I, " it has proved necessary for us to <lb/>
            love that which by nature belongs to us r"</p>
          <p>" It seems so," said he.</p>
          <p>" It is necessary, then, for a genuine, and not a pretended <lb/>
            lover, to be beloved by his favourite ?"</p>
          <p>To this Lysis and Menexenus scarcely nodded assent, but <lb/>
            Hippothales, through delight, exhibited all sorts of colours. And <lb/>
            I, being willing to examine the matter, said, " If there is any <lb/>
            difference between that which belongs to us and that which is <lb/>
            like, we shall be able to say, as it seems to me, Lysis and <lb/>
            Menexenus, respecting a friend, what he is, but if the like and <lb/>
            that which belongs are the same, it is not easy to get rid or <lb/>
            our former conclusion, that the like is useless to the like, as <lb/>
            regards similitude; but to admit that what is useless can be <lb/>
            friendly is absurd. 42. Are you willing, then," I added, <lb/>
            " since we are, as it were, intoxicated by the discussion, that <lb/>
            we should grant and affirm that that which belongs is different <lb/>
            from that which is like ?"</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" Whether, then, shall we admit that good belongs to every <lb/>
            thing, but that evil is foreign ? or that evil belongs to evil, good <lb/>
            to good, and that'which is neither good nor evil, to that which <lb/>
            is neither good nor evil ?"</p>
          <p>They both said, that so it appeared to them, that each be­ <lb/>
            longs to each.</p>
          <p>" Again, therefore," said I, " my boys, we have fallen upon <lb/>
            those conclusions which we at first rejected respecting friend­ <lb/>
            ship. For the unjust will be no less a friend to the unjust, <lb/>
            and the evil to the evil, than the good to the good."</p>
          <p>" So it seems," he said.</p>
          <p>" But what ? if we should say that the good and that which <lb/>
             <pb n="507"/>
            belongs are the same, will not the good only be a friend to the <lb/>
            good</p>
          <p>" Certainly."</p>
          <p>" But in this too we thought we had confuted ourselves; do <lb/>
            you not remember ?"</p>
          <p>"We do remember."</p>
          <p>" In what way, then, can we still deal with the subject; is <lb/>
            it not clear, in no way at all? I require, then, like skilful <lb/>
            pleaders in the law courts, to sum up all that has been said; <lb/>
            for if neither those that are loved, nor those that love, nor the <lb/>
            like, nor the unlike, nor the good, nor those that belong to us, <lb/>
            nor any others that we have described, (for I do not remember <lb/>
            them any further, on account of their number,) but if no one of <lb/>
            these is a friend, I have nothing more to say."</p>
          <p>43. When I had said this, I purposed to stir up some one of <lb/>
            the older men ; but just then, like evil spirits, the pedagogues <lb/>
            of Lysis and Menexenus approaching us, having hold of their <lb/>
            brothers by their hand, called to them, and bade them go <lb/>
            home, for it was already late. At first, then, both we and the <lb/>
            bystanders drove them away; but when they paid no attention <lb/>
            to us, but murmured in their barbarous dialect, and desisted <lb/>
            not from calling them, and seemed to us, from having drunk <lb/>
            too much at the Hermsean festival, to be difficult to manage, <lb/>
            we yielded to them, and dissolved the conference. However, <lb/>
            as they were just going away, I said, Lysis and Menexenus, <lb/>
            we have made ourselves ridiculous, both I, an old man, and <lb/>
            you; for those who are now leaving us will say, that we think <lb/>
            ourselves to be each other's friends, (for I reckon myself among <lb/>
            you,) but that we have not yet been able to discover what a <lb/>
            friend is.</p>
